The respondent, the father of H.J. (child), appeals an order of the Circuit Court (Tenney, J.) terminating his parental rights. See RSA 170- C:5 (2014). He argues that the evidence does not support the circuit court\u2019s findings that: (1) he had abandoned the child; (2) he had not paid sufficient support; and (3) termination of his parental rights was in the child\u2019s best interest. We affirm.", "The record supports the following facts. Approximately one month after the child was born, the father was incarcerated. After the father was released, the child lived with both parents. In February 2009, the mother moved out after an incident of domestic violence. From June 2009 through September 2010, a domestic violence order was in place against the father. In April 2009, the mother filed a parenting petition. The father did not appear at any of the hearings in the parenting case. In December 2009, the mother was granted sole legal and physical custody of H.J. The parenting plan granted the father supervised visitation once a week at his expense, but gave the mother discretion to refuse such visits. The plan stated that the father \u201cmay petition the court for further orders\u201d at such time that \u201che believes that he can be a positive and consistent influence in [the child\u2019s] life.\u201d", "The father visited H.J. twice at a visitation center in February and March of 2010. On March 20, 2010, he failed to appear for a scheduled visit. Around this time, he was incarcerated. When he was released in early 2011, he contacted the visitation center requesting to visit H.J. The mother exercised the discretion granted to her by the parenting plan and denied his request. She expressed concern that visitation would be emotionally disruptive to the child because the father\u2019s frequent incarcerations would not allow him to become a consistent part of the child\u2019s life. The father appears to have done nothing at this time to challenge the mother\u2019s decision. The father was re- incarcerated in 2012.", "In 2013, while still incarcerated, the father filed petitions requesting a change to the parenting plan. The court denied the petitions, observing that the father was incarcerated and \u201cnot in a position to exercise his parenting time . . . because of his circumstances.\u201d The court noted that \u201c[a]t such time as he is released, [the father] can contact the [visitation center], who can then contact [the mother].\u201d", "The father was released from incarceration in January 2014. He testified at the hearing on the termination of his parental rights that he \u201cprobably\u201d contacted the visitation center at that time, but did not \u201cremember exactly.\u201d He also testified that he did not file any additional petitions with the court seeking visitation because he was \u201cdealing with these legal issues,\u201d had limited transportation, and \u201chad a lot on [his] plate.\u201d At some point in 2015 the father was re-incarcerated. In early 2016, he was released. Approximately a year later, in February of 2017, he was re-incarcerated.", "In October of 2017, the mother filed a petition seeking termination of the father\u2019s parental rights on the grounds of abandonment and non-support. At the hearing on the petition, the mother requested that the court terminate the father\u2019s parental rights over H.J. so that her husband, who \u201chas been an active and constant part of [H.J.\u2019s] life since 2010,\u201d could adopt H.J. She testified that, since July 21, 2009, she has only received $458.70 in child support and that her child support case was closed in 2014. She acknowledged that the father has occasionally sent correspondence to H.J. including \u201ca bunch of cards in 2010,\u201d a Toys\u201cR\u201dUs gift card, two letters in 2016, and a birthday card in 2017. She testified that she shared these communications with H.J. and has saved them.", "The father testified that, although he has been in jail for four of the last eight years, he never intended to abandon the child. He also testified that he", "2 had \u201cnever been given the opportunity to be a father to [his child] . . . and it hasn\u2019t been for a lack of trying.\u201d", "The guardian ad litem (GAL) submitted a final report recommending that the court terminate the father\u2019s parental rights. At the hearing, the GAL testified that even though the father may not have desired to abandon the child, there has \u201cbeen a substantial period of time since there has been any contact,\u201d and the father\u2019s \u201cpersonal actions, his inability to stay out of criminal mischief . . . effectuated the abandonment.\u201d The GAL further testified that termination was in the child\u2019s best interest because the mother\u2019s husband was the child\u2019s \u201cfather figure,\u201d provided \u201cday-to-day support and emotional support,\u201d and wished to adopt H.J. The GAL recognized that the mother had exercised her right to deny visitation in 2011, which prevented the child from having contact with the father on that occasion, but concluded that the lack of a relationship between the child and the father was due to the father\u2019s consistent \u201crenewal of [his] criminal activities.\u201d", "In its termination order, the court found that the father had abandoned the child. See RSA 170-C:5, I. It also concluded that the father failed to provide adequate support. See RSA 170-C:5, II (stating that if \u201cparents are financially able,\u201d but \u201chave substantially and continuously neglected to provide the child with necessary subsistence, education or other care,\u201d then a statutory ground exists to terminate parental rights).

Rather, the parent opposing termination has the opportunity to rebut the presumption of intent to abandon by offering evidence of events that occurred before, during, and after the triggering period.

Therefore, the statutory presumption is triggered. On appeal, the father argues he rebutted the presumption, contending that he did not intend to abandon H.J. He asserts that \u201cit was the mother\u2019s refusal to permit or facilitate visits or contact that were the major barrier to a relationship between the father and [H.J.].\u201d He further contends that the trial court erred because it failed to properly consider the \u201ctotality of the evidence,\u201d and \u201cevents that occurred before, during and after the triggering period.\u201d See In re Jessie E., 137 N.H 336, 342 (1993).

See, e.g., In re G.

The trial court reasoned that the child is \u201chappy, living with the only family [the child] knows, cared for by the only parent . . . that has ever cared for [H.J.], and [a] stepfather, who now seeks to adopt [H.J.] and give [the child] a greater security in their relationship.\u201d The court also reasoned that \u201closs of contact with [the] birth father . . . is not a significant loss to this child, since [H.J.] does not even know him.\u201d It concluded that \u201ctermination is necessary in order to facilitate an adoption of [H.J.] by [the] stepfather . . . which is desired by the child.\u201d", "The father argues that the trial court\u2019s best interest ruling is erroneous because the trial court gave \u201cinsufficient weight . . . to the fact that the mother admitted an unwillingness to facilitate visits between the father and [H.J.].\u201d Although the father recognizes that the mother had a parenting plan that afforded her the discretion to deny visits, he argues that she \u201cabused that authority by prohibiting contact between the father and [H.J.].\u201d We disagree.", "We recognize, as we have previously, that \u201c[i]t cannot be assumed that termination is in the best interest of a child where the child\u2019s lack of knowledge of the parent whose rights are being terminated is due, in part, to the other parent\u2019s efforts to thwart attempts made to establish a relationship with the child.\u201d In re Sophia-Marie H., 165 N.H. at 338. However, the facts of this case are distinguishable from Sophia-Marie H. In Sophia-Marie H., a father attempted to maintain a relationship with his child and become a better father while incarcerated by: attempting numerous times to call the child from jail, writing many letters, taking a parenting class, and asking the court to reinstate visitation. Id. at 334, 339. The mother took multiple steps to keep the father from maintaining that relationship by: failing to deliver the father\u2019s letters, not disclosing the father\u2019s identity, changing her phone number so the father could no longer contact them, and precluding visitation by filing a petition seeking termination shortly after the father was released from incarceration. Id. at 334. The GAL recommended that the court deny the termination petition because the father had made efforts to turn his life around, and the GAL believed that the child would miss out on having a relationship with her father if the petition was granted. Id. at 335. The trial court found that the father had not abandoned his child; however, it found that other statutory grounds supported termination. Id. It then concluded that termination was in the child\u2019s best interest because the child \u201chas no bond with or connection to the", "6 father and is apparently unaware of his existence,\u201d and \u201cattempting to reintroduce the father into Sophia-Marie\u2019s life at this point would be difficult and confusing.\u201d Id. at 338 (brackets omitted). We reversed, observing that \u201cthe father has endeavored to maintain a relationship with Sophia-Marie, and we cannot ignore the fact that to the extent that Sophia-Marie does not know her father, it is, in part, due to the mother\u2019s decision not to disclose the father\u2019s attempts to contact her or even that he is her father.\u201d Id.", "Here, the father\u2019s efforts to establish a relationship with his child have been minimal. Unlike in Sophia-Marie H., the father chose not to contact or visit his child for long periods of time, even when he was not incarcerated. When the father petitioned to modify the parenting plan in 2013, the court concluded that he was \u201cnot in a position to exercise his parenting time\u201d because he was incarcerated, and instructed the father to contact the visitation center upon his release. The record does not demonstrate that he subsequently contacted the center. Nor has the father ever sought to modify the original parenting plan to lessen the mother\u2019s ability to control visitation.", "Here, also unlike in Sophia-Marie H., the mother\u2019s \u201cinterference\u201d with the father\u2019s ability to build a relationship with H.J. has been minimal. Although she denied the father a single visit in 2011, as was allowed by the parenting plan, the mother has not kept the father\u2019s identity a secret from the child and she has given the child letters sent from the father. Therefore, the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the lack of a relationship between the father and H.J. is directly attributable to the father\u2019s failure to attempt to establish such a relationship, not the mother\u2019s purported attempt to thwart it.", "The father also argues that the trial court erred in terminating his parental rights because the \u201cmother admitted she did not do anything to facilitate a relationship between the father and his [child].\u201d He cites In re William A., 142 N.H. 598, 600 (1998), for the proposition that he should be given additional time and opportunity to build a relationship with his child because there is no evidence to show that termination is necessary to ensure H.J. remains in a stable environment. In determining whether he should be given this opportunity, the dominant consideration is the welfare of the child, which prevails over the interests of the parents. In re Adam R., 159 N.H. at 792.", "In re William A. involved a father\u2019s petition to terminate a mother\u2019s parental rights on the grounds of abandonment and non-support.

The GAL recommended that the court not terminate the mother\u2019s parental rights because the mother had taken steps to improve her ability to have a positive and supportive relationship with William.

Id.; see also In re Sophia- Marie H., 165 N.H. at 339 (concluding that termination was not in the child\u2019s best interest after observing that the father whose rights were at issue was seeking to rebuild his relationship with his child in a manner that would not disrupt the child\u2019s relationship with her caregivers).", "Here, however, unlike in In re William A., the record does not reflect that the father has taken meaningful steps to build a relationship with H.J. or improve his ability to become a positive and supportive figure in the child\u2019s life. The GAL observes that, although H.J. knows that the father occasionally writes or sends gifts, the child has \u201cno real memory of him or of his direct presence,\u201d \u201c8-years have passed since there have been visits,\u201d and the father has made \u201cno effort . . . to avoid new or ongoing criminal activities.\u201d On this basis, the GAL concluded that termination was in the child\u2019s best interest. The trial court similarly concluded that despite the father\u2019s assertions that he loves his child and wants to be a part of H.J.\u2019s life, \u201cthe reality of this situation is that he has led a life over the past eight years full of criminal activity, most of it of a serious nature, which has resulted in numerous incarcerations.\u201d The trial court reasoned that the father \u201cseems to accept little to any responsibility for the effect these actions have had on his ability and availability for parenting,\u201d and observed that \u201c[i]n the meantime, [H.J.] has moved on . . . and has done very well through the efforts of [the child\u2019s] mother and [the] stepfather.\u201d", "\u201cImplicit in [RSA chapter 170-C] is the philosophy that whenever possible family life should be strengthened and preserved.\u201d RSA 170-C:1.

Neither party has asked us to overrule Cheever, and, in any event, the outcome in this case would be the same whether a six-year or three- year period applied. Accordingly, we follow Cheever\u2019s three-year holding. We disagree, however, with the defendant\u2019s assertion that Cheever compels the conclusion that the three-year period expired on April 5, 2016. In Cheever, it was not necessary to decide whether the limitations period started on the date of death or, as the defendant contends, on the date the cause of action accrued, because both dates were the same.

We now hold that the period starts on the date of death, as to hold otherwise would impermissibly write the phrase \u201cafter the death of the deceased party,\u201d RSA 556:11, out of the statute.

During the stop, the officer ran a computer check on the defendant\u2019s license and learned that the defendant\u2019s registration was suspended. The officer also checked the registration number of the vehicle and learned that the vehicle was registered to Jake Keenan, who was subsequently identified as the defendant\u2019s son.

Based on this meaning of \u201ccontrolled,\u201d the defendant argued that the State failed to prove that he owned or controlled the vehicle he was driving when the officer stopped him. 1 The basis for the suspension of the defendant\u2019s operating privileges is not disclosed by the record and, at any rate, is not relevant to this appeal. 2 An SR-22 insurance certificate is a \u201cuniform document filed by an insurance company pursuant to RSA 264:21 and RSA 259:9 that certifies that the policyholder is insured for New Hampshire\u2019s minimum liability requirements under RSA 264.\u201d N.H.

The State argues, as it did to the trial court, that the statute prohibits any person with a suspended registration from driving any vehicle. Although the parties and the trial court attempted to determine the meaning of RSA 261:178 by focusing their inquiry on the last clause of the statute, we construe all parts of the statute together to effectuate its overall purpose, even if the parties do not address it. See Fogg, 170 N.H. at 236. Accordingly, we consider all of the relevant language set forth in RSA 261:178, which states:", "Suspension of Registration of Vehicle. The director, upon", "evidence satisfactory to him that the owner of a vehicle is", "permitting or has permitted the same to be driven in violation of", "any of the provisions of this title . . . may suspend the registration", "of such vehicle until [the director] is satisfied that the offense will", "not be repeated or the owner has been acquitted, and any person", "who shall drive or permit to be driven a vehicle owned or controlled", "3", "by him upon any way after his registration has been suspended or", "revoked shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

Accordingly, the final clause, which criminalizes the act of driving or permitting to be driven \u201ca vehicle owned or controlled by [a person whose registration has been suspended],\u201d RSA 261:178, logically applies only to the vehicle registrations that have been suspended, and not to the driver. To equate the term \u201ccontrol\u201d with the term \u201cdrive,\u201d as the State did in its argument to the trial court, would prohibit an individual from driving a vehicle that is properly registered and insured, regardless of whether the vehicle is owned by that individual. We find the interpretation proffered by the State to be illogical.", "The State\u2019s interpretation of RSA 261:178 would prohibit an individual whose registration has been suspended from driving a vehicle owned, properly registered, and insured by his employer. The State\u2019s interpretation would also prohibit this same individual from renting and operating a vehicle owned, properly registered, and insured by a car rental agency. Indeed, this interpretation equates the suspension of an individual\u2019s registration privileges with a suspension of his or her driving privileges, despite the fact that these two privileges are distinct and are governed by separate statutes. See RSA 263:53 to :64-b (2014 & Supp. 2017) (statutes governing driver\u2019s licenses suspensions and revocations). We do not find that these results are either logical or just.", "More significantly, equating the term \u201ccontrolled\u201d with the terms \u201cdrive\u201d or \u201cown\u201d fails to recognize that the legislature specifically sought to distinguish these terms as they apply to the prohibition the statute criminalizes. Because we interpret legislative intent from the statute as written, we will not consider what the legislature might have said, add language that the legislature did not include, or disregard or conflate language that the legislature saw fit to include. See N.C. v. N.H. Bd. of Psychologists, 169 N.H. 361, 366 (2016) (\u201cWe also presume that the legislature does not waste words or enact redundant provisions and, whenever possible, we give effect to every word of a statute.\u201d). Thus, the term \u201ccontrolled\u201d in RSA 261:178 refers to conduct separate and distinct from either the ownership or the operation of a vehicle. But, the term \u201ccontrol\u201d is not defined by RSA chapter 261 or anywhere else in the motor vehicle code.", "4", "When a term is not defined in a statute, we look to its common usage using the dictionary for guidance. See K.L.N. Construction Co. v. Town of Pelham, 167 N.H. 180, 185 (2014). Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines \u201ccontrol,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201cpower or authority to guide or manage; directing or restraining domination.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 496 (unabridged ed. 2002). Applying this approved and common usage of the term \u201ccontrol\u201d to RSA 261:178 establishes that an individual can control a motor vehicle, without operating or owning it, by exercising power and authority over it by managing or directing its use. For example, an individual who leases or purchases a vehicle and registers it to a third party, yet still exercises authority over it by determining or managing its use, would \u201ccontrol\u201d a motor vehicle as that term is used in RSA 261:178. Given the overall purpose of this statute, the legislature intended to prohibit any person from driving or permitting to be driven \u201ca vehicle owned or controlled by him\u201d which has a suspended registration. This interpretation is consistent with the legislature\u2019s reference to \u201csuch vehicle\u201d within RSA 261:178 and the statute\u2019s overall purpose without producing the unjust results we have previously noted.", "The State argues, however, that the statute\u2019s general purposes should be examined in conjunction with RSA chapter 264 (2014 & Supp. 2017), the Accidents and Financial Responsibility Act, which is \u201cintended to induce, but not to compel, motor vehicle operators to provide security to persons injured by their negligence.\u201d Progressive N. Ins. Co. v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co., 149 N.H. 489, 492 (2003) (quotation omitted). New Hampshire does not require that a motor vehicle be insured prior to the operation of the vehicle. Coltey v. N.E. Telephone, 135 N.H. 223, 224 (1991). Yet, in certain circumstances enumerated in RSA 264:2 and :3 (2014), proof of financial responsibility may be required when, for example, a driver has been convicted of certain traffic- related offenses or has caused an accident.", "Proof of financial responsibility, and the restoration of a driver\u2019s operation and registration privileges, can be secured by the purchase of \u201cowner\u201d or \u201cnon-owner\u201d insurance which is evinced by the insurance company\u2019s issuance of an SR-22 certificate establishing that the policyholder is insured for New Hampshire\u2019s minimum liability requirements.

N.H. Admin. R., Saf-C 207.08. The State maintains that permitting so-called \u201crisky drivers,\u201d who have had their registration privileges suspended, to drive after purchasing non-owner insurance would effectively circumvent the registration requirement because these drivers could lawfully operate any vehicle he or she did not own or control. We disagree.", "5", "DOS regulations explicitly permit New Hampshire drivers to purchase either owner or non-owner insurance whenever proof of financial responsibility is required. See N.H. Admin. R., Saf-C 207.06. As in this case, an individual can have his or her operating privileges restored once that individual produces proof of financial responsibility to operate a vehicle. Id. The applicable regulations further provide that \u201cwhere non-owner\u2019s coverage is filed, registration of a vehicle shall not be permitted and active registration shall be suspended until evidence of owner coverage on any such vehicle is filed with the director.\u201d N.H. Admin. R., Saf-C 207.08 (emphasis added).3 As with RSA 261:178, this regulation specifies that evidence of insurance coverage on a specific vehicle is required before an individual\u2019s registration can be restored. Thus, while an individual with a suspended registration cannot register any vehicle upon securing non-owner coverage, nothing in either RSA chapter 264 or DOS regulations suggests or implies that a suspended registration bars an individual from restoring his or her operating privileges or thereafter employing them.", "RSA chapter 264 and DOS regulations establish an overall objective of requiring high-risk drivers to provide security for their operation of a motor vehicle, as well as a policy of inducing motor vehicle owners to provide security for the operation of their vehicles when the owner has permitted or is permitting that vehicle \u201cto be driven in violation of any provision of [the motor vehicle code].\u201d RSA 261:178. These purposes are entirely consistent with our interpretation of RSA 261:178 as prohibiting the operation of a vehicle which has a suspended registration. The legislature did not intend to limit the statute\u2019s reach to the Accidents and Financial Responsibility Act, because RSA 261:178 authorizes the director to suspend the registration of a vehicle when its owner has permitted it to be driven \u201cin violation of any provision of this title.\u201d RSA 261:178 (emphasis added).", "In fact, there may be circumstances in which the director suspends the registration of fewer than all vehicles owned or controlled by a person. For example, if a motor vehicle has not been properly inspected, the director may suspend the registration of that vehicle, see RSA 266:5 (2014), but may not suspend the registration of other vehicles owned by that person as a consequence of the initial registration suspension. Under these circumstances, RSA 261:178 would not prohibit the person, assuming he or she holds a valid driver\u2019s license, from operating the properly registered vehicle owned or controlled by him or her. The legislature did not expand the statute\u2019s application to that portion of the motor vehicle code regulating operating privileges, however, because the motor vehicle code authorizes the director to 3 We note that, by virtue of New Hampshire Administrative Rule Saf-C 207.08, the defendant here could not have registered another vehicle in his name or operated another vehicle that he owned or controlled because all active registrations would have been suspended until he filed an SR-22 certificate establishing his purchase of owner insurance.", "6 suspend an individual\u2019s operating privileges for specifically enumerated violations and conduct.

(Lakes Region), appeals an order of the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (Commission) requiring Lakes Region to refund a second base charge it had imposed on its customer, Robert Mykytiuk, and prohibiting it from \u201cimposing such charges unless and until they are included in the company\u2019s tariff.\u201d We affirm.", "The following facts are taken from the Commission\u2019s orders or recount testimony given at the hearing on the merits. In March 2016, Lakes Region learned that Mykytiuk had constructed an additional structure on his property. To supply the new structure with water, Mykytiuk had tapped into his primary residence\u2019s service connection. Shortly after learning of the new construction, Lakes Region sent Mykytiuk an application for new service for the additional structure and requested to inspect the water service connection.", "Lakes Region sent an inspector to Mykytiuk\u2019s property in May. Despite concluding that the new structure required a separate service connection, Lakes Region chose not to install one at that time. Rather, Lakes Region began billing Mykytiuk for an additional \u201cbase charge,\u201d which refers to the \u201c[m]inimum charge per customer per quarter\u201d scheduled in Lakes Region\u2019s tariff. Mykytiuk complained to the Commission, asserting that he was not required to have a second service connection. The Commission treated the matter as a formal complaint and held a hearing on the merits.", "At the hearing, Mykytiuk argued that Lakes Region could not charge him a separate base charge or require him to install a separate meter for the additional structure because neither was provided for in Lakes Region\u2019s tariff. He testified that his additional structure is a \u201cgarage[] with bunkhouse\u201d and that, according to his definition, a bunkhouse \u201cis subordinate to a primary residence, [and] . . . contain[s] sleeping facilities, and may contain sanitary facilities, but does not contain cooking facilities.\u201d He further testified that he rents out his primary residence by the week as a vacation rental, during which times he stays in the bunkhouse.", "Lakes Region\u2019s utility manager testified that she considered Mykytiuk\u2019s service to his additional structure to be a \u201ctandem connection\u201d \u2014 which she, in turn, understood to mean a connection from the service line to a second place of consumption after the meter \u2014 prohibited by New Hampshire Administrative Rules, Puc 606.04(h). According to her testimony, as summarized in the Commission\u2019s order, Lakes Region\u2019s tariff contains \u201cno specific working definition about what tandem service is.\u201d Furthermore, notwithstanding the conclusion that Mykytiuk had installed a prohibited tandem service, Lakes Region \u201cdecided not to disconnect [him] in April 2016 after being satisfied that there were no health concerns and that [he] had not bypassed recording water usage on the meter. Moreover, Lakes Region did not want to cause an undue hardship on [him].\u201d", "Following the hearing, the Commission issued its order, finding that Lakes Region had no basis under its current tariff to impose the second base charge on Mykytiuk. It ordered Lakes Region to refund those charges and further ordered that \u201cLakes Region shall not impose a second base charge on [Mykytiuk\u2019s] property . . . , until such time as Lakes Region receives approval to impose a second charge under the terms of a properly filed tariff amendment.\u201d Lakes Region now appeals, arguing that the Commission erred in failing to: (1) apply both RSA 378:1 (2009) and its own rules; (2) explain its rules on rehearing; and (3) reconsider a new issue determined in its order.", "2", "We first set forth our standard of review. \u201cA party seeking to set aside an order of the [Commission] has the burden of demonstrating that the order is contrary to law or, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, is unjust or unreasonable.\u201d Appeal of Northern New England Tele.

Lakes Region concedes that its tariff \u201cdoes not contain an express provision authorizing a second base charge for an additional residence.\u201d Nevertheless, it attempts to justify Mykytiuk\u2019s second base charge through the interplay of several statutes and regulations. For ease of reference, we set forth the relevant provisions here. First, RSA 378:1 provides, in pertinent part:", "Every public utility shall file with the [Commission], and", "shall print and keep open to public inspection, schedules showing", "the rates, fares, charges and prices for any service rendered or to", "be rendered in accordance with the rules adopted by the", "commission pursuant to RSA 541-A . . . .

Finally, RSA 378:14 provides:", "No public utility shall grant any free service, nor charge or", "receive a greater or lesser or different compensation for any service", "rendered to any person, firm or corporation than the compensation", "fixed for such service by the schedules on file with the commission", "and in effect at the time such service is rendered. RSA 378:14 (2009).", "Lakes Region\u2019s argument begins with the assertion that its tariff, which applies to \u201call water service in the franchise area,\u201d specifically applies to water service \u201c\u2018rendered in accordance with the rules adopted by the commission.\u2019\u201d (Quoting RSA 378:1.) Lakes Region then points out that the Commission\u2019s rules specifically prohibit tandem services, N.H. Admin R., Puc 606.04(j)(2), which, according to Lakes Region, explains why its tariff does not include a rate for such service. Nevertheless, Lakes Region argues, it must charge Mykytiuk a second service charge because his tandem service \u201ccarries a", "3 significantly greater cost\u201d than would be accounted for in the tariff\u2019s metered rate for actual water usage.", "Specifically, Lakes Region cites the hearing testimony of the Director of the Commission\u2019s Gas and Water Division, Mark A. Naylor, who opined that \u201cadding a second unit to an existing service . . . creates demand cost.\u201d Naylor explained that Lakes Region, like all utilities, is required \u201cto be able to provide [its] peak demand, plus a safety factor over that, on a 365 day basis,\u201d and, thus, must have \u201cfacilities to meet its peak demand[].\u201d According to Naylor:", "When you add additional places of consumption, when you", "add additional customers, which is what [Mykytiuk\u2019s situation] is,", "it adds to the peak demand. And that may not have an out-of-", "pocket cost today or tomorrow, [but] it will result in cost that the", "Company will have to face.", "Lakes Region elaborates on the foregoing concepts in explaining the importance of the fixed customer charge or base charge in its scheduled rates:", "Lakes Region\u2019s systems, being located in New Hampshire\u2019s", "Lakes and White Mountain Regions, serve[] primarily seasonal", "customers who own second homes that may be unoccupied for", "prolonged periods. During off-peak seasons, use is low. However,", "during peak holiday periods such as during weekends in July and", "August, demand is high which requires larger storage tanks, larger", "pipe diameters, and larger treatment and production (wells and", "pumps) facilities. As a result, Lakes Region\u2019s rates are designed to", "recover the fixed capital costs to make service available during", "periods of peak demand. Its base per customer charge is high", "while its metered consumption is correspondingly low. . . . The", "addition of a summer vacation rental . . . places significant", "additional peak demand. Lakes Region does not recover the costs", "to serve this additional peak demand in the absence of an", "additional fixed customer charge.", "Based upon all of the foregoing assertions, Lakes Region concludes that, in Mykytiuk\u2019s case, \u201callowing a second dwelling without a second customer charge would result in free or discounted service in violation of law.\u201d See RSA 378:14. More specifically, Lakes Region contends that \u201cthe Commission allowed [Mykytiuk] to maintain a second use in violation of Rule . . . 606.04 while paying rates that are less than required by RSA 378:1.\u201d It asserts that \u201c[t]he Commission . . . fail[ed] to address the central issue in the proceeding\u201d by failing to apply RSA 378:1 and its own rules as outlined above. We conclude, however, that the statutes and administrative rules at issue do not support Lakes Region\u2019s construction of them.", "4", "First, we note that the Commission made no finding as to whether the service to Mykytiuk\u2019s bunkhouse was or was not a tandem connection prohibited by Rule 606.04(j). The lack of such a finding, however, is immaterial to the disposition of this appeal, as we hold that, in any event, RSA 378:14 does not authorize the sort of self-help employed by Lakes Region here. To construe the statute as Lakes Region urges would render it internally inconsistent.", "No public utility shall grant any free service, nor charge or", "receive a greater or lesser or different compensation for any service", "rendered to any person, firm or corporation than the compensation", "fixed for such service by the schedules on file with the commission", "and in effect at the time such service is rendered. RSA 378:14 (emphases added). Here, in an ostensible attempt to avoid providing free or discounted service, Lakes Region charged a fee different from the rates scheduled in its tariff. Thus, rather than being authorized by RSA 378:14, the second base charge billed to Mykytiuk actually violates it. If, as Lakes Region contends, \u201callowing a second dwelling without a second customer charge would result in free or discounted service in violation of law,\u201d then its remedy would be, as the Commission suggested, to \u201cpropose revisions to its tariff to address [such] situations.\u201d", "Our cases make clear that the Commission is responsible for ensuring that a utility\u2019s rates are not discriminatory, preferential, or unfair. See Granite State Alarm Inc. & a. v. New England Tel. & Tel., 111 N.H. 235, 237 (1971) (\u201cIt is the duty of the commission . . . to see that under the tariff proposed by the company no class of service is discriminated against or receives preferential treatment.\u201d); Chicopee Mfg. Co. v. Company, 98 N.H. 5, 19 (1953) (\u201cThe complex and difficult task of distributing a rate increase among the ratepayers so as to eliminate discriminations and unfairness has been entrusted to the commission.\u201d). That responsibility is discharged in the ratemaking process. See Company v. State, 95 N.H. 353, 364 (1949) (\u201c[A]n important step in rate making is \u2018the adjustment of a rate schedule conforming to [the general revenue] level so as to eliminate discriminations and unfairness from its details.\u2019\u201d (quoting Power Comm\u2019n v. Pipeline Co., 315 U.S. 575, 584 (1942))); see also Granite State Alarm, 111 N.H. at 237; Chicopee Mfg. Co., 98 N.H. at 19. By negative implication, and in accordance with statutory provisions prohibiting utilities from imposing charges that deviate from the tariffed rates, see RSA 378:14, Lakes Region is not empowered to adjust its charges outside its tariffed rates unilaterally in order to ensure that Mykytiuk pays his fair share of Lakes Region\u2019s capacity costs.", "Lakes Region, nevertheless, argues that its tariff \u201cassumes and the Commission\u2019s rules require that separate and distinct uses or buildings have separate service lines (and meters) \u2018except in unusual situations such as", "5 service to an apartment or to a condominium.\u2019\u201d (Quoting N.H. Admin. R., Puc 606.04(g)). The rule Lakes Region quotes, however, does not explicitly require separate service lines for separate and distinct uses or structures, but, rather, provides that \u201c[c]urb stops shall be placed at the customer\u2019s property line except in unusual situations such as service to an apartment or to a condominium.\u201d N.H. Admin. R., Puc 606.04(g); see N.H. Admin. R., Env-Dw 504.02(c) (defining \u201c[c]urb stop\u201d to mean \u201cthe valve between the water distribution system and the service customer\u2019s premises which controls the flow of water to the premises\u201d).", "Indeed, Rule 606.04(g)\u2019s reference to \u201cthe customer\u2019s property line\u201d highlights the problem Naylor noted at the hearing. N.H. Admin. R., Puc 606.04(g) (emphasis added). As the Commission summarized his testimony, Naylor \u201cagreed with the suggestion that \u2018customer\u2019 and \u2018dwelling unit\u2019 should be treated synonymously.\u201d Lakes Region\u2019s tariff, however, does not define the term \u201ccustomer\u201d despite describing its base charge as a \u201c[m]inimum charge per customer per quarter.\u201d The Commission\u2019s regulations define \u201c[c]ustomer\u201d to mean \u201cany person, firm, corporation, cooperative marketing association, utility or governmental unit or subdivision of a municipality or of the state or nation supplied with water service by a utility.\u201d N.H. Admin R., Puc 602.05 (emphasis added); see also N.H. Admin R., Puc 602.18 (defining \"[w]ater service\" to \u201cmean[] the furnishing of water to a customer in this state by a utility\u201d).", "The Commission argues that \u201c[t]he \u2018customer\u2019 in this case is Mr. Mykytiuk, not the physical structures on his property. Connecting his bunkhouse to the water line in his home, after the meter, did not service a second customer.\u201d We agree. Because Mykytiuk is only one person, Lakes Region\u2019s tariff, as now written, subjects him to only one base charge. Accordingly, the Commission\u2019s order properly noted that Lakes Region\u2019s remedy would lie in a tariff amendment. The Commission recounted Naylor\u2019s testimony on this point: \u201cTo rectify the situation, Mr. Naylor suggested that what is needed is a clear definition of what a customer is and what a place of consumption is, and a clear definition of how service is formally requested. He thinks a tariff change is in order to make it clearer.\u201d (Citation omitted.)", "Lakes Region further contends that the Commission erred in determining that Mykytiuk\u2019s \u201cburden of proof was only to prove that Lakes Region\u2019s decision to impose a second customer charge on him is not authorized under its current tariff.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) Lakes Region argues that Mykytiuk\u2019s \u201cburden of proof was to demonstrate that the rate charged by Lakes Region was unjust [or] unreasonable or in violation of the law.\u201d (Quotation omitted.) It then asserts that \u201c[t]he Commission did not find that Lakes Region\u2019s charges were unjust or unreasonable or that Lakes Region had violated any law.\u201d We disagree.", "6", "In denying Lakes Region\u2019s motion for rehearing, the Commission ruled that \u201c[b]ecause a second base charge is not in Lakes Region\u2019s tariff, the imposition of one on Mr. Mykytiuk is \u2018in violation of [a] provision of law\u2019 under RSA 378:7.\u201d (Quoting RSA 378:7.)

Relying upon Appeal of City of Nashua, 138 N.H. 261, 263-64 (1994), Lakes Region argues:", "New Hampshire law is clear that when the Commission", "structures its decision solely by summarizing evidence presented", "by the contending parties and describing the parties\u2019 opposing", "views, without making specific factual findings in support of its", "own conclusions, it fails to meet its statutory obligation to make a", "concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting", "its findings and its order will therefore be vacated and remanded", "for a new hearing.

Specifically, Lakes Region argues that \u201c[i]n the last sentence of [its order], the Commission determined a new issue that was not previously noticed for the hearing when it ordered that: \u2018In the event its tariff is revised, [Lakes Region] shall not require Mr. Mykytiuk to install a second meter in the future so long as he undertakes no further renovations to the structures on his property.\u2019\u201d Lakes Region argues that \u201c[b]ecause the Commission did not provide notice of this issue, Lakes Region did not present evidence or arguments as to significant operational problems that would arise if the Commission did not apply Rule . . . 606.04,\u201d including risk of water loss and property damage due to leaks when one or both structures are unoccupied and the inability to disconnect service from one building without also disconnecting the other.", "We disagree that Lakes Region lacked notice of the issue. By letter dated November 10, 2016, the Commission notified the parties that because its rules \u201cdo not specifically address separate dwelling units and separate structures under [Rule] 600 et seq.[,] . . . [t]he Commission believes that a hearing on this matter will be useful in determining whether a separate base charge should be implemented and/or a separate meter installed.\u201d In its order on Lakes Region\u2019s motion to deny complaint and exclude evidence, the Commission noted that \u201c[t]he thrust of Mr. Mykytiuk\u2019s complaint is that Lakes Region is not permitted to charge him a separate base charge and/or install a separate meter under the terms of [Lakes Region\u2019s] tariff.\u201d We conclude that Lakes Region had adequate notice that the issue of whether it could or could not require Mykytiuk to install a separate service to his bunkhouse was an issue to be decided in the proceeding. We also note that notwithstanding Lakes Region\u2019s contention that the alleged lack of notice precluded it from presenting evidence or arguments as to certain \u201coperational problems,\u201d those problems were discussed in testimony by its utility manager and Naylor, and were also discussed in the summation by its counsel.", "To the extent the parties\u2019 arguments address whether the service to Mykytiuk\u2019s bunkhouse is or is not a tandem connection, we decline to consider them.

Nor do we need to do so in this case, because the State prevails under the more exacting de novo standard.", "The State does not contest that the defendant\u2019s request that Garrity withdraw \u201cconstituted a \u2018triggering statement,\u2019 and therefore necessitated an inquiry by the court.\u201d Accordingly, we will assume without deciding that the defendant\u2019s request constituted a triggering statement that required further judicial inquiry. See Sweeney, 151 N.H. at 670. After having reviewed the transcript of the colloquy conducted by the trial court with the defendant, we conclude that the court obtained sufficient clarity of the purpose of the defendant\u2019s request.", "The colloquy between the defendant and the court began as follows:", "THE COURT: Mr. Martin, tell me in your own words why you think", "you\u2019re entitled to a new counsel.", "THE DEFENDANT: I have a couple -- I have a list of things that I\u2019ve", "-- I\u2019ve made a list of things that he hasn\u2019t done that I could read to", "you if that\u2019s possible.", "THE COURT: Sure. Any way you want to tell me. The defendant then described the areas in which he believed that his counsel\u2019s representation had been deficient. These included his: (1) delay in providing the defendant with \u201cmy full discovery\u201d; (2) failure to request a second forensic expert; (3) attempts to persuade the defendant to accept a plea offered by the State; and (4) refusal to call a particular witness at trial. The defendant concluded:", "Also, he ignores most of my requests and he actually is", "trying to get me to -- persuade me into taking the State\u2019s plea,", "which I don\u2019t want to whatsoever. I\u2019ve actually voiced my opinion", "about what I want to do with my case and that I want to take it to", "trial and he\u2019s continually trying to get me to take the State\u2019s offer.", "Last, but not least, there is possible that there\u2019s people on", "the case that possibly tampered with evidence and helped fabricate", "this charge, yet he refuses to investigate these facts and present it", "for trial.", "4", "Last, but not least, Your Honor, as you know I\u2019m fighting for", "my life and I deserve to be represented zealously in every aspect", "and he has not done that. So I would appreciate if he was removed", "from my case for ineffective counsel.", "After hearing from defense counsel, the trial court ruled:", "Yeah, motion for new counsel is denied. We\u2019re on the eve of", "trial and I haven\u2019t heard anything that meets the level that would", "draw me to the conclusion that there hasn\u2019t been effective", "assistance of counsel, so we\u2019re going forward. Motion denied.", "When the defendant asked whether he \u201ccould just say a couple more things, please,\u201d the court allowed him to continue. The defendant told the court that his counsel had advised him that \u201cwe can\u2019t win this case and I want to go to trial. How can I -- how do I go to trial with someone who is already defeated and telling me there\u2019s no possible way I can win, your Honor?\u201d", "The colloquy ended with the following exchange:", "THE COURT: I know Attorney Garrity well enough to know that if", "he goes to trial, he\u2019s going to mount a strong defense. I don\u2019t think", "that\u2019s the issue. I think he\u2019s trying to get to you -- get into your", "head that maybe the facts aren\u2019t as strong as you would like them", "to be. You can\u2019t change the facts.", "THE DEFENDANT: Yeah, I understand the evidence against me,", "sir.", "THE COURT: Okay.", "THE DEFENDANT: So I have to -- I have to go to trial with Paul", "Garrity is what you\u2019re telling me, sir?", "THE COURT: I\u2019m not going to replace counsel on the eve of trial", "based upon what I just heard. I also heard that Attorney Garrity", "has investigated, that he will pursue any legitimate witnesses that", "may come to your defense, but I don\u2019t take continuances,", "particularly a week from trial.", "At this stage, where I\u2019ve seen the work that your counsel --", "counsels have put into this, to think it hasn\u2019t been competently", "pursued, diligently pursued, so motion to withdraw denied.", "The defendant concedes that the trial court allowed him to explain his dissatisfaction with Garrity. He argues, however, that his concluding question", "5 as to whether he \u201cha[d] to go to trial with Paul Garrity\u201d \u201ccreated the same ambiguity that was present in Sweeney,\u201d and that, therefore, the trial court was required to clarify the ambiguity. See Sweeney, 151 N.H. at 668-71. We disagree, as the facts in Sweeney are distinguishable.", "In Sweeney, the defendant asked whether he could speak to the trial judge \u201cprivately\u201d during a pretrial hearing held on the first day of trial. Sweeney, 151 N.H. at 668. After the trial judge advised him that it was \u201cnot allowed,\u201d id., the defendant again attempted to speak with the judge, who told him that he was \u201crepresented by very, very competent counsel.\u201d Id. The defendant persevered, attempting to address the authenticity of a proposed trial exhibit. Id. When the trial court advised him that his counsel \u201cwill make any arguments for you that have to be made,\u201d the defendant reported that his counsel had refused to make the argument. Id. The court then stated: \u201cWell, then, as long as you\u2019re represented by him, Mr. Sweeney, then you have to pay attention to him.\u201d Id. at 669. When faced with the choice of either advancing the challenge that he wished to make or remaining silent because he was represented by counsel, Sweeney asked, \u201cWell, sir, do I have the right to fire my lawyer?\u201d Id. The trial court responded, \u201cAt this point in time, no. We\u2019re on the verge of starting the jury trial, sir.\u201d Id. at 669. On appeal, we held that \u201cthe trial court\u2019s summary response to the defendant\u2019s question, without further inquiry, violated his State constitutional rights and constituted reversible error.\u201d Id. at 672.", "The defendant describes his final question to the trial court as one that \u201casked the court what options were available to him.\u201d We do not view his inquiry so broadly. Here, in contrast to Sweeney, the trial court conducted an extensive colloquy after the defendant made his request that Garrity withdraw as his counsel. The court began the exchange by asking: \u201cMr. Martin, tell me in your own words why you think you\u2019re entitled to a new counsel.\u201d (Emphasis added.) After describing the alleged deficiencies in Garrity\u2019s representation, the defendant concluded: \u201cI\u2019m fighting for my life and I deserve to be represented zealously in every aspect.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In response, the court ruled, \u201cmotion for new counsel is denied.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Throughout the hearing the trial court consistently and repeatedly referred to the defendant\u2019s request that Garrity withdraw as a motion for new counsel. Never did the defendant take issue with that reference. It was at the end of the lengthy colloquy that the defendant asked, \u201cI have to go to trial with Paul Garrity is what you\u2019re telling me, sir?\u201d The court responded, \u201cI\u2019m not going to replace counsel on the eve of trial based upon what I just heard.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Despite being given several opportunities throughout the colloquy, the defendant said nothing to the court that would suggest that he wished to proceed pro se. Although we noted in Sweeney that a defendant need not recite a talismanic formula in order to invoke the right to self-representation, id. at 670, we stated that further judicial inquiry was necessary \u201c[o]nce the defendant makes a sufficiently clear request to indicate an intention to switch", "6 representational gears.\u201d Id. at 671 (quotations omitted). Here, while the defendant clearly indicated that he wanted to fire Garrity, nothing that he said indicated that he sought to \u201cswitch representational gears\u201d and proceed pro se. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court achieved sufficient clarity of the purpose of the defendant\u2019s request. See id.", "Notably, in Sweeney, we limited our holding, explaining that \u201cwe do not hold that a trial judge must explicitly inform a defendant of his right to proceed pro se.\u201d Id. at 671. In doing so, we implicitly recognized the danger that might result if a trial court were to suggest an approach not previously contemplated by the defendant; i.e., to waive his right to counsel. The danger is \u201cthat a defendant will treat advice regarding the existence of the right as a subtle indicator that the judge is in fact recommending that he exercise the right.\u201d Com. v. Myers, 748 N.E.2d 471, 476 (Mass. App. Ct. 2001). As we observed in Sweeney, when a defendant invokes his right to self-representation, he necessarily waives his right to counsel. Sweeney, 151 N.H. at 670. In the absence of any indication from the defendant that he wished to \u201cswitch representational gears\u201d by waiving his right to counsel, we decline to hold that the trial court was required to sua sponte advise him of his right to proceed pro se. See Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. at 404 (observing that courts must indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver of right to counsel).", "Next, the defendant characterizes his request that Garrity file a motion to withdraw as a \u201cmotion to fire retained counsel,\u201d and argues that the court erred by denying his motion without asking how he wished to proceed. Defendants facing criminal charges who do not require appointed counsel generally have the right to counsel of their choice. United States v. Gonzalez- Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 144 (2006). In contrast, as the defendant acknowledges in his brief, \u201c[d]efendants represented by appointed counsel enjoy a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, but not a right to an attorney of their choice.\u201d See Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624 (1989).", "This dichotomy also exists in regard to the discharge of counsel. Although a defendant does not generally require the permission of a trial court to replace retained counsel, see, e.g., United States v. Woodard, 291 F.3d 95, 107 (1st Cir. 2002), \u201cthose who do not have the means to hire their own lawyers have no cognizable complaint so long as they are adequately represented by attorneys appointed by the courts.\u201d Caplin & Drysdale, 491 U.S. at 624.", "The State contends that, at the time of the hearing on Garrity\u2019s motion to withdraw, Garrity was serving as appointed rather than retained counsel. The defendant, in contrast, argues that Garrity appeared at the hearing in his capacity as retained counsel. We will assume without deciding that Garrity appeared as retained counsel at the February 21 hearing.", "7", "We have observed that \u201cthe ethical, fair, and orderly administration of justice may outweigh a defendant\u2019s right to chosen counsel when, for example, the trial court determines that a defendant has asserted his right to dismiss counsel as a dilatory tactic.\u201d State v. Gonzalez, 170 N.H. 398, 405 (2017). \u201c[T]he right to counsel cannot be manipulated so as to obstruct the orderly procedure in the courts or to interfere with the fair administration of justice.\u201d United States v. Llanes, 374 F.2d 712, 717 (2d Cir. 1967) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). \u201cJudges must be vigilant that requests for appointment of a new attorney on the eve of trial should not become a vehicle for achieving delay.\u201d Id. Accordingly, our rules of criminal procedure specifically prohibit the withdrawal of counsel in a criminal case \u201cafter the case has been assigned for trial or hearing, except upon motion granted by the court for good cause shown, and on such terms as the court may order.\u201d N.H. R. Crim. P. 5(h). This rule applies whether counsel is appointed or retained.", "Here, the case had been assigned for trial. The record does not establish that good cause existed as of February 21 to allow Garrity to withdraw and for the court to appoint new counsel. The trial court allowed the defendant to explain the reasons for his dissatisfaction with Garrity\u2019s representation, and considered them, along with Garrity\u2019s responses. The defendant expressed concern about Garrity\u2019s preparation for trial and Garrity\u2019s attempt to persuade him to consider the State\u2019s plea offer. The trial court was not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s perception of deficiencies in Garrity\u2019s performance and denied the motion to withdraw.", "We note that, prior to this colloquy, the trial court had held a pretrial conference on February 15, during which counsel for both parties addressed the trial preparation that had been completed and that which remained to be done. Given the record before us, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s discretionary ruling that there was no good cause to allow Garrity to withdraw and to appoint new counsel is sustainable. See N.H. R. Crim. P. 5(h); cf. United States v. Allen, 789 F.2d 90, 93 (1st Cir. 1986) (\u201cGood cause for substitution of counsel cannot be determined solely according to the subjective standard of what the defendant perceives.\u201d (quotation omitted)).", "Although the defendant contends that the trial court \u201cshould have inquired into the availability of [the defendant\u2019s original] public defenders, their familiarity with his case, and their ability to try the case on short notice,\u201d we are not persuaded that the trial court erred when it determined that replacement of counsel was not a viable alternative to a delay in trial. At the time of the February 21, 2017 hearing, Garrity had been representing the defendant for approximately 21 months, and the second degree murder trial, which included several other serious charges, was scheduled to begin six days later. Given these facts, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the public defender, if appointed to represent the defendant, would not have been able to adequately prepare for trial.", "8", "We reach the same result under the Federal Constitution. See United States v. Mota-Santana, 391 F.3d 42, 47 (1st Cir. 2004) (defendant seeking to replace retained counsel with appointed counsel must show good cause).", "Finally, the defendant argues that, because the State\u2019s case \u201chinged largely on the identification of [the defendant] by two eyewitnesses,\u201d and because there was evidence of eyewitness intoxication, the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury that it should consider evidence of intoxication when it evaluated the reliability of eyewitness testimony. We evaluate allegations of error by interpreting the disputed instructions in their entirety, as a reasonable juror would have understood them, and in light of all the evidence in the case. State v. West, 167 N.H. 465, 468 (2015). We determine whether the jury instructions adequately and accurately explain each element of the offense and reverse only if the instructions did not fairly cover the issues of law in the case. Id. Whether a particular jury instruction is necessary, and the scope and wording of jury instructions, are within the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Rice, 169 N.H. 783, 790 (2017). We review the trial court\u2019s decision on this issue to determine whether its exercise of discretion is sustainable. Id. To establish that the trial court\u2019s decision is not sustainable, the defendant must demonstrate that the court\u2019s ruling was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case. Id.", "The trial court provided the following identification instructions to the jury:", "In this case, one of the issues is the identification of the", "defendant as the perpetrator of the crime.

If, after examining the", "evidence, you have a reasonable doubt as to the accuracy of the", "identification, you must find the defendant not guilty.", "The defendant argues that the trial court should have included the following language when it instructed the jury on the factors that it could consider when appraising identification testimony: \u201cWhether, at the time of the observation, the witness was under the influence of alcohol and, if so, to what degree.\u201d He contends that because the court omitted evidence of intoxication from the list of factors that could be considered, \u201ca reasonable juror could conclude that the court, and thus the law, regarded the impact of intoxication as less important than the listed factors.\u201d We disagree.", "The trial court twice instructed the jury to consider the opportunity and the capacity of each identification witness when evaluating the identification testimony. Defense counsel also focused on the opportunity and capacity of the witnesses to observe the assault in his closing argument. The court instructed the jury that, in assessing identification testimony, it could consider a list of relevant factors. By using the language \u201csuch factors as\u201d in the instruction, the court made clear to the jury that the list was non-exhaustive. Having reviewed the instructions given by the trial court in their entirety, we conclude that the defendant has not demonstrated that the trial court\u2019s decision was clearly untenable or unreasonable to the prejudice of his case.", "10", "Issues raised in the defendant\u2019s notice of appeal, but not briefed are deemed waived.

On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress upon finding that: (1) he was not in custody for Miranda purposes when he was questioned by detectives about the alleged assault, see Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966); and (2) his consent to search the store and his person were \u201cvoluntary and free of duress and coercion.\u201d We affirm.", "The following facts are drawn from the trial court\u2019s order. In July 2016, K.L. reported to Detective Lombardi of the Nashua Police Department that someone she described \u201cas a thin, darker skin man named \u2018Abi\u2019\u201d had sexually assaulted her inside of a new wireless store in Nashua. On July 13, at approximately 4:45 p.m., Lombardi and his colleague, Detective DiTullio, went to the store. They wore plain clothes with their badges around their necks and their guns displayed on their hips. Even though the store was not yet open to the public, the detectives were able to enter through the main entrance. The detectives informed the defendant and another man, Diego Gomez, that they were investigating a female\u2019s complaint about the prior night, and asked if they would be willing to give statements at the police station \u201cvoluntarily.\u201d The defendant and Gomez agreed. The conversation \u201cwas cordial, polite, and short, lasting five minutes.\u201d", "All four men then left the store and Gomez locked the doors. Lombardi suggested that the defendant and Gomez take separate vehicles in case one of them finished his interview early. A patrol officer then arrived to secure both entrances to ensure that no one entered the store in their absence. The defendant and Gomez drove to the police station in their own vehicles and the detectives drove in an unmarked cruiser. The four men entered the station through the front lobby. Both Gomez and the defendant were signed in as visitors at 5:15 p.m. The detectives did not take any items from the defendant, such as his keys or cell phone.", "After signing in the two men, the detectives brought them to a waiting area in the detectives\u2019 bureau located on the second floor. The detectives decided to first interview Gomez and asked the defendant to remain in the waiting room. The defendant agreed. The detectives told the defendant to let them know if he needed anything during the wait. The defendant was alone and unsupervised and was not restrained in any manner while in the waiting area. The door to the exit remained unlocked and the defendant could have left at any time without the assistance of the detectives or any other officer.", "The detectives interviewed Gomez for approximately twenty-five minutes, after which Lombardi met the defendant in the waiting room and brought him to a small interview room. The room contained a table and three chairs. Lombardi gave the defendant a \u201cvictim/witness background sheet\u201d and asked him to complete it. Lombardi then left the room.", "Thereafter, both DiTullio and Lombardi entered the room, and they began interviewing the defendant at 5:52 p.m. The interview was audio and video recorded. At the beginning of the interview, Lombardi told the defendant the following:", "2", "No one forced you to come in here, right? You\u2019re not under arrest", "right now. . . . [T]hat door is shut just for our privacy. It\u2019s not", "locked. If at any time you don\u2019t want to talk to us, you just let us", "know and we will bring you back outside and you can get in your", "car and leave. Before the questioning began, the defendant received a call on his cell phone. The defendant answered the phone and had a brief conversation with the caller. After the call, the defendant completed the \u201cvictim/witness background sheet.\u201d The detectives then began to question the defendant about the night of July 12. The trial court found that the tone of the interview was conversational, the detectives did not raise their voices, and the defendant gave long narrative responses rather than \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers.", "During the interview, the defendant acknowledged that he met K.L. at the wireless store the previous night. He stated that after he saw her walking barefoot near the store, he asked her if she wanted help. She agreed to go into the store. The defendant, K.L., and Gomez then drank together in the store. The defendant indicated that he left the store to buy more beer and a package of condoms, in case something might \u201chappen.\u201d The defendant represented that when he returned, the three of them continued to drink and, at some point, K.L. vomited and fell asleep.", "The defendant denied that anything sexual happened with K.L. He stated that he left the store when his wife called him around 12:30, and when he did, K.L. was outside on the sidewalk with Gomez. The defendant also reported that K.L. tried kissing him but he did not reciprocate because she was vomiting and was too impaired.", "Approximately thirteen minutes into the interview, the following exchange occurred, as recited in the trial court\u2019s order:1", "Lombardi:", "And what happened after she was kissing you?", "Defendant:", "Nothing.", "Lombardi:", "That was it?

Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court concluded \u201cthat the defendant was not in custody at any point during the interview and therefore was not entitled to Miranda protections.\u201d Also, the court found that, because the defendant signed the two consent forms, was not in custody, and was not threatened or coerced in any way, the \u201cState has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that his consent to search the store and his person was voluntary and free of duress and coercion.\u201d The jury thereafter convicted the defendant. This appeal followed.", "On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred when it found that: (1) he was not in custody for Miranda purposes when he was questioned by the detectives about the alleged assault; and (2) his consent to the searches of the store and his person was free and voluntary. The defendant cites both the State and Federal Constitutions in support of his arguments that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress. See N.H. CONST. pt.

We address the defendant\u2019s argument as to each fact in turn.", "First, the defendant argues that when the trial court credited Lombardi for informing the defendant that he could terminate the questioning and leave at any time, the trial court failed to consider the fact that the detectives did not honor this promise when the defendant twice asked for the assistance of counsel during the interview. Essentially, the defendant asserts that when he asked to consult with an attorney this question served as a request to end the interview. The defendant contends, therefore, that we should not give as much weight to the \u201cdemonstrably superficial warning\u201d the detectives gave to the defendant here as we have in prior cases. We disagree.", "9", "We have previously held that whether a suspect is informed that he or she is free to terminate the interrogation at any time is a significant factor in our custody analysis. See McKenna, 166 N.H. at 680; State v. Locke, 149 N.H. 1, 7 (2002) (\u201cGiven the repeated advice that he was free to leave, we conclude that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would not believe he was restrained to the degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d); State v. Johnson, 140 N.H. 573, 578 (1995) (finding no custody, based, in part, upon fact that trooper informed defendant he was free to leave). We have also noted that a statement to a suspect that he is not under arrest generally weighs against a finding of custody. See McKenna, 166 N.H. at 679; Hammond, 144 N.H. at 404 (finding no custody, based, in part, upon fact that officers informed the defendant several times that he was not under arrest and that he was free to leave at any time).", "As an initial matter, whether the detectives intended to honor their promise to end the interview at the time they offered it is not the focus of this inquiry. We need not examine the subjective intent of the detectives; rather, we conduct an objective analysis to determine whether a reasonable person would have believed that he was restrained to the degree associated with formal arrest. See McKenna, 166 N.H. at 676-77. Thus, to the extent that the defendant asserts that the detectives never intended to permit him to terminate the interview, this claim is irrelevant to our analysis.", "Objectively, given the facts here, the detectives\u2019 responses to the defendant\u2019s request for an attorney have no bearing on the weight we give to the detectives\u2019 representations that the defendant was free to leave or terminate the interview because the defendant did not request to do so. His request to consult with an attorney cannot be equated to a request to terminate the interview. We find support for this conclusion in our decision in Locke, where we recognized that repeatedly advising a defendant that he is free to leave is a strong indication that the defendant is not in custody. Locke, 149 N.H. at 7. We concluded that the defendant in Locke was not in custody despite his inquiry to the detective during the interview if he had any rights. Id. at 5. Nor did the interview become custodial in Locke when the defendant stood up, walked out of the interview room, and \u201cran into\u201d the detective in the hallway and then returned to the interview room, because the detective neither blocked the defendant\u2019s path nor told the defendant to go back into the room. Id. at 5, 7.", "Similarly, here, at no time did the defendant ask to leave the interview room or to terminate the interview. Nor is there evidence in the record to suggest that the defendant made gestures or otherwise indicated that he wanted to leave or terminate the interview. Indeed, the defendant asking to consult with an attorney is more akin to the defendant in Locke asking if he had any rights. The detectives here did not, as the defendant contends, ignore their promise that the defendant could terminate the interview at any time.", "10 There is no indication in the record that the detectives restricted the defendant\u2019s ability to leave or end the questioning. Thus, we find that this factor \u2014 instructing the defendant that he is free to leave at any time \u2014 weighs against a finding of custody even when considering the defendant\u2019s request to consult with a lawyer.", "Second, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding that the length of the interview was a factor that weighed against a finding of custody. The defendant contends that the trial court failed to consider the entire interaction between the defendant and the officers when calculating the length of the interview. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the detectives spent over two and a half hours with him \u2014 from the moment the officers arrived at the defendant\u2019s business to when the detectives returned the defendant to the police station after going to the hospital. We recently noted that \u201c[w]hile in general, [brief interrogations] weigh[] against a finding of custody, the length of questioning can be a relatively \u2018undeterminative factor in the analysis of custody.\u2019\u201d In re E.G., 171 N.H. at ___ (slip op. at 12) (quoting United States v. Griffin, 922 F.2d 1343, 1348 (8th Cir. 1990)). We recognize that the defendant\u2019s interaction with the detectives lasted over two hours, but the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the only substantive questioning occurred while the defendant was in the interview room at the station, which lasted less than twenty minutes. Cf. Locke, 149 N.H. at 6-7 (finding no custody, and recognizing, in part, that the interview\u2019s duration was not excessive \u2014 it lasted for three and one-half hours, and there was no evidence of shouting or harsh tones). On balance, we conclude that despite the length of the overall interaction, the trial court did not err by only considering the brevity of the interview at the station and we agree with the trial court that this factor weighs against a finding of custody.", "Third, the defendant argues that the accusatory nature of the questioning weighs in favor of a finding of custody. \u201c[W]e have repeatedly recognized the importance of the absence or presence of accusatory questioning in our analysis of custody, contrasting accusatory questioning, which weighs in favor of custody, with questioning of a purely general nature, which supports a determination of no custody.\u201d McKenna, 166 N.H. at 682; Jennings, 155 N.H. at 775 (nature of interrogation is important factor in custody determination); see also State v. Dedrick, 132 N.H. 218, 225 (1989) (finding custody, in part, because intensity of the interview escalated when the officers accused the defendant of untruths and stated \u201ctime and again\u201d that it was the defendant who had killed the victim), abrogated on other grounds by State v. Ford, 144 N.H. 57, 62-63 (1999); cf. State v. Graca, 142 N.H. 670, 675 (1998) (concluding that the defendant was not in custody, in part, because the \u201cquestioning throughout the incident was of a purely general nature\u201d). The defendant relies upon Jennings to argue that when Lombardi urged the defendant to be truthful and \u201cconfronted him with alleged evidence which was inconsistent with his denial of sexual contact with K.L.,\u201d this accusation weighs", "11 in favor of finding custody. See Jennings, 155 N.H. at 774. In Jennings, however, the officer began the interview by immediately \u201cconfront[ing] the defendant with his daughter\u2019s allegations of sexual assault and said he was certain she was telling the truth.\u201d Id. Moreover, in Jennings, we considered the questioning during the interview in conjunction with the \u201ccontrol exercised by the police from the beginning of the encounter,\u201d which clearly indicated \u201cthat the police believed the defendant to be guilty of sexual assault [signaling] to a reasonable person that his freedom of movement was curtailed to the degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d Id.", "By contrast, in this case, Lombardi stated only that he had some evidence to suggest that the defendant\u2019s statements were inaccurate and that he just wanted the truth from the defendant. Lombardi then provided the defendant with an opportunity to respond. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Lombardi accused the defendant of committing a specific crime. Cf. McKenna, 166 N.H. at 682-83 (concluding that the accusatory nature of the questioning \u2014 repeatedly asking the defendant, for over an hour, why he sexually assaulted the victim \u2014 weighed in favor of a finding of custody). The majority of the questioning was not accusatory in nature and as soon as it became arguably accusatory, the defendant asked to consult with an attorney. At that point, the questioning ceased, but for one assertion made in the context of a request for consent to search, asking the defendant to confirm his denial that any sexual assault had occurred. Furthermore, here, unlike the confrontational tone used in Jennings, the trial court found that \u201cthe detectives presented a relaxed demeanor[,] . . . were cordial toward the defendant,\u201d and did not \u201craise their voices.\u201d Thus, the overall tone of the interview was not accusatory and, therefore, this factor weighs against a finding of custody.", "Fourth, the defendant argues that when the trial court considered the fact that the detectives were in plain clothes as a factor that weighs against custody, the trial court ignored the \u201cactual appearance of the detectives involved.\u201d We generally find the fact that the officers are in plain clothing to weigh against a finding of custody. See Locke, 149 N.H. at 4, 6 (finding no custody when, in part, the two officers were in plain clothes, displayed their badges when identifying themselves, and weapons were not displayed). However, we recognize that in this case, this factor weighs slightly more in favor of a finding of custody because the two detectives\u2019 weapons and badges were plainly visible to the defendant, and a third uniformed officer arrived to guard the store while the defendant and Gomez went to the police station. These facts differ from situations where the officers are in plain clothes and their weapons are not visible. Thus, taken together, these facts weigh slightly in favor of a finding of custody.", "Finally, the defendant argues that in conducting its custody analysis, the trial court \u201cmissed\u201d the dynamic of the situation involving the detectives\u2019", "12 initiation of contact. We acknowledge that when police initiate contact with the suspect, custody is more likely to exist. See McKenna, 166 N.H. at 684 (relevant to our assessment of the character of the interrogation is the fact that the police initiated the contact with the defendant). Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, however, the trial court considered this factor as weighing in favor of finding custody and we do not disagree. As the trial court also noted, all of the factors are to be considered together to determine whether there was \u201crestraint on freedom of movement to the degree associated with formal arrest.\u201d Id. at 676 (quotation omitted). We do not rely on any single factor in isolation. Id. at 686.", "In reviewing the ultimate determination of custody, we acknowledge that some facts weigh in favor of finding custody, including: the appearance of the detectives; the detectives\u2019 initiation of contact with the defendant; and the questioning at the police station in a small interview room, with the door closed, and with the defendant in the chair furthest from the door. However, in addition to the facts discussed above that weigh against a finding of custody, the following facts also suggest that the defendant was not in custody: the defendant agreed to go to the police station; he drove there voluntarily; he was signed in as a visitor; the interview lasted less than twenty minutes; and he was not restrained in any way. Thus, although some factors weigh in favor of a finding of custody, after considering the totality of the circumstances of the encounter, we conclude that a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position would not have believed himself to be in custody, and therefore, he was not in custody for Miranda purposes when he was questioned and signed the two consent forms. See In re E.G., 171 N.H. at ___ (slip op. at 13); McKenna, 166 N.H. at 677. The Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than does the State Constitution with regard to the defendant\u2019s rights under Miranda. See In re E.G., 171 N.H. at ___ (slip op. at 13); J.D.B. v. North Carolina, 564 U.S. 261, 270-71 (2011). Therefore, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution.", "Next, the defendant argues that his consent to the searches of the store and his person were not voluntary due to the coercive manner by which the detectives secured his consent in violation of his rights under Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. \u201cA voluntary consent free of duress and coercion is a recognized exception to the need for both a warrant and probable cause.\u201d State v. Livingston, 153 N.H. 399, 405 (2006) (quotation omitted). The burden is on the State to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the consent was free, knowing, and voluntary. Id. The voluntariness of the consent is a question of fact determined by examining the totality of the circumstances. Id. We will disturb the trial court\u2019s factual findings only if they are not supported by the record or are clearly erroneous. Id. Our review of the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions, however, is de novo. Id.", "13", "The trial court found that the State met its burden of establishing that the defendant validly consented to the searches. In reaching its conclusion, the trial court relied upon the following facts: (1) the State produced two consent forms signed by the defendant, see State v. Watson, 151 N.H. 537, 541 (2004) (use of written consent form may be an important factor when evaluating totality of the circumstances); (2) the defendant was not in custody, see id. at 540-41 (fact that defendant is in custody may weigh heavily against finding of valid consent); (3) the video recording demonstrated that Lombardi clearly explained that the defendant did not have to consent to either search, see id. at 541 (good policy for police officers to advise persons that they have right to refuse to consent to warrantless search); and (4) the defendant\u2019s tone in the video demonstrated that he freely and voluntarily gave his consent to search the store, cf. id. (upholding trial court\u2019s finding that even though the defendant\u2019s consent was \u201cperhaps done unenthusiastically,\u201d the defendant freely, knowingly, and voluntarily consented to the search).", "The defendant argues that custody is a factor that weighs heavily in determining whether consent was involuntary. See id. at 540-41. This is a valid point. However, we have already established that the defendant was not in custody when he consented to the two searches. Therefore, the detectives did not violate his Miranda rights by continuing to speak with him or by asking for his consent to search, and, thus, this factor does not weigh against a finding of valid consent.", "The defendant next argues that \u201c[r]egardless of whether the [d]efendant was in custody, his consent was involuntary for a myriad of other reasons.\u201d The defendant contends that the detectives went beyond informing the defendant of viable alternatives to consent \u2014 obtaining a search warrant \u2014 because the detectives threatened to close his business while they sought a warrant authorizing a search of the store. See Livingston, 153 N.H. at 406. In asserting this argument, the defendant seeks to distinguish the circumstances here from the facts in Livingston. In Livingston, we noted that informing a defendant of viable alternatives to a consent search does not necessarily vitiate consent. Id. The defendant in Livingston had initially refused to consent to a search of his vehicle. Id. at 406-07. When he refused, he thought he had no other options available. Id. at 407. The officer then informed the defendant that while he could continue to refuse a search of the vehicle, his refusal would result in a canine sniff search of the exterior of the vehicle and if the canine responded to the odor of narcotics, the officer would then seize the vehicle and apply for a search warrant. Id. In light of these circumstances, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the officer\u2019s statements were more explanatory than coercive and thus, the defendant\u2019s consent was voluntary. Id.", "Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, the present circumstances are similar to Livingston. Here, we rely upon the trial court\u2019s finding that \u201c[b]ased on . . . Lombardi\u2019s tone and demeanor, Lombardi was [not] threatening to close", "14 the defendant\u2019s store permanently or was otherwise making any other type of impermissible threat.\u201d Therefore, as in Livingston, Lombardi\u2019s statement was more explanatory than coercive because Lombardi was merely attempting to advise the defendant of the consequences of his refusal to consent. The circumstances are thus different here than in other cases where the alleged threats \u201cwent beyond \u2018a mere reference to the fact that [officers] could obtain a [search] warrant.\u2019\u201d State v. Socci, 166 N.H. 464, 473-74 (2014) (quoting United States v. Ivy, 165 F.3d 397, 403 (6th Cir. 1998) (alleged threats included making arrests, using crowbars and sledgehammers, or taking away the defendant\u2019s children if he did not consent to a search)).", "As the trial court also found, the defendant had already verbally consented to the search prior to this alleged \u201cthreat\u201d being made. Given that the defendant had already consented to the search of his business and considering the trial court\u2019s conclusion relating to Lombardi\u2019s tone and demeanor, we conclude that Lombardi\u2019s subsequent statement did not coerce the defendant to consent. Thus, Lombardi\u2019s explanation of viable alternatives to consent does not weigh against a finding of a voluntary consent.", "The defendant also argues that the trial court minimized his request to speak with a lawyer. Specifically, the defendant contends that, regardless of whether he was in custody, the trial court failed to consider that he had requested to consult with an attorney in order to understand the consent form seeking his DNA sample and was never afforded an opportunity to speak with one. We disagree. The trial court considered this request for counsel and found that Lombardi did not ignore it. The record supports this conclusion. Lombardi informed the defendant that he could consult with an attorney when he stated, \u201c[w]ell that\u2019s fine if you want to consult a lawyer about that. Like I said I\u2019m not going to force you to [consent].\u201d This statement informed the defendant that he could consult an attorney before consenting to the search of his person.", "Moreover, the defendant\u2019s initial refusal to consent to the DNA search does not necessarily invalidate a subsequent consent as involuntary. See State v. Green, 133 N.H. 249, 259 (1990). The defendant could have continued to refuse to consent or could have left the room. Notably, the defendant\u2019s initial refusal to consent to the body search, followed by execution of the consent form without asking any questions, suggests that the defendant understood his rights to refuse and was not coerced into signing the consent form.

Synopsys, 374 F.3d 23, 30-32 (1st Cir. 2004) (adopting abuse of discretion standard for reviewing trial court\u2019s application of judicial estoppel). But see Seymour v.

In the summary judgment context, we have explained that \u201cwe apply our traditional summary judgment standard of review to the legal issues and to the determination of whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,\u201d but \u201cwe review the trial court\u2019s decision to grant equitable relief . . . for an unsustainable exercise of discretion.\u201d Conant v.

The legal issues presented in this case include: (1) whether the trial court reviewed the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss under the appropriate standard; and (2) our law concerning judicial estoppel in the bankruptcy context, which is an issue of first impression. We address these issues in turn.", "III", "In its order granting the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, the trial court identified the following as the applicable standard of review:", "Generally, in ruling upon a motion to dismiss, the trial court", "is required to determine whether the allegations contained in the", "[plaintiff\u2019s] pleadings are sufficient to state a basis upon which", "5", "relief may be granted.

(emphasis added). \u201cA jurisdictional challenge based upon lack of standing is such a defense.\u201d Id. (quotation omitted). We have not, however, included judicial estoppel among such defenses. Therefore, the trial court must assume the truth of the plaintiff\u2019s allegations and construe all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff as the nonmoving party. See, e.g., Surprenant v. Mulcrone, 163 N.H. 529, 530 (2012) (applying this standard to motion to dismiss based on quasi-judicial immunity); Lamprey v.

In denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for reconsideration, however, the trial court stated: \u201cOther than the plaintiff\u2019s bald assertion that her bankruptcy trustee has taken over the instant case, there is nothing in the record to support this contention.\u201d In so ruling, the trial court erred in two respects. First, it failed to credit the plaintiff\u2019s allegation as true, instead imposing a requirement that the plaintiff submit evidence supporting her contention. This is inconsistent with the standard of review applicable at the motion to dismiss stage. See Surprenant, 163 N.H. at 530; Lamprey, 163 N.H. at 256; Paul, 153 N.H. at 749. Second, the trial court overlooked that the plaintiff had attached supporting documentation to her objection to the motion to dismiss. See Beane v. Dana S.

Specifically, the plaintiff attached (1) the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting the motion to reopen to administer the potential asset of the estate (i.e., the medical malpractice claim), (2) the notice of Notinger\u2019s appointment as trustee of the estate, and (3) a letter from Notinger stating his intention to retain the plaintiff\u2019s present counsel to represent him in the pending malpractice action.", "IV", "Because the trial court rejected the factual premise that the bankruptcy trustee is pursuing the medical malpractice claim on behalf of the estate, the court did not address whether judicial estoppel should bar the trustee\u2019s pursuit of this claim. The application of judicial estoppel to a trustee pursuing a claim on behalf of a bankruptcy estate presents an issue of first impression in this jurisdiction. We will address this issue on appeal, instead of remanding for the trial court to consider it in the first instance, because the parties have briefed the issue and it presents a question of law in this context. See Lynn v. Wentworth By The Sea Master Ass\u2019n, 169 N.H. 77, 84 (2016) (addressing question of law in the interest of judicial economy instead of remanding to the trial court); cf.

One is that, unlike the plaintiff-debtor, the bankruptcy trustee \u201cnever took an inconsistent position . . . with regard to this claim.\u201d Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272; accord Stephenson, 700 F.3d at 272; Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 188; Hamm, 52 So. 3d at 494; see also Cannon-Stokes v. Potter, 453 F.3d 446, 448 (7th Cir. 2006) (opining that \u201cunless the estate itself engages in contradictory litigation tactics the elements of judicial estoppel are not satisfied\u201d). We agree with this reasoning. The first judicial estoppel factor is not met with respect to the trustee because the trustee did not assert inconsistent positions. See Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272; Stephenson, 700 F.3d at 272; Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 188; Hamm, 52 So. 3d at 494. We need not consider the remaining judicial estoppel factors because we find the lack of inconsistent positions dispositive in this case. See Pike, 158 N.H. at 271 (\u201cBecause we find no contradiction in the positions taken, we do not consider the remaining factors which inform the application of judicial estoppel.\u201d); Porter v. City of Manchester, 155 N.H. 149, 157 (2007) (same).", "The defendants recognize that courts have declined to apply judicial estoppel to a bankruptcy trustee pursuing a claim not disclosed by the debtor, but urge us to reject this view. According to the defendants, \u201cthe better rule for the integrity of the judicial system as a whole is that [judicial] estoppel should bind the trustee as well\u201d as the debtor.", "As an initial matter, we note that there is some debate over which court\u2019s integrity should be the focus of the doctrine. Compare Reed, 650 F.3d at 572 (\u201c[T]he purpose of judicial estoppel . . . in this context is to protect the integrity of the bankruptcy process.\u201d), with Ah Quin v. County of Kauai Dept. of Transp., 733 F.3d 267, 275 (9th Cir. 2013) (\u201c[P]rotecting\u201d and \u201cpromoting the efficient operation of the bankruptcy system\u201d \u201cdiffers from the goal of judicial estoppel \u2014 protecting the integrity of the courts\u201d), and Eastman, 493 F.3d at 1156 (\u201c[T]he court where the judicial estoppel defense arises . . . is the court interested in protecting its process.\u201d). For purposes of this appeal, we assume that the bankruptcy system is part of the \u201cjudicial process\u201d with which the doctrine of judicial estoppel is concerned. Cf. Pike, 158 N.H. at 270 (\u201cThe general function of judicial estoppel is to prevent abuse of the judicial process,", "10 resulting in an affront to the integrity of the courts.\u201d (emphasis added) (quotation omitted)).", "The defendants argue that judicial estoppel is necessary to protect the integrity of the bankruptcy system because it incentivizes debtors to fully disclose their assets. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that this justification \u201cdo[es] not withstand scrutiny.\u201d Ah Quin, 733 F.3d at 274. \u201c[T]he bankruptcy system already provides plenty of protections.\u201d Id. at 275. For example, \u201cthe [b]ankruptcy [c]ode allows a bankruptcy case to be reopened in order to administer assets of the estate.\u201d Reed, 650 F.3d at 575; see 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 350(b) (2012). Additionally, \u201cthe bankruptcy court has tools of its own to punish a debtor who it determines purposefully tried to hide assets.\u201d Slater, 871 F.3d at 1187. \u201cPunishment of dishonest debtors and deterrence of those who would intentionally omit assets from their schedules is adequately addressed . . . in the [bankruptcy code] provisions for denial or revocation of discharge, and in the case law, which allows exemptions to be denied for a debtor\u2019s bad faith.\u201d Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 187. In sum, the bankruptcy court \u201cis quite capable of fashioning a punishment which will redress [the debtor\u2019s] lack of timely disclosure\u201d if the omission was intentional. In re Lewis, 273 B.R. 739, 748 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2001). Thus, we agree that \u201calternative mechanisms exist to more equitably protect the integrity of the bankruptcy system (and prevent undue benefit to the debtor) than the harsh rule imposed\u201d by applying judicial estoppel to the bankruptcy trustee. Robinson v. District of Columbia, 10 F. Supp. 3d 181, 190 n.9 (D.D.C. 2014).", "We also agree with courts that have recognized how the application of judicial estoppel under these circumstances would be inequitable and would undermine, rather than promote, judicial integrity. \u201cWe recognize that all courts have a strong interest in discouraging the misuse of the legal system . . . . It makes little sense, however, to try to further this interest by punishing those whom the truthful disclosure of assets is intended to benefit.\u201d Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 187. Indeed, \u201c[e]stopping the [t]rustee from pursuing the [claim] against the [defendants] would thwart one of the core goals of the bankruptcy system \u2014 obtaining a maximum and equitable distribution for creditors \u2014 by unnecessarily vaporizing the assets effectively belonging to innocent creditors.\u201d Reed, 650 F.3d at 576 (quotation omitted). Furthermore, it would be \u201can incongruent remedy\u201d to allow the alleged tortfeasors to escape liability while punishing the creditors of the estate. Thompson v. Quarles, 392 B.R. 517, 527 (S.D. Ga. 2008); see also In re Flugence, 738 F.3d 126, 132 (5th Cir. 2013) (stating that this would \u201cturn[ ] equity on its head\u201d). In effect, this would \u201ccause the very result the doctrine is intended to prevent\u201d \u2014 it would \u201cimpair[ ] the integrity of the judicial system.\u201d James D. Walker, Jr. & Amber Nickell, Judicial Estoppel and the Eleventh Circuit Consumer Bankruptcy Debtor, 56 Mercer L. Rev. 1115, 1128 (2005). Therefore, we conclude that \u201c[i]mposing the doctrine of judicial estoppel on an innocent bankruptcy trustee, which, in turn, punishes innocent creditors for the mistakes of a debtor, does", "11 not further the purpose of protecting the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d Hamm, 52 So. 3d at 497.", "We are also not persuaded by the cases the defendants cite in support of their position that the trustee should be judicially estopped from pursuing the claim. For example, Guay, Moses, and In re Superior Crewboats, Inc., 374 F.3d 330 (5th Cir. 2004), are inapposite because the trustee had abandoned the claims in each case, and thus the application of judicial estoppel to the bankruptcy trustee was not at issue. See Guay, 677 F.3d at 15; Moses, 606 F.3d at 791, 795; Superior Crewboats, 374 F.3d at 333. Instead, the issue in those cases was whether the debtors should be judicially estopped from pursuing the claims. See Guay, 677 F.3d at 17; Moses, 606 F.3d at 792; Superior Crewboats, 374 F.3d at 332, 334-36. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit distinguished Superior Crewboats on this basis in Kane and Reed and held that judicial estoppel did not bar the trustee from pursuing the claims. See Kane, 535 F.3d at 386-87; Reed, 650 F.3d at 578. The Fifth Circuit reasoned, and we agree, that it would be inequitable to bar the trustee from pursuing the medical malpractice claim \u201cfor the benefit of the estate\u2019s creditors.\u201d Kane, 535 F.3d at 387; accord Reed, 650 F.3d at 576-77.", "The Eleventh Circuit adopted the same rule in Parker, holding that judicial estoppel does not bar the bankruptcy trustee from pursuing the claim. See Parker, 365 F.3d at 1269, 1272. The Eleventh Circuit reasoned, and we agree, \u201cthat because the trustee was the real party in interest in the civil lawsuit, had never taken an inconsistent position . . . , and had not abandoned the discrimination claim,\u201d the trustee\u2019s pursuit of that claim was not barred by judicial estoppel. Slater, 871 F.3d at 1184; see Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendants\u2019 reliance on a different Eleventh Circuit case, Burnes v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., 291 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2002), overruled in part by Slater, 871 F.3d 1174, is misplaced. \u201c[U]nlike Parker, Burnes did not address the application of judicial estoppel to the interests of a bankruptcy trustee who seeks to prosecute claims connected to a bankruptcy estate.\u201d Thompson v. Earthlink Shared Services, LLC, 956 F. Supp. 2d 1317, 1319 (N.D. Ala. 2013); see Burnes, 291 F.3d at 1283 (applying judicial estoppel to the plaintiff-debtor). Moreover, after the parties submitted their briefs, the Eleventh Circuit overruled Burnes on the point for which the defendants cite it, and reaffirmed Parker\u2019s \u201ccontinued viability.\u201d Slater, 871 F.3d at 1185-86, 1188 n.16. Therefore, we disagree with the other cases cited by the defendants that apply Burnes instead of Parker.", "D", "The defendants also argue that the trustee should be bound by the plaintiff\u2019s conduct for purposes of judicial estoppel. We are not persuaded by the case the defendants rely on for this proposition. See In re Fineberg, 202 B.R. 206, 227-28 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1996) (raising the issue of judicial estoppel", "12 sua sponte and observing, in dicta, that the trustee\u2019s claims \u201ccould conceivably\u201d be barred by judicial estoppel because the debtor and the trustee were \u201cin a relationship of privity with each other\u201d). Instead, we think the better rule is that followed by several federal appellate courts: \u201cwhere the defense of judicial estoppel arises from a debtor\u2019s failure to disclose a claim in his bankruptcy filings and his subsequent pursuit of that claim, the trustee receives the asset free of this . . . defense.\u201d Stephenson, 700 F.3d at 271 n.6 (quotation, brackets, and ellipsis omitted); accord Reed, 650 F.3d at 575-76; Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272 n.3; Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 188.", "Courts that have adopted this rule reason that the bankruptcy code \u201cdistinguishes between the debtor and the debtor\u2019s estate immediately upon the filing of a [c]hapter 7 bankruptcy.\u201d Reed, 650 F.3d at 574. As the Fifth Circuit explained, \u201cthe general principle that a trustee receives causes of action subject to defenses that could have been raised against the debtor \u2018has been properly limited to pre-petition defenses to a cause of action that would have been applicable to a debtor if no bankruptcy case had been filed.\u2019\u201d Id. at 575 (emphasis added) (quoting Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 188). The debtor\u2019s omission of a claim from her bankruptcy schedule or failure to amend her schedule to disclose an asset is considered post-petition conduct, which \u201cdoes not adhere to the [t]rustee.\u201d Id. at 574-75; see Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 188. Therefore, because the plaintiff\u2019s conduct giving rise to the defendants\u2019 judicial estoppel defense did not occur until after the bankruptcy petition was filed and the potential claim had passed into the bankruptcy estate, the estate received the asset free of this defense. See Reed, 650 F.3d at 576; Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272 n.3; Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 188.", "E", "The defendants next argue that the trustee should be judicially estopped from pursuing the medical malpractice claim in light of \u201cthe specific facts of this case\u201d \u2014 namely, an agreement between the trustee and the plaintiff to split the proceeds of any recovery. For this point, the defendants rely on a document that was never submitted to the trial court: a motion filed in the bankruptcy case by the trustee on November 22, 2016, indicating that the trustee and the plaintiff \u201chave agreed to split the net proceeds\u201d of the medical malpractice action \u201c50/50,\u201d and requesting that the bankruptcy court approve this \u201csettlement\u201d under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019(a).

Nevertheless, we will consider the trustee-plaintiff agreement in deciding this appeal in light of the unusual circumstances presented, which include the fact that we are deciding", "13 an issue not reached by the trial court, rather than remanding for the trial court to consider it in the first instance, and we expect that this document would be submitted to the trial court were we instead to remand the case for the trial court to determine whether judicial estoppel applies to the trustee in this case. Additionally, the plaintiff has not moved to strike this document from the defendants\u2019 appendix, her counsel acknowledged the existence of the agreement at oral argument, and both counsel had an opportunity to address it.", "The trustee-plaintiff agreement has no effect on our conclusion that the trustee is not judicially estopped from pursuing the medical malpractice claim against the defendants. Any agreement between the bankruptcy trustee and the plaintiff to split potential proceeds from the malpractice lawsuit is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court, after a hearing and notice to the creditors. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9019(a). The bankruptcy court is solely responsible for deciding how best to administer the assets of an estate in a manner that protects creditors. See Metrou, 781 F.3d at 360.", "V", "In sum, the trial court erred in dismissing the medical malpractice claim against the defendants on the basis of judicial estoppel. That claim belongs to the bankruptcy estate. See Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272-73. The representative of that estate, the bankruptcy trustee, is vested with the authority to pursue that claim and is the real party in interest. See Moses, 606 F.3d at 793, 795-97. The trustee \u201cdid not make any inconsistent statements to the courts,\u201d and the trustee is \u201cnot tainted or burdened\u201d by the plaintiff\u2019s inconsistent statements. Parker, 365 F.3d at 1269, 1273. Furthermore, it would be inequitable to apply judicial estoppel to a trustee pursuing a claim on behalf of innocent creditors, and doing so would undermine, rather than protect, the integrity of the judicial process. For all of these reasons, we hold that the trustee is not judicially estopped from pursuing the medical malpractice claim against the defendants. In light of this holding, we need not address the parties\u2019 remaining arguments, which concern the application of judicial estoppel to the plaintiff. See Thompson, 956 F.

Adams, 449 U.S. 433, 448-49 (1981). As the congressional reports state:", "[A] prisoner who has had a detainer lodged against him is seriously", "disadvantaged by such action. He is in custody and therefore in", "no position to seek witnesses or to preserve his defense. He must", "often be kept in close custody and is ineligible for desirable work", "assignments. What is more, when detainers are filed against a", "prisoner he sometimes loses interest in institutional opportunities", "because he must serve his sentence without knowing what", "additional sentences may lie before him, or when, if ever, he will be", "in a position to employ the education and skills he may be", "developing. H.R. Rep. No. 91-1018, at 3 (1970); S. Rep. No. 91-1356, at 3 (1970), reprinted in 1970 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4864, 4866.", "Although we agree with the defendant that the IAD\u2019s purpose \u201cis to benefit prisoners,\u201d Brown, 157 N.H. at 566 (quotation omitted), we are not persuaded by his argument that the STA has dual purposes (benefitting both a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial and society\u2019s interest in prompt dispositions) while the IAD does not. We believe, instead, that there are substantial similarities between the two statutes, warranting consistent interpretation. Indeed, both the IAD and the STA \u201cprovide for detaining a defendant imprisoned in another jurisdiction and require his prompt transfer and trial,\u201d \u201ccontain statutory limitations on the time that may elapse before a defendant is brought to trial,\u201d \u201cpermit extensions of time,\u201d and \u201cimpose the sanction of dismissal of the charges when their limitations are transgressed.\u201d United States v. Odom, 674 F.2d 228, 231 (4th Cir. 1982). We conclude that, in setting forth these requirements, Congress enacted both statutes \u201cto serve the best interest of the public and the defendant by requiring the prompt disposition of criminal charges.\u201d Id.; cf. Hill, 528 U.S. at 117 (acknowledging that society \u201cenjoy[s] some benefit from the IAD\u2019s time limits,\u201d as \u201c[d]elay can lead to a less accurate outcome as witnesses become unavailable and memories fade\u201d).", "4", "While the federal courts have yet to determine when a defendant has been \u201cbrought to trial\u201d for purposes of the IAD, the majority of the federal circuit courts have decided that, when interpreting the STA, a trial \u201ccommence[s],\u201d see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3161(c)(1), \u201con the day the jury is empaneled, even if not sworn.\u201d United States v. Rodriguez, 63 F.3d 1159, 1164 (1st Cir. 1995); accord United States v. Jones, 23 F.3d 1307, 1308 (8th Cir. 1994); Government of Virgin Islands v. Duberry, 923 F.2d 317, 320 (3d Cir. 1991); United States v. Fox, 788 F.2d 905, 908 (2d Cir. 1986); United States v. A-A-A Elec. Co., Inc., 788 F.2d 242, 246 (4th Cir. 1986); United States v.

In addition, Oklahoma, the only other state to have decided the issue, has also held that \u201cfor purposes of the IAD, a trial commences when the jury selection begins.\u201d Bowie v. State, 816 P.2d 1143, 1147 (Okla. Crim. App. 1991). We join these courts today. See State v. Farrow, 140 N.H. 473, 475 (1995) (stating that statutes pertaining to the same subject matter \u201care to be considered in interpreting\u201d one another and will be construed \u201cso that they do not contradict each other\u201d (quotations omitted)); see also Odom, 674 F.3d at 231 (applying \u201cthe principle that related statutes having the same purpose should be construed together\u201d in interpreting the IAD and the STA).", "In support of his argument that a defendant is not \u201cbrought to trial\u201d under the IAD until the jury is sworn and the admission of evidence begins, the defendant relies on the meaning of \u201ctrial\u201d in the double jeopardy context. Although \u201ca criminal trial does not commence for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause until the jury is empaneled and sworn,\u201d Gomez v. United States, 490 U.S. 858, 872 (1989); see State v. Ojo, 166 N.H. 95, 98 (2014), \u201cother constitutional rights attach before that point,\u201d Gomez, 490 U.S. at 873. Indeed, jury selection is \u201ca critical stage of the criminal proceeding.\u201d Id. at 873 & n.26 (stating that \u201c[i]ndications that Congress likewise considers jury selection part of a felony trial may be gleaned . . . from its passage in 1975 of the Speedy Trial Act\u201d); see also Bowie, 816 P.2d at 1147 (\u201cJury selection is an intrinsic part of the trial process.\u201d). It is at voir dire that the parties first have the opportunity to introduce the jurors to the potential issues in their case. It is also when the \u201ccourt may enforce a defendant\u2019s right to be tried by a jury free from . . . prejudice . . . or predisposition about the defendant\u2019s culpability.\u201d Gomez, 490 U.S. at 873 (citations omitted).", "Moreover, the protections afforded defendants and the goals achieved by the IAD are distinct from those covered by double jeopardy principles. \u201cThe reason for holding that jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn lies in the need to protect the interest of an accused in retaining a chosen jury.\u201d Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35-36 (1978) (explaining that the defendant\u2019s \u201cvalued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal", "5 . . . is an interest with roots deep in the historic development of trial by jury in the Anglo-American system of criminal justice\u201d (quotation omitted)). While we have acknowledged that \u201c[t]he right to complete a trial before a particular tribunal is not absolute,\u201d we have allowed exceptions to this right only in the most narrow of circumstances: \u201cwhen the defendant consents to the mistrial, or, if he objects, upon a finding of the trial court that there is manifest necessity for the act, or that the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.\u201d Ojo, 166 N.H. at 99-100 (emphases added) (stating that \u201call possible alternatives to a mistrial must be considered, employed and found wanting before declaration of a mistrial over the defendant\u2019s objection is justified\u201d (quotation and brackets omitted)). These circumscribed exceptions do not alter the reasoning for placing a defendant in jeopardy \u201conce he is put to trial before a jury.\u201d Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 188 (1957). A defendant\u2019s \u201cright to complete a trial before a particular tribunal\u201d remains, Ojo, 166 N.H. at 99, and is contained within a defendant\u2019s right not to be subjected \u201cto repeated prosecutions for the same offense,\u201d United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470, 479 (1971). Double jeopardy protections are in place to promote \u201cthe finality of judgments,\u201d minimize the \u201charassing exposure to the harrowing experience of a criminal trial,\u201d and safeguard the defendant\u2019s \u201cvalued right to continue with the chosen jury.\u201d Crist, 437 U.S. at 38. In sum, the IAD assures prisoners that the disposition of their out-of-state charges is forthcoming, see RSA 606-A:1, I; S. Rep. No. 91-1356, at 3 (1970), an objective that begins at jury selection, while double jeopardy principles protect defendants from being subjected to \u201ca second trial on the same charge,\u201d Green, 355 U.S. at 188, an objective that begins when the jury is empaneled and sworn. Thus, we are convinced that the concerns underlying double jeopardy principles are \u201cwholly different\u201d from those addressed by the IAD. Cf. Howell, 719 F.2d at 1262 (stating that \u201cthe constitutional considerations underlying the double jeopardy clause are wholly different from the premises of the Speedy Trial Act\u201d (quotation omitted)).", "Finally, the defendant points out that following jury selection, a defendant can \u201cwait weeks for the commencement of trial,\u201d as \u201cactions of the court or the State can interrupt the progress toward adjudication.\u201d Although we hold today that the commencement of jury selection constitutes the point when a defendant is \u201cbrought to trial\u201d for purposes of the IAD, incident to this holding is our understanding that prosecutors and courts will act in good faith to ensure the speedy progression of all phases of trial. After all, the burden of showing compliance with the IAD is on the State, Brown, 157 N.H. at 558, and any improper delay in trial proceedings would contravene the IAD\u2019s purpose of securing a speedy trial for prisoners, see Sprague, 146 N.H. at 335-36.", "Affirmed.", "HICKS, BASSETT, HANTZ MARCONI, and DONOVAN, JJ., concurred.", "6 "]}]
