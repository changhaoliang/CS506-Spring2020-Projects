2018086hj.pdf,2018-0440,IN RE H.J.,Non-criminal,"['Petitioner, the mother of H.J., self-represented party, by brief.', 'Law Office of Gary Paradis, PLLC, of Manchester (Gary Paradis by brief), for the father.', 'BASSETT, J. The respondent, the father of H.J. (child), appeals an order of the Circuit Court (Tenney, J.) terminating his parental rights. See RSA 170- C:5 (2014). He argues that the evidence does not support the circuit court’s findings that: (1) he had abandoned the child; (2) he had not paid sufficient support; and (3) termination of his parental rights was in the child’s best interest. We affirm.', 'The record supports the following facts. Approximately one month after the child was born, the father was incarcerated. After the father was released, the child lived with both parents. In February 2009, the mother moved out after an incident of domestic violence. From June 2009 through September 2010, a domestic violence order was in place against the father. In April 2009, the mother filed a parenting petition. The father did not appear at any of the hearings in the parenting case. In December 2009, the mother was granted sole legal and physical custody of H.J. The parenting plan granted the father supervised visitation once a week at his expense, but gave the mother discretion to refuse such visits. The plan stated that the father “may petition the court for further orders” at such time that “he believes that he can be a positive and consistent influence in [the child’s] life.”', 'The father visited H.J. twice at a visitation center in February and March of 2010. On March 20, 2010, he failed to appear for a scheduled visit. Around this time, he was incarcerated. When he was released in early 2011, he contacted the visitation center requesting to visit H.J. The mother exercised the discretion granted to her by the parenting plan and denied his request. She expressed concern that visitation would be emotionally disruptive to the child because the father’s frequent incarcerations would not allow him to become a consistent part of the child’s life. The father appears to have done nothing at this time to challenge the mother’s decision. The father was re- incarcerated in 2012.', 'In 2013, while still incarcerated, the father filed petitions requesting a change to the parenting plan. The court denied the petitions, observing that the father was incarcerated and “not in a position to exercise his parenting time . . . because of his circumstances.” The court noted that “[a]t such time as he is released, [the father] can contact the [visitation center], who can then contact [the mother].”', 'The father was released from incarceration in January 2014. He testified at the hearing on the termination of his parental rights that he “probably” contacted the visitation center at that time, but did not “remember exactly.” He also testified that he did not file any additional petitions with the court seeking visitation because he was “dealing with these legal issues,” had limited transportation, and “had a lot on [his] plate.” At some point in 2015 the father was re-incarcerated. In early 2016, he was released. Approximately a year later, in February of 2017, he was re-incarcerated.', 'In October of 2017, the mother filed a petition seeking termination of the father’s parental rights on the grounds of abandonment and non-support. At the hearing on the petition, the mother requested that the court terminate the father’s parental rights over H.J. so that her husband, who “has been an active and constant part of [H.J.’s] life since 2010,” could adopt H.J. She testified that, since July 21, 2009, she has only received $458.70 in child support and that her child support case was closed in 2014. She acknowledged that the father has occasionally sent correspondence to H.J. including “a bunch of cards in 2010,” a Toys“R”Us gift card, two letters in 2016, and a birthday card in 2017. She testified that she shared these communications with H.J. and has saved them.', 'The father testified that, although he has been in jail for four of the last eight years, he never intended to abandon the child. He also testified that he', '2 had “never been given the opportunity to be a father to [his child] . . . and it hasn’t been for a lack of trying.”', 'The guardian ad litem (GAL) submitted a final report recommending that the court terminate the father’s parental rights. At the hearing, the GAL testified that even though the father may not have desired to abandon the child, there has “been a substantial period of time since there has been any contact,” and the father’s “personal actions, his inability to stay out of criminal mischief . . . effectuated the abandonment.” The GAL further testified that termination was in the child’s best interest because the mother’s husband was the child’s “father figure,” provided “day-to-day support and emotional support,” and wished to adopt H.J. The GAL recognized that the mother had exercised her right to deny visitation in 2011, which prevented the child from having contact with the father on that occasion, but concluded that the lack of a relationship between the child and the father was due to the father’s consistent “renewal of [his] criminal activities.”', 'In its termination order, the court found that the father had abandoned the child. See RSA 170-C:5, I. It also concluded that the father failed to provide adequate support. See RSA 170-C:5, II (stating that if “parents are financially able,” but “have substantially and continuously neglected to provide the child with necessary subsistence, education or other care,” then a statutory ground exists to terminate parental rights). The court also determined that termination of the father’s parental rights was in the child’s best interest. This appeal followed.', 'Parental rights are “natural, essential, and inherent” within the meaning of Part I, Article 2 of the New Hampshire Constitution. In re Sophia-Marie H., 165 N.H. 332, 335 (2013). The dominant consideration in termination proceedings under RSA chapter 170-C is the welfare of the child, which prevails over the interests of the parents. Id.', 'Before a court may order the termination of a parent’s rights, the petitioning party must prove a statutory ground for termination beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. Once a statutory ground is established, the court must then consider whether termination, or some alternative dispositional order, is in the child’s best interest. Id. We will affirm the trial court’s order unless it is unsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of law. In re Sophia-Marie H., 165 N.H at 336.', 'The father first argues that the trial court erred when it determined that the mother had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the father abandoned his child. RSA 170-C:5, I, authorizes termination when:', 'The parent has abandoned the child. It shall be presumed that the', 'parent intends to abandon the child . . . who has been left by his', '3', 'parent in the care and custody of another without any provision for', 'his support, or without communication from such parent for a', 'period of 6 months. If in the opinion of the court the evidence', 'indicates that such parent has made only minimal efforts to', 'support or communicate with the child, the court may declare the', ""child to be abandoned. RSA 170-C:5, I. “Abandonment is a factual issue to be determined by the [circuit] court, and we will not disturb that determination unless it is unsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of law.” In re Shannon M., 146 N.H. 22, 25 (2001) (quotation omitted). “The six-month period of time during which there is no contact or support by the parent may trigger a finding of abandonment, but it does not mandate that finding.” Id. (quotation omitted). Rather, the parent opposing termination has the opportunity to rebut the presumption of intent to abandon by offering evidence of events that occurred before, during, and after the triggering period. Id. The trial court must then consider the totality of the evidence to determine whether the presumption of intent to abandon has been rebutted. In re Deven O., 165 N.H. 685, 690 (2013). “In making this determination, the court should consider, among other things, the frequency and quality of the communication between the parent and child, the emotional and financial support provided by the parent for the child, and whether the overall conduct of the parent evidences a willingness to take on responsibility and concern for the child's physical and emotional care and well-being.” Id. at 690-91 (quotation omitted). The court may declare the child abandoned if it finds that the parent has made “‘only minimal efforts to support or communicate with the child.’” In re Sheena B., 139 N.H. 179, 181 (1994) (quoting RSA 170-C:5, I)."", 'At the termination hearing, the father’s counsel acknowledged that there were periods during which the father left H.J. in the mother’s care and custody without communication for at least six months. Therefore, the statutory presumption is triggered. On appeal, the father argues he rebutted the presumption, contending that he did not intend to abandon H.J. He asserts that “it was the mother’s refusal to permit or facilitate visits or contact that were the major barrier to a relationship between the father and [H.J.].” He further contends that the trial court erred because it failed to properly consider the “totality of the evidence,” and “events that occurred before, during and after the triggering period.” See In re Jessie E., 137 N.H 336, 342 (1993). We disagree.', '“Strictly speaking, there is no abandonment by a parent where the separation of parent and child is caused solely by the other parent or a third party and because of no fault on the part of the parent whose rights are sought to be terminated.” In re Shannon M., 146 N.H. at 26 (quotation omitted). “‘Fault’ in this context would include the absence of efforts to reinitiate contact on the part of the parent whose rights are sought to be terminated.” Id.', '4 (quotation omitted). Here, however, the trial court explicitly considered whether the mother’s actions were responsible for the lack of contact between the father and H.J., and concluded that “[t]he blame clearly rests with [the father], whose extensive criminal activities and numerous incarcerations have left him unable to be a parent to [H.J.].” The court also observed that even though a 2013 court order instructed the father that he could seek visitation after being released from jail, he “never followed through, despite ample time and opportunity to do so.” The court concluded that the father’s reasons for not seeking visitation — specifically that he had “a lot on [his] plate” and lacked transportation — were not only “a weak excuse, but also a very telling example of his on-again, off-again interest in being a parent to [H.J.].” On this record, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in finding that the father’s contacts with H.J. were “minimal and not substantial,” and that the father, “through his actions, has abandoned [H.J.].”', 'To the extent that the father is also arguing that the trial court erred because it “could not consider his contact or lack of contact during [the] time he was prohibited by restraining order from contacting or supporting [the] child,” we disagree. We have previously held that “a finding of abandonment is not precluded merely because the initial separation of the [parent] and child resulted from a court order and against the will of the [parent].” In re Sheena B., 139 N.H. at 184 (quotation omitted). Although, “[t]hat, of course, is a factor to be considered on the question, . . . subsequent conduct on the part of the parent thereafter may be found to constitute abandonment.” Id. (quotation omitted). Moreover, here the record does not reflect that the restraining order interfered with the father’s ability to contact H.J.; indeed, the last two times that the father visited the child took place in early 2010, during the period covered by the restraining order.', 'We also reject the father’s assertion that the trial court should have given more weight to his attempts to communicate with the child before and after the triggering period. At the termination hearing, the father testified that he e-mailed the mother “over the years . . . at least a dozen times,” and the mother acknowledged that the father has occasionally sent correspondence to H.J. The trial court concluded that these “other contacts . . . are minimal and not substantial.” See In re Jessie E., 137 N.H. at 343 (“A court may declare a child abandoned if it finds objectively that the parent has made only minimal efforts to support or communicate with the child.”); see also In re Sheena B., 139 N.H. at 181 (“The presumption of abandonment will not be rebutted upon a showing of a mere flicker of interest.” (quotation omitted)). The trial court ruled that the mother “has presented proof, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [the father] has abandoned [H.J.].” We will not disturb this factual finding because the father has not demonstrated that it is unsupported by the evidence or plainly erroneous as a matter of law. See In re Shannon M., 146 N.H. at 25.', '5', 'A termination of parental rights “petition may be granted where the court finds that one or more” of the listed statutory grounds exist. RSA 170-C:5 (emphasis added). Therefore, we need not analyze the father’s argument that the trial court erred in determining that the father had not “paid sufficient support” because, even if true, it would provide no basis for reversal. See, e.g., In re G. B., 167 N.H. 99, 105 (2014).', 'Having concluded that a statutory ground exists for termination, we now consider the father’s argument that the trial court erred in ruling that termination was in the best interest of the child. The trial court reasoned that the child is “happy, living with the only family [the child] knows, cared for by the only parent . . . that has ever cared for [H.J.], and [a] stepfather, who now seeks to adopt [H.J.] and give [the child] a greater security in their relationship.” The court also reasoned that “loss of contact with [the] birth father . . . is not a significant loss to this child, since [H.J.] does not even know him.” It concluded that “termination is necessary in order to facilitate an adoption of [H.J.] by [the] stepfather . . . which is desired by the child.”', 'The father argues that the trial court’s best interest ruling is erroneous because the trial court gave “insufficient weight . . . to the fact that the mother admitted an unwillingness to facilitate visits between the father and [H.J.].” Although the father recognizes that the mother had a parenting plan that afforded her the discretion to deny visits, he argues that she “abused that authority by prohibiting contact between the father and [H.J.].” We disagree.', 'We recognize, as we have previously, that “[i]t cannot be assumed that termination is in the best interest of a child where the child’s lack of knowledge of the parent whose rights are being terminated is due, in part, to the other parent’s efforts to thwart attempts made to establish a relationship with the child.” In re Sophia-Marie H., 165 N.H. at 338. However, the facts of this case are distinguishable from Sophia-Marie H. In Sophia-Marie H., a father attempted to maintain a relationship with his child and become a better father while incarcerated by: attempting numerous times to call the child from jail, writing many letters, taking a parenting class, and asking the court to reinstate visitation. Id. at 334, 339. The mother took multiple steps to keep the father from maintaining that relationship by: failing to deliver the father’s letters, not disclosing the father’s identity, changing her phone number so the father could no longer contact them, and precluding visitation by filing a petition seeking termination shortly after the father was released from incarceration. Id. at 334. The GAL recommended that the court deny the termination petition because the father had made efforts to turn his life around, and the GAL believed that the child would miss out on having a relationship with her father if the petition was granted. Id. at 335. The trial court found that the father had not abandoned his child; however, it found that other statutory grounds supported termination. Id. It then concluded that termination was in the child’s best interest because the child “has no bond with or connection to the', '6 father and is apparently unaware of his existence,” and “attempting to reintroduce the father into Sophia-Marie’s life at this point would be difficult and confusing.” Id. at 338 (brackets omitted). We reversed, observing that “the father has endeavored to maintain a relationship with Sophia-Marie, and we cannot ignore the fact that to the extent that Sophia-Marie does not know her father, it is, in part, due to the mother’s decision not to disclose the father’s attempts to contact her or even that he is her father.” Id.', 'Here, the father’s efforts to establish a relationship with his child have been minimal. Unlike in Sophia-Marie H., the father chose not to contact or visit his child for long periods of time, even when he was not incarcerated. When the father petitioned to modify the parenting plan in 2013, the court concluded that he was “not in a position to exercise his parenting time” because he was incarcerated, and instructed the father to contact the visitation center upon his release. The record does not demonstrate that he subsequently contacted the center. Nor has the father ever sought to modify the original parenting plan to lessen the mother’s ability to control visitation.', 'Here, also unlike in Sophia-Marie H., the mother’s “interference” with the father’s ability to build a relationship with H.J. has been minimal. Although she denied the father a single visit in 2011, as was allowed by the parenting plan, the mother has not kept the father’s identity a secret from the child and she has given the child letters sent from the father. Therefore, the record supports the trial court’s conclusion that the lack of a relationship between the father and H.J. is directly attributable to the father’s failure to attempt to establish such a relationship, not the mother’s purported attempt to thwart it.', 'The father also argues that the trial court erred in terminating his parental rights because the “mother admitted she did not do anything to facilitate a relationship between the father and his [child].” He cites In re William A., 142 N.H. 598, 600 (1998), for the proposition that he should be given additional time and opportunity to build a relationship with his child because there is no evidence to show that termination is necessary to ensure H.J. remains in a stable environment. In determining whether he should be given this opportunity, the dominant consideration is the welfare of the child, which prevails over the interests of the parents. In re Adam R., 159 N.H. at 792.', 'In re William A. involved a father’s petition to terminate a mother’s parental rights on the grounds of abandonment and non-support. In re William A., 142 N.H. at 600. William was in the legal custody of his father and his father’s wife, William’s stepmother. Id. The GAL recommended that the court not terminate the mother’s parental rights because the mother had taken steps to improve her ability to have a positive and supportive relationship with William. Id. at 601-02. The mother merely wanted the right to visit her son, not legal or physical custody. Id. at 601. The GAL believed that such visitation', '7 was in William’s best interest; however, the trial court determined that it was in William’s best interest to terminate the mother’s rights. Id. We reversed, observing that the mother had taken steps to “enhance[] her ability to have a positive and supportive relationship with William,” and that there was no evidence to suggest that terminating the mother’s parental rights was necessary to keep the child in a stable environment. Id.; see also In re Sophia- Marie H., 165 N.H. at 339 (concluding that termination was not in the child’s best interest after observing that the father whose rights were at issue was seeking to rebuild his relationship with his child in a manner that would not disrupt the child’s relationship with her caregivers).', 'Here, however, unlike in In re William A., the record does not reflect that the father has taken meaningful steps to build a relationship with H.J. or improve his ability to become a positive and supportive figure in the child’s life. The GAL observes that, although H.J. knows that the father occasionally writes or sends gifts, the child has “no real memory of him or of his direct presence,” “8-years have passed since there have been visits,” and the father has made “no effort . . . to avoid new or ongoing criminal activities.” On this basis, the GAL concluded that termination was in the child’s best interest. The trial court similarly concluded that despite the father’s assertions that he loves his child and wants to be a part of H.J.’s life, “the reality of this situation is that he has led a life over the past eight years full of criminal activity, most of it of a serious nature, which has resulted in numerous incarcerations.” The trial court reasoned that the father “seems to accept little to any responsibility for the effect these actions have had on his ability and availability for parenting,” and observed that “[i]n the meantime, [H.J.] has moved on . . . and has done very well through the efforts of [the child’s] mother and [the] stepfather.”', '“Implicit in [RSA chapter 170-C] is the philosophy that whenever possible family life should be strengthened and preserved.” RSA 170-C:1. However, for the last eight years — because of his own actions and choices — H.J.’s biological father has not been a part of the child’s family life. Instead, as the trial court observed, H.J. is “happy, living with the only family [the child] knows, cared for by the only parent . . . that has ever cared for [H.J.], and [a] stepfather, who now seeks to adopt [H.J.] and give [the child] a greater security in their relationship.” Based upon this evidence, we conclude that the trial court’s ruling that termination is in the child’s best interest is supported by the evidence and not plainly erroneous as a matter of law.

The plaintiff, Monica Anderson, appeals a decision of the Superior Court (O’Neill, J.) dismissing her personal injury action against the defendant, the Estate of Mary D. Wood, as time-barred by RSA 508:4 (2010). We reverse and remand.', 'The following facts are taken from the trial court’s orders; the procedural history is taken from the record before us. On April 5, 2013, the plaintiff was involved in a motor vehicle accident with a vehicle driven by Mary D. Wood (Wood). The plaintiff commenced suit by complaint dated March 25, 2016, alleging that Wood had caused her injury by negligently rear-ending her vehicle. The complaint was mistakenly served on Wood’s daughter, who was also named Mary D. Wood. The daughter moved to dismiss on the grounds that Wood had passed away on January 22, 2015, and the plaintiff had no cause of action against the daughter, who was neither the administrator of Wood’s estate nor had any legal relationship with, or legal duty to, the plaintiff.', 'On April 29, 2016, the plaintiff moved to amend her complaint to substitute the Estate of Mary D. Wood for Mary D. Wood as the defendant. The plaintiff’s motion alleged that she had filed a petition for estate administration for the Estate of Mary D. Wood and that she would serve notice of the action on the estate once the circuit court ruled on that petition.', 'On June 30, 2016, the trial court dismissed the action, ruling, sua sponte, that it did not have subject matter jurisdiction. The court noted the plaintiff’s concession that she had filed the action against the wrong defendant, but concluded that it could not grant her motion to amend because there was “nothing in the record to suggest . . . that an Estate of Mary D. Wood presently exists.” The parties did not dispute that Wood died intestate and no estate had been opened immediately following her death. The court acknowledged the plaintiff’s allegation that she had sought to open an estate, but noted that the plaintiff had not provided “any documentation demonstrating that the [circuit court] ever issued a grant of administration of said estate.” Accordingly, the court dismissed the action, ruling that “there is presently no legal entity that can be properly substituted for the current defendant such that this Court would possess subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to RSA 556:7.” See RSA 556:7 (2007).', 'In August 2016, a certificate of appointment was issued, naming an administrator of the Estate of Mary D. Wood. The plaintiff filed her complaint in the instant action on April 4, 2017. The defendant moved to dismiss, arguing that the statute of limitations had run on the claim.', 'The trial court granted the motion to dismiss. The court ruled that because the action “is one for personal injury, and it was not pending until after [Wood’s] death[,] . . . said action falls within the purview of RSA 556:11, and is thus subject to the limitations of RSA 508:4.” See RSA 508:4; RSA 556:11 (2007). The court further ruled:', 'It is undisputed that the accident giving rise to the present cause', 'of action occurred on April 5, 2013. Therefore, in order to satisfy', 'the three-year statute of limitations period set forth in RSA 508:4,', 'the plaintiff was required to file the present action by April 5, 2016.', 'Because the present action was filed April 4, 2017, nearly one year', 'after the three-year statute of limitations had run, the Court finds', 'that the plaintiff’s claim is time-barred by RSA 508:4.', '2 This appeal followed.', 'We first set forth our standard of review.', 'In reviewing a trial court’s ruling on a motion to dismiss, we', 'generally consider whether the [plaintiff’s] allegations are', 'reasonably susceptible of a construction that would permit', 'recovery. The [defendant], however, moved to dismiss based', 'exclusively upon the statute of limitations. The statute of', 'limitations is an affirmative defense and the [defendant] bear[s] the', 'burden of proving that it applies. State v. Lake Winnipesaukee Resort, 159 N.H. 42, 45 (2009) (citations omitted). As there was no dispute regarding the dates on which the cause of action accrued and on which suit was brought, the trial court’s conclusion that the statute of limitations had run is a ruling of law. Accordingly, our review is de novo. Id.', 'On appeal, the plaintiff argues, among other things, that the trial court misapplied RSA 556:11 in dismissing her complaint. That statute provides: “If an action is not then pending, one may be brought for such cause at any time within 6 years after the death of the deceased party, subject to the provisions of RSA 508.” RSA 556:11. Citing Coffey v. Bresnahan, 127 N.H. 687 (1986), the plaintiff asserts that because her claim was not time-barred by RSA 508:4 at the time of Wood’s death, RSA 556:11 allows her six years from the date of Wood’s death to commence her action. She contends that her suit filed on April 4, 2017 was timely because: (1) at the time of Wood’s death on January 22, 2015, three years had not passed since the accrual of her cause of action on April 5, 2013; and (2) at the time her complaint was filed on April 4, 2017, six years had not passed since Wood’s death on January 22, 2015.', 'The defendant, on the other hand, argues that in Cheever v. Southern New Hampshire Regional Medical Center, 141 N.H. 589 (1997), we interpreted RSA 556:11 “as being subservient to the general statute of limitations contained in RSA 508:4.” The defendant contends that the issue presented here was decided in Cheever, and that the three-year statute of limitations in RSA 508:4 controls. Thus, according to the defendant, the statute expired on April 5, 2016 — three years after the cause of action accrued.', 'The parties’ arguments require us to interpret both our prior case law and the applicable statutory provisions.', 'In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiter of', 'legislative intent as expressed in the words of the statute', 'considered as a whole. We first examine the language of the', 'statute and ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words', '3', 'used. We interpret legislative intent from the statute as written', 'and will not consider what the legislature might have said or add', 'language that the legislature did not see fit to include. Unless we', 'find statutory language to be ambiguous, we will not examine', 'legislative history. Balise v. Balise, 170 N.H. 521, 524 (2017) (citations omitted). We review the trial court’s interpretation of statutes de novo. Id.', 'In Coffey, we applied a prior version of RSA 556:11, which provided: “If an action is not then pending, and has not already become barred by the statute of limitations, one may be brought for such cause at any time within two years after the death of the deceased party, and not afterwards.” RSA 556:11 (1974) (amended 1983); see Coffey, 127 N.H. at 690. In light of our holding in Gould v. Concord Hospital, 126 N.H. 405 (1985), that “the classification created by RSA 556:11 violated the equal protection clause of the New Hampshire Constitution,” we did not apply the statute as written. Coffey, 127 N.H. at 690. Instead, we “conclude[d] that the statute [was] constitutional when a six-year limitations period is substituted for the unconstitutional two- year limitation.” Id. Under that construction, the plaintiff’s action, commenced in 1984 against a defendant who had died in 1979, “was timely under the six-year limitations period.” Id. at 691.', 'That conclusion, we noted, “d[id] not end the matter, . . . for there is an additional requirement in RSA 556:11; that is, the suit must not have already become barred by the statute of limitations in RSA 508:4.” Id. at 691-92. On that issue, we found our decision in Perutsakos v. Tarmey, 107 N.H. 51 (1966), controlling. Coffey, 127 N.H. at 692. In that case, we held:', 'We think that the words of [RSA 556:11], “has not already become', 'barred” mean an action which has not become barred at the time', 'of the death of the deceased party.', 'In other words section 11 permits suits within a designated', 'period after the decedent’s death on all claims not already barred', 'at the time of such death by the general statute of limitations. Perutsakos, 107 N.H. at 53 (quoting RSA 556:11) (citation omitted). The acts of alleged medical malpractice giving rise to the suit in Coffey had occurred in 1978. Coffey, 127 N.H. at 689. Thus, given our holding in Perutsakos, we concluded that the suit in Coffey “was clearly not barred at the time of [the defendant’s] death and, thus, the second requirement of RSA 556:11 has been satisfied.” Id. at 692.', 'In 1983, the legislature amended RSA 556:11 to its present form. The plaintiff implicitly contends that this amendment did not abrogate our', '4 decisions in Coffey and Perutsakos, as she asserts that she satisfied RSA 556:11’s requirement that her claim must not have been barred by RSA 508:4 at the time of Wood’s death. We agree.', 'We have long held that when the legislature amends a statute, it “is presumed to [be] cognizant of the interpretation put upon the statute by the court.” Waterman v. Lebanon, 78 N.H. 23, 24 (1915). It is further presumed “to have adopted that construction, in the absence of any change in the phraseology used or other competent evidence of a different purpose.” Id. On the other hand, we have also noted that “any material change in the language of” a statute by amendment is “[o]rdinarily . . . presumed to indicate a change in legal rights.” Appeal of Manchester Transit Auth., 146 N.H. 454, 458 (2001) (quotations omitted).', 'In Petition of CIGNA Healthcare, 146 N.H. 683 (2001), we recognized a third possibility: a substantial revision to a statute that, nevertheless, conforms to pre-existing statutory construction. See Petition of CIGNA Healthcare, 146 N.H. at 690. There, we determined that amendments that were admittedly intended to expand probate court jurisdiction nevertheless did not extend them to the point urged by the respondent because, given the presumption that the legislature knew of our previous narrow construction of statutes involving probate court jurisdiction, it would not “have left [its] intention to be inferred from a single doubtful expression but would have conferred the authority in plain and explicit terms.” Id. at 690 (quotation and ellipsis omitted). Courts in other jurisdictions have applied similar reasoning. See, e.g., Havens v. Portfolio Inv. Exchange Inc., 983 F. Supp. 2d 1007, 1011 (N.D. Ind. 2013) (noting that “when a legislature is aware that a statute is being interpreted in a particular way and [amends it in a way that] fails to expressly reject that construction, it has effectively ‘acquiesced’ to it”); Pudmaroff v. Allen, 951 P.2d 335, 337 (Wash. Ct. App. 1998) (“The Legislature is presumed to be familiar with judicial interpretations of statutes” and “[u]nless there is an indication the Legislature intended to overrule a particular interpretation, amendments are presumed to be consistent with previous interpretations.”).', 'Here, nothing in the plain language of RSA 556:11, as amended, clearly evinces an intent to abrogate the holdings of Coffey and Perutsakos. The pertinent language was changed from “has not already become barred by the statute of limitations,” RSA 556:11 (1974) (amended 1983), to “subject to the provisions of RSA 508,” RSA 556:11. We interpret this amended language as consistent with the holdings of Coffey and Perutsakos. Accordingly, we conclude that the 1983 amendment to RSA 556:11 was not intended to, and did not, abrogate our interpretation of that statute in Coffey and Perutsakos. See, e.g., Havens, 983 F. Supp. 2d at 1011; Pudmaroff, 951 P.2d at 337. We also agree with the plaintiff that she satisfied the requirement that, at the time of Wood’s death, her claim was not barred by RSA 508:4 — Wood died on', '5 January 22, 2015, less than three years from the accrual of the plaintiff’s cause of action on April 5, 2013.', 'We now must determine whether the plaintiff’s claim was brought within the applicable limitations period. We first note two events subsequent to the amendment of RSA 556:11 that impact that determination. First, in 1986, RSA 508:4 was amended to, among other things, change the six-year limitations period to three years. See Laws 1986, 227:12. Subsequently, we decided Cheever, the case relied upon by the defendant. In Cheever, the plaintiff commenced a wrongful death action against a doctor and a hospital on March 31, 1995, alleging negligence in the care given to the decedent on April 7, 1989, the date he died. Cheever, 141 N.H. at 590. The plaintiff appealed the dismissal of the suit as time-barred, arguing that RSA 556:11 provided a six- year statute of limitations. Id. The defendants, on the other hand, “read the ‘subject to the provisions of RSA 508’ language to mandate a three-year limit.” Id. (quoting RSA 556:11). We construed the statute according to its plain language:', 'The six-year period referenced in RSA 556:11 is, by the express', 'terms of the statute, “subject to the provisions of RSA 508.” . . .', 'The plain meaning of the phrase “subject to” indicates that the six-', 'year period set forth in the statute is subservient to or governed by', 'the provisions of RSA chapter 508. Thus, because we construe', 'statutes to effectuate their evident purpose, the applicable statute', 'of limitations period in this instance must be three years. Id. at 591 (quoting RSA 556:11) (citations omitted). We therefore affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiff’s action. Id. at 592.', 'In light of Cheever, we cannot agree with the plaintiff’s assertion that the applicable limitations period is six years: Cheever clearly holds that it is three years. Id. at 591. Neither party has asked us to overrule Cheever, and, in any event, the outcome in this case would be the same whether a six-year or three- year period applied. Accordingly, we follow Cheever’s three-year holding. We disagree, however, with the defendant’s assertion that Cheever compels the conclusion that the three-year period expired on April 5, 2016. In Cheever, it was not necessary to decide whether the limitations period started on the date of death or, as the defendant contends, on the date the cause of action accrued, because both dates were the same. See id. at 590. We now hold that the period starts on the date of death, as to hold otherwise would impermissibly write the phrase “after the death of the deceased party,” RSA 556:11, out of the statute. See Hodges v. Johnson, 170 N.H. 470, 484 (2017) (noting that “when construing a statute, we must give effect to all words in the statute and presume that the legislature did not enact superfluous or redundant words” (quotation and brackets omitted)). Thus, a claim will be timed-barred by RSA 556:11 unless brought within three years after the', '6 decedent’s death. We note that this construction alleviates the defendant’s concern that “the plaintiff’s construction of the applicable statutes relating to claims against estates would result in an unlimited horizon for a plaintiff to bring a claim in circumstances where an estate had not been established.”', 'Because the plaintiff’s claim was not time-barred by RSA 508:4 at the time of Wood’s death and the instant suit was brought within three years of Wood’s death, the action is timely. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of the defendant’s motion to dismiss and remand for further proceedings. In light of our holding on this issue, we need not address the remaining issues on appeal.', 'Reversed and remanded.', 'LYNN, C.J., and BASSETT, HANTZ MARCONI, and DONOVAN, JJ., concurred.', '7 ']"
2018081keenan.pdf,2017-0692,THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE v. JEFFREY R. KEENAN,Non-criminal,"['Gordon J. MacDonald, attorney general (Stephen D. Fuller, senior assistant attorney general, on the memorandum of law, and Elizabeth C. Woodcock, assistant attorney general, orally), for the State.', 'Randall Baldwin Clark, of Hollis, on the brief and orally, for the defendant.', 'DONOVAN, J. The defendant, Jeffrey R. Keenan, appeals his conviction in the Circuit Court (Stephen, J.) for driving a motor vehicle while his vehicle registration privileges were suspended, in violation of RSA 261:178 (2014). Because the defendant’s conviction was based upon his lawful operation of a vehicle owned and registered to his son, we reverse.', 'The following facts have been gleaned from the record and are not disputed. On January 25, 2017, the New Hampshire Department of Safety (DOS) suspended the defendant’s operating privileges.1 On January 31, DOS suspended the defendant’s registration due to a lack of insurance. Between these two dates, the defendant purchased an operator insurance policy and presented evidence of this coverage by way of an “SR-22” certificate to DOS.2 As a result, DOS restored the defendant’s operating privileges. The notice DOS issued to the defendant explicitly stated that “All license/operating privileges are hereby restored. Your registration remains suspended.” (Capitalization omitted.)', 'On August 31, the defendant pulled out of his driveway and was promptly stopped by a Salem police officer who observed that the vehicle driven by the defendant was uninspected. During the stop, the officer ran a computer check on the defendant’s license and learned that the defendant’s registration was suspended. The officer also checked the registration number of the vehicle and learned that the vehicle was registered to Jake Keenan, who was subsequently identified as the defendant’s son. Nonetheless, the officer issued a summons to the defendant charging him with operating a vehicle while his registration privileges were suspended in violation of RSA 261:178.', 'At trial, the parties did not dispute the relevant facts — (1) the defendant’s operating privileges were restored and in good standing on the date of the motor vehicle stop; (2) at that time, the defendant’s registration remained suspended; and (3) the defendant was operating a vehicle, owned and properly registered in his son’s name. Thus, the only dispute at trial was whether the defendant’s act of driving a vehicle lawfully registered to another person while his registration was suspended constituted a violation of RSA 261:178.', 'In their arguments at trial, the parties focused on the last clause of RSA 261:178, which states: “any person who shall drive or permit to be driven a vehicle owned or controlled by him upon any way after his registration has been suspended or revoked shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.” The State argued that the statute prohibits any person with a suspended registration from driving any vehicle, regardless of whether the vehicle is registered to another person, in part, because the word “controlled” as it appears in the statute is synonymous with “driven.” The defendant countered that “controlled” does not mean “driven” but instead refers to circumstances where a person treats a vehicle as his own but does not legally own it. Based on this meaning of “controlled,” the defendant argued that the State failed to prove that he owned or controlled the vehicle he was driving when the officer stopped him. 1 The basis for the suspension of the defendant’s operating privileges is not disclosed by the record and, at any rate, is not relevant to this appeal. 2 An SR-22 insurance certificate is a “uniform document filed by an insurance company pursuant to RSA 264:21 and RSA 259:9 that certifies that the policyholder is insured for New Hampshire’s minimum liability requirements under RSA 264.” N.H. Admin. R., Saf-C 202.01(ah).', '2', 'The trial court found that the defendant “drove a vehicle controlled by him, on a way, after his registration was suspended” and entered a finding of guilty. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court reviewed the defendant’s registration suspension and determined that the suspension was tied to him personally rather than to a specific vehicle. Based on this determination, the trial court concluded that the “legislative intent” was to prohibit him from “driving any vehicle until he gets that straightened out.” The defendant appeals his conviction arguing solely that the trial court rested its decision upon an erroneous interpretation of RSA 261:178.', ""Resolving the purely legal issue now before us requires that we engage in statutory interpretation. The interpretation of a statute presents a question of law, which we review de novo. STIHL, Inc. v. State of N.H., 168 N.H. 332, 334 (2015). In matters of statutory interpretation, we are the final arbiters of the legislature's intent as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. Id. When construing its meaning, we first examine the language found in the statute, and where possible, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meanings to the words used. Id. When statutory language is ambiguous, however, we will consider legislative history and examine the statute’s overall objective and presume that the legislature would not pass an act that would lead to an absurd or illogical result. Id. at 334-35. We interpret statutory provisions in the context of the overall statutory scheme, id. at 335, and construe all parts of a statute together to effectuate its overall purpose and avoid absurd or unjust results. State v. Fogg, 170 N.H. 234, 236 (2017). We apply the same principles of construction when interpreting administrative rules. State v. Villeneuve, 160 N.H. 342, 347 (2010)."", 'On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erroneously treated “controlled” as a synonym for the term “drive,” which constitutes an illogical interpretation of the statute. The State argues, as it did to the trial court, that the statute prohibits any person with a suspended registration from driving any vehicle. Although the parties and the trial court attempted to determine the meaning of RSA 261:178 by focusing their inquiry on the last clause of the statute, we construe all parts of the statute together to effectuate its overall purpose, even if the parties do not address it. See Fogg, 170 N.H. at 236. Accordingly, we consider all of the relevant language set forth in RSA 261:178, which states:', 'Suspension of Registration of Vehicle. The director, upon', 'evidence satisfactory to him that the owner of a vehicle is', 'permitting or has permitted the same to be driven in violation of', 'any of the provisions of this title . . . may suspend the registration', 'of such vehicle until [the director] is satisfied that the offense will', 'not be repeated or the owner has been acquitted, and any person', 'who shall drive or permit to be driven a vehicle owned or controlled', '3', 'by him upon any way after his registration has been suspended or', 'revoked shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. The statute is not a model of clarity, but its terms are susceptible to a plain and unambiguous interpretation when we consider the overall purpose of the statutory scheme and construe all parts of the statute together. See Fogg, 170 N.H. at 236.', 'While the parties focus on the final clause of RSA 261:178, the statute specifically references the suspension of “the registration of such vehicle” in its immediately preceding language. RSA 261:178 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the final clause, which criminalizes the act of driving or permitting to be driven “a vehicle owned or controlled by [a person whose registration has been suspended],” RSA 261:178, logically applies only to the vehicle registrations that have been suspended, and not to the driver. To equate the term “control” with the term “drive,” as the State did in its argument to the trial court, would prohibit an individual from driving a vehicle that is properly registered and insured, regardless of whether the vehicle is owned by that individual. We find the interpretation proffered by the State to be illogical.', 'The State’s interpretation of RSA 261:178 would prohibit an individual whose registration has been suspended from driving a vehicle owned, properly registered, and insured by his employer. The State’s interpretation would also prohibit this same individual from renting and operating a vehicle owned, properly registered, and insured by a car rental agency. Indeed, this interpretation equates the suspension of an individual’s registration privileges with a suspension of his or her driving privileges, despite the fact that these two privileges are distinct and are governed by separate statutes. See RSA 263:53 to :64-b (2014 & Supp. 2017) (statutes governing driver’s licenses suspensions and revocations). We do not find that these results are either logical or just.', 'More significantly, equating the term “controlled” with the terms “drive” or “own” fails to recognize that the legislature specifically sought to distinguish these terms as they apply to the prohibition the statute criminalizes. Because we interpret legislative intent from the statute as written, we will not consider what the legislature might have said, add language that the legislature did not include, or disregard or conflate language that the legislature saw fit to include. See N.C. v. N.H. Bd. of Psychologists, 169 N.H. 361, 366 (2016) (“We also presume that the legislature does not waste words or enact redundant provisions and, whenever possible, we give effect to every word of a statute.”). Thus, the term “controlled” in RSA 261:178 refers to conduct separate and distinct from either the ownership or the operation of a vehicle. But, the term “control” is not defined by RSA chapter 261 or anywhere else in the motor vehicle code.', '4', 'When a term is not defined in a statute, we look to its common usage using the dictionary for guidance. See K.L.N. Construction Co. v. Town of Pelham, 167 N.H. 180, 185 (2014). Webster’s Third New International Dictionary defines “control,” in relevant part, as “power or authority to guide or manage; directing or restraining domination.” Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 496 (unabridged ed. 2002). Applying this approved and common usage of the term “control” to RSA 261:178 establishes that an individual can control a motor vehicle, without operating or owning it, by exercising power and authority over it by managing or directing its use. For example, an individual who leases or purchases a vehicle and registers it to a third party, yet still exercises authority over it by determining or managing its use, would “control” a motor vehicle as that term is used in RSA 261:178. Given the overall purpose of this statute, the legislature intended to prohibit any person from driving or permitting to be driven “a vehicle owned or controlled by him” which has a suspended registration. This interpretation is consistent with the legislature’s reference to “such vehicle” within RSA 261:178 and the statute’s overall purpose without producing the unjust results we have previously noted.', 'The State argues, however, that the statute’s general purposes should be examined in conjunction with RSA chapter 264 (2014 & Supp. 2017), the Accidents and Financial Responsibility Act, which is “intended to induce, but not to compel, motor vehicle operators to provide security to persons injured by their negligence.” Progressive N. Ins. Co. v. Enterprise Rent-A-Car Co., 149 N.H. 489, 492 (2003) (quotation omitted). New Hampshire does not require that a motor vehicle be insured prior to the operation of the vehicle. Coltey v. N.E. Telephone, 135 N.H. 223, 224 (1991). Yet, in certain circumstances enumerated in RSA 264:2 and :3 (2014), proof of financial responsibility may be required when, for example, a driver has been convicted of certain traffic- related offenses or has caused an accident.', 'Proof of financial responsibility, and the restoration of a driver’s operation and registration privileges, can be secured by the purchase of “owner” or “non-owner” insurance which is evinced by the insurance company’s issuance of an SR-22 certificate establishing that the policyholder is insured for New Hampshire’s minimum liability requirements. See RSA 264:21 (2014); RSA 259:9 (2014); N.H. Admin. R., Saf-C 207.06. Restoration of a driver’s operating or registration privileges “shall be based on the type of filing made,” such that the purchase of non-owner’s coverage can restore a driver’s operating privileges, but not the driver’s registration privileges. N.H. Admin. R., Saf-C 207.08. The State maintains that permitting so-called “risky drivers,” who have had their registration privileges suspended, to drive after purchasing non-owner insurance would effectively circumvent the registration requirement because these drivers could lawfully operate any vehicle he or she did not own or control. We disagree.', '5', 'DOS regulations explicitly permit New Hampshire drivers to purchase either owner or non-owner insurance whenever proof of financial responsibility is required. See N.H. Admin. R., Saf-C 207.06. As in this case, an individual can have his or her operating privileges restored once that individual produces proof of financial responsibility to operate a vehicle. Id. The applicable regulations further provide that “where non-owner’s coverage is filed, registration of a vehicle shall not be permitted and active registration shall be suspended until evidence of owner coverage on any such vehicle is filed with the director.” N.H. Admin. R., Saf-C 207.08 (emphasis added).3 As with RSA 261:178, this regulation specifies that evidence of insurance coverage on a specific vehicle is required before an individual’s registration can be restored. Thus, while an individual with a suspended registration cannot register any vehicle upon securing non-owner coverage, nothing in either RSA chapter 264 or DOS regulations suggests or implies that a suspended registration bars an individual from restoring his or her operating privileges or thereafter employing them.', 'RSA chapter 264 and DOS regulations establish an overall objective of requiring high-risk drivers to provide security for their operation of a motor vehicle, as well as a policy of inducing motor vehicle owners to provide security for the operation of their vehicles when the owner has permitted or is permitting that vehicle “to be driven in violation of any provision of [the motor vehicle code].” RSA 261:178. These purposes are entirely consistent with our interpretation of RSA 261:178 as prohibiting the operation of a vehicle which has a suspended registration. The legislature did not intend to limit the statute’s reach to the Accidents and Financial Responsibility Act, because RSA 261:178 authorizes the director to suspend the registration of a vehicle when its owner has permitted it to be driven “in violation of any provision of this title.” RSA 261:178 (emphasis added).', 'In fact, there may be circumstances in which the director suspends the registration of fewer than all vehicles owned or controlled by a person. For example, if a motor vehicle has not been properly inspected, the director may suspend the registration of that vehicle, see RSA 266:5 (2014), but may not suspend the registration of other vehicles owned by that person as a consequence of the initial registration suspension. Under these circumstances, RSA 261:178 would not prohibit the person, assuming he or she holds a valid driver’s license, from operating the properly registered vehicle owned or controlled by him or her. The legislature did not expand the statute’s application to that portion of the motor vehicle code regulating operating privileges, however, because the motor vehicle code authorizes the director to 3 We note that, by virtue of New Hampshire Administrative Rule Saf-C 207.08, the defendant here could not have registered another vehicle in his name or operated another vehicle that he owned or controlled because all active registrations would have been suspended until he filed an SR-22 certificate establishing his purchase of owner insurance.', '6 suspend an individual’s operating privileges for specifically enumerated violations and conduct. See RSA 263:56 (2014). In light of these separate statutory provisions governing two distinct privileges, we find it unreasonable to interpret this statutory scheme as automatically imposing a penalty on one privilege by virtue of the imposition of a suspension as to the other.', 'For the foregoing reasons, we find that the trial court erred by interpreting RSA 261:178 and the suspension of the defendant’s registration as barring the defendant’s operating privileges.', 'Reversed.', 'LYNN, C.J., and HICKS, BASSETT, and HANTZ MARCONI, JJ., concurred.', '7 ']"

Richardson on the brief), for the petitioner.', 'Gordon J. MacDonald, attorney general (Laura E. B. Lombardi, senior assistant attorney general, on the brief), for the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission.', 'HICKS, J. The petitioner, Lakes Region Water Company, Inc. (Lakes Region), appeals an order of the New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (Commission) requiring Lakes Region to refund a second base charge it had imposed on its customer, Robert Mykytiuk, and prohibiting it from “imposing such charges unless and until they are included in the company’s tariff.” We affirm.', 'The following facts are taken from the Commission’s orders or recount testimony given at the hearing on the merits. In March 2016, Lakes Region learned that Mykytiuk had constructed an additional structure on his property. To supply the new structure with water, Mykytiuk had tapped into his primary residence’s service connection. Shortly after learning of the new construction, Lakes Region sent Mykytiuk an application for new service for the additional structure and requested to inspect the water service connection.', 'Lakes Region sent an inspector to Mykytiuk’s property in May. Despite concluding that the new structure required a separate service connection, Lakes Region chose not to install one at that time. Rather, Lakes Region began billing Mykytiuk for an additional “base charge,” which refers to the “[m]inimum charge per customer per quarter” scheduled in Lakes Region’s tariff. Mykytiuk complained to the Commission, asserting that he was not required to have a second service connection. The Commission treated the matter as a formal complaint and held a hearing on the merits.', 'At the hearing, Mykytiuk argued that Lakes Region could not charge him a separate base charge or require him to install a separate meter for the additional structure because neither was provided for in Lakes Region’s tariff. He testified that his additional structure is a “garage[] with bunkhouse” and that, according to his definition, a bunkhouse “is subordinate to a primary residence, [and] . . . contain[s] sleeping facilities, and may contain sanitary facilities, but does not contain cooking facilities.” He further testified that he rents out his primary residence by the week as a vacation rental, during which times he stays in the bunkhouse.', 'Lakes Region’s utility manager testified that she considered Mykytiuk’s service to his additional structure to be a “tandem connection” — which she, in turn, understood to mean a connection from the service line to a second place of consumption after the meter — prohibited by New Hampshire Administrative Rules, Puc 606.04(h). According to her testimony, as summarized in the Commission’s order, Lakes Region’s tariff contains “no specific working definition about what tandem service is.” Furthermore, notwithstanding the conclusion that Mykytiuk had installed a prohibited tandem service, Lakes Region “decided not to disconnect [him] in April 2016 after being satisfied that there were no health concerns and that [he] had not bypassed recording water usage on the meter. Moreover, Lakes Region did not want to cause an undue hardship on [him].”', 'Following the hearing, the Commission issued its order, finding that Lakes Region had no basis under its current tariff to impose the second base charge on Mykytiuk. It ordered Lakes Region to refund those charges and further ordered that “Lakes Region shall not impose a second base charge on [Mykytiuk’s] property . . . , until such time as Lakes Region receives approval to impose a second charge under the terms of a properly filed tariff amendment.” Lakes Region now appeals, arguing that the Commission erred in failing to: (1) apply both RSA 378:1 (2009) and its own rules; (2) explain its rules on rehearing; and (3) reconsider a new issue determined in its order.', '2', 'We first set forth our standard of review. “A party seeking to set aside an order of the [Commission] has the burden of demonstrating that the order is contrary to law or, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, is unjust or unreasonable.” Appeal of Northern New England Tele. Operations, LLC, 165 N.H. 267, 270 (2013); see RSA 541:13 (2007). The Commission’s findings of fact “are presumed prima facie lawful and reasonable.” Northern New England Tele., 165 N.H. at 270; see RSA 541:13. We give the Commission’s “policy choices considerable deference,” but review its statutory interpretations de novo. Northern New England Tele., 165 N.H. at 271 (quotation omitted).', 'Lakes Region first challenges the Commission’s determination that it could not charge an additional base charge for the service to Mykytiuk’s garage and bunkhouse. Lakes Region concedes that its tariff “does not contain an express provision authorizing a second base charge for an additional residence.” Nevertheless, it attempts to justify Mykytiuk’s second base charge through the interplay of several statutes and regulations. For ease of reference, we set forth the relevant provisions here. First, RSA 378:1 provides, in pertinent part:', 'Every public utility shall file with the [Commission], and', 'shall print and keep open to public inspection, schedules showing', 'the rates, fares, charges and prices for any service rendered or to', 'be rendered in accordance with the rules adopted by the', 'commission pursuant to RSA 541-A . . . . RSA 378:1. Next, New Hampshire Administrative Rules, Puc 606.04 provides, in part, that “[n]o tandem services shall be permitted.” N.H. Admin R., Puc 606.04(j). Finally, RSA 378:14 provides:', 'No public utility shall grant any free service, nor charge or', 'receive a greater or lesser or different compensation for any service', 'rendered to any person, firm or corporation than the compensation', 'fixed for such service by the schedules on file with the commission', 'and in effect at the time such service is rendered. RSA 378:14 (2009).', 'Lakes Region’s argument begins with the assertion that its tariff, which applies to “all water service in the franchise area,” specifically applies to water service “‘rendered in accordance with the rules adopted by the commission.’” (Quoting RSA 378:1.) Lakes Region then points out that the Commission’s rules specifically prohibit tandem services, N.H. Admin R., Puc 606.04(j)(2), which, according to Lakes Region, explains why its tariff does not include a rate for such service. Nevertheless, Lakes Region argues, it must charge Mykytiuk a second service charge because his tandem service “carries a', '3 significantly greater cost” than would be accounted for in the tariff’s metered rate for actual water usage.', 'Specifically, Lakes Region cites the hearing testimony of the Director of the Commission’s Gas and Water Division, Mark A. Naylor, who opined that “adding a second unit to an existing service . . . creates demand cost.” Naylor explained that Lakes Region, like all utilities, is required “to be able to provide [its] peak demand, plus a safety factor over that, on a 365 day basis,” and, thus, must have “facilities to meet its peak demand[].” According to Naylor:', 'When you add additional places of consumption, when you', 'add additional customers, which is what [Mykytiuk’s situation] is,', 'it adds to the peak demand. And that may not have an out-of-', 'pocket cost today or tomorrow, [but] it will result in cost that the', 'Company will have to face.', 'Lakes Region elaborates on the foregoing concepts in explaining the importance of the fixed customer charge or base charge in its scheduled rates:', 'Lakes Region’s systems, being located in New Hampshire’s', 'Lakes and White Mountain Regions, serve[] primarily seasonal', 'customers who own second homes that may be unoccupied for', 'prolonged periods. During off-peak seasons, use is low. However,', 'during peak holiday periods such as during weekends in July and', 'August, demand is high which requires larger storage tanks, larger', 'pipe diameters, and larger treatment and production (wells and', 'pumps) facilities. As a result, Lakes Region’s rates are designed to', 'recover the fixed capital costs to make service available during', 'periods of peak demand. Its base per customer charge is high', 'while its metered consumption is correspondingly low. . . . The', 'addition of a summer vacation rental . . . places significant', 'additional peak demand. Lakes Region does not recover the costs', 'to serve this additional peak demand in the absence of an', 'additional fixed customer charge.', 'Based upon all of the foregoing assertions, Lakes Region concludes that, in Mykytiuk’s case, “allowing a second dwelling without a second customer charge would result in free or discounted service in violation of law.” See RSA 378:14. More specifically, Lakes Region contends that “the Commission allowed [Mykytiuk] to maintain a second use in violation of Rule . . . 606.04 while paying rates that are less than required by RSA 378:1.” It asserts that “[t]he Commission . . . fail[ed] to address the central issue in the proceeding” by failing to apply RSA 378:1 and its own rules as outlined above. We conclude, however, that the statutes and administrative rules at issue do not support Lakes Region’s construction of them.', '4', 'First, we note that the Commission made no finding as to whether the service to Mykytiuk’s bunkhouse was or was not a tandem connection prohibited by Rule 606.04(j). The lack of such a finding, however, is immaterial to the disposition of this appeal, as we hold that, in any event, RSA 378:14 does not authorize the sort of self-help employed by Lakes Region here. To construe the statute as Lakes Region urges would render it internally inconsistent.', 'No public utility shall grant any free service, nor charge or', 'receive a greater or lesser or different compensation for any service', 'rendered to any person, firm or corporation than the compensation', 'fixed for such service by the schedules on file with the commission', 'and in effect at the time such service is rendered. RSA 378:14 (emphases added). Here, in an ostensible attempt to avoid providing free or discounted service, Lakes Region charged a fee different from the rates scheduled in its tariff. Thus, rather than being authorized by RSA 378:14, the second base charge billed to Mykytiuk actually violates it. If, as Lakes Region contends, “allowing a second dwelling without a second customer charge would result in free or discounted service in violation of law,” then its remedy would be, as the Commission suggested, to “propose revisions to its tariff to address [such] situations.”', 'Our cases make clear that the Commission is responsible for ensuring that a utility’s rates are not discriminatory, preferential, or unfair. See Granite State Alarm Inc. & a. v. New England Tel. & Tel., 111 N.H. 235, 237 (1971) (“It is the duty of the commission . . . to see that under the tariff proposed by the company no class of service is discriminated against or receives preferential treatment.”); Chicopee Mfg. Co. v. Company, 98 N.H. 5, 19 (1953) (“The complex and difficult task of distributing a rate increase among the ratepayers so as to eliminate discriminations and unfairness has been entrusted to the commission.”). That responsibility is discharged in the ratemaking process. See Company v. State, 95 N.H. 353, 364 (1949) (“[A]n important step in rate making is ‘the adjustment of a rate schedule conforming to [the general revenue] level so as to eliminate discriminations and unfairness from its details.’” (quoting Power Comm’n v. Pipeline Co., 315 U.S. 575, 584 (1942))); see also Granite State Alarm, 111 N.H. at 237; Chicopee Mfg. Co., 98 N.H. at 19. By negative implication, and in accordance with statutory provisions prohibiting utilities from imposing charges that deviate from the tariffed rates, see RSA 378:14, Lakes Region is not empowered to adjust its charges outside its tariffed rates unilaterally in order to ensure that Mykytiuk pays his fair share of Lakes Region’s capacity costs.', 'Lakes Region, nevertheless, argues that its tariff “assumes and the Commission’s rules require that separate and distinct uses or buildings have separate service lines (and meters) ‘except in unusual situations such as', '5 service to an apartment or to a condominium.’” (Quoting N.H. Admin. R., Puc 606.04(g)). The rule Lakes Region quotes, however, does not explicitly require separate service lines for separate and distinct uses or structures, but, rather, provides that “[c]urb stops shall be placed at the customer’s property line except in unusual situations such as service to an apartment or to a condominium.” N.H. Admin. R., Puc 606.04(g); see N.H. Admin. R., Env-Dw 504.02(c) (defining “[c]urb stop” to mean “the valve between the water distribution system and the service customer’s premises which controls the flow of water to the premises”).', 'Indeed, Rule 606.04(g)’s reference to “the customer’s property line” highlights the problem Naylor noted at the hearing. N.H. Admin. R., Puc 606.04(g) (emphasis added). As the Commission summarized his testimony, Naylor “agreed with the suggestion that ‘customer’ and ‘dwelling unit’ should be treated synonymously.” Lakes Region’s tariff, however, does not define the term “customer” despite describing its base charge as a “[m]inimum charge per customer per quarter.” The Commission’s regulations define “[c]ustomer” to mean “any person, firm, corporation, cooperative marketing association, utility or governmental unit or subdivision of a municipality or of the state or nation supplied with water service by a utility.” N.H. Admin R., Puc 602.05 (emphasis added); see also N.H. Admin R., Puc 602.18 (defining ""[w]ater service"" to “mean[] the furnishing of water to a customer in this state by a utility”).', 'The Commission argues that “[t]he ‘customer’ in this case is Mr. Mykytiuk, not the physical structures on his property. Connecting his bunkhouse to the water line in his home, after the meter, did not service a second customer.” We agree. Because Mykytiuk is only one person, Lakes Region’s tariff, as now written, subjects him to only one base charge. Accordingly, the Commission’s order properly noted that Lakes Region’s remedy would lie in a tariff amendment. The Commission recounted Naylor’s testimony on this point: “To rectify the situation, Mr. Naylor suggested that what is needed is a clear definition of what a customer is and what a place of consumption is, and a clear definition of how service is formally requested. He thinks a tariff change is in order to make it clearer.” (Citation omitted.)', 'Lakes Region further contends that the Commission erred in determining that Mykytiuk’s “burden of proof was only to prove that Lakes Region’s decision to impose a second customer charge on him is not authorized under its current tariff.” (Quotation omitted.) Lakes Region argues that Mykytiuk’s “burden of proof was to demonstrate that the rate charged by Lakes Region was unjust [or] unreasonable or in violation of the law.” (Quotation omitted.) It then asserts that “[t]he Commission did not find that Lakes Region’s charges were unjust or unreasonable or that Lakes Region had violated any law.” We disagree.', '6', 'In denying Lakes Region’s motion for rehearing, the Commission ruled that “[b]ecause a second base charge is not in Lakes Region’s tariff, the imposition of one on Mr. Mykytiuk is ‘in violation of [a] provision of law’ under RSA 378:7.” (Quoting RSA 378:7.) Our law on this issue is well settled:', '[T]he vehicles by which utility rates are set, the tariffs or rate', 'schedules required to be filed with the [Commission], do not simply', 'define the terms of the contractual relationship between a utility', 'and its customers. They have the force and effect of law and bind', 'both the utility and its customers. As such, the customers of a', 'utility have a right to rely on the rates which are in effect at the', 'time that they consume the services provided by the utility, at least', 'until such time as the utility applies for a change. Appeal of Pennichuck Water Works, 120 N.H. 562, 566 (1980) (citations omitted). Accordingly, the Commission properly ruled that Lakes Region’s deviation from its tariffed rate was a violation of law and that Mykytiuk had met his burden.', 'Lakes Region next argues that the Commission erred “in denying Lakes Region’s motion for rehearing because it failed to explain how its rules applied or did not apply under RSA 378:1.” In essence, Lakes Region asserts that the Commission failed to address its argument that its “approved rates for water service under RSA 378:1 do not allow it to provide service to multiple dwellings” except in “unusual” cases such as apartments or condominiums “where it is understood, if not stated, that separate charges apply for each use.” (Quotation omitted.) Relying upon Appeal of City of Nashua, 138 N.H. 261, 263-64 (1994), Lakes Region argues:', 'New Hampshire law is clear that when the Commission', 'structures its decision solely by summarizing evidence presented', 'by the contending parties and describing the parties’ opposing', 'views, without making specific factual findings in support of its', 'own conclusions, it fails to meet its statutory obligation to make a', 'concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting', 'its findings and its order will therefore be vacated and remanded', 'for a new hearing. (Quotations, brackets, and ellipses omitted.)', 'We disagree that the Commission’s decision is contrary to the above- stated proposition of law. The Commission’s essential finding of fact — not disputed by Lakes Region — was that “Lakes Region’s tariff does not specifically address the situation presented here . . . . The tariff refers to ‘customer(s)’ throughout, but there is nothing in the tariff about when a second meter or separate service must be installed, or what is or is not a tandem', '7 service as prohibited by our rules under [Rule] 606.04(j).” This finding was, as we concluded above, sufficient to support the Commission’s legal ruling that, “[u]nder the terms of its present tariff, there is no basis for Lakes Region to require Mr. Mykytiuk to pay a second base charge every month for his newly constructed unit.” Lakes Region cites no authority for the proposition that an order of the Commission providing both factual findings and legal reasoning sufficient to support its rulings must, nevertheless, be vacated because it fails to explain why the Commission found the non-prevailing party’s contrary arguments unpersuasive.', 'Finally, Lakes Region argues that the Commission erred by failing to reconsider a new issue decided in its order. Specifically, Lakes Region argues that “[i]n the last sentence of [its order], the Commission determined a new issue that was not previously noticed for the hearing when it ordered that: ‘In the event its tariff is revised, [Lakes Region] shall not require Mr. Mykytiuk to install a second meter in the future so long as he undertakes no further renovations to the structures on his property.’” Lakes Region argues that “[b]ecause the Commission did not provide notice of this issue, Lakes Region did not present evidence or arguments as to significant operational problems that would arise if the Commission did not apply Rule . . . 606.04,” including risk of water loss and property damage due to leaks when one or both structures are unoccupied and the inability to disconnect service from one building without also disconnecting the other.', 'We disagree that Lakes Region lacked notice of the issue. By letter dated November 10, 2016, the Commission notified the parties that because its rules “do not specifically address separate dwelling units and separate structures under [Rule] 600 et seq.[,] . . . [t]he Commission believes that a hearing on this matter will be useful in determining whether a separate base charge should be implemented and/or a separate meter installed.” In its order on Lakes Region’s motion to deny complaint and exclude evidence, the Commission noted that “[t]he thrust of Mr. Mykytiuk’s complaint is that Lakes Region is not permitted to charge him a separate base charge and/or install a separate meter under the terms of [Lakes Region’s] tariff.” We conclude that Lakes Region had adequate notice that the issue of whether it could or could not require Mykytiuk to install a separate service to his bunkhouse was an issue to be decided in the proceeding. We also note that notwithstanding Lakes Region’s contention that the alleged lack of notice precluded it from presenting evidence or arguments as to certain “operational problems,” those problems were discussed in testimony by its utility manager and Naylor, and were also discussed in the summation by its counsel.', 'To the extent the parties’ arguments address whether the service to Mykytiuk’s bunkhouse is or is not a tandem connection, we decline to consider them. As previously noted, the Commission made no finding on that issue and it was not specifically asked to do so in Lakes Region’s motion for rehearing.', '8 Accordingly, we also decline Lakes Region’s request that we “vacate and remand . . . with instructions to interpret and apply the Commission’s water service rules to the facts of this case” as that request is not properly before us. See RSA 541:4 (2007) (providing that “no ground not set forth [in a motion for rehearing] shall be urged, relied on, or given any consideration by the court”).', 'Affirmed.', 'LYNN, C.J., and BASSETT, J., concurred.', '9 ']"

Fuller, senior assistant attorney general, orally), for the State.', 'Eric S. Wolpin, assistant appellate defender, of Concord, on the brief and orally, for the defendant.', 'BASSETT, J. The defendant, Joel Martin, appeals his convictions for second degree murder, second degree assault, and being a felon in possession of a dangerous weapon. See RSA 630:1-b, I(a) (2016); RSA 631:2, I(b) (2016); RSA 159:3 (2016). He argues that the Superior Court (Brown, J.) erred when it: (1) failed to inquire how he wanted to proceed if his motion to discharge his counsel were granted; and (2) denied his request to instruct the jury to consider the effect of alcohol intoxication on eyewitness identification testimony. We affirm.', 'The following evidence was presented to the jury. On Friday, May 8, 2015, the defendant went to a Manchester nightclub. The club was crowded and dark. The defendant approached a group of three men, including the murder victim, and a fight broke out. After other people intervened, the fight ended, and the defendant walked to the other side of the bar.', 'As one of the club promoters was speaking to the victim, the defendant approached and stabbed the victim, inflicting the fatal wounds. As two club security guards pulled the defendant away from the victim, the defendant stabbed one guard and slashed the other. One of the guards grabbed the defendant in a bear hug and removed him from the club. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was found nearby with a lacerated neck and a partially amputated finger.', 'The defendant was later arrested and charged with alternative counts of second degree murder, two counts of second degree assault, and one count of being a felon in possession of a deadly weapon. On May 12, 2015, counsel from the Office of the New Hampshire Public Defender was appointed to represent the defendant. On June 3, 2015, Attorney Paul Garrity filed an appearance, and, on June 9, the defendant’s appointed counsel withdrew.', 'Almost two years later, in a motion dated February 16, 2017, Garrity and Attorney Justin Shepherd advised the trial court that the defendant was indigent and requested that the court appoint them as his counsel. They informed the court that, although the defendant had originally retained Garrity and that the defendant and his family had agreed to pay for Garrity’s services, Garrity had not received payment since July 15, 2015. They also reported that the total fees paid to Garrity as of February 16, 2017 were “substantially less than was called for by the fee agreement,” the defendant had “filed a financial affidavit affirming his indigency,” and the court had “approved requests for services other than counsel on the basis of the [defendant’s] financial status.” Garrity and Shepherd cited the impracticality “of the Public Defender’s Office taking over a murder case approximately a week and half before trial,” and requested that the trial court appoint them as trial counsel and “authorize payment for their services by the State of New Hampshire.”', 'Two days later, on Saturday, February 18, Garrity met with the defendant. At that meeting, the defendant asked Garrity to withdraw as his counsel. Garrity filed a motion to withdraw on the next business day, February 21, and, on that same day, the trial court held a hearing on the motion. After conducting an extended colloquy with the defendant and Garrity, the court orally denied the motion. On March 3, the trial court issued a written order appointing Garrity and Shepherd as defendant’s counsel and authorizing their', '2 compensation as indigent defense counsel. See RSA 604-A:3, :4 (2001); Sup. Ct. R. 47.', 'Following an eight-day jury trial, the defendant was convicted of second degree murder, two counts of second degree assault and being a felon in possession of a dangerous weapon. This appeal followed.', 'The defendant first argues that the trial court erred when it “did not inform [him] of his options nor determine whether [he] wished to proceed pro se.” The State counters that, after the defendant informed the trial court that he was dissatisfied with his counsel, the trial court conducted a sufficient inquiry.', 'Both Part I, Article 15 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to counsel and the right to self-representation. State v. Sweeney, 151 N.H. 666, 670 (2005). We first address the defendant’s claim under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid our analysis. State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).', 'The right to counsel and the right to self-representation are mutually exclusive; the exercise of one right nullifies the other. State v. Ayer, 154 N.H. 500, 516 (2006). To be effective, an assertion of the right to self-representation must be clear and unequivocal. Id. This requirement is necessary to protect a defendant from inadvertently waiving the right to counsel through “occasional musings on the benefits of self-representation.” United States v. Frazier-El, 204 F.3d 553, 558 (4th Cir. 2000) (quotation omitted). It also “prevents a defendant from taking advantage of and manipulating the mutual exclusivity of the rights to counsel and self-representation.” Id. at 559. “[I]f a defendant in a criminal proceeding makes an equivocal demand on the question of self- representation, he has a potential ground for appellate reversal no matter how the [trial] court rules.” United States v. Miles, 572 F.3d 832, 836 (10th Cir. 2009) (quotation and emphasis omitted). To address this dilemma, and “because a waiver of the right to counsel should not be lightly inferred,” appellate courts, including this court, have held that “a defendant’s election to represent himself must be clearly and unequivocally asserted.” Id. at 836-37 (quotation omitted); see Sweeney, 151 N.H. at 670.', 'Courts should “indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver.” Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. 387, 404 (1977); State v. Davis, 139 N.H. 185, 190 (1994). Notwithstanding this presumption, there is no requirement that a defendant use specific language to invoke his right to self-representation: “‘[T]he triggering statement in a defendant’s attempt to waive his right to counsel need not be punctilious; rather, the dialogue between the court and the defendant must result in a clear and unequivocal statement.’” Sweeney,', '3 151 N.H. at 670 (quoting United States v. Proctor, 166 F.3d 396, 403 (1st Cir. 1999)).', 'We have not yet had occasion to decide whether we should apply a deferential or de novo standard when reviewing the issue of whether a defendant’s request for self-representation was clear and unequivocal. See State v. Towle, 162 N.H. 799, 803 (2011). Nor do we need to do so in this case, because the State prevails under the more exacting de novo standard.', 'The State does not contest that the defendant’s request that Garrity withdraw “constituted a ‘triggering statement,’ and therefore necessitated an inquiry by the court.” Accordingly, we will assume without deciding that the defendant’s request constituted a triggering statement that required further judicial inquiry. See Sweeney, 151 N.H. at 670. After having reviewed the transcript of the colloquy conducted by the trial court with the defendant, we conclude that the court obtained sufficient clarity of the purpose of the defendant’s request.', 'The colloquy between the defendant and the court began as follows:', 'THE COURT: Mr. Martin, tell me in your own words why you think', 'you’re entitled to a new counsel.', 'THE DEFENDANT: I have a couple -- I have a list of things that I’ve', '-- I’ve made a list of things that he hasn’t done that I could read to', 'you if that’s possible.', 'THE COURT: Sure. Any way you want to tell me. The defendant then described the areas in which he believed that his counsel’s representation had been deficient. These included his: (1) delay in providing the defendant with “my full discovery”; (2) failure to request a second forensic expert; (3) attempts to persuade the defendant to accept a plea offered by the State; and (4) refusal to call a particular witness at trial. The defendant concluded:', 'Also, he ignores most of my requests and he actually is', 'trying to get me to -- persuade me into taking the State’s plea,', 'which I don’t want to whatsoever. I’ve actually voiced my opinion', 'about what I want to do with my case and that I want to take it to', 'trial and he’s continually trying to get me to take the State’s offer.', 'Last, but not least, there is possible that there’s people on', 'the case that possibly tampered with evidence and helped fabricate', 'this charge, yet he refuses to investigate these facts and present it', 'for trial.', '4', 'Last, but not least, Your Honor, as you know I’m fighting for', 'my life and I deserve to be represented zealously in every aspect', 'and he has not done that. So I would appreciate if he was removed', 'from my case for ineffective counsel.', 'After hearing from defense counsel, the trial court ruled:', 'Yeah, motion for new counsel is denied. We’re on the eve of', 'trial and I haven’t heard anything that meets the level that would', 'draw me to the conclusion that there hasn’t been effective', 'assistance of counsel, so we’re going forward. Motion denied.', 'When the defendant asked whether he “could just say a couple more things, please,” the court allowed him to continue. The defendant told the court that his counsel had advised him that “we can’t win this case and I want to go to trial. How can I -- how do I go to trial with someone who is already defeated and telling me there’s no possible way I can win, your Honor?”', 'The colloquy ended with the following exchange:', 'THE COURT: I know Attorney Garrity well enough to know that if', 'he goes to trial, he’s going to mount a strong defense. I don’t think', 'that’s the issue. I think he’s trying to get to you -- get into your', 'head that maybe the facts aren’t as strong as you would like them', 'to be. You can’t change the facts.', 'THE DEFENDANT: Yeah, I understand the evidence against me,', 'sir.', 'THE COURT: Okay.', 'THE DEFENDANT: So I have to -- I have to go to trial with Paul', 'Garrity is what you’re telling me, sir?', 'THE COURT: I’m not going to replace counsel on the eve of trial', 'based upon what I just heard. I also heard that Attorney Garrity', 'has investigated, that he will pursue any legitimate witnesses that', 'may come to your defense, but I don’t take continuances,', 'particularly a week from trial.', 'At this stage, where I’ve seen the work that your counsel --', 'counsels have put into this, to think it hasn’t been competently', 'pursued, diligently pursued, so motion to withdraw denied.', 'The defendant concedes that the trial court allowed him to explain his dissatisfaction with Garrity. He argues, however, that his concluding question', '5 as to whether he “ha[d] to go to trial with Paul Garrity” “created the same ambiguity that was present in Sweeney,” and that, therefore, the trial court was required to clarify the ambiguity. See Sweeney, 151 N.H. at 668-71. We disagree, as the facts in Sweeney are distinguishable.', 'In Sweeney, the defendant asked whether he could speak to the trial judge “privately” during a pretrial hearing held on the first day of trial. Sweeney, 151 N.H. at 668. After the trial judge advised him that it was “not allowed,” id., the defendant again attempted to speak with the judge, who told him that he was “represented by very, very competent counsel.” Id. The defendant persevered, attempting to address the authenticity of a proposed trial exhibit. Id. When the trial court advised him that his counsel “will make any arguments for you that have to be made,” the defendant reported that his counsel had refused to make the argument. Id. The court then stated: “Well, then, as long as you’re represented by him, Mr. Sweeney, then you have to pay attention to him.” Id. at 669. When faced with the choice of either advancing the challenge that he wished to make or remaining silent because he was represented by counsel, Sweeney asked, “Well, sir, do I have the right to fire my lawyer?” Id. The trial court responded, “At this point in time, no. We’re on the verge of starting the jury trial, sir.” Id. at 669. On appeal, we held that “the trial court’s summary response to the defendant’s question, without further inquiry, violated his State constitutional rights and constituted reversible error.” Id. at 672.', 'The defendant describes his final question to the trial court as one that “asked the court what options were available to him.” We do not view his inquiry so broadly. Here, in contrast to Sweeney, the trial court conducted an extensive colloquy after the defendant made his request that Garrity withdraw as his counsel. The court began the exchange by asking: “Mr. Martin, tell me in your own words why you think you’re entitled to a new counsel.” (Emphasis added.) After describing the alleged deficiencies in Garrity’s representation, the defendant concluded: “I’m fighting for my life and I deserve to be represented zealously in every aspect.” (Emphasis added.) In response, the court ruled, “motion for new counsel is denied.” (Emphasis added.) Throughout the hearing the trial court consistently and repeatedly referred to the defendant’s request that Garrity withdraw as a motion for new counsel. Never did the defendant take issue with that reference. It was at the end of the lengthy colloquy that the defendant asked, “I have to go to trial with Paul Garrity is what you’re telling me, sir?” The court responded, “I’m not going to replace counsel on the eve of trial based upon what I just heard.” (Emphasis added.) Despite being given several opportunities throughout the colloquy, the defendant said nothing to the court that would suggest that he wished to proceed pro se. Although we noted in Sweeney that a defendant need not recite a talismanic formula in order to invoke the right to self-representation, id. at 670, we stated that further judicial inquiry was necessary “[o]nce the defendant makes a sufficiently clear request to indicate an intention to switch', '6 representational gears.” Id. at 671 (quotations omitted). Here, while the defendant clearly indicated that he wanted to fire Garrity, nothing that he said indicated that he sought to “switch representational gears” and proceed pro se. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court achieved sufficient clarity of the purpose of the defendant’s request. See id.', 'Notably, in Sweeney, we limited our holding, explaining that “we do not hold that a trial judge must explicitly inform a defendant of his right to proceed pro se.” Id. at 671. In doing so, we implicitly recognized the danger that might result if a trial court were to suggest an approach not previously contemplated by the defendant; i.e., to waive his right to counsel. The danger is “that a defendant will treat advice regarding the existence of the right as a subtle indicator that the judge is in fact recommending that he exercise the right.” Com. v. Myers, 748 N.E.2d 471, 476 (Mass. App. Ct. 2001). As we observed in Sweeney, when a defendant invokes his right to self-representation, he necessarily waives his right to counsel. Sweeney, 151 N.H. at 670. In the absence of any indication from the defendant that he wished to “switch representational gears” by waiving his right to counsel, we decline to hold that the trial court was required to sua sponte advise him of his right to proceed pro se. See Brewer v. Williams, 430 U.S. at 404 (observing that courts must indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver of right to counsel).', 'Next, the defendant characterizes his request that Garrity file a motion to withdraw as a “motion to fire retained counsel,” and argues that the court erred by denying his motion without asking how he wished to proceed. Defendants facing criminal charges who do not require appointed counsel generally have the right to counsel of their choice. United States v. Gonzalez- Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 144 (2006). In contrast, as the defendant acknowledges in his brief, “[d]efendants represented by appointed counsel enjoy a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, but not a right to an attorney of their choice.” See Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 624 (1989).', 'This dichotomy also exists in regard to the discharge of counsel. Although a defendant does not generally require the permission of a trial court to replace retained counsel, see, e.g., United States v. Woodard, 291 F.3d 95, 107 (1st Cir. 2002), “those who do not have the means to hire their own lawyers have no cognizable complaint so long as they are adequately represented by attorneys appointed by the courts.” Caplin & Drysdale, 491 U.S. at 624.', 'The State contends that, at the time of the hearing on Garrity’s motion to withdraw, Garrity was serving as appointed rather than retained counsel. The defendant, in contrast, argues that Garrity appeared at the hearing in his capacity as retained counsel. We will assume without deciding that Garrity appeared as retained counsel at the February 21 hearing.', '7', 'We have observed that “the ethical, fair, and orderly administration of justice may outweigh a defendant’s right to chosen counsel when, for example, the trial court determines that a defendant has asserted his right to dismiss counsel as a dilatory tactic.” State v. Gonzalez, 170 N.H. 398, 405 (2017). “[T]he right to counsel cannot be manipulated so as to obstruct the orderly procedure in the courts or to interfere with the fair administration of justice.” United States v. Llanes, 374 F.2d 712, 717 (2d Cir. 1967) (quotation and ellipsis omitted). “Judges must be vigilant that requests for appointment of a new attorney on the eve of trial should not become a vehicle for achieving delay.” Id. Accordingly, our rules of criminal procedure specifically prohibit the withdrawal of counsel in a criminal case “after the case has been assigned for trial or hearing, except upon motion granted by the court for good cause shown, and on such terms as the court may order.” N.H. R. Crim. P. 5(h). This rule applies whether counsel is appointed or retained.', 'Here, the case had been assigned for trial. The record does not establish that good cause existed as of February 21 to allow Garrity to withdraw and for the court to appoint new counsel. The trial court allowed the defendant to explain the reasons for his dissatisfaction with Garrity’s representation, and considered them, along with Garrity’s responses. The defendant expressed concern about Garrity’s preparation for trial and Garrity’s attempt to persuade him to consider the State’s plea offer. The trial court was not persuaded by the defendant’s perception of deficiencies in Garrity’s performance and denied the motion to withdraw.', 'We note that, prior to this colloquy, the trial court had held a pretrial conference on February 15, during which counsel for both parties addressed the trial preparation that had been completed and that which remained to be done. Given the record before us, we conclude that the trial court’s discretionary ruling that there was no good cause to allow Garrity to withdraw and to appoint new counsel is sustainable. See N.H. R. Crim. P. 5(h); cf. United States v. Allen, 789 F.2d 90, 93 (1st Cir. 1986) (“Good cause for substitution of counsel cannot be determined solely according to the subjective standard of what the defendant perceives.” (quotation omitted)).', 'Although the defendant contends that the trial court “should have inquired into the availability of [the defendant’s original] public defenders, their familiarity with his case, and their ability to try the case on short notice,” we are not persuaded that the trial court erred when it determined that replacement of counsel was not a viable alternative to a delay in trial. At the time of the February 21, 2017 hearing, Garrity had been representing the defendant for approximately 21 months, and the second degree murder trial, which included several other serious charges, was scheduled to begin six days later. Given these facts, the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the public defender, if appointed to represent the defendant, would not have been able to adequately prepare for trial.', '8', 'We reach the same result under the Federal Constitution. See United States v. Mota-Santana, 391 F.3d 42, 47 (1st Cir. 2004) (defendant seeking to replace retained counsel with appointed counsel must show good cause).', 'Finally, the defendant argues that, because the State’s case “hinged largely on the identification of [the defendant] by two eyewitnesses,” and because there was evidence of eyewitness intoxication, the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury that it should consider evidence of intoxication when it evaluated the reliability of eyewitness testimony. We evaluate allegations of error by interpreting the disputed instructions in their entirety, as a reasonable juror would have understood them, and in light of all the evidence in the case. State v. West, 167 N.H. 465, 468 (2015). We determine whether the jury instructions adequately and accurately explain each element of the offense and reverse only if the instructions did not fairly cover the issues of law in the case. Id. Whether a particular jury instruction is necessary, and the scope and wording of jury instructions, are within the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Rice, 169 N.H. 783, 790 (2017).

2018080sachdev.pdf,2017-0599,THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE v. ABHISHEK SACHDEV,Criminal,"['Gordon J. MacDonald, attorney general (Stephen D. Fuller, senior assistant attorney general, on the brief and orally), for the State.', 'Shaheen & Gordon, P.A., of Concord (James D. Rosenberg on the brief and orally), for the defendant.', 'DONOVAN, J. Following a jury trial in Superior Court (Temple, J.), the defendant, Abhishek Sachdev, was convicted on two counts of aggravated felonious sexual assault, see RSA 632-A:2, I(f), (m) (Supp. 2017), and one count of simple assault, see RSA 631:2-a, I(a) (2016). On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress upon finding that: (1) he was not in custody for Miranda purposes when he was questioned by detectives about the alleged assault, see Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966); and (2) his consent to search the store and his person were “voluntary and free of duress and coercion.” We affirm.', 'The following facts are drawn from the trial court’s order. In July 2016, K.L. reported to Detective Lombardi of the Nashua Police Department that someone she described “as a thin, darker skin man named ‘Abi’” had sexually assaulted her inside of a new wireless store in Nashua. On July 13, at approximately 4:45 p.m., Lombardi and his colleague, Detective DiTullio, went to the store. They wore plain clothes with their badges around their necks and their guns displayed on their hips. Even though the store was not yet open to the public, the detectives were able to enter through the main entrance. The detectives informed the defendant and another man, Diego Gomez, that they were investigating a female’s complaint about the prior night, and asked if they would be willing to give statements at the police station “voluntarily.” The defendant and Gomez agreed. The conversation “was cordial, polite, and short, lasting five minutes.”', 'All four men then left the store and Gomez locked the doors. Lombardi suggested that the defendant and Gomez take separate vehicles in case one of them finished his interview early. A patrol officer then arrived to secure both entrances to ensure that no one entered the store in their absence. The defendant and Gomez drove to the police station in their own vehicles and the detectives drove in an unmarked cruiser. The four men entered the station through the front lobby. Both Gomez and the defendant were signed in as visitors at 5:15 p.m. The detectives did not take any items from the defendant, such as his keys or cell phone.', 'After signing in the two men, the detectives brought them to a waiting area in the detectives’ bureau located on the second floor. The detectives decided to first interview Gomez and asked the defendant to remain in the waiting room. The defendant agreed. The detectives told the defendant to let them know if he needed anything during the wait. The defendant was alone and unsupervised and was not restrained in any manner while in the waiting area. The door to the exit remained unlocked and the defendant could have left at any time without the assistance of the detectives or any other officer.', 'The detectives interviewed Gomez for approximately twenty-five minutes, after which Lombardi met the defendant in the waiting room and brought him to a small interview room. The room contained a table and three chairs. Lombardi gave the defendant a “victim/witness background sheet” and asked him to complete it. Lombardi then left the room.', 'Thereafter, both DiTullio and Lombardi entered the room, and they began interviewing the defendant at 5:52 p.m. The interview was audio and video recorded. At the beginning of the interview, Lombardi told the defendant the following:', '2', 'No one forced you to come in here, right? You’re not under arrest', 'right now. . . . [T]hat door is shut just for our privacy. It’s not', 'locked. If at any time you don’t want to talk to us, you just let us', 'know and we will bring you back outside and you can get in your', 'car and leave. Before the questioning began, the defendant received a call on his cell phone. The defendant answered the phone and had a brief conversation with the caller. After the call, the defendant completed the “victim/witness background sheet.” The detectives then began to question the defendant about the night of July 12. The trial court found that the tone of the interview was conversational, the detectives did not raise their voices, and the defendant gave long narrative responses rather than “yes” or “no” answers.', 'During the interview, the defendant acknowledged that he met K.L. at the wireless store the previous night. He stated that after he saw her walking barefoot near the store, he asked her if she wanted help. She agreed to go into the store. The defendant, K.L., and Gomez then drank together in the store. The defendant indicated that he left the store to buy more beer and a package of condoms, in case something might “happen.” The defendant represented that when he returned, the three of them continued to drink and, at some point, K.L. vomited and fell asleep.', 'The defendant denied that anything sexual happened with K.L. He stated that he left the store when his wife called him around 12:30, and when he did, K.L. was outside on the sidewalk with Gomez. The defendant also reported that K.L. tried kissing him but he did not reciprocate because she was vomiting and was too impaired.', 'Approximately thirteen minutes into the interview, the following exchange occurred, as recited in the trial court’s order:1', 'Lombardi:', 'And what happened after she was kissing you?', 'Defendant:', 'Nothing.', 'Lombardi:', 'That was it? You’re positive?', 'Defendant:', 'Yes.', 'Lombardi:', 'Well, what if I told you that I had some evidence to', 'suggest otherwise? Would you say that that was', 'inaccurate evidence? Like I said, I just want the truth', 'from you. Okay?', 'Defendant: I am telling the truth. 1 Although the defendant provided us with a transcript of the interview, we rely upon the trial court’s order for the substance of the interview because the trial court’s recitation of the interview is based upon its review of the video recording of the interview, rather than the transcript of the interview, which was produced after the suppression hearing.', '3 Lombardi:', 'She’s an adult. She’s not a kid or anything like that,', 'okay? You know, it is what it is. I just want you to be', 'truthful with me. Defendant: I have a wife. You have to understand that. Lombardi: We’re not going to talk to your wife. This is a private', 'conversation just between us, okay? No one outside of', 'this room is going to hear this. I just want you to be', 'truthful with me. If . . . what happens between you', 'and your wife, that’s your own thing. Defendant: Can I consult a lawyer by any chance? Lombardi: If you want to talk to a lawyer, . . . that’s fine. Okay,', 'I’m just trying to talk to you man to man. Um, let me', 'lay out what we have right here, okay. Basically, um,', 'your store — we’re going to need to take some pictures', 'of the inside of it. We’re gonna need to look through it', 'for some beer cans and some things like that. [Gomez]', 'told us that she was bleeding in there and that he had', 'like cleaned her up with some [inaudible]. We want to', 'be able to get those things. So there is a couple of', 'ways for us to go about doing that. Okay. We can get', 'a search warrant or we can get consent from you. It’s', 'entirely . . . Defendant: You can go ahead. You can do that. DiTullio:', 'Let me go get the consent form. [Detective DiTullio leaves the room] Lombardi:', 'All right, so what we are going to do is review a', 'consent to search form. As I said, we are going to go', 'in there, we’re going to take pictures, we’re going to get', 'those items that we need to get, and then you can', 'have your store back. Okay. Um. All right. So. [Detective DiTullio returns with form] Defendant: I mean what happened to her? Is she in trouble? Lombardi: She’s not in trouble. Like you said, she had some cuts', 'and scrapes on her. We were trying to figure out', 'where those came from. That kind of stuff. Defendant: [inaudible] [W]e feel bad because she was walking', 'barefoot. That’s why we took her in. I’ll be helping', 'you. You can go in and take a look. Whatever you', 'want. So but tomorrow can we do the sales over there', 'or no?', '4 Lombardi:', 'Assuming that we can just go in there and take', 'pictures . . . As soon as we are done [inaudible as they', 'talk over each other] ... Lombardi:', 'All right. This is basically our standard consent to', 'search form. Okay, so we have everyone fill this out', 'when we are searching something. So I’ll read it and', 'then you can read it with me as I am reading it to you.', '. . . So “I . . . have been informed of my constitutional', 'right not to have a search made of my . . . premise.” Defendant: Not to have? Lombardi: Yes. So you have the right to not let us do this, and', 'have us get a search warrant, which means we’ll close', 'down your business until . . . Defendant: No, you can go ahead . . . Lombardi: So you have the right to not let us take these pictures', 'and not search your building. Okay? You have that', 'right. . . . Hold on one second, let me start again here', '. . . So I, your name, have been informed of my', 'constitutional right not to have a search made of my', 'premise um without a search warrant and of my right', 'to refuse to consent to . . . such a search . . . do', 'hereby authorize the below listed individuals, who', 'have identified themselves to me as law enforcement', 'officers, to conduct a complete search of my premise', 'situated at your business 83 Main Street.

I', 'understand that anything discovered may be used', 'against me in a criminal proceeding. This consent to', 'search has been given by me voluntarily without', 'threats or promises of any kind. Okay, so I’m not', 'threatening you, I’m not telling you that I’m going to', 'do anything that I’m not going to do. . . . Do you have', 'any questions about it first of all? Defendant: Nope. Lombardi: If you agree to that, you can sign right there and then', 'date and time. [Defendant signs form] Lombardi:', 'All right. And then. You said nothing sexual', 'happened with you and her, right? Nothing like that. Defendant: [inaudible]', '5', 'Lombardi:', 'I was going to fill out another one of these and ask for', 'buccal swabs, which is basically I’ll take a little Q-tip', 'and rub the inside of your mouth to get a DNA sample.', 'Are you okay with consenting to that?', 'DiTullio:', 'It’s two Q-tips, they’re about this long. We’ll rub one', 'on the inside of your cheek and one on the other side', 'of the cheek. And that’s it. . . .', 'Lombardi:', 'Like I said, it’s to get a . . . some of your DNA.', 'Defendant:', 'Why’s that?', 'Lombardi:', 'You said that there was no sexual assault . . .', 'Defendant:', '[inaudible] consulting a lawyer?', 'Lombardi:', 'Well that’s fine if you want to consult a lawyer about', 'that. Like I said I’m not going to force you to do that.', 'I’m not going to make you any promises, but the', 'buccal swabs are to take DNA so we can compare', 'them against any other DNA that may or may not have', 'been found. It’s entirely up to you. Same thing with', 'this one, I’m not going to force you to do anything you', 'don’t want to.', 'Defendant:', 'I mean, you can go ahead on that one [referring to the', 'search of the store].', 'Lombardi:', 'Okay, but you don’t want to sign the consent for the', 'swabs for your DNA?', 'Defendant:', 'Not right now.', 'Lombardi:', 'Not right now?', 'Defendant:', 'No.', 'Lombardi:', 'Okay. All right. Fair enough. All right, so with that', 'being said, we’ll run out there. We’ll take', 'photographs, we’ll go look through there get that all', 'done and um that way you can have your business', 'back up and running and do what you have to do,', 'okay? The recording ends shortly thereafter at 6:11 p.m. Both detectives then left the room to review the information they had gathered and the defendant remained inside the interview room. The detectives decided that they would apply for a search warrant to obtain buccal swabs, penile swabs, pubic hairs, fingernail clippings, and some of the defendant’s clothing.', 'After approximately five minutes, Lombardi went back into the interview room to inform the defendant about the next steps in the investigation. Lombardi explained that they were going to apply for a search warrant to obtain the buccal swabs and other bodily samples. Lombardi explained the search warrant process and again asked the defendant for his consent to obtain these samples. During this brief discussion, the defendant reconsidered his decision and agreed to consent to the search of his person. This interaction', '6 was not recorded. However, the trial court found that Lombardi credibly testified that he did not make any threats or promises to the defendant.', 'The defendant then executed a “consent to search” form similar to the form by which he consented to a search of the store. Lombardi read it aloud and asked the defendant if he had any questions. After explaining what was being requested of the defendant — “buccal swabs, clothing, undergarments, swabs of fingers, penile swabs [and] pubic combing” — the defendant initialed the form next to the list of items and signed the bottom of the form at 6:30 p.m. He did not have any questions during the process.', 'Lombardi obtained the buccal swabs from the defendant at the station and then the detectives brought him to the hospital to collect the additional samples. Afterwards, the detectives brought the defendant back to the station. The detectives did not ask the defendant any questions during the drive to and from the hospital. At the station, Lombardi thanked the defendant for his cooperation and gave the defendant his business card. The defendant then got into his vehicle and left the station. The detectives obtained an arrest warrant one week later and subsequently arrested the defendant on July 22, 2016.', 'Prior to trial, the defendant moved to suppress “any and all evidence” obtained after he allegedly “invoked his right to counsel,” or, in the alternative, to suppress evidence obtained during the warrantless searches of the store and his person because his consent to both of those searches was not free, knowing, and voluntary. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court concluded “that the defendant was not in custody at any point during the interview and therefore was not entitled to Miranda protections.” Also, the court found that, because the defendant signed the two consent forms, was not in custody, and was not threatened or coerced in any way, the “State has shown by a preponderance of the evidence that his consent to search the store and his person was voluntary and free of duress and coercion.” The jury thereafter convicted the defendant. This appeal followed.', 'On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court erred when it found that: (1) he was not in custody for Miranda purposes when he was questioned by the detectives about the alleged assault; and (2) his consent to the searches of the store and his person was free and voluntary. The defendant cites both the State and Federal Constitutions in support of his arguments that the trial court erred when it denied his motion to suppress. See N.H. CONST. pt. I, arts. 15, 19; U.S. CONST. amends. IV-VI, XIV. We first address the defendant’s claims under the State Constitution and rely upon federal law only to aid in our analysis. State v. Ball, 124 N.H. 226, 231-33 (1983).', 'We begin by addressing the defendant’s argument that the trial court erred in finding that he was not in custody for Miranda purposes. Before a defendant’s responses made during a custodial interrogation may be used as', '7 evidence against him, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it did not violate his constitutional rights under Miranda. State v. McKenna, 166 N.H. 671, 676 (2014). For Miranda warnings to be required a defendant must be subjected to custodial interrogation by the police. See State v. Hammond, 144 N.H. 401, 403 (1999). Therefore, as a general rule, two conditions must be met before Miranda warnings are required: (1) the suspect must be “in custody”; and (2) he must be subject to “interrogation.” In re B.C., 167 N.H. 338, 342 (2015). In this appeal, the only issue is whether the trial court erred in finding that the defendant was not in custody.', '“Custody entitling a defendant to Miranda protections requires formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement of the degree associated with formal arrest.” McKenna, 166 N.H. at 676 (quotation omitted). “In the absence of formal arrest, we must determine whether a suspect’s freedom of movement was sufficiently curtailed by considering how a reasonable person in the suspect’s position would have understood the situation.” Id. at 676-77 (quotation omitted). To determine whether a reasonable person in the defendant’s position would believe himself in custody, the trial court should consider the totality of the circumstances of the encounter. Id. at 677. “Factors to be considered include, but are not limited to: the number of officers present, the degree to which the suspect was physically restrained, the interview’s duration and character, and the suspect’s familiarity with his surroundings.” In re E.G., 171 N.H. ___, ___ (decided August 17, 2018) (slip op. at 5) (quotation omitted).', 'On appeal, we recognize that the custody determination “is a law- dominated mixed question in which ‘the crucial question entails an evaluation made after [the] determination of [the historical facts]: if encountered by a “reasonable person,” would the identified circumstances add up to custody as defined in Miranda?’” State v. Ford, 144 N.H. 57, 62-63 (1999) (quoting Thompson v. Keohane, 516 U.S. 99, 113 (1995)). “The trier of fact is not ‘in an appreciably better position’ than we to answer that question.” Id. at 63 (quoting Thompson, 516 U.S. at 114-15). Accordingly, although we will not overturn the trial court’s findings of historical facts unless they are contrary to the manifest weight of the evidence, we review the ultimate determination of custody de novo. Id.; In re E.G., 171 N.H. at ___ (slip op. at 5).', 'Here, the trial court’s findings of historical facts relating to custody are not in dispute. Accordingly, we accept and rely upon the historical facts as set forth in the trial court’s suppression order. Moreover, we note that the appellate record does not contain the videotape of the defendant’s interview with the detectives, which the trial court had the benefit of considering before issuing its order. See Bean v. Red Oak Prop. Mgmt., 151 N.H. 248, 250 (2004) (burden on appealing party to provide court with record sufficient to decide issues on appeal); see also Sup. Ct. R. 13(3) (we will not ordinarily review any part of the record that has not been provided to us in an appendix by a party or', '8 transmitted to us by the trial court or administrative agency). Therefore, we must assume that the evidence in the record was sufficient to support the trial court’s factual findings as they pertain to the interview, i.e., the detectives’ tone, demeanor, and physical presence. See Bean, 151 N.H. at 250.', 'In its order, the trial court found the following factors weighed against a finding of custody: (1) the defendant agreed to go to the police station voluntarily and drove there himself; (2) the defendant entered through the front lobby of the station and signed in as a visitor; (3) only two detectives were present throughout the evening; (4) the detectives were in plain clothes; (5) although armed, the detectives did not brandish their weapons; (6) “[m]ost importantly, at the start of the interview, the defendant was notified that his presence was voluntary and . . . he was not under arrest,” and “that he could stop the interview at any time and . . . the defendant would be permitted to leave”; (7) the detectives “presented a relaxed demeanor and were cordial toward [the] defendant”; and (8) the interview was short, lasting less than twenty minutes. While the trial court acknowledged that there are some facts suggesting that the defendant was in custody — the interview room was small and the defendant sat in the chair furthest from the door, the detectives initiated contact with the defendant at his place of business, and the questioning took place at the police station — when considering the “totality of the circumstances of the encounter,” State v. Jennings, 155 N.H. 768, 772 (2007) (quotation omitted), the court found that the defendant was not in custody at any point during the interview.', 'The defendant argues that the trial court overlooked the following facts in its custody analysis: (1) the detectives did not honor their promise to end the interview even though the defendant twice asked to consult with counsel; (2) the entire interaction between the officers and the defendant lasted over two and a half hours; (3) the detectives’ questions were accusatory; (4) two detectives initiated contact with the defendant at his place of business, invited him to the police station, and left a uniformed officer to guard the defendant’s place of business; and (5) the two officers had badges around their necks and guns at their side. We address the defendant’s argument as to each fact in turn.', 'First, the defendant argues that when the trial court credited Lombardi for informing the defendant that he could terminate the questioning and leave at any time, the trial court failed to consider the fact that the detectives did not honor this promise when the defendant twice asked for the assistance of counsel during the interview. Essentially, the defendant asserts that when he asked to consult with an attorney this question served as a request to end the interview. The defendant contends, therefore, that we should not give as much weight to the “demonstrably superficial warning” the detectives gave to the defendant here as we have in prior cases. We disagree.', '9', 'We have previously held that whether a suspect is informed that he or she is free to terminate the interrogation at any time is a significant factor in our custody analysis. See McKenna, 166 N.H. at 680; State v. Locke, 149 N.H. 1, 7 (2002) (“Given the repeated advice that he was free to leave, we conclude that a reasonable person in the defendant’s position would not believe he was restrained to the degree associated with formal arrest.”); State v. Johnson, 140 N.H. 573, 578 (1995) (finding no custody, based, in part, upon fact that trooper informed defendant he was free to leave). We have also noted that a statement to a suspect that he is not under arrest generally weighs against a finding of custody. See McKenna, 166 N.H. at 679; Hammond, 144 N.H. at 404 (finding no custody, based, in part, upon fact that officers informed the defendant several times that he was not under arrest and that he was free to leave at any time).', 'As an initial matter, whether the detectives intended to honor their promise to end the interview at the time they offered it is not the focus of this inquiry. We need not examine the subjective intent of the detectives; rather, we conduct an objective analysis to determine whether a reasonable person would have believed that he was restrained to the degree associated with formal arrest. See McKenna, 166 N.H. at 676-77. Thus, to the extent that the defendant asserts that the detectives never intended to permit him to terminate the interview, this claim is irrelevant to our analysis.', 'Objectively, given the facts here, the detectives’ responses to the defendant’s request for an attorney have no bearing on the weight we give to the detectives’ representations that the defendant was free to leave or terminate the interview because the defendant did not request to do so. His request to consult with an attorney cannot be equated to a request to terminate the interview. We find support for this conclusion in our decision in Locke, where we recognized that repeatedly advising a defendant that he is free to leave is a strong indication that the defendant is not in custody. Locke, 149 N.H. at 7. We concluded that the defendant in Locke was not in custody despite his inquiry to the detective during the interview if he had any rights. Id. at 5. Nor did the interview become custodial in Locke when the defendant stood up, walked out of the interview room, and “ran into” the detective in the hallway and then returned to the interview room, because the detective neither blocked the defendant’s path nor told the defendant to go back into the room. Id. at 5, 7.', 'Similarly, here, at no time did the defendant ask to leave the interview room or to terminate the interview. Nor is there evidence in the record to suggest that the defendant made gestures or otherwise indicated that he wanted to leave or terminate the interview. Indeed, the defendant asking to consult with an attorney is more akin to the defendant in Locke asking if he had any rights. The detectives here did not, as the defendant contends, ignore their promise that the defendant could terminate the interview at any time.', '10 There is no indication in the record that the detectives restricted the defendant’s ability to leave or end the questioning. Thus, we find that this factor — instructing the defendant that he is free to leave at any time — weighs against a finding of custody even when considering the defendant’s request to consult with a lawyer.', 'Second, the defendant argues that the trial court erred in finding that the length of the interview was a factor that weighed against a finding of custody. The defendant contends that the trial court failed to consider the entire interaction between the defendant and the officers when calculating the length of the interview. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the detectives spent over two and a half hours with him — from the moment the officers arrived at the defendant’s business to when the detectives returned the defendant to the police station after going to the hospital. We recently noted that “[w]hile in general, [brief interrogations] weigh[] against a finding of custody, the length of questioning can be a relatively ‘undeterminative factor in the analysis of custody.’” In re E.G., 171 N.H. at ___ (slip op. at 12) (quoting United States v. Griffin, 922 F.2d 1343, 1348 (8th Cir. 1990)). We recognize that the defendant’s interaction with the detectives lasted over two hours, but the record supports the trial court’s finding that the only substantive questioning occurred while the defendant was in the interview room at the station, which lasted less than twenty minutes. Cf. Locke, 149 N.H. at 6-7 (finding no custody, and recognizing, in part, that the interview’s duration was not excessive — it lasted for three and one-half hours, and there was no evidence of shouting or harsh tones). On balance, we conclude that despite the length of the overall interaction, the trial court did not err by only considering the brevity of the interview at the station and we agree with the trial court that this factor weighs against a finding of custody.', 'Third, the defendant argues that the accusatory nature of the questioning weighs in favor of a finding of custody. “[W]e have repeatedly recognized the importance of the absence or presence of accusatory questioning in our analysis of custody, contrasting accusatory questioning, which weighs in favor of custody, with questioning of a purely general nature, which supports a determination of no custody.” McKenna, 166 N.H. at 682; Jennings, 155 N.H. at 775 (nature of interrogation is important factor in custody determination); see also State v. Dedrick, 132 N.H. 218, 225 (1989) (finding custody, in part, because intensity of the interview escalated when the officers accused the defendant of untruths and stated “time and again” that it was the defendant who had killed the victim), abrogated on other grounds by State v. Ford, 144 N.H. 57, 62-63 (1999); cf. State v. Graca, 142 N.H. 670, 675 (1998) (concluding that the defendant was not in custody, in part, because the “questioning throughout the incident was of a purely general nature”). The defendant relies upon Jennings to argue that when Lombardi urged the defendant to be truthful and “confronted him with alleged evidence which was inconsistent with his denial of sexual contact with K.L.,” this accusation weighs', '11 in favor of finding custody. See Jennings, 155 N.H. at 774. In Jennings, however, the officer began the interview by immediately “confront[ing] the defendant with his daughter’s allegations of sexual assault and said he was certain she was telling the truth.” Id. Moreover, in Jennings, we considered the questioning during the interview in conjunction with the “control exercised by the police from the beginning of the encounter,” which clearly indicated “that the police believed the defendant to be guilty of sexual assault [signaling] to a reasonable person that his freedom of movement was curtailed to the degree associated with formal arrest.” Id.', 'By contrast, in this case, Lombardi stated only that he had some evidence to suggest that the defendant’s statements were inaccurate and that he just wanted the truth from the defendant. Lombardi then provided the defendant with an opportunity to respond. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record to suggest that Lombardi accused the defendant of committing a specific crime. Cf. McKenna, 166 N.H. at 682-83 (concluding that the accusatory nature of the questioning — repeatedly asking the defendant, for over an hour, why he sexually assaulted the victim — weighed in favor of a finding of custody). The majority of the questioning was not accusatory in nature and as soon as it became arguably accusatory, the defendant asked to consult with an attorney. At that point, the questioning ceased, but for one assertion made in the context of a request for consent to search, asking the defendant to confirm his denial that any sexual assault had occurred. Furthermore, here, unlike the confrontational tone used in Jennings, the trial court found that “the detectives presented a relaxed demeanor[,] . . . were cordial toward the defendant,” and did not “raise their voices.” Thus, the overall tone of the interview was not accusatory and, therefore, this factor weighs against a finding of custody.', 'Fourth, the defendant argues that when the trial court considered the fact that the detectives were in plain clothes as a factor that weighs against custody, the trial court ignored the “actual appearance of the detectives involved.” We generally find the fact that the officers are in plain clothing to weigh against a finding of custody. See Locke, 149 N.H. at 4, 6 (finding no custody when, in part, the two officers were in plain clothes, displayed their badges when identifying themselves, and weapons were not displayed). However, we recognize that in this case, this factor weighs slightly more in favor of a finding of custody because the two detectives’ weapons and badges were plainly visible to the defendant, and a third uniformed officer arrived to guard the store while the defendant and Gomez went to the police station. These facts differ from situations where the officers are in plain clothes and their weapons are not visible. Thus, taken together, these facts weigh slightly in favor of a finding of custody.', 'Finally, the defendant argues that in conducting its custody analysis, the trial court “missed” the dynamic of the situation involving the detectives’', '12 initiation of contact. We acknowledge that when police initiate contact with the suspect, custody is more likely to exist. See McKenna, 166 N.H. at 684 (relevant to our assessment of the character of the interrogation is the fact that the police initiated the contact with the defendant). Contrary to the defendant’s assertion, however, the trial court considered this factor as weighing in favor of finding custody and we do not disagree. As the trial court also noted, all of the factors are to be considered together to determine whether there was “restraint on freedom of movement to the degree associated with formal arrest.” Id. at 676 (quotation omitted). We do not rely on any single factor in isolation. Id. at 686.', 'In reviewing the ultimate determination of custody, we acknowledge that some facts weigh in favor of finding custody, including: the appearance of the detectives; the detectives’ initiation of contact with the defendant; and the questioning at the police station in a small interview room, with the door closed, and with the defendant in the chair furthest from the door. However, in addition to the facts discussed above that weigh against a finding of custody, the following facts also suggest that the defendant was not in custody: the defendant agreed to go to the police station; he drove there voluntarily; he was signed in as a visitor; the interview lasted less than twenty minutes; and he was not restrained in any way. Thus, although some factors weigh in favor of a finding of custody, after considering the totality of the circumstances of the encounter, we conclude that a reasonable person in the defendant’s position would not have believed himself to be in custody, and therefore, he was not in custody for Miranda purposes when he was questioned and signed the two consent forms. See In re E.G., 171 N.H. at ___ (slip op. at 13); McKenna, 166 N.H. at 677. The Federal Constitution offers the defendant no greater protection than does the State Constitution with regard to the defendant’s rights under Miranda. See In re E.G., 171 N.H. at ___ (slip op. at 13); J.D.B. v. North Carolina, 564 U.S. 261, 270-71 (2011). Therefore, we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution.', 'Next, the defendant argues that his consent to the searches of the store and his person were not voluntary due to the coercive manner by which the detectives secured his consent in violation of his rights under Part I, Article 19 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. “A voluntary consent free of duress and coercion is a recognized exception to the need for both a warrant and probable cause.” State v. Livingston, 153 N.H. 399, 405 (2006) (quotation omitted). The burden is on the State to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the consent was free, knowing, and voluntary. Id. The voluntariness of the consent is a question of fact determined by examining the totality of the circumstances. Id. We will disturb the trial court’s factual findings only if they are not supported by the record or are clearly erroneous. Id. Our review of the trial court’s legal conclusions, however, is de novo. Id.', '13', 'The trial court found that the State met its burden of establishing that the defendant validly consented to the searches. In reaching its conclusion, the trial court relied upon the following facts: (1) the State produced two consent forms signed by the defendant, see State v. Watson, 151 N.H. 537, 541 (2004) (use of written consent form may be an important factor when evaluating totality of the circumstances); (2) the defendant was not in custody, see id. at 540-41 (fact that defendant is in custody may weigh heavily against finding of valid consent); (3) the video recording demonstrated that Lombardi clearly explained that the defendant did not have to consent to either search, see id. at 541 (good policy for police officers to advise persons that they have right to refuse to consent to warrantless search); and (4) the defendant’s tone in the video demonstrated that he freely and voluntarily gave his consent to search the store, cf. id. (upholding trial court’s finding that even though the defendant’s consent was “perhaps done unenthusiastically,” the defendant freely, knowingly, and voluntarily consented to the search).', 'The defendant argues that custody is a factor that weighs heavily in determining whether consent was involuntary. See id. at 540-41. This is a valid point. However, we have already established that the defendant was not in custody when he consented to the two searches. Therefore, the detectives did not violate his Miranda rights by continuing to speak with him or by asking for his consent to search, and, thus, this factor does not weigh against a finding of valid consent.', 'The defendant next argues that “[r]egardless of whether the [d]efendant was in custody, his consent was involuntary for a myriad of other reasons.” The defendant contends that the detectives went beyond informing the defendant of viable alternatives to consent — obtaining a search warrant — because the detectives threatened to close his business while they sought a warrant authorizing a search of the store. See Livingston, 153 N.H. at 406. In asserting this argument, the defendant seeks to distinguish the circumstances here from the facts in Livingston. In Livingston, we noted that informing a defendant of viable alternatives to a consent search does not necessarily vitiate consent. Id. The defendant in Livingston had initially refused to consent to a search of his vehicle. Id. at 406-07. When he refused, he thought he had no other options available. Id. at 407. The officer then informed the defendant that while he could continue to refuse a search of the vehicle, his refusal would result in a canine sniff search of the exterior of the vehicle and if the canine responded to the odor of narcotics, the officer would then seize the vehicle and apply for a search warrant. Id. In light of these circumstances, we affirmed the trial court’s conclusion that the officer’s statements were more explanatory than coercive and thus, the defendant’s consent was voluntary. Id.', 'Contrary to the defendant’s assertion, the present circumstances are similar to Livingston. Here, we rely upon the trial court’s finding that “[b]ased on . . . Lombardi’s tone and demeanor, Lombardi was [not] threatening to close', '14 the defendant’s store permanently or was otherwise making any other type of impermissible threat.” Therefore, as in Livingston, Lombardi’s statement was more explanatory than coercive because Lombardi was merely attempting to advise the defendant of the consequences of his refusal to consent. The circumstances are thus different here than in other cases where the alleged threats “went beyond ‘a mere reference to the fact that [officers] could obtain a [search] warrant.’” State v. Socci, 166 N.H. 464, 473-74 (2014) (quoting United States v. Ivy, 165 F.3d 397, 403 (6th Cir. 1998) (alleged threats included making arrests, using crowbars and sledgehammers, or taking away the defendant’s children if he did not consent to a search)).', 'As the trial court also found, the defendant had already verbally consented to the search prior to this alleged “threat” being made. Given that the defendant had already consented to the search of his business and considering the trial court’s conclusion relating to Lombardi’s tone and demeanor, we conclude that Lombardi’s subsequent statement did not coerce the defendant to consent. Thus, Lombardi’s explanation of viable alternatives to consent does not weigh against a finding of a voluntary consent.', 'The defendant also argues that the trial court minimized his request to speak with a lawyer. Specifically, the defendant contends that, regardless of whether he was in custody, the trial court failed to consider that he had requested to consult with an attorney in order to understand the consent form seeking his DNA sample and was never afforded an opportunity to speak with one. We disagree. The trial court considered this request for counsel and found that Lombardi did not ignore it. The record supports this conclusion. Lombardi informed the defendant that he could consult with an attorney when he stated, “[w]ell that’s fine if you want to consult a lawyer about that. Like I said I’m not going to force you to [consent].” This statement informed the defendant that he could consult an attorney before consenting to the search of his person.', 'Moreover, the defendant’s initial refusal to consent to the DNA search does not necessarily invalidate a subsequent consent as involuntary. See State v. Green, 133 N.H. 249, 259 (1990). The defendant could have continued to refuse to consent or could have left the room. Notably, the defendant’s initial refusal to consent to the body search, followed by execution of the consent form without asking any questions, suggests that the defendant understood his rights to refuse and was not coerced into signing the consent form. See State v. Patch, 142 N.H. 453, 459 (1997) (“The fact that the defendant consented to a search of his vehicle’s trunk and to portions of [another] residence, but refused to consent to a further search of his own residence, indicates that the defendant understood his right to refuse to consent to a search, and that the consent was knowingly, voluntarily, and freely given.”); State v. Prevost, 141 N.H. 647, 650 (1997) (finding no coercion, based in part, on the fact that, despite the defendant’s initial refusal and request for an attorney, she', '15 subsequently signed the consent form without hesitation). There is no evidence that the detectives coerced the defendant into signing the consent form and the defendant offered no evidence to the trial court that conflicted with Lombardi’s testimony regarding the facts and circumstances surrounding the defendant’s ultimate decision to consent to a search of his person. Thus, his request to consult an attorney does not weigh against a finding of a voluntary consent.', 'Therefore, when considering the totality of the circumstances, we agree with the trial court that the defendant’s consent to both searches was free, knowing, and voluntary. Because the Federal Constitution affords no greater protection than the State Constitution, see Livingston, 153 N.H. at 408; Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 227 (1973) (whether a consent to a search was voluntary is a question of fact determined from the totality of all of the circumstances), we reach the same result under the Federal Constitution as we do under the State Constitution.', 'Affirmed.', 'LYNN, C.J., and HICKS, BASSETT, and HANTZ MARCONI, JJ., concurred.', '16 ']"

This appeal arises from the dismissal of a medical malpractice action filed by the plaintiff, Nicole Alward, against defendants Emery Johnston, M.D., Gary Fleischer, M.D., Tung Thuy Nguyen, M.D., Elliot Hospital, and Southern New Hampshire Medical Center.1 The plaintiff argues that the Superior Court (Temple, J.) erred in granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss based on the doctrine of judicial estoppel. We reverse and remand.', 'I', 'The following relevant facts are found either in the plaintiff’s allegations, which we accept as true, or in the trial court’s orders, recited in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. In July 2013, the plaintiff experienced persistent and severe lower back pain as well as numbness and weakness in her right leg. In July and August of 2013, she visited the emergency departments of the two defendant hospitals, was evaluated by the defendant doctors, and underwent two back surgeries. Throughout these attempts to treat her symptoms, the plaintiff’s pain remained consistent and at times worsened. Thereafter, she suffered from “severe pain, bilateral weakness, and numbness, and both bowel and urinary incontinence,” and was unable to work.', 'Following her second back surgery, the plaintiff consulted with two different attorneys about a potential medical malpractice claim. Ultimately, both attorneys advised the plaintiff that they were unwilling to represent her in a medical malpractice action against the treating physicians and hospitals. As a result, the plaintiff believed that her potential claim had no value.', 'The plaintiff consulted with a bankruptcy attorney, Mark Cornell, in April 2015. She informed Attorney Cornell about her potential medical malpractice claim and that other attorneys had declined to pursue it. When Cornell drafted the plaintiff’s petition for chapter 7 bankruptcy, he did not list the potential medical malpractice claim on the plaintiff’s schedule of assets. Cornell also failed to advise the plaintiff that she needed to disclose this potential claim to the bankruptcy trustee.', 'Using the documents prepared by Cornell, the plaintiff filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy on July 23, 2015. The United States Trustee appointed Steven Notinger as the chapter 7 trustee. On December 22, 2015, the bankruptcy court granted the plaintiff a discharge under 11 U.S.C. § 727 (2012).', 'At her ex-husband’s suggestion, in February 2016, the plaintiff consulted with a third law firm, Swartz & Swartz, P.C., which agreed to represent her and pursue the medical malpractice claim. The plaintiff filed the medical malpractice action against the defendants in superior court on June 27, 2016. The plaintiff “did not understand or know that she needed to advise” the 1 Other defendants named in the plaintiff’s complaint did not participate in this appeal.', '2 bankruptcy court or the trustee “of the change of status of the [p]otential [c]laim.” On June 13, Notinger had filed a “Report of No Distribution” with the bankruptcy court, in which he certified that “there is no property available for distribution from the estate over and above that exempted by law,” and requesting to be discharged from further duties as trustee. On July 14, the bankruptcy court issued an order closing the case and discharging the trustee.', 'On October 28, the defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiff should be judicially estopped from pursuing her medical malpractice claim because she failed to disclose it on her schedule of assets. The plaintiff immediately consulted with new bankruptcy counsel, who filed a motion to reopen her bankruptcy case “to administer a potential asset” and requested the appointment of a trustee “to protect the interests of creditors and the [plaintiff].” The bankruptcy court granted the motion on November 14 and the United States Trustee appointed Notinger as the trustee.', 'The plaintiff then filed an objection to the defendants’ motion to dismiss, asserting that her failure to list the malpractice claim on her bankruptcy schedule was the product of inadvertence or mistake, and citing federal cases recognizing that judicial estoppel should not apply under those circumstances. See, e.g., New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 753 (2001). The plaintiff also asserted that the defendants’ judicial estoppel argument was “moot” in light of the fact that the bankruptcy court had granted her motion to reopen and a trustee had been appointed to administer the potential asset. She included, as exhibits to her objection, a copy of her motion to reopen, the bankruptcy court’s order granting the motion, and the notice from the United States Trustee of Notinger’s appointment as trustee. The plaintiff also attached a letter from Notinger to Swartz & Swartz, P.C., dated November 15, 2016, which stated: “This letter confirms that I intend to engage your firm (subject to bankruptcy court approval) to represent me in the Alward medical malpractice litigation.”', 'The trial court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss, concluding that the plaintiff was judicially estopped from pursuing her medical malpractice claim. The court ruled that the plaintiff’s failure to disclose her malpractice claim to the bankruptcy court was not due to inadvertence or mistake. The court also disagreed that “the issue of judicial estoppel was rendered moot” by the reopening of the bankruptcy case, relying on Moses v. Howard University Hospital, 606 F.3d 789 (D.C. Cir. 2010), and other federal cases cited therein. See Moses, 606 F.3d at 800 (applying judicial estoppel to the plaintiff-debtor and rejecting his argument that “he cured his failure to disclose” his claims by reopening the bankruptcy and amending his bankruptcy schedule). In ruling that the plaintiff was judicially estopped from pursuing her medical malpractice claim, the trial court noted that, “[l]ike the plaintiff in Moses, the plaintiff here only moved to reopen her bankruptcy proceedings to amend her schedule of assets after the defendants filed their', '3 motion to dismiss based on judicial estoppel.” The court stated that the timing of these events “strongly suggests that the plaintiff’s motion . . . was prompted entirely by the defendants’ motion to dismiss,” which “is exactly the type of behavior that the court in Moses condemned.”', 'The plaintiff moved for reconsideration. She argued, inter alia, that applying judicial estoppel to bar the malpractice claim would be inequitable, in part because it would allow the defendants to escape responsibility for their negligence at the expense of the plaintiff’s creditors, whose interests the court must consider, given that the bankruptcy trustee had “taken control of the instant lawsuit for the benefit of the estate.” Relying on Wood v. Household Finance Corp., 341 B.R. 770, 774 (W.D. Wash. 2006), the plaintiff asserted that judicial estoppel did not apply to the trustee.', 'In its order denying reconsideration, the court stated:', '[T]he plaintiff claims that the Chapter 7 Trustee “has now taken', 'control of the instant lawsuit for the benefit of the estate, not for', 'the benefit of Plaintiff/debtor,” and thus the issue of judicial', 'estoppel is moot because the Trustee cannot be held accountable', 'for the plaintiff’s prior assertions. In support of her position, the', 'plaintiff cites [Wood], in which the court held that “there is a', 'difference between a debtor attempting to pursue an action for his', 'own benefit, and a trustee pursuing an action for the benefit of', 'creditors.” Wood, 341 B.R. at 774. However, in Wood, the trustee', 'had been “substituted as the real party of interest in the instant', 'action,” entirely replacing the original plaintiff. Id. at 771. There', 'has been no such replacement in the instant case. The Trustee', 'has not filed an appearance, a motion to be substituted as the real', 'party in interest, or a motion to intervene. Other than the', 'plaintiff’s bald assertion that her bankruptcy trustee has taken', 'over the instant case, there is nothing in the record to support this', 'contention. (Citation omitted.) In light of this ruling, the court did not address whether judicial estoppel applied to the trustee. This appeal followed.2', 'II', 'Although the plaintiff challenges the trial court’s dismissal of the medical malpractice claim on a number of grounds, we need address only two. First, she contends that the trial court failed to adhere to the standard of review governing motions to dismiss by failing to construe the facts presented in the 2 The trustee authorized the plaintiff’s counsel to pursue the medical malpractice claim — including this appeal — on behalf of the estate.', '4 light most favorable to her. Second, she argues that the trial court erred in applying judicial estoppel where the bankruptcy case has been reopened and the trustee is pursuing the claim on behalf of the bankruptcy estate. The defendants counter that the medical malpractice claim should be barred by judicial estoppel “regardless of whether it is pursued by [the plaintiff] or the bankruptcy trustee.”', 'We begin by addressing the standard that governs our review of the trial court’s orders. The defendants correctly note that we have not yet determined “the applicable standard of review for the dismissal of a complaint on the basis of judicial estoppel.” Citing cases from the First Circuit, the defendants contend that we should review the trial court’s decision regarding judicial estoppel for an “abuse of discretion.” See Alternative System Concepts, Inc. v. Synopsys, 374 F.3d 23, 30-32 (1st Cir. 2004) (adopting abuse of discretion standard for reviewing trial court’s application of judicial estoppel). But see Seymour v. Collins, 39 N.E.3d 961, 975-76 (Ill. 2015) (noting state and federal courts are split regarding standard of review applicable to judicial estoppel).', 'Courts that apply an abuse of discretion standard do so in part because judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine. See, e.g., In re Coastal Plains, Inc., 179 F.3d 197, 205 (5th Cir. 1999). In the summary judgment context, we have explained that “we apply our traditional summary judgment standard of review to the legal issues and to the determination of whether a genuine issue of material fact exists,” but “we review the trial court’s decision to grant equitable relief . . . for an unsustainable exercise of discretion.” Conant v. O’Meara, 167 N.H. 644, 648-49 (2015). We assume, for purposes of this appeal, that the trial court’s dismissal of the complaint on the ground of judicial estoppel constituted a decision to grant equitable relief. We still begin our inquiry by applying our traditional standard of review for motions to dismiss to the legal issues presented. Cf. id. Specifically, we review issues of law de novo. See England v. Brianas, 166 N.H. 369, 371 (2014); Chatman v. Brady, 162 N.H. 362, 365 (2011); cf. Thore v. Howe, 466 F.3d 173, 182 (1st Cir. 2006) (noting First Circuit reviews de novo questions of law concerning judicial estoppel). The legal issues presented in this case include: (1) whether the trial court reviewed the defendants’ motion to dismiss under the appropriate standard; and (2) our law concerning judicial estoppel in the bankruptcy context, which is an issue of first impression. We address these issues in turn.', 'III', 'In its order granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss, the trial court identified the following as the applicable standard of review:', 'Generally, in ruling upon a motion to dismiss, the trial court', 'is required to determine whether the allegations contained in the', '[plaintiff’s] pleadings are sufficient to state a basis upon which', '5', 'relief may be granted. To make this determination, the court', 'would normally accept all facts pled by the [plaintiff] as true,', 'construing them most favorably to the [plaintiff]. When the motion', 'to dismiss does not challenge the sufficiency of the [plaintiff’s] legal', 'claim but, instead, raises certain defenses, the trial court must', 'look beyond the [plaintiff’s] unsubstantiated allegations and', 'determine, based on the facts, whether the [plaintiff] ha[s]', 'sufficiently demonstrated [his or her] right to claim relief. K.L.N. Construction Co. v. Town of Pelham, 167 N.H. 180, 183 (2014) (quotations and citations omitted).', 'We note that this standard of review is limited to “certain defenses.” Id. (emphasis added). “A jurisdictional challenge based upon lack of standing is such a defense.” Id. (quotation omitted). We have not, however, included judicial estoppel among such defenses. Therefore, the trial court must assume the truth of the plaintiff’s allegations and construe all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff as the nonmoving party. See, e.g., Surprenant v. Mulcrone, 163 N.H. 529, 530 (2012) (applying this standard to motion to dismiss based on quasi-judicial immunity); Lamprey v. Britton Constr., 163 N.H. 252, 256 (2012) (applying this standard to motions to dismiss based on statutes of limitations and repose); Paul v. Sherburne, 153 N.H. 747, 749 (2006) (applying this standard to motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim); Sutliffe v. Epping School Dist., 627 F. Supp. 2d 41, 44 (D.N.H. 2008) (explaining that a motion to dismiss based on an affirmative defense — such as judicial estoppel — must be evaluated under the same standard as a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, which requires the trial court to “accept the well-pleaded factual allegations . . . as true, drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff’s favor”), aff’d, 584 F.3d 314 (1st Cir. 2009).', 'The trial court indicated that it was assuming the truth of the plaintiff’s allegations in its order granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss. In denying the plaintiff’s motion for reconsideration, however, the trial court stated: “Other than the plaintiff’s bald assertion that her bankruptcy trustee has taken over the instant case, there is nothing in the record to support this contention.” In so ruling, the trial court erred in two respects. First, it failed to credit the plaintiff’s allegation as true, instead imposing a requirement that the plaintiff submit evidence supporting her contention. This is inconsistent with the standard of review applicable at the motion to dismiss stage. See Surprenant, 163 N.H. at 530; Lamprey, 163 N.H. at 256; Paul, 153 N.H. at 749. Second, the trial court overlooked that the plaintiff had attached supporting documentation to her objection to the motion to dismiss. See Beane v. Dana S. Beane & Co., 160 N.H. 708, 711 (2010) (holding that, in ruling on a motion to dismiss, the trial court may consider, among other things, “documents attached to the plaintiff’s pleadings”); DiFruscia v. N.H. Dept. of Pub. Works & Highways, 136 N.H. 202, 204 (1992) (“[I]f additional evidence is submitted,', '6 without objection, the trial court should consider it when making its ruling [on a motion to dismiss].”). Specifically, the plaintiff attached (1) the bankruptcy court’s order granting the motion to reopen to administer the potential asset of the estate (i.e., the medical malpractice claim), (2) the notice of Notinger’s appointment as trustee of the estate, and (3) a letter from Notinger stating his intention to retain the plaintiff’s present counsel to represent him in the pending malpractice action.', 'IV', 'Because the trial court rejected the factual premise that the bankruptcy trustee is pursuing the medical malpractice claim on behalf of the estate, the court did not address whether judicial estoppel should bar the trustee’s pursuit of this claim. The application of judicial estoppel to a trustee pursuing a claim on behalf of a bankruptcy estate presents an issue of first impression in this jurisdiction. We will address this issue on appeal, instead of remanding for the trial court to consider it in the first instance, because the parties have briefed the issue and it presents a question of law in this context. See Lynn v. Wentworth By The Sea Master Ass’n, 169 N.H. 77, 84 (2016) (addressing question of law in the interest of judicial economy instead of remanding to the trial court); cf. Thore, 466 F.3d at 182 (reviewing question of law concerning judicial estoppel de novo).', 'A', 'Before discussing the law concerning judicial estoppel, we provide a brief overview of the relevant bankruptcy principles that affect our analysis. The trustee acts as the representative of the chapter 7 bankruptcy estate, which is created when the debtor files a bankruptcy petition under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq. See 11 U.S.C. §§ 323(a), 541(a) (2012); Slater v. U.S. Steel Corp., 871 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir. 2017) (en banc). Upon the filing of the petition, all of the debtor’s legal and equitable interests in property — including tort claims that accrued before the debtor filed her petition — are immediately transferred to a bankruptcy estate and become property of that estate. Auday v. Wet Seal Retail, Inc., 698 F.3d 902, 904 (6th Cir. 2012); see Slater, 871 F.3d at 1179; 11 U.S.C. § 541(a)(1). This is true even if the interest is not disclosed on the debtor’s bankruptcy schedule. See Kane v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., 535 F.3d 380, 385 (5th Cir. 2008) (per curiam).', 'Property that is not abandoned or administered remains property of the bankruptcy estate. Id.; see 11 U.S.C. § 554(d) (2012). Therefore, “[e]ven after the [bankruptcy] case is closed, the estate continues to retain its interest in unscheduled property.” 5 Alan N. Resnick & Henry J. Sommer, Collier on Bankruptcy ¶ 554.03, at 554-16 (16th ed. 2010); accord Philbrick v. Burbank, 101 N.H. 311, 313 (1958) (adopting the view that “the legal title to [an', '7 unadministered] asset, while necessarily resting in the bankrupt for such purpose as the bringing of a suit thereon, is in custodia legis in the bankruptcy court if the property in question was never abandoned or disposed of”).', 'Because the bankruptcy court has not administered the medical malpractice claim, and the trustee has not abandoned it, the claim is the property of the bankruptcy estate. See 11 U.S.C. § 554(d); Kane, 535 F.3d at 385. The trustee, as the representative of the estate, is vested with the authority to pursue that claim against the defendants as an asset of the estate. See Reed v. City of Arlington, 650 F.3d 571, 575 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc); Moses, 606 F.3d at 793; see also Metrou v. M.A. Mortenson Co., 781 F.3d 357, 360 (7th Cir. 2015) (“The Trustee is entitled to pursue this litigation as an asset of the estate in bankruptcy.”). Thus, by operation of law, the trustee is the real party in interest. See Moses, 606 F.3d at 795-97; Kane, 535 F.3d at 385; Parker v. Wendy’s Intern., Inc., 365 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir. 2004); Stephenson v. Malloy, 700 F.3d 265, 272 (6th Cir. 2012); Hamm v. Norfolk Southern Ry. Co., 52 So. 3d 484, 490 (Ala. 2010).', 'B', 'The defendants contend that judicial estoppel should apply in this case because the trustee “did not affect any substitution or intervention” while the case was in the trial court, and, they assert, “[t]he appeal has been brought by [Alward], not the trustee.” In support of their position, the defendants rely on an unpublished Eleventh Circuit decision, Pavlov v. Ingles Markets, Inc., 236 F. App’x 549 (11th Cir. 2007) (per curiam). We agree with other courts that, under similar circumstances, have found Pavlov inapposite. See Moses v. Howard University Hosp., 601 F. Supp. 2d 1, 4 (D.D.C. 2009), aff’d 606 F.3d 789. In Pavlov, judicial estoppel was not “invoked to bar the claims of a blameless bankruptcy trustee who had failed to formally intervene but nevertheless clearly expressed [his] intent to prosecute a debtor’s claim on behalf of the bankruptcy estate.” Id. “Rather, the doctrine was invoked to bar the claims of [an] individual debtor[ ] notwithstanding the possibility that th[e] debtor[’s] bankruptcy trustee[ ] — who had failed to inject [himself] into the case ‘through intervention or otherwise’ — might have some interest in the action.” Id. (citation omitted) (quoting Pavlov, 236 F. App’x at 550).', 'In this case, unlike in Pavlov, the bankruptcy trustee has clearly expressed his intent to pursue the claim on behalf of the estate. See id. Indeed, the trustee authorized the plaintiff’s counsel to pursue the medical malpractice claim, including prosecuting this appeal, on behalf of the estate. Cf. Slater, 871 F.3d at 1178 (noting the bankruptcy trustee filed, and the bankruptcy court granted, a motion “request[ing] to employ the lawyers who were representing Slater in her employment action to continue to pursue the claims against U.S. Steel on behalf of the estate”); Auday, 698 F.3d at 904 (noting the trustee “applied to the bankruptcy court for authority to hire', '8 Auday’s lawyer . . . to pursue the claim against Wet Seal,” and the bankruptcy court granted the application). Furthermore, the trustee is the real party in interest by operation of law. See Moses, 606 F.3d at 795-97; Kane, 535 F.3d at 385; Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272; Stephenson, 700 F.3d at 272; Hamm, 52 So. 3d at 490. Under these circumstances, a motion to substitute would be “a mere formality” that confirms, rather than initiates, the trustee’s status as the real party in interest. Moses, 606 F.3d at 796-97. Therefore, we disagree with the defendants that the absence of such a substitution is a basis for applying judicial estoppel to the trustee.', 'C', 'We now turn to the law concerning judicial estoppel. New Hampshire has adopted the doctrine of judicial estoppel as part of its common law. See Kelleher v. Marvin Lumber & Cedar Co., 152 N.H. 813, 848 (2005). “The doctrine of judicial estoppel generally prevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a case on an argument and then relying on a contradictory argument to prevail in another phase.” Cohoon v. IDM Software, 153 N.H. 1, 4 (2005) (quotation omitted); accord New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. at 749. “The general function of judicial estoppel is to prevent abuse of the judicial process, resulting in an affront to the integrity of the courts.” Pike v. Mullikin, 158 N.H. 267, 270 (2009) (quotation omitted).', 'While the circumstances under which judicial estoppel may be', 'invoked vary with each situation, the following three factors', 'typically inform the decision whether to apply the doctrine:', '(1) whether the party’s later position is clearly inconsistent with its', 'earlier position; (2) whether the party has succeeded in persuading', 'a court to accept that party’s earlier position; and (3) whether the', 'party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an', 'unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing', 'party if not estopped. In the Matter of Carr & Edmunds, 156 N.H. 498, 502 (2007); see Kelleher, 152 N.H. at 848 (adopting these factors from New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. at 750-51). “‘Additional considerations may inform the doctrine’s application in specific factual contexts.’” Cohoon, 153 N.H. at 6 (quoting New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. at 751).', 'Because we have never addressed the application of judicial estoppel in the bankruptcy context, we look to other jurisdictions for guidance. Several courts, including the First Circuit, have held “that a failure to identify a claim as an asset in a bankruptcy proceeding is a prior inconsistent position that may serve as the basis for application of judicial estoppel, barring the debtor from pursuing the claim in a later proceeding.” Guay v. Burack, 677 F.3d 10, 17 (1st Cir. 2012) (emphasis added); see, e.g., Moses, 606 F.3d at 799-800;', '9 Eastman v. Union Pacific R. Co., 493 F.3d 1151, 1157-60 (10th Cir. 2007); Jethroe v. Omnova Solutions, Inc., 412 F.3d 598, 600-01 (5th Cir. 2005). With respect to whether the trustee should be barred from pursuing the claim, federal courts that have considered the issue have held that “judicial estoppel does not bar a bankruptcy trustee from pursuing claims that the debtor failed to disclose.” Stephenson, 700 F.3d at 271; see Metrou, 781 F.3d at 360; Reed, 650 F.3d at 573; Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272; Eastman, 493 F.3d at 1155 n.3 (noting, in dicta, that the district court’s application of judicial estoppel against the trustee was “[q]uite likely” “inappropriate”); In re Riazuddin, 363 B.R. 177, 187-88 (B.A.P. 10th Cir. 2007); see also Hamm, 52 So. 3d at 494.', 'Courts that have adopted this rule cite several justifications. One is that, unlike the plaintiff-debtor, the bankruptcy trustee “never took an inconsistent position . . . with regard to this claim.” Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272; accord Stephenson, 700 F.3d at 272; Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 188; Hamm, 52 So. 3d at 494; see also Cannon-Stokes v. Potter, 453 F.3d 446, 448 (7th Cir. 2006) (opining that “unless the estate itself engages in contradictory litigation tactics the elements of judicial estoppel are not satisfied”). We agree with this reasoning. The first judicial estoppel factor is not met with respect to the trustee because the trustee did not assert inconsistent positions. See Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272; Stephenson, 700 F.3d at 272; Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 188; Hamm, 52 So. 3d at 494. We need not consider the remaining judicial estoppel factors because we find the lack of inconsistent positions dispositive in this case. See Pike, 158 N.H. at 271 (“Because we find no contradiction in the positions taken, we do not consider the remaining factors which inform the application of judicial estoppel.”); Porter v. City of Manchester, 155 N.H. 149, 157 (2007) (same).', 'The defendants recognize that courts have declined to apply judicial estoppel to a bankruptcy trustee pursuing a claim not disclosed by the debtor, but urge us to reject this view. According to the defendants, “the better rule for the integrity of the judicial system as a whole is that [judicial] estoppel should bind the trustee as well” as the debtor.', 'As an initial matter, we note that there is some debate over which court’s integrity should be the focus of the doctrine. Compare Reed, 650 F.3d at 572 (“[T]he purpose of judicial estoppel . . . in this context is to protect the integrity of the bankruptcy process.”), with Ah Quin v. County of Kauai Dept. of Transp., 733 F.3d 267, 275 (9th Cir. 2013) (“[P]rotecting” and “promoting the efficient operation of the bankruptcy system” “differs from the goal of judicial estoppel — protecting the integrity of the courts”), and Eastman, 493 F.3d at 1156 (“[T]he court where the judicial estoppel defense arises . . . is the court interested in protecting its process.”). For purposes of this appeal, we assume that the bankruptcy system is part of the “judicial process” with which the doctrine of judicial estoppel is concerned. Cf. Pike, 158 N.H. at 270 (“The general function of judicial estoppel is to prevent abuse of the judicial process,', '10 resulting in an affront to the integrity of the courts.” (emphasis added) (quotation omitted)).', 'The defendants argue that judicial estoppel is necessary to protect the integrity of the bankruptcy system because it incentivizes debtors to fully disclose their assets. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that this justification “do[es] not withstand scrutiny.” Ah Quin, 733 F.3d at 274. “[T]he bankruptcy system already provides plenty of protections.” Id. at 275. For example, “the [b]ankruptcy [c]ode allows a bankruptcy case to be reopened in order to administer assets of the estate.” Reed, 650 F.3d at 575; see 11 U.S.C. § 350(b) (2012). Additionally, “the bankruptcy court has tools of its own to punish a debtor who it determines purposefully tried to hide assets.” Slater, 871 F.3d at 1187. “Punishment of dishonest debtors and deterrence of those who would intentionally omit assets from their schedules is adequately addressed . . . in the [bankruptcy code] provisions for denial or revocation of discharge, and in the case law, which allows exemptions to be denied for a debtor’s bad faith.” Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 187. In sum, the bankruptcy court “is quite capable of fashioning a punishment which will redress [the debtor’s] lack of timely disclosure” if the omission was intentional. In re Lewis, 273 B.R. 739, 748 (Bankr. N.D. Ga. 2001). Thus, we agree that “alternative mechanisms exist to more equitably protect the integrity of the bankruptcy system (and prevent undue benefit to the debtor) than the harsh rule imposed” by applying judicial estoppel to the bankruptcy trustee. Robinson v. District of Columbia, 10 F. Supp. 3d 181, 190 n.9 (D.D.C. 2014).', 'We also agree with courts that have recognized how the application of judicial estoppel under these circumstances would be inequitable and would undermine, rather than promote, judicial integrity. “We recognize that all courts have a strong interest in discouraging the misuse of the legal system . . . . It makes little sense, however, to try to further this interest by punishing those whom the truthful disclosure of assets is intended to benefit.” Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 187. Indeed, “[e]stopping the [t]rustee from pursuing the [claim] against the [defendants] would thwart one of the core goals of the bankruptcy system — obtaining a maximum and equitable distribution for creditors — by unnecessarily vaporizing the assets effectively belonging to innocent creditors.” Reed, 650 F.3d at 576 (quotation omitted). Furthermore, it would be “an incongruent remedy” to allow the alleged tortfeasors to escape liability while punishing the creditors of the estate. Thompson v. Quarles, 392 B.R. 517, 527 (S.D. Ga. 2008); see also In re Flugence, 738 F.3d 126, 132 (5th Cir. 2013) (stating that this would “turn[ ] equity on its head”). In effect, this would “cause the very result the doctrine is intended to prevent” — it would “impair[ ] the integrity of the judicial system.” James D. Walker, Jr. & Amber Nickell, Judicial Estoppel and the Eleventh Circuit Consumer Bankruptcy Debtor, 56 Mercer L. Rev. 1115, 1128 (2005). Therefore, we conclude that “[i]mposing the doctrine of judicial estoppel on an innocent bankruptcy trustee, which, in turn, punishes innocent creditors for the mistakes of a debtor, does', '11 not further the purpose of protecting the integrity of the judicial process.” Hamm, 52 So. 3d at 497.', 'We are also not persuaded by the cases the defendants cite in support of their position that the trustee should be judicially estopped from pursuing the claim. For example, Guay, Moses, and In re Superior Crewboats, Inc., 374 F.3d 330 (5th Cir. 2004), are inapposite because the trustee had abandoned the claims in each case, and thus the application of judicial estoppel to the bankruptcy trustee was not at issue. See Guay, 677 F.3d at 15; Moses, 606 F.3d at 791, 795; Superior Crewboats, 374 F.3d at 333. Instead, the issue in those cases was whether the debtors should be judicially estopped from pursuing the claims. See Guay, 677 F.3d at 17; Moses, 606 F.3d at 792; Superior Crewboats, 374 F.3d at 332, 334-36. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit distinguished Superior Crewboats on this basis in Kane and Reed and held that judicial estoppel did not bar the trustee from pursuing the claims. See Kane, 535 F.3d at 386-87; Reed, 650 F.3d at 578. The Fifth Circuit reasoned, and we agree, that it would be inequitable to bar the trustee from pursuing the medical malpractice claim “for the benefit of the estate’s creditors.” Kane, 535 F.3d at 387; accord Reed, 650 F.3d at 576-77.', 'The Eleventh Circuit adopted the same rule in Parker, holding that judicial estoppel does not bar the bankruptcy trustee from pursuing the claim. See Parker, 365 F.3d at 1269, 1272. The Eleventh Circuit reasoned, and we agree, “that because the trustee was the real party in interest in the civil lawsuit, had never taken an inconsistent position . . . , and had not abandoned the discrimination claim,” the trustee’s pursuit of that claim was not barred by judicial estoppel. Slater, 871 F.3d at 1184; see Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendants’ reliance on a different Eleventh Circuit case, Burnes v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., 291 F.3d 1282 (11th Cir. 2002), overruled in part by Slater, 871 F.3d 1174, is misplaced. “[U]nlike Parker, Burnes did not address the application of judicial estoppel to the interests of a bankruptcy trustee who seeks to prosecute claims connected to a bankruptcy estate.” Thompson v. Earthlink Shared Services, LLC, 956 F. Supp. 2d 1317, 1319 (N.D. Ala. 2013); see Burnes, 291 F.3d at 1283 (applying judicial estoppel to the plaintiff-debtor). Moreover, after the parties submitted their briefs, the Eleventh Circuit overruled Burnes on the point for which the defendants cite it, and reaffirmed Parker’s “continued viability.” Slater, 871 F.3d at 1185-86, 1188 n.16. Therefore, we disagree with the other cases cited by the defendants that apply Burnes instead of Parker.', 'D', 'The defendants also argue that the trustee should be bound by the plaintiff’s conduct for purposes of judicial estoppel. We are not persuaded by the case the defendants rely on for this proposition. See In re Fineberg, 202 B.R. 206, 227-28 (Bankr. E.D. Pa. 1996) (raising the issue of judicial estoppel', '12 sua sponte and observing, in dicta, that the trustee’s claims “could conceivably” be barred by judicial estoppel because the debtor and the trustee were “in a relationship of privity with each other”). Instead, we think the better rule is that followed by several federal appellate courts: “where the defense of judicial estoppel arises from a debtor’s failure to disclose a claim in his bankruptcy filings and his subsequent pursuit of that claim, the trustee receives the asset free of this . . . defense.” Stephenson, 700 F.3d at 271 n.6 (quotation, brackets, and ellipsis omitted); accord Reed, 650 F.3d at 575-76; Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272 n.3; Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 188.', 'Courts that have adopted this rule reason that the bankruptcy code “distinguishes between the debtor and the debtor’s estate immediately upon the filing of a [c]hapter 7 bankruptcy.” Reed, 650 F.3d at 574. As the Fifth Circuit explained, “the general principle that a trustee receives causes of action subject to defenses that could have been raised against the debtor ‘has been properly limited to pre-petition defenses to a cause of action that would have been applicable to a debtor if no bankruptcy case had been filed.’” Id. at 575 (emphasis added) (quoting Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 188). The debtor’s omission of a claim from her bankruptcy schedule or failure to amend her schedule to disclose an asset is considered post-petition conduct, which “does not adhere to the [t]rustee.” Id. at 574-75; see Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 188. Therefore, because the plaintiff’s conduct giving rise to the defendants’ judicial estoppel defense did not occur until after the bankruptcy petition was filed and the potential claim had passed into the bankruptcy estate, the estate received the asset free of this defense. See Reed, 650 F.3d at 576; Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272 n.3; Riazuddin, 363 B.R. at 188.', 'E', 'The defendants next argue that the trustee should be judicially estopped from pursuing the medical malpractice claim in light of “the specific facts of this case” — namely, an agreement between the trustee and the plaintiff to split the proceeds of any recovery. For this point, the defendants rely on a document that was never submitted to the trial court: a motion filed in the bankruptcy case by the trustee on November 22, 2016, indicating that the trustee and the plaintiff “have agreed to split the net proceeds” of the medical malpractice action “50/50,” and requesting that the bankruptcy court approve this “settlement” under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 9019(a). See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9019(a) (“On motion by the trustee and after notice and a hearing, the court may approve a compromise or settlement.”).', 'As a general matter, we will not consider documents that were not submitted to the trial court because they are not part of the record. See Sup. Ct. R. 13(1); Flaherty v. Dixey, 158 N.H. 385, 387 (2009). Nevertheless, we will consider the trustee-plaintiff agreement in deciding this appeal in light of the unusual circumstances presented, which include the fact that we are deciding', '13 an issue not reached by the trial court, rather than remanding for the trial court to consider it in the first instance, and we expect that this document would be submitted to the trial court were we instead to remand the case for the trial court to determine whether judicial estoppel applies to the trustee in this case. Additionally, the plaintiff has not moved to strike this document from the defendants’ appendix, her counsel acknowledged the existence of the agreement at oral argument, and both counsel had an opportunity to address it.', 'The trustee-plaintiff agreement has no effect on our conclusion that the trustee is not judicially estopped from pursuing the medical malpractice claim against the defendants. Any agreement between the bankruptcy trustee and the plaintiff to split potential proceeds from the malpractice lawsuit is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court, after a hearing and notice to the creditors. See Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9019(a). The bankruptcy court is solely responsible for deciding how best to administer the assets of an estate in a manner that protects creditors. See Metrou, 781 F.3d at 360.', 'V', 'In sum, the trial court erred in dismissing the medical malpractice claim against the defendants on the basis of judicial estoppel. That claim belongs to the bankruptcy estate. See Parker, 365 F.3d at 1272-73. The representative of that estate, the bankruptcy trustee, is vested with the authority to pursue that claim and is the real party in interest. See Moses, 606 F.3d at 793, 795-97. The trustee “did not make any inconsistent statements to the courts,” and the trustee is “not tainted or burdened” by the plaintiff’s inconsistent statements. Parker, 365 F.3d at 1269, 1273. Furthermore, it would be inequitable to apply judicial estoppel to a trustee pursuing a claim on behalf of innocent creditors, and doing so would undermine, rather than protect, the integrity of the judicial process. For all of these reasons, we hold that the trustee is not judicially estopped from pursuing the medical malpractice claim against the defendants. In light of this holding, we need not address the parties’ remaining arguments, which concern the application of judicial estoppel to the plaintiff. See Thompson, 956 F. Supp. 2d at 1322 & n.6.', 'Reversed and remanded.', 'LYNN, C.J., and BASSETT, J., concurred.', '14 ']"

Collectively, they are referred to as the “Provider Power Companies.”', 'The Freedom Companies and the Provider Power Companies are engaged in the same business — arranging for the supply of electricity and natural gas to commercial and residential customers in New Hampshire and other New England states. The parties’ current dispute concerns a Freedom Company employee whom the defendants hired, without the plaintiffs’ knowledge, allegedly to misappropriate the plaintiffs’ confidential and proprietary information. According to the plaintiffs, the defendants used the information obtained from the employee to harm the plaintiffs’ business by improperly interfering with their relationships with their customers and the employee.', 'After a seven-day jury trial in Superior Court (Anderson, J.), the jury returned verdicts in the plaintiffs’ favor on many of their claims, including those for tortious interference with customer contracts, tortious interference with economic relations with customers, tortious interference with the employee’s contract, and misappropriation of trade secrets. The jury awarded compensatory damages to the plaintiffs on each of these claims, except the misappropriation of trade secrets claim, and included in the damages award $93,000 for the attorney’s fees incurred by the plaintiffs in prior litigation against the employee for his wrongful conduct. The jury’s total damages award, including the attorney’s fees, was $556,208. Subsequently, the trial court awarded attorney’s fees to the plaintiffs under the New Hampshire Uniform Trade Secrets Act (NHUTSA), see RSA ch. 350-B (2009).', 'On appeal, the defendants challenge: (1) the jury’s verdicts on the plaintiffs’ claims for tortious interference with customer contracts and the employee’s contract; (2) the jury’s award of damages for tortious interference with customer contracts and tortious interference with economic relations, and its inclusion in that award of the attorney’s fees incurred in the plaintiffs’ prior litigation against the employee; and (3) the trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to the plaintiffs under the NHUTSA. We affirm.', 'Before addressing the defendants’ numerous appellate arguments, we highlight the following principles. First, we decline to review any argument that the defendants did not raise before the trial court. See State v. Blackmer, 149 N.H. 47, 48 (2003). “The general rule in this jurisdiction is that a contemporaneous and specific objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate review.” Id. (quotation omitted). “This rule, which is based on common sense and judicial economy, recognizes that trial forums should have an opportunity to rule on issues and to correct errors before they are presented to the appellate court.” Id. (quotation omitted). As the appealing parties, it is the defendants’ burden to provide this court with a record demonstrating that they raised their appeal arguments before the trial court. See Bean v. Red Oak Prop. Mgmt., 151 N.H. 248, 250 (2004). Moreover, although the plain error', '2 rule allows us to consider errors not brought to the attention of the trial court, see Sup. Ct. R. 16-A, in this case, we exercise our discretion to consider plain error only when the defendants specifically argue under that rule.', 'Second, we confine our review to only those issues that the defendants have fully briefed. See Blackmer, 149 N.H. at 49. “[I]n the realm of appellate review, a mere laundry list of complaints regarding adverse rulings by the trial court, without developed legal argument, is insufficient to warrant judicial review.” Id. (quotation omitted).', 'Third, we will not review any issue that the defendants address in their brief, but did not raise in their notice of appeal. See id. An argument that is not raised in a party’s notice of appeal is not preserved for appellate review. Id. For example, although the defendants purport to challenge the jury’s verdict on the plaintiffs’ misappropriation of trade secrets claim, the argument is not preserved for our review because the defendants did not include that issue in their notice of appeal.', 'Similarly, we will not address any issue that the defendants raised in their notice of appeal, but did not brief. The defendants raise 27 questions in their notice of appeal, but have briefed far fewer. Any issue that the defendants raised in their notice of appeal, but did not brief, is deemed waived. See In re Estate of King, 149 N.H. 226, 230 (2003).', 'With these principles in mind, we address only a fraction of the defendants’ arguments. We do not address other arguments either because they were not preserved, were not sufficiently developed for appellate review, were not raised in the defendants’ notice of appeal, or were raised in the notice of appeal but not briefed. I. The Defendants’ Challenges to the Jury Verdicts', 'A. Tortious Interference with Customer Contracts', '1. PNE', 'After trial, the defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) as to the plaintiffs’ tortious interference with certain of PNE’s customer contracts on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that those contracts remained valid after February 2013. According to the defendants, in February 2013, PNE “failed financially because it was unable to maintain its required financial sureties with ISO [New England],” which the defendants assert, manages the “wholesale power transmission market, sometimes referred to as ‘the grid.’” The defendants contend that, as a result, ISO New England “suspended PNE’s participation in the power market and directed the host utility,” Public Service of New Hampshire (PSNH), “to assume', '3 responsibility” for the electricity used by PNE’s customers by February 20, 2013. The defendants state that, on February 20, “all of PNE’s customers were transferred to PSNH for their electricity needs, and PNE stopped buying electricity and re-selling the electricity to its customers.” The defendants concede that “PNE was released from its suspension[ ] . . . in late March 2013,” but contend that PNE “was not able to immediately recover financially and was not back up and running until June.” The defendants argued that they were entitled to JNOV with regard to PNE’s contracts with the customers that transferred to PSNH because the plaintiffs failed to prove that PNE maintained contracts with those customers after it was suspended.', 'The trial court denied the defendants’ motion, finding that “there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that the [challenged] contracts continued even after the customers were transferred to PSNH.” For instance, the trial court noted, the employee “testified that, on behalf of [the] [p]laintiffs, he would maintain the relationships with customers even after they were transferred to a utility during periods of market volatility.” The trial court stated that the employee also testified that, as part of the service that the plaintiffs provided to customers, the employee “would keep the customers abreast of market conditions and forecasts, so that when rates went down customers could return to [the] [p]laintiffs for their service.” According to the employee, “this service was part of the contractual relationship.” The trial court also determined that there was sufficient evidence from which the jury could have found that the plaintiffs and their customers “contemplated this sort of short- term transfer.” The defendants argue that the trial court erred in so ruling.', 'A motion for JNOV relates to the sufficiency of the evidence and presents a question of law. Murray v. McNamara, 167 N.H. 474, 478 (2015). A party is entitled to JNOV only when the sole reasonable inference that may be drawn from the evidence, which must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non- moving party, is so overwhelmingly in favor of the moving party that no contrary verdict could stand. Id. at 478-79. The court cannot weigh the evidence or inquire into the credibility of the witnesses, and if the evidence adduced at trial is conflicting, or if several reasonable inferences may be drawn, the motion should be denied. Id. at 479.', 'Although in the past we have stated that we will not overturn the trial court’s decision absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion, id., in fact, because a motion for JNOV presents a question of law, our review is de novo, see Ellis v. Candia Trailers & Snow Equip., 164 N.H. 457, 463 (2012) (explaining that “[w]e review questions of law de novo”).', 'Based upon our review of the record, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred by denying the defendants’ motion for JNOV. As the trial court aptly observed, the evidence adduced at trial was conflicting, and while the defendants’ evidence “may have cast doubt” on the plaintiffs’ evidence, it “did', '4 not prevent a reasonable jury” from finding that “the contractual relationships continued after the suspension.”', '2. Resident Power', 'The defendants argue that they were entitled to JNOV with regard to certain of Resident Power’s customers because, although Resident Power was not suspended, it “suffered significant reputational damage because it was so closely linked to PNE, which was suspended.” Moreover, the defendants assert, Resident Power’s contracts with certain customers provided for automatic termination of the contract if a party ceases conducting business “in the ordinary sense,” and, following PNE’s suspension, Resident Power ceased conducting business “in the ordinary sense.” According to the defendants, “Resident Power effectively ceas[ed] to conduct business in the ordinary sense” because it “could not transfer the customers placed with PNE to a new supplier without the customers’ permission or without facing slamming allegations.”', 'In denying the defendants’ motion for JNOV, the trial court determined that the phrase “to conduct business in the ordinary sense” is ambiguous “as it could be reasonably understood to mean either a significant disruption in business, however fleeting in length, or the permanent shutdown of operations.” (Quotation omitted.) The trial court concluded that, given the provision’s ambiguity, “the jury was entitled to decide [its] meaning and application.”', 'Because the defendants do not argue otherwise, we assume without deciding that the meaning of the provision was a fact question for the jury to decide. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we cannot say that the sole reasonable inference is that Resident Power ceased to “conduct business in the ordinary sense” when PNE was suspended. See Murray, 167 N.H. at 478-79. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court’s denial of the defendants’ motion for JNOV on this ground was not erroneous.', 'B. Tortious Interference with the Employee’s Contract', 'The defendants assert that the trial court erred when it declined their request for “an instruction that required the jury to find” that the non-compete provision in the employee’s contract with the plaintiffs “was backed by consideration.” The defendants argue that, without such an instruction, “[t]he jury was conclusively required to presume the validity of [the employee’s] non- compete agreement.” They further argue that, in fact, the non-compete provision lacked consideration and, therefore, that “the trial court’s refusal to instruct the jury as requested was error because the jury could have been misled into basing its verdict on a misperception of the law, that is, that there can be interference with an invalid contract.” (Quotations omitted.)', '5', 'The purpose of jury instructions is to identify issues of material fact, and to explain to the jury, in clear and intelligible language, the proper standards of law by which it is to resolve them. N.H. Ball Bearings v. Jackson, 158 N.H. 421, 433-34 (2009). The scope and wording of jury instructions, however, are within the sound discretion of the trial judge and are evaluated as a reasonable juror would have interpreted them. Id. at 434. A trial court need not use the exact words of any party’s jury instruction request. Peterson v. Gray, 137 N.H. 374, 377 (1993). A jury charge is sufficient as a matter of law if it fairly presents the case to the jury such that no injustice is done to the legal rights of the parties. Jackson, 158 N.H. at 434. In a civil case, we review jury instructions in context. Id. We will reverse if the charge, taken in its entirety, fails to explain adequately the law applicable to the case in such a way that the jury could have been misled. Id.', 'We disagree with the defendants’ assertion that the jury instructions did not require the jury to find that the employee’s non-compete agreement was supported by consideration. Viewing the instructions in context and as a whole, we conclude that they adequately explained to the jury that for the jury to find that the employee’s non-compete agreement existed, the jury had to find that it was supported by consideration.', 'When the court instructed the jury on the plaintiffs’ tortious interference with customer contracts claim, it told the jury:', 'Onto the second claim, intentional interference with', 'customer contract.

They must', 'also show which of the Plaintiffs was harmed by the conduct of any', 'Defendant. I’ll now explain these elements to you.', '6', 'The first element that the Plaintiffs must prove is that they', 'had an existing contract.

In order to prevail in this claim, the Plaintiffs must', 'prove by a balance of the probability that one[,] one or more of the', 'Plaintiffs had a contract with [the employee]; two, the Defendants', 'knew of that contractual relationship; three, the Defendants', 'intentionally, improperly, wrongfully and in bad faith induced [the', 'employee] to breach his agreement with the Plaintiffs[;] and four,', 'the Plaintiffs were damaged by the interference.', 'As [with] Claim 2, you must determine whether any of the', 'Plaintiffs entered into a valid or voidable contract with [the', 'employee].

(Emphasis added.) The court also instructed the jury that, as with the tortious interference with customer contracts claim, for the tortious interference with the employee’s contract claim, “[t]he Plaintiffs are not required to prove that the contract is enforceable; in other words, a voidable contract is still a contract on which Plaintiffs may base a claim.” In its written instructions, the court explained that, to prove the existence of a contract, the plaintiffs had to establish that the contract was supported by “adequate consideration.”', 'Reading the jury instructions as a whole, we conclude that the trial court correctly instructed the jury that “[t]o prove the existence of a contract,” including the employee’s contract, the plaintiffs had to prove that the contract was supported by adequate consideration.', 'To the extent that the defendants argue that they were entitled to JNOV because the plaintiffs failed to prove that the non-compete agreement was supported by consideration, we disagree. The trial court determined that the plaintiffs’ continuation of the employee’s at-will employment constituted consideration for the covenant not to compete. See Smith, Batchelder & Rugg v. Foster, 119 N.H. 679, 683 (1979). The trial court also found that the agreement was supported by consideration because it allowed the employee to use company e-mail and to receive commissions. Although the defendants asserted that the continuation of the relationship did not furnish consideration because the employee obtained no additional benefit by continuing the relationship, the trial court disagreed. The court observed that the defendants’ argument was “predicated on their assertion that [the employee] had already earned the commissions on the customers he signed.”', 'The trial court determined that, in fact, the original agreement between the plaintiffs and the employee was unclear as to when the employee earned commissions. In light of the ambiguity in the original agreement and “the uncertain business environment in February 2013,” the court determined that the employee and the plaintiffs could have had a good faith dispute over his entitlement to commissions. The non-compete agreement, the court ruled, resolved that good faith dispute, and the resolution of such a dispute furnished adequate consideration.', 'We find no error in the trial court’s analysis. See Foster, 119 N.H. at 683 (explaining that “[c]ontinued employment after signing an employment contract', '8 constitutes consideration for a covenant not to compete therein”). On appeal, the defendants do not address the trial court’s analysis, and, therefore, they have failed to persuade us that the trial court erred when it denied their motion for JNOV as to whether the employee’s non-compete agreement was supported by consideration. II. The Defendants’ Challenges to the Jury’s Damages Award', 'A. Duplicate Recovery', 'The defendants contend that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that it could not award damages to the plaintiffs for both tortious interference with customer contracts and tortious interference with economic relations because those claims were alternative theories of recovery. The defendants concede that they did not request that instruction, but assert that because “the error did not arise until the trial court accepted . . . verdicts” on both claims, their motion for JNOV properly preserved their argument for our review.', '“A contemporaneous objection is necessary to preserve a jury instruction issue for appellate review.” Clark & Lavey Benefits Solutions v. Educ. Dev. Ctr., 157 N.H. 220, 223 (2008) (quotation omitted). Absent a contemporaneous objection, the trial court is not afforded the opportunity to correct, in a timely fashion, an error it may have made. Id. “This long-standing requirement is grounded in common sense and judicial economy, and applies equally to civil and criminal matters.” Id. (quotation omitted). Generally speaking, “[a]ll objections to a jury charge are waived unless taken on the record before the jury retires.” Snelling v. City of Claremont, 155 N.H. 674, 688 (2007); see Transmedia Restaurant Co. v. Devereaux, 149 N.H. 454, 458-59 (2003) (holding that challenge to trial court’s failure to provide a jury instruction was not preserved by post-trial motions). Thus, the defendants’ motion for JNOV failed to preserve their jury instruction argument.', 'Alternatively, the defendants assert their jury instruction argument under our plain error rule. See Sup. Ct. R. 16-A. The plain error rule allows us to consider errors not brought to the attention of the trial court. Clark & Lavey Benefits Solutions, 157 N.H. at 225. However, the rule should be used sparingly, its use limited to those circumstances in which a miscarriage of justice would otherwise result. Id. “For us to find error under the rule: (1) there must be an error; (2) the error must be plain; (3) the error must affect substantial rights; and (4) the error must seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” Id. (quotation omitted). Because the plaintiffs do not argue otherwise, we assume without deciding that plain error review of the trial court’s jury instruction is available. See id.', '9', 'We conclude that the trial court did not err. Under New Hampshire law, “a plaintiff cannot claim multiple recoveries for the same loss even though different theories of liability are alleged.” Snelling, 155 N.H. at 690. When a plaintiff’s theories of recovery “arise from the same set of operative facts,” the plaintiff “is entitled to only a single recovery.” Id. at 691.', 'In the instant case, the trial court instructed the jury that the plaintiffs could not “recover more than once for the same loss even if they allege different theories of legal fault on the part of the [d]efendants.” The trial court further instructed the jury that “if the [p]laintiffs’ claims arise out of a common core of facts[,] only a single recovery will be made, even if you find for the [p]laintiffs on more than one of their claims.” Viewing the jury instructions as a whole, we cannot conclude that it fails to explain adequately New Hampshire’s law about double recovery. See Jackson, 158 N.H. at 434. Thus, we hold that the defendants cannot prevail on their jury instruction claim under our plain error rule.', 'To the extent that the defendants argue that the jury, in fact, awarded the plaintiffs a double recovery by awarding damages on both the tortious interference with customer contracts claim and the tortious interference with economic relations claim, we disagree. We must presume that the jury followed the trial court’s instructions, which precluded the jury from allowing the plaintiffs to “recover more than once for the same loss.” See Nilsson v. Bierman, 150 N.H. 393, 403 (2003).', 'B. Damages for Tortious Interference with Customer Contracts and', 'Tortious Interference with Economic Relations', 'The defendants moved to set aside the jury’s award of damages on the tortious interference with customer contracts and tortious interference with economic relations claims. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that the jury’s award was neither conclusively against the weight of the evidence nor wholly unreasonable. The court observed that the plaintiffs proved their damages largely through the testimony of Bart Fromuth, the son of the owner of the Freedom Companies. Fromuth estimated damages based upon each customer’s average electricity usage, the plaintiffs’ commission or marginal profit per kilowatt hour, and the average retention length for the customers. From those variables, Fromuth calculated what each lost customer would have spent on electricity, and, consequently, what the plaintiffs would have earned, over the duration of the contract or economic relationship.', 'The trial court acknowledged that, as the defendants asserted, Fromuth’s calculations were based upon the following assumptions: Fromuth assumed “that the customer’s usage going forward would have been consistent with its average usage; that each lost customer would have stayed with [the] [p]laintiffs as long as the estimated average; and that market conditions like those in', '10 February 2013 would not have occurred and caused [the] [p]laintiffs to lose customers.”', 'The trial court determined that “the jury could credit Fromuth’s testimony regarding damages despite the assumptions underlying his calculations” because his assumptions were “reasonable.” The court explained:', 'Where variables could be determined by reference to the particular', 'customer’s information, they were[,] . . . and where they could not,', 'Fromuth used reasonable assumptions based on historical data', '[the] [p]laintiffs possessed. Since the question of how long lost', 'customers would have stayed if not for [the] [d]efendants’', 'interference was hypothetical, such assumptions were necessary in', 'order to come to a reasonable assessment of damages.', 'The trial court observed that, as the defendants contended, Fromuth’s methodology did not account for the reputational harm that the plaintiffs suffered when PNE was suspended or the possibility that customers would have terminated their contracts or economic relationships with the plaintiffs prematurely. Those considerations, the court ruled, “could bear on the jury’s assessment of Fromuth’s testimony, but . . . are not so weighty that they should have compelled the jury to reject [it].”', 'The court also declined to find the award “unreasonable simply because [it] did not exactly correspond with [the] [p]laintiffs’ requested damages.” The trial court explained: “The jury’s task was not to blindly accept or reject [the] [p]laintiffs’ request.” Rather, it was “to determine based on the evidence presented to [it] the damages to which [the] [p]laintiffs were entitled.”', '“New Hampshire law does not require that damages be calculated with mathematical certainty, and the method used to compute them need not be more than an approximation.” Blouin v. Sanborn, 155 N.H. 704, 707 (2007). Direct review of a damages award is the responsibility of the trial judge, who may disturb a verdict as excessive (or inadequate) if its amount is conclusively against the weight of the evidence. Id. The court may also order remittitur if the verdict is “manifestly exorbitant.” Id. (quotation omitted). The amount of a verdict is conclusively against the weight of the evidence only if no reasonable jury could have reached it. Id. Once the trial court has reviewed the amount of the verdict under this standard, we will not disturb its finding unless no reasonable person could have made it. Id. Our task upon review is not to attempt to ascertain the one and only correct verdict. Id.', 'On appeal, the defendants repeat the arguments that they made in the trial court. We do not find those arguments sufficient grounds for us to disturb the trial court’s decision. See id.', '11', 'C. Attorney’s Fees as Damages', 'Before the trial court instructed the jury, the parties discussed whether the plaintiffs could recover as damages the attorney’s fees they incurred when they sued the employee for his wrongful conduct. The defendants contended that such fees were not recoverable because there was insufficient evidence that they were the “natural necessary consequence” of the defendants’ allegedly tortious conduct. See Symetra Life Ins. Co. v. Rapid Settlements, Ltd., 775 F.3d 242, 251 (5th Cir. 2014) (explaining that, under Texas law, attorney’s fees incurred in prior litigation may be recovered as damages in a later suit based upon tortious interference with contract “where the natural and proximate . . . consequences of prior wrongful acts had been to involve a plaintiff in litigation’’ (quotation and ellipsis omitted)); Hubbard v. Gould, 74 N.H. 25, 28 (1906) (“If it is established that the defendants and not the plaintiff are responsible for the injury to [the third party’s] horse, the expenses reasonably incurred in good faith by [the plaintiff] in litigating the questions raised by [the third party’s] claim are part of his damages . . . .”).', 'The trial court disagreed and instructed the jury as follows:', 'Plaintiffs request damages for the attorney[’s] fees which they', 'incurred in their prior litigation against [the employee]. In order', 'for Plaintiffs to be entitled to such an award, they must prove', 'that[:] one, they incurred reasonable attorney[’s] fees in the', 'prosecution of the action against [the employee]; two, the litigation', 'must have been against [the employee] and not against any of the', 'Defendants in this case[;] and three, they became involved in such', 'litigation because of some tort[i]ous act of the Defendants.', 'Therefore, if you find the Plaintiffs were forced to institute', 'the litigation against [the employee] because of the Defendants[’]', 'tort[i]ous conduct you may award Plaintiffs the fees incurred in', 'that prior litigation.', 'If you find the Defendants committed no tort[i]ous conduct', 'or the Defendants[’] tort[i]ous conduct did not force Plaintiffs to', 'institute the litigation against [the employee], you should not', 'award Plaintiffs their requested fees. Consistent with that instruction, the jury’s damage award included $93,000 in attorney’s fees the plaintiffs incurred in their prior lawsuit against the employee.', 'Thereafter, the defendants moved for JNOV arguing, first, that the evidence failed to establish that the litigation against the employee was the “natural consequence” of the defendants’ allegedly tortious conduct. The trial', '12 court ruled that “there was sufficient evidence to show that [the] [d]efendants’ misconduct forced [the] [p]laintiffs to institute the suit against [the employee].” Specifically, the trial court observed that the plaintiffs presented evidence that they sued the employee so as to enforce his contractual promises. The trial court also observed that the plaintiffs presented evidence that the defendants caused the employee to breach his agreements with the plaintiffs: the employee testified that the owners of Provider Power Companies encouraged him to take the plaintiffs’ customer information and sales leads to use for the defendants’ benefit. Although the trial court acknowledged that, as the defendants contended, the employee “was the primary perpetrator of the torts,” the court ruled that this fact “did not prevent the jury from assessing fees against [the] [d]efendants” given that the jury found that they conspired with the employee “to engage in the tortious misconduct.”', 'In their motion for JNOV, the defendants also argued, for the first time, that the plaintiffs failed to prove that their attorney’s fees were reasonable. The trial court ruled that the argument was waived because the defendants did not raise it before the jury deliberated. The trial court observed that the defendants did not include this argument in their motions for a directed verdict or in their objections to the jury instructions.', 'On appeal, the defendants reiterate their trial court assertion that the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover the fees as damages in the instant action because the evidence failed to demonstrate that the lawsuit against the employee “was . . . the natural consequence of [the] [d]efendants’ purportedly tortious conduct.” Viewing the evidence, including that upon which the trial court relied, in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, we cannot say that the sole reasonable inference is that the lawsuit was not the natural consequence of the defendants’ purportedly tortious conduct. See Murray, 167 N.H. at 478- 79. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court’s denial of the defendants’ motion for JNOV on this ground was not erroneous.', 'The defendants next assert that the trial court erred when it instructed the jury that it could include the previously incurred attorney’s fees in the damages award. The defendants contend that the trial court’s instruction is error because, according to the defendants, New Hampshire has not adopted the “tort of another” doctrine as an exception to the general rule that each party is responsible for his or her own attorney’s fees. See Shelton v. Tamposi, 164 N.H. 490, 501 (2013). Under that doctrine, “[o]ne who through the tort of another has been required to act in the protection of his interests by bringing or defending an action against a third person is entitled to recover reasonable compensation for . . . attorney fees . . . thereby suffered or incurred in the earlier action.” Restatement (Second) of Torts § 914(2), at 492 (1979).', 'However, as the plaintiffs correctly observe, the defendants have not preserved this argument for our review. The record demonstrates that the', '13 defendants did not argue before the trial court that the court’s proposed jury instruction was inconsistent with New Hampshire law. Thus, we decline to consider that argument on appeal.', 'The defendants next contend that the trial court committed plain error when it concluded that they waived their argument regarding the plaintiffs’ failure to prove that the attorney’s fees were reasonable. See Sup. Ct. R. 16-A. We disagree that the trial court’s ruling constituted error.', '“The well-established rule is that an objection to the sufficiency of evidence is waived unless taken at a time when there may still be an opportunity to supply the deficiency,” i.e., before the court instructs the jury. Carlisle v. Frisbie Mem. Hosp., 152 N.H. 762, 767 (2005) (quotation omitted). Here, as the trial court aptly noted, the defendants did not argue, prior to the court instructing the jury, that the plaintiffs’ proof of reasonableness was insufficient. Thus, the trial court’s determination that the defendants waived that argument is consistent with New Hampshire law and does not constitute error. III. Attorney’s Fees Under the New Hampshire Uniform Trade Secrets Act', 'The defendants contend that the trial court erred when it awarded the plaintiffs’ prevailing party attorney’s fees under the NHUTSA. A prevailing party may be awarded attorney’s fees when recovery of fees is authorized by statute, an agreement between the parties, or an established judicial exception to the general rule that precludes recovery of such fees. In the Matter of Mason & Mason, 164 N.H. 391, 398 (2012). We will not overturn the trial court’s decision concerning attorney’s fees absent an unsustainable exercise of discretion. Id. at 399. We give substantial deference to the trial court’s decision on attorney’s fees. Id.', 'We review the trial court’s interpretation of the NHUTSA de novo. See Petition of State Employees’ Assoc., 161 N.H. 476, 478 (2011). We are the final arbiter of the intent of the legislature as expressed in the words of the statute considered as a whole. Id. When examining the language of a statute, we ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning to the words used. Id. We interpret a statute in the context of the statutory scheme and not in isolation. Id. at 479. Our goal is to apply statutes in light of the legislature’s intent in enacting them, and in light of the policy sought to be advanced by the entire statutory scheme. Id.', 'To interpret the NHUTSA, we also rely upon the official comments to the Uniform Trade Secrets Act. See In the Matter of Ball & Ball, 168 N.H. 133, 137 (2015) (discussing interpretation of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act). When interpreting a uniform law, such as the NHUTSA, “the intention of the drafters of a uniform act becomes the legislative intent upon enactment.” Id.', '14 (quotation omitted). In addition, we consider the interpretation of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act by other jurisdictions. See id. “The opinions from courts in other jurisdictions are relevant because uniform laws should be interpreted to effect their general purpose to make uniform the laws of those states that enact them.” Id. (quotation omitted); see RSA 350-B:8 (stating that the NHUTSA “shall be applied and construed to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect to the subject [of trade secrets] among states enacting it”).', 'RSA 350-B:4, III provides, “The court may award reasonable attorney’s fees to the prevailing party when . . . [w]illful and malicious misappropriation exists.” The pertinent official comment to the Uniform Trade Secrets Act explains that this provision “allows a court to award reasonable attorney fees to a prevailing party . . . as a deterrent to . . . willful and malicious misappropriation.” Unif. Trade Secrets Act § 4 Comment (amended 1985). The comment states that, when willful and malicious appropriation is at issue, “the court should take into consideration the extent to which a complainant will recover exemplary damages in determining whether additional attorney’s fees should be awarded” and the court should rely upon patent law “to determine whether attorney’s fees should be awarded even if there is a jury.” Id.; see, e.g., Clearone Communications, Inc. v. Biamp Systems, 653 F.3d 1163, 1186 (10th Cir. 2011) (concluding that interpretation of patent law fee-shifting provision “provides persuasive guidance” in interpreting the attorney’s fee provision of Utah’s Uniform Trade Secrets Act).', 'The Patent Act authorizes an award of attorney’s fees to the prevailing party “in exceptional cases.” 35 U.S.C. § 285 (2012); see Octane Fitness v. ICON Health & Fitness, 134 S. Ct. 1749, 1752 (2014). A case is considered to be “exceptional” when it “stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party’s litigating position (considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.” Octane Fitness, 134 S. Ct. at 1756. To determine whether a case is “exceptional,” the court applies a totality of the circumstances test. Id. One of the factors that may bear upon this determination is “the need in particular circumstances to advance considerations of compensation and deterrence.” Id. at 1756 & n.6 (quotation omitted).', 'Here, the trial court used a totality of the circumstances test to determine whether to award attorney’s fees to the plaintiffs under the NHUTSA. The court considered the fact that the jury did not award the plaintiffs damages for their misappropriation claim, but concluded that the extent of the defendants’ malice and willfulness outweighed that fact. The court also observed that awarding fees in this case furthered the goals of the NHUTSA to maintain standards of commercial ethics and deter intentional misappropriation of trade secrets. As the court explained:', '15', 'The jury could have reasonably found that [the] [d]efendants', 'exploited [the employee’s] position to siphon confidential customer', 'information and sales leads in order to secure a competitive', 'advantage in the same market in which [the] [p]laintiffs operated.', 'This is not a case where the misappropriated information was put', 'to some use that could only indirectly harm [the] [p]laintiffs; it was', 'wielded in the exact manner [that the] UTSA was enacted to', 'discourage. Upon consideration of the record and the trial court’s order, we conclude that the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion when it awarded the plaintiffs their attorney’s fees under the NHUTSA.', 'In arguing for a contrary result, the defendants invite us, in construing the NHUTSA, to apply case law developed under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (2012) (Section 1988). See Farrar v. Hobby, 506 U.S. 103, 114, 115 (1992) (concluding that, in a Section 1988 case, there are “some circumstances” when a prevailing party’s victory for purposes of Section 1988 is so “technical” that the plaintiff should not recover any attorney’s fees (quotation omitted)). We decline their invitation.', 'The defendants next assert that, even if the plaintiffs are entitled to fees under the NHUTSA, the trial court was required “to apportion the attorney time consumed in preparing and proving [the] misappropriation [claim]” from that consumed preparing and proving the plaintiffs’ other claims. The defendants contend that “[a]lthough a number of fundamental facts were essential” to all of the plaintiffs’ claims, “that does not mean they all required the same research, discovery, proof, or legal expertise.” (Quotation omitted.) The defendants argue that the plaintiffs’ misappropriation of trade secrets claim is analytically severable from the plaintiffs’ other claims, observing, for instance, that “the law regarding misappropriation of trade secrets and tortious interference is not the same.”', 'Under New Hampshire law, when a party prevails on some claims and not others, and the successful and unsuccessful claims are analytically severable, any fee award should be reduced to exclude time spent on unsuccessful claims. Appeal of the Local Gov’t Ctr., 165 N.H. 790, 814 (2014). The defendants imply that a different standard should apply in this case because it involves a claim for which attorney’s fees are statutorily authorized (misappropriation of trade secrets) and claims for which there is no such statutory authorization. They cite Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 313 (Tex. 2006), for the proposition that “[i]ntertwined facts[,] alone, do not make unrecoverable fees recoverable.” Under Texas law, “if any attorney’s fees relate solely to a claim for which such fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must segregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.” Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 313. However, “when discrete legal services advance both a', '16 recoverable and unrecoverable claim[,] . . . they are so intertwined that they need not be segregated.” Id. at 313-14. The record does not demonstrate that the defendants argued before the trial court that the trial court should adopt the Texas standard. Therefore, we conclude that their argument is not preserved for our review, and we apply our traditional standard to this case.', 'Under New Hampshire law, claims are “analytically severable” when they seek different relief, see Funtown USA, Inc. v. Town of Conway, 129 N.H. 352, 356 (1987); claims are not “analytically severable” when they constitute alternative theories of recovery and the evidence necessary to prove liability under one theory is relevant to prove liability under the other theory, see LaMontagne Builders v. Brooks, 154 N.H. 252, 261 (2006).', 'Here, the court determined that all of the plaintiffs’ “claims share a common core of facts that make severance impracticable and unreasonable.” The court determined that “[t]he facts relevant to each claim overlap significantly, and the investigation and work performed to prosecute one claim necessarily related to the others.” Because there is record support for those determinations, we uphold them, and conclude, therefore, that the trial court did not unsustainably exercise its discretion when it declined “to apportion the attorney time consumed in preparing and proving [the] misappropriation” claim from that consumed preparing and proving the plaintiffs’ other claims.', 'Affirmed.', 'DALIANIS, C.J., and HICKS and LYNN, JJ., concurred.', '17 ']"

The SEA, the NEPBA, the Teamsters Local 633 (Teamsters), the New Hampshire Troopers Association (NHTA), and the New Hampshire State Police Command Staff of the New Hampshire Troopers Association are individual unions that, together, represent approximately 50 separate state employee bargaining units. In December 2016, those five unions began negotiating with the State on successor contracts under RSA 273-A:9, I (2010), which requires unions representing state employees to negotiate with the State as a “bargaining committee” on “[a]ll cost items and terms and conditions of employment affecting state employees.” The first session was an organizational meeting, where the parties identified spokespersons, discussed bargaining schedules, reviewed, revised, and signed “ground rules,” and discussed and agreed upon the order in which each of the five unions would make “proposal presentations” to the State.', 'After several bargaining sessions, the State rejected all wage proposals, explaining that “the Governor was not offering any wage increases . . . given anticipated increases in prescription drug costs in the healthcare market.” As a result, on March 7, 2017, the Teamsters and the NHTA declared an impasse. See RSA 273-A:1, VI (2010) (defining “impasse” as the parties’ failure, “having exhausted all their arguments, to achieve agreement in the course of good faith bargaining, resulting in a deadlock in negotiations”).', 'Although no other unions declared an impasse, the State took the position that all five unions must proceed to impasse mediation. See generally RSA 273-A:12 (Supp. 2017) (setting forth the procedures the parties must use when they have reached an impasse in negotiations, including mediation and fact-finding by a neutral third party). The SEA challenged the State on this position, and subsequently, the petitioners each filed complaints with the PELRB. During the pendency of these complaints, the State advised all five unions that it would select a mediator and continued to assert that all of the unions must participate in impasse mediation “because the issues to be resolved affected all bargaining units.”', 'The PELRB consolidated the petitioners’ complaints and found in a 2-1 vote that RSA 273-A:9, I, “requires all five unions to utilize the Union Committee format at the bargaining table and during impasse resolution proceedings until such time as the common terms and condition[s] of employment are settled.” Based upon that determination, the PELRB found: (1) the State was “entitled to insist that the five unions continue to adhere to the Union Committee format in the event one or more unions declares a bargaining impasse” in negotiating common costs, terms, and conditions; and', '2 (2) the unions have the obligation to “coordinate with each other” to determine whether the bargaining committee will engage with the State at the bargaining table or in impasse resolution proceedings. The PELRB, therefore, dismissed the complaints and ordered the petitioners to coordinate with the other unions “to determine the forum in which negotiations will go forward.” The petitioners unsuccessfully moved for rehearing, and this appeal followed.', '“RSA chapter 541 governs our review of PELRB decisions.” Appeal of Nashua Sch. Dist., 170 N.H. 386, 391 (2017) (quotation omitted); see RSA 273- A:14 (2010). “Pursuant to RSA 541:13 (2007), we will not set aside the PELRB’s order except for errors of law, unless we are satisfied, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that it is unjust or unreasonable.” Nashua Sch.

They assert that the PELRB’s interpretation of RSA 273-A:9, I: (1) contradicts the plain language of the statute; and (2) leads to an absurd result.

See, e.g., RSA 273-A:3, II(a) (2010) (explaining when and how the parties must commence negotiations), :12 (setting forth impasse resolution procedures). RSA 273-A:3, I, sets forth a general rule that requires all parties “to negotiate in good faith.” “‘Good faith’ negotiation involves meeting at reasonable times and places in an effort to reach agreement on the terms of employment, and [cooperating] in mediation and fact-finding required by this chapter.” RSA 273-A:3, I; see also RSA 273- A:5, I(g) (prohibiting any public employer from “refus[ing] to negotiate in good faith with the exclusive representative of a bargaining unit”). In this way, “good faith” negotiation encompasses all parts of the negotiating process.', 'RSA 273-A:9, I, sets forth an additional rule that applies only to negotiations between the State and the unions representing state employees. RSA 273-A:9, I, provides:', 'All cost items and terms and conditions of employment', 'affecting state employees in the classified system generally shall be', 'negotiated by the state, represented by the governor as chief', 'executive, with a single employee bargaining committee comprised', 'of exclusive representatives of all interested bargaining units.', 'Negotiations regarding terms and conditions of employment unique', 'to individual bargaining units shall be negotiated individually with', 'the representatives of those units by the governor. RSA 273-A:9, I, sets forth a framework for negotiations to occur between the Governor, on behalf of the State, and a single committee comprised of the exclusive representatives of all interested bargaining units when negotiating common cost items and terms and conditions of employment. This framework arguably provides for efficient and fair negotiations between the State and the unions on cost items and terms and conditions of employment that affect all unions representing state employees.', 'RSA 273-A:12, which applies to all public bargaining units and public employers, sets forth detailed procedures designed to assist parties who are at an impasse in negotiations reach a resolution to their dispute. When the parties reach an impasse, RSA 273-A:12, I(b) requires the parties to engage in mediation with a neutral third party. The statute further provides that, if the parties so choose, or if mediation does not resolve the dispute, a neutral party chosen by the parties or appointed by the PELRB shall make and report', '4 findings of fact and recommendations. RSA 273-A:12, I(b). If one or both parties reject the recommendations, the statute sets forth additional steps to resolve the dispute. See RSA 273-A:12, II (submission of the neutral party’s findings of fact and recommendations to the union’s full membership and employer’s board for a vote), III (submission of the neutral party’s findings of fact and recommendations to the legislative board), IV (reopening negotiations if the parties still have not reached an agreement).', 'The petitioners do not dispute their obligation under RSA 273-A:9, I, to negotiate as a bargaining committee at the bargaining table on common cost items, terms, and conditions. However, the SEA asserts that the plain language of RSA 273-A:12 requires an impasse between the individual union and the State in order to trigger the impasse resolution procedures. Because neither the SEA nor the State has declared an impasse, the SEA argues that the impasse resolution procedures have not been triggered and, therefore, the State must continue bargaining with the SEA.', 'Similarly, the NEPBA argues that the plain language of RSA 273-A:9, I, and RSA 273-A:12 limits the bargaining committee format to negotiations at the bargaining table. Pointing to the absence of the word “committee” in RSA 273-A:12 and the references to individual bargaining units, see RSA 273-A:12, I(a)(1)-(2), the NEPBA asserts that requiring all five unions to maintain the bargaining committee format through impasse resolution procedures “improperly reads a committee bargaining requirement into RSA 273-A:12 that does not exist.” Though the petitioners set forth different arguments, their conclusion is the same: once one or more unions in the bargaining committee reach an impasse in negotiations with the State, the plain language of the statute no longer obligates the unions to negotiate as a single bargaining committee and instead requires the State to negotiate individually with the unions who have not declared an impasse.', 'Here, the impasse declared by the Teamsters and the NHTA occurred after the State rejected all of the proposals on an item held in common by all of the bargaining committee members — wages. The reason for the State’s rejection of the wage proposals was the same for all — the anticipated increase of prescription drug costs. Thus, the Teamsters’ and NHTA’s impasse declarations resulted from the State’s position on wages that applied to “all union wage proposals.”', 'The statutory scheme is silent as to the proper course of action under these circumstances. Arguably, such silence creates an ambiguity. See In re Juvenile 2005-212, 154 N.H. 763, 766 (2007). Because the legislative history is silent on this issue, it also provides no guidance to resolve any ambiguity. See Laws 1997, 351:53 (adding the bargaining committee language to RSA 273-A:9). We look, therefore, to the structure of the statutory scheme as a whole to discern the legislature’s objectives. When we examine the pertinent', '5 statutes in the context of the entire statutory scheme, rather than in isolation, we conclude that the legislature intended unions negotiating on behalf of state employees to continue negotiating with the State as a bargaining committee under the circumstances in this case when the item causing impasse with one or more unions is common to all. See Exeter Police Assoc., 154 N.H. at 65.', 'Such an interpretation is consistent with the plain language of RSA 273- A:3, I, which defines “good faith negotiation” to include the steps provided in RSA 273-A:12 to resolve an impasse. See RSA 273-A:3, I (defining “good faith negotiation” as including “cooperat[ing] in mediation and fact-finding”), :12, I- IV (setting forth the steps to resolving an impasse). It is also consistent with the plain language of RSA 273-A:9, I, which mandates that “cost items and terms and conditions of employment affecting state employees . . . be negotiated by the state . . . with a single employee bargaining committee.” See McCarthy v. Wheeler, 152 N.H. 643, 645 (2005) (“The use of the word ‘shall’ is generally regarded as a command.”). Furthermore, it is consistent with the apparent purpose of RSA 273-A:9, I, namely, to provide for efficiency and fairness in negotiations on common items and terms and conditions of employment between the State and the unions representing state employees. Finally, it is consistent with the evident purpose of RSA 273-A:12, which is to enable the parties to resolve the impasse.', 'We disagree with the petitioners that our interpretation leads to an absurd result or is unjust and unreasonable. When, as in this case, the State has rejected all proposals on an item common to all unions, which has caused at least one union to declare an impasse, it is reasonable to allow the State to engage in impasse negotiations with all of the unions participating as a single bargaining committee.', 'We further disagree with the NEPBA that our interpretation somehow deprives the petitioners of their ability to exercise independent negotiation strategies. When, as in this case, the State seeks to negotiate with the unions as a single bargaining committee after it has rejected all proposals on a common item, we fail to see how requiring the parties to engage in impasse resolution proceedings, with the unions participating as a single bargaining committee, deprives the unions of their ability to “maintain an effective bargaining posture.” Both stages of negotiation — bargaining at the table and resolving an impasse — allow the unions to advocate for the interests of their respective members. See RSA 273-A:12, I(a)(1)-(2) (allowing parties to make presentations to the other party), I(b) (mediation and fact-finding). Whether the parties continue negotiating at the table or enter into impasse resolution procedures, the unions will be negotiating with the State as to an item that all five unions have in common.', 'Because our function “is not to make laws, but to interpret them, any public policy arguments relevant to the wisdom” of the statutory scheme “and', '6 its consequences should be addressed to the General Court.” Logan v.

Fuller, senior assistant attorney general, on the memorandum of law and orally), for the State.', 'Eric S. Wolpin, assistant appellate defender, of Concord, on the brief and orally, for the defendant.', 'LYNN, C.J. The defendant, Hjalmar Bjorkman, appeals his conviction following a jury trial in the Superior Court (MacLeod, J.) on one count of using computer services for a prohibited purpose, see RSA 649-B:4, I(a) (2016). The defendant challenges the trial court’s denial of his motion to dismiss, contending that jury selection does not fulfill the requirement under the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) that a defendant be “brought to trial” within 180 days of filing a request for final disposition. We affirm.', 'The following facts are derived from the record. While being held at a correctional facility in Vermont on an unrelated matter, the defendant was indicted in New Hampshire on the charge that forms the basis of this appeal. After learning of the indictment, the defendant filed a “request for final disposition” under the IAD. See RSA 606-A:1, III(a) (2001). This request was received by the State on January 17, 2017.', 'Jury selection for the defendant’s trial was held on July 10, 2017, within 180 days from the court’s receipt of the defendant’s request for disposition. Eight days later, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that his case had not been “brought to trial” within the time period required by the IAD, which he stated had lapsed the day before, on July 17. The State objected, contending, among other things, that jury selection amounted to being “brought to trial” within the meaning of the IAD. On July 21, 2017, the trial court held a hearing on the motion. At the hearing, the defendant asserted that “the commencement of trial occurs” after jury selection, “when the case is called, the [d]efendant is brought before the court, the jury is . . . sworn, and the case begins.”', 'The trial court issued an oral decision on the defendant’s motion to dismiss, ruling “as a matter of law that the trial began . . . at the time of jury selection,” which the court deemed a “critical stage” in the trial. The court explained that at jury selection, counsel for both parties “engaged in direct attorney conducted voir dire with the jury,” wherein they raised anticipated issues for trial. The court also noted that once a jury has been empaneled, a defendant no longer has the right to proceed with a bench trial. In so ruling, the trial court relied on federal case law interpreting the Speedy Trial Act (STA), see 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161 et seq. (2012), reasoning that the IAD is “intertwined” with the constitutional right to a speedy trial, and that for purposes of the STA “a jury trial commences . . . when the court begins voir dire.” The court also distinguished IAD cases from those involving double jeopardy, explaining that the two categories encompass “different legal concepts” and seek “to address different issues of protection for the [d]efendant.” Finally, the trial court stated that “as a practical matter,” voir dire in complex cases could “go on for days, perhaps a week or more,” making it “difficult” to comply with the defendant’s interpretation of the IAD.', 'Following his conviction, the defendant asked the trial court to reconsider its denial of his motion to dismiss. The defendant argued that “the [c]ourt’s reliance on federal case law construing the [STA] was misplaced” because the STA uses different terminology and has different legislative intent than the IAD. The trial court denied the defendant’s motion to reconsider, and this appeal followed.', 'The denial of the defendant’s motion to dismiss an indictment under the IAD presents a question of law, which we review de novo. State v. Nelson, 161', '2 N.H. 58, 61 (2010). As a congressionally sanctioned interstate compact, the IAD is a federal law subject to federal construction. State v. Sprague, 146 N.H. 334, 336 (2001).', '“The IAD is a compact entered into by 48 States, the United States, and the District of Columbia to establish procedures for resolution of one State’s outstanding charges against a prisoner of another State.” State v. Brown, 157 N.H. 555, 557 (2008) (quotation omitted). Under Article III of the IAD, a person imprisoned in a party state who has a detainer lodged against him in another party state “may file a request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information, or complaint.” Id. (quotation omitted). The statute mandates that the prisoner “shall be brought to trial within 180 days” of receipt of this request by “the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court.” RSA 606-A:1, III(a) (emphasis added); see Brown, 157 N.H. at 557. In the absence of a waiver,1 the defendant’s inability to stand trial, or a proper continuance, the pending charges must be dismissed with prejudice if a prisoner is not brought to trial within the prescribed time period. State v. Dolbeare, 140 N.H. 84, 86 (1995). The burden of showing compliance with the IAD is upon the State. Brown, 157 N.H. at 558.', 'Both parties agree that January 17, 2017 serves as the commencement date of the 180-day time limit. Therefore, the only issue before us is whether the defendant was “brought to trial” for purposes of the IAD when the jury was selected on July 10, 2017. We hold that he was. The defendant asserts that the phrase “brought to trial” for purposes of the IAD refers to the proceedings that follow jury selection which involve “the calling of witness[es], the hearing of evidence, and the resolution of the controversy in question.” We disagree.', 'Although the phrase “brought to trial” is not defined in the IAD, the legislature set forth the statute’s purpose in Article I:', 'The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner,', 'detainers based on untried indictments, informations or', 'complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons 1 At oral argument, there was discussion about whether the defendant’s agreement to a trial date outside of the IAD’s time limit amounted to waiver. Under our case law, “mere silence by the defendant and his attorney when the trial date is set does not amount to waiver” of the IAD’s time requirements. Dolbeare, 140 N.H. at 86. Based on the record before us — which does not include the trial court’s “e-mail,” mentioned at argument, proposing the trial date, or evidence of the parties’ assent to that trial date — there is no indication of waiver by the defendant. We note, however, that the United States Supreme Court, in a decision issued after Dolbeare, held that defense counsel could waive a defendant’s right to be brought to trial within the IAD’s 180-day period by affirmatively agreeing to a trial date outside of that time period. New York v. Hill, 528 U.S. 110, 112-13, 115 (explaining that defense counsel waived defendant’s rights under the IAD by responding, “That will be fine, Your Honor,” when asked by trial court whether proposed trial date worked for defendant).

We believe, instead, that there are substantial similarities between the two statutes, warranting consistent interpretation. Indeed, both the IAD and the STA “provide for detaining a defendant imprisoned in another jurisdiction and require his prompt transfer and trial,” “contain statutory limitations on the time that may elapse before a defendant is brought to trial,” “permit extensions of time,” and “impose the sanction of dismissal of the charges when their limitations are transgressed.” United States v. Odom, 674 F.2d 228, 231 (4th Cir. 1982). We conclude that, in setting forth these requirements, Congress enacted both statutes “to serve the best interest of the public and the defendant by requiring the prompt disposition of criminal charges.” Id.; cf. Hill, 528 U.S. at 117 (acknowledging that society “enjoy[s] some benefit from the IAD’s time limits,” as “[d]elay can lead to a less accurate outcome as witnesses become unavailable and memories fade”).', '4', 'While the federal courts have yet to determine when a defendant has been “brought to trial” for purposes of the IAD, the majority of the federal circuit courts have decided that, when interpreting the STA, a trial “commence[s],” see 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1), “on the day the jury is empaneled, even if not sworn.” United States v. Rodriguez, 63 F.3d 1159, 1164 (1st Cir. 1995); accord United States v. Jones, 23 F.3d 1307, 1308 (8th Cir. 1994); Government of Virgin Islands v. Duberry, 923 F.2d 317, 320 (3d Cir. 1991); United States v. Fox, 788 F.2d 905, 908 (2d Cir. 1986); United States v. A-A-A Elec. Co., Inc., 788 F.2d 242, 246 (4th Cir. 1986); United States v.

In addition, Oklahoma, the only other state to have decided the issue, has also held that “for purposes of the IAD, a trial commences when the jury selection begins.” Bowie v. State, 816 P.2d 1143, 1147 (Okla. Crim. App. 1991). We join these courts today. See State v. Farrow, 140 N.H. 473, 475 (1995) (stating that statutes pertaining to the same subject matter “are to be considered in interpreting” one another and will be construed “so that they do not contradict each other” (quotations omitted)); see also Odom, 674 F.3d at 231 (applying “the principle that related statutes having the same purpose should be construed together” in interpreting the IAD and the STA).', 'In support of his argument that a defendant is not “brought to trial” under the IAD until the jury is sworn and the admission of evidence begins, the defendant relies on the meaning of “trial” in the double jeopardy context. Although “a criminal trial does not commence for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause until the jury is empaneled and sworn,” Gomez v. United States, 490 U.S. 858, 872 (1989); see State v. Ojo, 166 N.H. 95, 98 (2014), “other constitutional rights attach before that point,” Gomez, 490 U.S. at 873. Indeed, jury selection is “a critical stage of the criminal proceeding.” Id. at 873 & n.26 (stating that “[i]ndications that Congress likewise considers jury selection part of a felony trial may be gleaned . . . from its passage in 1975 of the Speedy Trial Act”); see also Bowie, 816 P.2d at 1147 (“Jury selection is an intrinsic part of the trial process.”). It is at voir dire that the parties first have the opportunity to introduce the jurors to the potential issues in their case. It is also when the “court may enforce a defendant’s right to be tried by a jury free from . . . prejudice . . . or predisposition about the defendant’s culpability.” Gomez, 490 U.S. at 873 (citations omitted).', 'Moreover, the protections afforded defendants and the goals achieved by the IAD are distinct from those covered by double jeopardy principles. “The reason for holding that jeopardy attaches when the jury is empaneled and sworn lies in the need to protect the interest of an accused in retaining a chosen jury.” Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35-36 (1978) (explaining that the defendant’s “valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal', '5 . . . is an interest with roots deep in the historic development of trial by jury in the Anglo-American system of criminal justice” (quotation omitted)). While we have acknowledged that “[t]he right to complete a trial before a particular tribunal is not absolute,” we have allowed exceptions to this right only in the most narrow of circumstances: “when the defendant consents to the mistrial, or, if he objects, upon a finding of the trial court that there is manifest necessity for the act, or that the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.” Ojo, 166 N.H. at 99-100 (emphases added) (stating that “all possible alternatives to a mistrial must be considered, employed and found wanting before declaration of a mistrial over the defendant’s objection is justified” (quotation and brackets omitted)). These circumscribed exceptions do not alter the reasoning for placing a defendant in jeopardy “once he is put to trial before a jury.” Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 188 (1957). A defendant’s “right to complete a trial before a particular tribunal” remains, Ojo, 166 N.H. at 99, and is contained within a defendant’s right not to be subjected “to repeated prosecutions for the same offense,” United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470, 479 (1971). Double jeopardy protections are in place to promote “the finality of judgments,” minimize the “harassing exposure to the harrowing experience of a criminal trial,” and safeguard the defendant’s “valued right to continue with the chosen jury.” Crist, 437 U.S. at 38. In sum, the IAD assures prisoners that the disposition of their out-of-state charges is forthcoming, see RSA 606-A:1, I; S. Rep. No. 91-1356, at 3 (1970), an objective that begins at jury selection, while double jeopardy principles protect defendants from being subjected to “a second trial on the same charge,” Green, 355 U.S. at 188, an objective that begins when the jury is empaneled and sworn. Thus, we are convinced that the concerns underlying double jeopardy principles are “wholly different” from those addressed by the IAD. Cf. Howell, 719 F.2d at 1262 (stating that “the constitutional considerations underlying the double jeopardy clause are wholly different from the premises of the Speedy Trial Act” (quotation omitted)).', 'Finally, the defendant points out that following jury selection, a defendant can “wait weeks for the commencement of trial,” as “actions of the court or the State can interrupt the progress toward adjudication.” Although we hold today that the commencement of jury selection constitutes the point when a defendant is “brought to trial” for purposes of the IAD, incident to this holding is our understanding that prosecutors and courts will act in good faith to ensure the speedy progression of all phases of trial. After all, the burden of showing compliance with the IAD is on the State, Brown, 157 N.H. at 558, and any improper delay in trial proceedings would contravene the IAD’s purpose of securing a speedy trial for prisoners, see Sprague, 146 N.H. at 335-36.', 'Affirmed.', 'HICKS, BASSETT, HANTZ MARCONI, and DONOVAN, JJ., concurred.', '6 ']"
