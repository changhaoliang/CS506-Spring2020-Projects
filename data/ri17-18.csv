0,Rhode Island Resource Recovery : Corporation v. : Restivo Monacelli LLP. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Restivo Monacelli LLP (Restivo), appeals from a February 1, 2016 judgment in Providence County Superior Court in favor of the plaintiff, Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation (Resource Recovery), in the amount of $5,733,648.18, inclusive of interest. That judgment was entered following a jury trial and a verdict in Resource Recovery’s favor. On appeal, Restivo contends that the trial justice erred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law for the following reasons: (1) Resource Recovery was required to, but did not, present expert testimony with respect to proximate cause; and (2) Resource Recovery did not have standing to assert a claim for “investment losses.” Restivo further claims that “the trial justice committed prejudicial error in his instructions to the jury * * *.” Restivo posits, additionally, that the trial justice erred as a matter of law by holding that Resource Recovery was “‘immune’ from the in pari delicto defense and that the ‘adverse interest’ exception to the defense applied to [Resource Recovery].” Lastly, Restivo contends on', '-1- appeal that the trial justice erred in denying Restivo’s motion “to set off settlement amounts that [Resource Recovery] received from other parties from the jury’s awarded damages * * *.”', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel 1', 'Resource Recovery is a quasi-governmental corporation established for the purpose of operating and managing the Central Landfill in Johnston. As will become clear from the discussion of the trial testimony infra, in 2007, when a new Executive Director of Resource Recovery (Michael OConnell)2 was appointed, he uncovered a multitude of problems at said corporation. These included very large charitable donations to organizations which had no relationship to Resource Recovery’s mission, overpaying for a purchase of real estate, and the fact that the funds in several of Resource Recovery’s trust funds were not invested in accordance with Resource Recovery’s policies. After the new Executive Director reported those problems to the Governor, a full forensic audit was undertaken, which confirmed many of the matters of concern that had been discovered by the new Executive Director. As a result, necessary reforms were implemented within Resource Recovery. This case arises out of a quest to determine the relative fault of various entities and persons with respect to the problems which plagued Resource Recovery and the time span during which those problems persisted. 1', 'Since this case can be resolved by solely evaluating Restivo’s contention that Resource Recovery was required to present expert testimony as to proximate causation, we relate only the facts and standard of review necessary to analyze that contention. 2', 'Michael OConnell’s name is spelled without an apostrophe in the briefs of both parties, in the transcript, and in other documents that are part of the record. For that reason, we do not use an apostrophe.', '-2-', 'Of importance to the instant case is the fact that an audit of Resource Recovery was undertaken in each fiscal year. For fiscal years 1995 to 2005, the firm of Lefkowitz, Garfinkel, Champi & DeRienzo, P.C. (LGCD) served as Resource Recovery’s auditor. However, for fiscal years 2006 and 2007, Restivo was hired to audit Resource Recovery. From 1996 to 2008, Van Liew Trust Company (Van Liew) was the trustee of the two trusts at issue in this case.3 Subsequent to the above-referenced chain of events, Resource Recovery filed suit against LGCD, Van Liew, and Restivo. LGCD and Van Liew entered into separate settlement agreements with Resource Recovery. As such, we are confronted with only the suit by Resource Recovery against Restivo.', 'That suit was commenced on July 30, 2010, when Resource Recovery filed a Complaint containing five counts against Restivo arising from “the failures of Restivo * * * in its provision of auditing and accounting services to the Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation * * * during the time period between the summer of 2006 and the termination of its engagement on June 30, 2008.” The five counts were as follows: professional malpractice (Count One); breach of contract (Count Two); aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty (Count Three); civil liability for giving a false document to an agent, employee, or public official, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-18-1 (Count Four); and civil conspiracy (Count Five). On June 30, 2011, after Restivo’s motion for a more definite statement as to Counts Three, Four, and Five was allowed by the trial justice, Resource Recovery filed a document entitled “Plaintiff’s More Definite Statement.” 3', 'We need not delve into the specific details relative to the two trusts at issue in this case. It suffices to know that the funds in those trusts were not invested in accordance with Resource Recovery’s policies. We do note, for the reader’s interest, that the record reflects the fact that there was a third trust, which related to the employee pension plan; but any issues regarding that trust are not pertinent to this case.', '-3-', 'The Plaintiff’s More Definite Statement contained the same five counts as had been set forth in the original Complaint. It went on to specifically allege that Restivo “negligently failed to identify – or actively participated in concealing – the true status of [Resource Recovery’s] financial statements * * *.”', 'According to Resource Recovery, Restivo’s “actions and/or omission postponed the detection of the mismanagement, wrongdoing, and corruption occurring at [Resource Recovery] and delayed [Resource Recovery] and other authorities from addressing the issues and avoiding subsequent losses.”', 'Thereafter, on December 11, 2013, Counts Three, Four, and Five of the Plaintiff’s More Definite Statement were dismissed with prejudice by stipulation, in accordance with Rule 41(a)(1)(B) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The only remaining counts were those alleging professional malpractice and breach of contract (Counts One and Two). The case ultimately progressed to a jury trial on those counts, which trial took place over eleven days in October and November of 2015. We relate below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial', '1. The Testimony of Michael OConnell', 'Michael OConnell testified for Resource Recovery. It was his testimony that, at the time of trial, he was the Executive Director of Resource Recovery and had held that post since January of 2007. He testified that he was “responsible for the day-to-day activities” at the Central Landfill in Johnston and that he reported to the “board of commissioners.” He explained that, when he started at Resource Recovery, the Chairman of the Board functioned as Resource Recovery’s Chief Executive Officer, whereas Mr. OConnell, despite having the title of Executive', '-4- Director, was “just an administrator * * *.” It was further his testimony that, in his first few months working at Resource Recovery, he identified “specific large issues” within the entity with respect to “charitable contributions; * * * consolidation of [Resource Recovery’s] investments with one financial corporation; and * * * excessive prices that the corporation had paid for land that [it] bought for [an] industrial park.”', 'With respect to the charitable contributions, Mr. OConnell testified that, although charitable contributions had been made by Resource Recovery, when he “looked at the mission of the corporation, it wasn’t what we were supposed to do * * *.” He stated that it was his “goal to limit or restrict it or tie it to [Resource Recovery’s] mission.” He further testified that, from fiscal year 2003 until fiscal year 2007, Resource Recovery had made charitable contributions in the amount of $2,092,163.95. He confirmed in his testimony that Restivo had conducted the audits of Resource Recovery for two of the years in that time period—viz., fiscal years 2006 and 2007. He then detailed in his testimony certain charitable contributions which were made during the years that Restivo had conducted its audits but were not related to the mission of Resource Recovery.', 'He further testified that funds were also spent on the involvement of board commissioners and/or employees as participants in charity golf events—“[a]pproximately $1,000 for each golf outing” and “approximately ten [outings] a year.”', 'It was further Mr. OConnell’s testimony that, at the start of fiscal year 2006, Resource Recovery had approximately one hundred million dollars in investments in the “employee pension investments” (the pension trust) and the two “landfill trust funds” (the two trusts at issue). He explained that the money in the “landfill trust funds” was set aside for the point in the future when the landfill would be filled to capacity and would no longer be taking in trash and, accordingly, no longer producing any revenue; he added that the money in the “landfill trust', '-5- funds” was used “to make sure that the landfill is properly maintained, it’s properly fixed, it’s properly secure.”4', 'It was further his testimony that Van Liew managed all of the trust investments. He stated that he had been concerned with having all of Resource Recovery’s investments under the management of one small firm—viz., Van Liew. He also testified that, after assuming the position of Executive Director, he learned that a commissioner on the Resource Recovery Board of Commissioners was also a paid board member of Van Liew. Furthermore, he answered in the affirmative when asked if, “at some point,” he became “concerned with whether Van Liew had been making investments in accordance with the * * * rules and policies governing investments in the trust?” He testified that he “came to find” that the investments in the trust funds were “in opposition to the investment strategy that the corporation had.”', 'It was Mr. OConnell’s testimony that he expressed to the Rhode Island Auditor General his “concern that [Resource Recovery] had excessive charitable contributions, [and] had concentration of assets [issues] to be resolved.” According to Mr. OConnell’s testimony, he further expressed his concern to the Auditor General that Resource Recovery had “paid * * * inflated prices for real estate property” and had “failed to properly record them * * * on [its] financial statements.” He then testified that he also conveyed his concerns to the Governor at a meeting on November 12, 2007. It was his testimony that the Governor ordered “a 45-day preliminary examination * * * to be done by the bureau of audits * * *.”5 He further testified 4', 'Dean Huff, who was the Chief Financial Officer of Resource Recovery at the time of trial, described in his testimony the two trusts referred to by Mr. OConnell as the “landfill trust funds.” Mr. Huff described one trust as the “pollution remediation trust fund” and the other trust as the “closure/post-closure trust fund.” 5', 'Mr. OConnell explained in his testimony that the Bureau of Audits “is a department of the state which typically does * * * internal audits. They audit the other agencies in the state.” It', '-6- that the Governor instructed two of the commissioners on the Resource Recovery Board of Commissioners not to attend any further board meetings, thereby precluding the existence of a quorum.6 According to Mr. OConnell’s testimony, the Bureau of Audits issued a document entitled “Preliminary 45-day Examination of Rhode Island Resource Recovery Corporation, Summary of Findings, March 2008.” Mr. OConnell testified that, as a result of the conclusions made in that document, the Governor “ordered a full forensic audit.” The full forensic audit resulted in a very lengthy report dated September 22, 2009. In the Executive Summary of that report, it is noted that “the Bureau found numerous instances in which employees, vendors, and various current and former Commissioners, appear to have acted in ways that compromised their fiduciary and ethical obligations to [Resource Recovery] and to the public.”', 'Mr. OConnell further testified that he believed that Restivo had “failed to do its job for Resource Recovery[.]” He bluntly stated:', '“[Restivo was] a professional accounting and auditing firm who in', 'the course of two years found no issues with Resource Recovery. I', 'came in in six months and I was tripping over issues, I couldn’t', 'help it, they were everywhere. And they found nothing.” is important to note that Rhode Island has both an Auditor General and a Bureau of Audits. The Office of the Auditor General is the State of Rhode Island’s legislative audit agency. See Office of the Auditor General, http://www.oag.state.ri.us/ (last visited July 2, 2018). The Bureau of Audits, also called the Office of Internal Audit, “performs the auditing function for the Executive Branch of State Government, and falls under the Department of Administration.” See Office of Internal Audit, About Us, http://www.omb.ri.gov/internal-audit/about/overview.php (last visited July 2, 2018). Reference was made, in the course of the testimony in this case, to both the Auditor General and the Bureau of Audits. 6', 'A quorum is defined as “[t]he smallest number of people who must be present at a meeting so that official decisions can be made * * *.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1446 (10th ed. 2014).', '-7- He testified that he terminated Restivo’s services in June of 2008. He went on to detail the damages that Resource Recovery contended were incurred as a result of Restivo’s alleged “failure to do its job.”', '2. The Testimony of Resource Recovery’s Expert Witnesses', 'a. The Testimony of Joseph Centofanti', 'Joseph Centofanti, who was called by Resource Recovery, was qualified as an expert witness in the areas of accounting and auditing. Mr. Centofanti, after being qualified as an expert, began his testimony by explaining the auditing process in general. It was his testimony that the audits of governmental entities were governed by “[g]enerally accepted accounting principles, generally accepted auditing standards, [and] government auditing standards * * *.” He added that audits were also governed by the requirements imposed by the Rhode Island Auditor General and by the provisions in the contract between the parties. He noted that the requirements of the Auditor General included a requirement to report “any indications of fraud, abuse, or illegal acts that are noted * * *.” Mr. Centofanti testified that, based on his review of extensive materials, which materials he detailed in his testimony at length, it was his opinion that Restivo “lacked the experience to perform an audit of a quasi-governmental entity.” He further testified that Restivo “failed to test compliance with the applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and other agreements,” “failed to identify and report the improper charitable contributions,” and “failed to report internal control deficiencies that were identified.” He provided details of how an auditor would test the compliance of the trust investments with the investment policies of the corporation; and he added that, except for a single comment in the papers which he reviewed, he “couldn’t find any evidence * * * that [the trust investments were] reviewed for compliance” by Restivo.', '-8-', 'Mr. Centofanti also testified as to the amount of money that had been donated by Resource Recovery in fiscal years 2006 and 2007 to charitable organizations which were not related to Resource Recovery’s mission. He testified that the charitable contributions for those fiscal years constituted “indications of fraud or abuse.” He further added in his testimony that, if Restivo had uncovered these contributions, it would have been obligated to report them to the Auditor General.', 'b. The Testimony of Jerry DeNigris', 'Jerry DeNigris testified on behalf of Resource Recovery and was qualified as an expert in calculating and determining investment losses. He stated that he was hired to “view the activity, the securities purchased specifically, in these various trust accounts to determine first what they had actually made or lost; and to see - - really to compare them to investment policies to see whether or not the activity in the account was consistent with or complied with those investment policies.”', 'He testified that there were “securities that were out of compliance” with the investment policies of Resource Recovery. He stated that his analysis spanned from July 1, 2006 until January of 2008.', 'It was his testimony that the “damages” resulting from those “nonconforming securities” amounted to $2,551,052.', 'B', 'Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law', 'At the close of Resource Recovery’s case-in-chief, Restivo moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that, due to the fact that Resource Recovery did not present expert testimony on causation, there was “no evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that a breach by Restivo caused any of the plaintiff’s purported damage.” The trial justice deferred decision on that aspect of the', '-9- Rule 50 motion. Restivo presented its evidence, and it then renewed its Rule 50 motion at the close of all the evidence. The trial justice again deferred decision.', 'On November 3, 2015, the jury rendered its verdict, finding that Restivo “breach[ed] the standard of care owed to [Resource Recovery] in Restivo’s audit of Resource Recovery’s financial statements in fiscal year 2006 or fiscal year 2007” and that that breach proximately caused damage to Resource Recovery. It further found that Restivo breached its contractual agreement with Resource Recovery and that the breach of contract proximately caused damage to Resource Recovery. The jury allocated damages as follows: (1) $207,625.39 for losses “as related to charitable contributions;” (2) $83,500 for fees paid to Restivo under the contract between the parties; (3) $20,255 for fees paid to “Restivo’s successor;” and (4) $2,551,052 for losses relating “to investments in the [trust funds at issue].”7', 'After the jury verdict was rendered, Restivo again renewed its Rule 50 motion on the same pertinent grounds as it had initially articulated. The trial justice issued a decision on January 11, 2016, in which he denied the motion. On February 1, 2016, final judgment entered against Restivo in the amount of $5,733,648.18, inclusive of interest. A timely notice of appeal was filed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Rule 50(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure states that, “[i]f during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law * * *.” 7', 'We note that the jury did not make separate awards of damages with respect to the breach of contract and professional malpractice counts.', '- 10 -', 'We have stated that “[o]ur review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.” Giron v. Bailey, 985 A.2d 1003, 1007 (R.I. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). We conduct our review of a “motion for judgment as a matter of law in the same manner as the trial justice.” Plourde v. Myers, 823 A.2d 1138, 1142 (R.I. 2003); see also Botelho v. Caster’s Inc., 970 A.2d 541, 544 (R.I. 2009). We examine “the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses, and draw from the record all reasonable inferences that support the position of the nonmoving party.” Filippi v. Filippi, 818 A.2d 608, 617 (R.I. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Wellborn v. Spurwink/Rhode Island, 873 A.2d 884, 887 (R.I. 2005). “If, after such a review, there remain factual issues upon which reasonable persons might draw different conclusions, the motion for [judgment as a matter of law] must be denied, and the issues must be submitted to the jury for determination.” Marketing Design Source, Inc. v.

Hopkins, 787 A.2d 1158, 1165 (R.I. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, Restivo raises numerous contentions as to alleged error by the trial justice. However, we need focus our inquiry only on the contention that the trial justice erred in denying Restivo’s motion for judgment as a matter of law because, as Restivo avers, expert testimony with respect to proximate cause was required in this case but was not presented by Resource', '- 11 - Recovery. Due to the fact that our conclusion with respect to that issue is dispositive, we need not address the other contentions on appeal.', 'A', 'Expert Testimony as to Proximate Cause', 'With respect to the issue of expert testimony as to proximate cause, Restivo posits that the connection between its alleged breach of its professional duty of care and the damages Resource Recovery suffered is “beyond common knowledge and would not be obvious to a layperson.”', 'As such, Restivo contends that expert testimony as to proximate cause was necessary in this case. Restivo avers specifically that, in the instant case, “[n]o expert * * * testified what would have happened, and when it would have happened, if Restivo had, in fact, reported [Resource Recovery’s] board’s charitable gifts, the * * * trusts investments, or any other asserted fraud or abuse to the Auditor General.” Indeed, Restivo asserts that Resource Recovery “never presented any evidence of what it was that the auditor general or governor would do, when it would be done, and, most importantly, what effect that would have had on the damages.” Restivo further contends that the fact that the “need for expert testimony to establish the causal link between Restivo’s professional negligence and [Resource Recovery’s] claimed damages is even more pronounced here because the concurrent negligence of other professionals— Lefkowitz and Van Liew—caused the same or similar damages to [Resource Recovery], plus the clear evidence that the damages were primarily caused by [Resource Recovery’s] own malfeasance.”', 'We begin our analysis of Restivo’s contentions by noting that, to “maintain a cause of action for negligence, the plaintiff must establish four elements: (1) a legally cognizable duty owed by defendant to plaintiff; (2) breach of that duty; (3) that the conduct proximately caused', '- 12 - the injury; and (4) actual loss or damage.” Medeiros v. Sitrin, 984 A.2d 620, 625 (R.I. 2009); see also Santana v. Rainbow Cleaners, Inc., 969 A.2d 653, 658 (R.I. 2009). We are concerned in this appeal only with the proximate cause element of proof relative to a negligence claim. Proximate cause “requires a factual finding that the harm would not have occurred but for the [act] and that the harm [was a] natural and probable consequence of the [act].” Almonte v. Kurl, 46 A.3d 1, 18 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). Resource Recovery contends before this Court that, in the instant case, “causation was straightforward.” However, after a thorough review of the extensive record in this case, we conclude that that statement is a gross exaggeration. In fact, we are of the decided opinion that the issue of causation was murky at best and that expert testimony was unquestionably required to prove that Restivo proximately caused Resource Recovery’s damages.', 'In this context, the Court has explained that:', '“The use of expert testimony arises from a need which comes in', 'turn from the fact that the subject matter of the inquiry is one', 'involving special skills and training beyond the ken of the average', 'layman. If all the facts and circumstances can be accurately', 'described to a jury and if the jury is as capable of comprehending', 'and understanding such facts and drawing correct conclusions from', 'them as is the expert, there is no necessity for the expert testimony.', 'The jury in such instances can determine the question just as well', 'as the expert.” Barenbaum v.

Follett, 51 R.I. 413, 416-17, 155 A. 363, 364 (1931). We have more recently articulated the standard to be applied as follows: “It is well settled that expert testimony is required to establish any matter that is not obvious to a lay person and thus lies beyond common knowledge * * *.” Jessup & Conroy, P.C. v. Seguin, 46 A.3d 835, 839 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Broadley v. State, 939 A.2d 1016, 1022 (R.I. 2008); Ahmed v. Pannone, 779 A.2d 630, 633 n.1 (R.I. 2001).', '- 13 -', 'In cases dealing with medical malpractice and legal malpractice or with issues which required particularized knowledge of the medical or legal fields, we have over the years determined that one or more of the issues of standard of care, breach of the standard of care, and proximate causation were beyond the common knowledge of a lay person and required expert testimony. See, e.g., Ahmed, 779 A.2d at 633; Boccasile v. Cajun Music Ltd., 694 A.2d 686, 690 (R.I. 1997); see generally Cappuccilli v. Carcieri, 174 A.3d 722, 730 (R.I. 2017).', 'Specifically with respect to proximate causation, in Almonte we held that expert testimony on proximate cause was required in a case dealing with a patient who was brought to the hospital after a “severe psychological episode” but was not committed; rather, he was discharged at his request. Almonte, 46 A.3d at 8, 18. The patient subsequently committed suicide. Id. at 8. This Court held that expert testimony on proximate cause was necessary in that case because it would not be obvious to a lay person “what would most probably have resulted were Mr. Almonte to have been committed * * *.” Id. at 18. Likewise, in Vallinoto v. DiSandro, 688 A.2d 830 (R.I. 1997), in a case where the plaintiff was suing her former attorney (with whom she had had an affair) for intentional infliction of emotional distress, we held that expert medical testimony was required with respect to establishing a causal link between her mental and physical complaints and her affair with her former attorney. Vallinoto, 688 A.2d at 833-34, 838. In Mills v. State Sales, Inc., 824 A.2d 461 (R.I. 2003), we held that the “causal relationship between a particular toxin and its effect on the human body would have to be established through expert testimony.” Mills, 824 A.2d at 468. And, in Boccasile, we held that, when the negligence at issue involved “the professional skill and judgment of a nurse,” expert testimony as to proximate cause was required. Boccasile, 694 A.2d at 690 (internal quotation marks omitted).', '- 14 -', 'We also point the reader to numerous cases where we required expert testimony in situations not specific to proximate cause but which we also determined involved issues beyond the common knowledge of a lay person. See, e.g., Laplante v. Rhode Island Hospital, 110 A.3d 261, 265 (R.I. 2015) (holding that the “question of whether and how defendants’ diagnosis and treatment of [plaintiff] aggravated his pelvic fracture is one that must be answered with expert testimony”); Sousa v. Chaset, 519 A.2d 1132, 1135 (R.I. 1987) (holding that “plaintiff’s urological condition, and the treatment he received or should have received for the same, were matters beyond the obvious common knowledge of the jury”), abrogated on other grounds by Cruz v. DaimlerChrysler Motors Corp., 66 A.3d 446, 452 (R.I. 2013); Young v. Park, 417 A.2d 889, 893 (R.I. 1980) (holding that “matters concerning polycythemia and Myleran therapy are not so obvious that the need for expert testimony is obviated”).', 'In our judgment, this case is comparable to the foregoing cases requiring expert testimony. In this case, we are confronted with alleged accounting malpractice as opposed to medical or legal malpractice; but accounting is a comparably specialized field, requiring specific training and skills.8 It is clear that understanding how a negligent audit caused, or allowed to persist, damages such as those stemming from inappropriate charitable contributions and a change in the amount potentially gleaned from trust investments requires knowledge far beyond the ken of an ordinary lay person. See Barenbaum, 114 R.I. at 90-91, 328 A.2d at 733. It requires both an understanding of the auditing process as well as an understanding of what would likely have occurred had the problems concerning Resource Recovery’s finances been brought to light sooner than they eventually were. Moreover, as Restivo points out, this case is further 8', 'See, e.g., American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, The Uniform CPA Examination, https://www.aicpa.org/becomeacpa/cpaexam.html (last visited July 2, 2018) (discussing the examination required to become a certified public accountant).', '- 15 - complicated by the fact that Restivo was not the only purportedly negligent party. LGCD and Van Liew were both alleged to have been negligent parties, and any negligence on their part would potentially have had a significant impact on the damages relative to the charitable contributions and the trust investments. It is far from clear to a lay person which party’s negligence proximately caused which specific portions of the damages that Resource Recovery allegedly incurred.', 'Resource Recovery contends before this Court that, “[b]ased on the testimony and the evidence on record, a jury could reasonably conclude that, had Restivo done its job, the conduct of the [Resource Recovery] bad actors would have been stopped sooner, and [Resource Recovery] would not have incurred damages.” In our estimation, however, Resource Recovery takes an exceedingly simplistic view of the case that plainly does not demonstrate real appreciation of the depth of complexity which this difficult case embodies. Accordingly, it is clear to this Court that, to establish the causal connection between Restivo’s purported negligence and the damages suffered by Resource Recovery, the testimony of an auditing/accounting expert was necessary. A jury simply could not determine such a question without expert testimony. See Barenbaum, 114 R.I. at 90-91, 328 A.2d at 733.', 'To further explicate our conclusion, we note that the facts of this case vary materially from cases in which this Court has held that expert testimony was not required. See, e.g., id. at 90, 92, 328 A.2d at 734 (holding that there was no error in the trial justice’s refusal to let the jury hear an architect’s opinion about whether a stairway had been “improperly designed” because “it called for a conclusion of fact that was well within the jury’s ability to make”); Glennon, 87 R.I. at 457, 143 A.2d at 284 (holding that it was error to admit the testimony of an architect as to how a particular wall could have been made to be safer); Fontaine, 51 R.I. at 416, 155 A. at 364', '- 16 - (holding that it was not error to prevent an engineer from testifying as to his opinion concerning whether a certain avenue “was safe and convenient for travelers with their teams, carts and carriages”). By way of a more detailed example, in Giron this Court held that expert testimony was not necessary. Giron, 985 A.2d at 1010. In that case, one of the plaintiffs was walking across a porch at his dwelling place when his “foot sank into the soft-wooden floorboards” and he was “propelled to the railing.” Id. at 1005, 1010. He grasped the railing to stop himself from falling, but the railing gave way and he fell off the second floor porch to the sidewalk below. Id. We held that evidence as to the existence of defects in the railing and the floor of the porch, the landlord’s awareness of such defects, and the landlord’s failure to sufficiently warn the tenant constitued “more than sufficient evidence for a jury to find that [the landlord’s] breach of her duty was the proximate cause of [the] injuries.” Id. at 1010. It is certainly within the common knowledge of a lay person that, if a porch and a railing are both defective and the landlord knew of the defects and failed to warn against them, the landlord proximately caused the injuries sustained from a fall as a result of the defective porch and railing.

It is perhaps not beyond the ken of an ordinary layperson to determine that, in the circumstances of this case, Restivo’s professional malpractice resulted in losses in the trusts’ investment portfolios.', 'It is a far more complicated matter, however, to quantify the loss proximately caused by the auditor’s negligence.', 'I do not have similar concerns with respect to the other elements of damages assessed by the jury. The $207,625.39 for inappropriate charitable contributions corresponds with Joseph Centofanti’s testimony concerning the amount of “non-mission related” charitable contributions made in fiscal year 2007. Mr. Centofanti also testified that he had determined that there were $209,091.32 in “non-mission related” charitable contributions in fiscal year 2006.

Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment with respect to the award of damages as it relates to charitable contributions.', 'The remaining damages amounts relate to the jury’s finding that Restivo “breach[ed] its contractual agreement * * * to audit Resource Recovery’s financial statements for the fiscal years 2006 or 2007[.]” The $83,500 award represents the fees paid to Restivo under the terms of this contract, less the amount attributable to auditing a pension fund, and the $20,255 was the amount paid to the successor auditor to correct the financial statements that were in error. Both of these awards appear to be straightforward figures that the jury was capable of assessing, without the assistance of expert testimony as to causation, for Restivo’s breach of contract.

For that crime, he was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. On appeal, the defendant claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial justice made three errors, two of which relate to the trial justice’s jury instructions and one of which arises from the admission of certain testimony at trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A little after five o’clock in the evening on Sunday, October 4, 2009, a six-year-old boy named Marco Nieves was pronounced dead at Hasbro Children’s Hospital. According to the autopsy performed by then-Chief Medical Examiner of the State of Rhode Island, Thomas Gilson, M.D., the cause of death was peritonitis, which is a medical term that describes', '-1- inflammation around the stomach cavity. The manner of death was deemed to be homicide. In Dr. Gilson’s opinion, the peritonitis that led to Marco’s death was the result of the infliction of a substantial amount of blunt force to the abdomen.', 'As a string of text messages between defendant and his girlfriend, Trisha Oliver, later revealed, that blunt force came from defendant’s fist. 1', 'At some point in the afternoon of October 3, Ms. Oliver’s son, Marco, began vomiting. Despite the boy’s distress, Ms. Oliver brought him to church, where a number of people told her that Marco did not look well. The defendant, meanwhile, was spending the evening hanging out at his friend’s car shop. He had been with Marco and his daughter, Ms. Oliver’s other child, while Ms. Oliver ran errands that morning. 2 The defendant did not return to Ms. Oliver’s Cranston apartment until the early morning hours of October 4. However, between the time that he left and the time that he returned to his girlfriend’s apartment, defendant and Ms. Oliver exchanged a series of damning text messages that revealed in stark and vulgar terms what had happened to Marco Nieves.', 'At about a quarter to five o’clock on the afternoon of October 3, after texting with defendant over an unrelated issue, Ms. Oliver sent defendant the following text message: “of course [Marco] is gonna be all hurt and cryin cuz u f****n beat the crap out of him im not wit that sh*t[.]” Minutes later, defendant responded, with his feelings emphasized by all capital letters: “I PUNCH DAT LIL B***H 3 TIMES AND DAT WAS IT. DA HARDEST 1 WAS ON 1', 'Of note, this is not defendant’s first foray into this Court’s docket. In 2014, this Court vacated in part and affirmed in part a pretrial ruling of a justice of the Superior Court suppressing a host of text messages found on defendant’s girlfriend’s cell phone. See State v. Patino, 93 A.3d 40 (R.I. 2014). The text messages that were the subject of that decision were admitted into evidence and used extensively throughout defendant’s trial. 2', 'The defendant’s parental rights with respect to his and Ms. Oliver’s daughter have been terminated. See In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273 (R.I. 2011).', '-2- HIS STOMACH CUZ HE MOVED. BUT LET HIM B A MAN AND NOT A LIL B***H LIKE U[.]” The defendant then issued a follow-up message, again in all capital letters: “WAT KIND OF DISCIPLINE OR ANYTHIN U GONNA KNO[.]”', 'Ms. Oliver responded immediately, informing defendant that Marco had not complained to her about being in pain; rather, as she texted, he was just throwing up. She, too, issued a follow-up: “idk wat u did but u hurt [h]is stomach real bad[.]” The defendant’s response: “I TOLD U. I WENT 2 PUNCH HIM ON HIS BACK AGAIN AND HE MOVED AND I HIT HIM ON HIS STOMACH.”', 'After sending that text, defendant attempted to offer an alternative explanation for why Marco might be sick to his stomach. The defendant wrote to Ms. Oliver: “ITS PROLLY SINCE HE HAD ATE DATS Y. MY BAD IM REALY SORRY ABOUT DAT[.]” Ms. Oliver texted defendant back, stating that Marco was making sounds and throwing up a foamy substance; she also informed defendant that the boy’s eyes were rolling toward the back of his head. At this point, it was just after 5 p.m. on Saturday, October 3. It was clear to defendant’s girlfriend that her son Marco was in terrible distress.', 'But while Marco’s condition continued to worsen, the couple contented themselves with text messages. Their text chain shows that Ms. Oliver was becoming increasingly concerned with Marco; he was still throwing up, his stomach was “madd tight[,]” and after briefly falling asleep, he had vomited on the bed sheets. The defendant suggested a solution: She should leave Marco alone for a while and let settle whatever food that he had eaten. Meanwhile, Ms. Oliver noted that her son’s vomit was dark and that his blanket needed to be washed. The defendant, though, was undeterred as he proposed cures for Marco’s distress.', 'The defendant suggested, first, that Ms. Oliver should give Marco some water. After being informed that Marco had thrown up again, defendant offered a twist: Ms. Oliver should', '-3- awaken Marco and give him water with lemon. Then, defendant suggested that she should rub Marco’s stomach. When notified that the stomach rub had failed, defendant again asked Ms. Oliver to give Marco a drink of water. Time wore on, and his proposed remedies were to no avail. At about six o’clock that evening, defendant texted: “MAKE HIM LIKE EXERCISE[.]” Exasperated, Ms. Oliver responded: “yes mike idk wat else 2 do[.]”', 'She then sent defendant the following text: “mike he is in madd pain u had 2 hit him real hard mike wtf[.]” The defendant responded: “I HIT HIM DA SAME WAY EVERYWHERE BUT ITS DAT HE MOVED AND I HIT HIM BAD[.]” Ms. Oliver queried: “wat if somethin happened 2 him his eyes r rolin he cant even talk he says he is doin reall badd[.]” The defendant then implored his girlfriend to relax and calm down. Ms. Oliver’s response was to ask defendant to come to her home and help take care of Marco; defendant agreed to do so. And, apparently recognizing her predicament, Ms. Oliver ominously typed out one more message to defendant: “wat if i got2 take him 2 da hospi[ta]l wat will i say and dos marks on his neck omg[.]” 3', 'Despite his agreement to do so, defendant did not return to Ms. Oliver’s home until hours later, around three or four in the morning. While Ms. Oliver continued texting with defendant, and as Marco continued to suffer, defendant whiled away the evening enjoying drinks and hanging around his friend’s car shop in Central Falls, alternating between drinking with his friends and by himself at his mother’s home.', 'Early the next morning, October 4, a dispatcher at the Cranston Fire Department received a distressing emergency call. On the other end of the line was Trisha Oliver, and she related disturbing news: her son was not breathing. Within minutes, a crew of four men from the Cranston Fire Department arrived at Ms. Oliver’s apartment. Private David Brouillard, an 3', 'As this Court previously has noted, this text message “was never actually delivered” because of “a lack of funds on [Ms.] Oliver’s phone[.]” Patino, 93 A.3d at 44 n.3.', '-4- emergency medical technician, was one of the first to respond to the scene. Upon rushing into Ms. Oliver’s apartment, Pvt. Brouillard first observed a young boy on the couch. The boy was unresponsive. Private Brouillard also encountered a woman, who he later confirmed was Ms. Oliver, and another child. Ms. Oliver, Pvt. Brouillard noted, “appeared nervous and upset.” There was also another person in the apartment; a man who Pvt. Brouillard noticed was “quiet, standing in the corner, not saying anything.” That man, it turned out, was defendant.', 'As soon as Pvt. Brouillard entered the apartment, he went to the boy on the couch. The boy “was not breathing and he had no pulse.” While Pvt. Brouillard continued checking for a pulse, Ms. Oliver, upset and nervous, told him that the boy “had been up all night vomiting and complaining of stomach pain.” Two of the other responders, Privates Christopher Coutu and Mark Bouchard, also hurried over to the boy to administer aid. The fourth firefighter on the scene, Lieutenant James Woyciechowski, radioed in the boy’s status to the incoming rescue personnel.', 'With time of the essence, Pvt. Brouillard began “working on the [boy’s] airway,” while Pvt. Coutu continued to search for a pulse. As Pvt. Brouillard searched for any obstructions in the boy’s airway, he opened a breathing bag to ventilate him. Private Bouchard also readied an automated external defibrillator (AED), which is a device designed to check the heart’s rhythm and, if needed, deliver electric shocks to reset it. However, after Pvt. Bouchard pushed the button marked “analyze” on the AED, it read: “no shock advised.” Neither Pvt. Brouillard nor Pvt. Coutu found a pulse.', 'As Pvt. Brouillard and Pvt. Coutu ventilated the boy and continued administering CPR, the rescue arrived at the scene. Lieutenant Thomas Rimoshytus, who arrived with the rescue personnel and who had been informed that the boy was not responding to aid, instructed: “Scoop', '-5- him up and let’s go.” With the AED pads still attached to the boy’s body, Pvt. Coutu cradled the child and rushed him out to the just-arrived ambulance. Inside the ambulance, the boy was placed on a stretcher, and the rescuers administered CPR and reconnected the AED. Still, as Pvt. Brouillard testified, the boy’s body looked “limp and totally lifeless.”', 'During all of this commotion, with his girlfriend hysterical, his girlfriend’s son unresponsive, and a number of firefighters and rescue personnel rushing about, defendant appeared to be calm and quiet. As a number of the firefighters observed, defendant remained off to the side, standing in the hallway, with his hands in his pockets.', 'En route to the hospital, the rescue personnel applied the AED again. This time, pushing the analyze button resulted in a reading of “shock advise[d].” As Lt. Rimoshytus later testified, “[w]e shocked him, and he was still pulseless and not breathing * * *.”', 'Just before 6:30 a.m., the rescue arrived at Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence. Medical records reveal that the boy did not regain a documented pulse until 7:20 a.m. Linda Snelling, M.D., the Chief of Pediatric Critical Care and Medical Director of the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, was the boy’s attending physician that morning. She described his condition as “[g]rave.” The boy underwent CT scans of his brain and abdomen, and he was later moved to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.', 'As Dr. Snelling testified, the CT scans showed that there was the presence of “free air” in the boy’s abdomen. Free air, Dr. Snelling explained, indicates an “abdominal perforation, usually an intentional perforation.” While the free “air itself hurts,” she testified that “the bigger problem is that if you have a perforation or a hole in your intestine, what is inside the intestines spills out into the abdominal cavity and it’s full of bacteria.” That, according to Dr. Snelling, “can cause a lot of irritation, * * * infection, and it can cause a lot of tissue swelling. It can', '-6- change the blood flow to the organs, and depending upon where in the intestine the hole is located, it can also spill acids from the digestive system into the abdominal contents.”', 'Over the course of the next several hours, the boy’s condition did not improve. As the morning turned to afternoon, according to Dr. Snelling, he was on “[e]very kind of life support system except for a heart bypass machine. He had adrenaline to make his heart beat. He had a ventilator to breathe for him. * * * He had blood products. He was getting a lot of resuscitation.” However, despite the heroic efforts of medical personnel, Marco Nieves was later pronounced dead.', 'Back at the apartment, Lieutenant (then-sergeant) Matthew Kite of the Cranston Police Department had arrived just as the rescue left for the hospital. He approached the apartment and spoke with Ms. Oliver, who was visibly upset and was pacing outside her apartment building. Ms. Oliver then agreed to walk him through her apartment. Once inside, Lt. Kite observed two individuals, defendant and the infant daughter of defendant and Ms. Oliver. The defendant, according to Lt. Kite, was seated calmly on the couch. Lieutenant Kite then walked with Ms. Oliver room by room, observing that one bed had been stripped of its sheets, which were piled on the floor. He also spotted “a white waste basket with a coffee ground type substance visible in the bottom.” In the bathroom, he viewed the same “brown coffee grind type substance in the toilet.” The object of his search, Lt. Kite explained, was to find the cause of Marco’s injury, which he initially suspected was “an ingestion of a toxic substance” such as a “household cleaner.”', 'After the apartment walk-through, Ms. Oliver left for the hospital. Lieutenant Kite, now in the kitchen area, began making small talk with defendant, who was standing near the kitchen. As Lt. Kite scanned the living room, he noticed that there were a number of cell phones lying', '-7- about. Then, the home phone, a landline, rang, and defendant answered it. After he hung up, defendant, apparently recognizing that he would soon be leaving, changed his daughter’s diaper and began packing a diaper bag. Meanwhile, a cell phone on the kitchen counter caught Lt. Kite’s attention, either by making a sound or vibration, or because the screen lit up. The defendant, who had finished packing the diaper bag, sat back down on the couch and did not respond to the cell phone. When Lt. Kite picked up the cell phone from the counter, its screen indicated that a new message had been received. After a few clicks, he read the message but quickly returned the cell phone to the counter. The information that Lt. Kite gleaned from that text message was incriminating and it gave him cause to contact police headquarters. Although he had initially been searching for household items that Marco may have ingested, the text message indicated that there was a different, more malicious cause of injury. 4', 'The defendant was transported to the Cranston police station, where he agreed to speak with two detectives. In his interview with the detectives, defendant did not have much to offer. He confirmed that he had been out the evening and night of Saturday, October 3, and that he had returned to Ms. Oliver’s apartment sometime between three and four o’clock in the morning. The defendant also said that Ms. Oliver had informed him that Marco had been vomiting. 5', 'On April 2, 2010, close to six months after Marco Nieves died, defendant was indicted by a grand jury for Marco Nieves’s murder, in violation of §§ 11-23-1 and 11-23-2. After a trial in the Superior Court held in April 2015, defendant was convicted of murder in the second degree. Thereafter, the trial justice sentenced defendant to life imprisonment. The defendant appealed, arguing that the trial justice erred (1) in instructing the jury with respect to second-degree felony 4', 'Later, the police obtained a warrant to search and seize the cell phone Lt. Kite had picked up. See Patino, 93 A.3d at 45. 5', 'The questioning was video recorded, a recording that the jury would later view at trial.', '-8- murder; (2) in instructing the jury with respect to causation; and (3) by admitting testimony about prior bruising that had been observed on Marco’s body.', 'II', 'The Jury Instructions', 'The defendant’s first two assignments of error arise out of the trial justice’s jury instructions. He first argues that the trial justice erred with respect to her instruction on second- degree felony murder in three respects: (1) that the instruction on second-degree felony murder deprived him of due process because, even though the indictment charged him with murder in violation of § 11-23-1, it included neither a charge of second-degree felony murder nor a charge of the predicate felony to second-degree felony murder, felony child abuse; (2) that there should have been no instruction on second-degree felony murder at all because, under the merger doctrine, the predicate felony for second-degree felony murder—in this case, felony child abuse—should have merged into the homicide; and (3) that the trial justice erred by describing the injury required to establish felony child abuse as one that was “however slight.”', 'The defendant also takes issue with the trial justice’s instruction on causation. According to defendant, the instruction on proximate cause did not sufficiently explain to the jury the lynchpin of his defense—that is, whether Marco Nieves’s death was proximately caused by defendant, as the state had argued, or by Ms. Oliver’s failure to obtain medical care for the child, as defendant maintained.', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'We review jury instructions de novo.

(quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 929 (R.I. 2005)).

Ensey, 881 A.2d 81, 95 (R.I. 2005)).', 'B', 'Second-Degree Felony Murder', 'The trial justice began her charge to the jury with a definition of murder: “Murder, whether murder in the first degree or murder in the second degree, is the unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.” Accordingly, the trial justice explained, to convict defendant of murder, either in the first or second degree, the jury had to find that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) “that the [d]efendant willfully caused the death of another human”; and (2) “that the [d]efendant acted with malice aforethought.”', 'The trial justice then distinguished between murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree. To find defendant guilty of first-degree murder, the trial justice told the jurors, they needed to conclude that defendant “acted with premeditation[,]” meaning an “intent to kill * * * which * * * existed for more than a mere moment.” If, the trial justice explained, a', '- 10 - defendant “commits a murder but does not act with premeditation having a duration of more than a mere moment, * * * [he] is guilty of murder in the second degree * * *.”', 'The trial justice then turned to that with which defendant has taken issue on appeal: the instruction on second-degree felony murder. She explained that if the jury did not find defendant guilty of first-degree murder, or if the jury did not find that the state had proven that defendant acted with the requisite intent to kill for second-degree murder, then the jury still had to “consider whether the [s]tate has proven [d]efendant guilty of second degree felony murder.” As the trial justice clarified for the jury, “[t]hat’s murder in the second degree also, but it’s on a different theory.”', 'She first summarized the doctrine of second-degree felony murder:', '“Under our law, the criminal offense of second degree', 'murder may also be established under what is known as the Felony', 'Murder Rule. If a [d]efendant kills someone in the course of or in', 'attempting to commit an inherently dangerous felony, then that', 'killing is by law considered second degree murder even if the', '[d]efendant did not intend to kill another human being.', '“Under this doctrine the [s]tate need not prove malice or', 'intent to kill. So you can still find the [d]efendant guilty of second', 'degree murder even if the [s]tate does not prove malice or intent to', 'kill, if the Doctrine of Felony Murder applies.” The trial justice then explained that:', '“In order to convict [d]efendant of second degree murder', 'under the Felony Murder Doctrine, the [s]tate must prove the', 'following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: Number l, that the', '[d]efendant caused the death of Marco Nieves; and Number 2, that', 'he did so while committing or attempting to commit an inherently', 'dangerous felony. In order to convict the [d]efendant of second', 'degree murder under the Felony Murder Doctrine, the [s]tate does', 'not have to prove that the [d]efendant acted with malice', 'aforethought or even that he intended to kill anybody.', '“* * *', '“The only intent required is that the [d]efendant intended to', 'commit the underlying felony, the one that is inherently dangerous', '* * *.”', '- 11 -', 'In this case, the predicate felony for the trial justice’s second-degree felony murder instruction was felony child abuse, a violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-9-5.3—which is also known as “Brendan’s Law.” The trial justice described Brendan’s Law as follows:', '“I instruct you that under Rhode Island law, where a person', 'having care of a child knowingly or intentionally inflicts any', 'physical injury upon the child, however slight, he or she is guilty of', 'a felony * * *.” (Emphasis added.) She then explained that Brendan’s Law contained an exception: “If the injury inflicted does not constitute a serious bodily injury and the injury arises from the imposition of non-excessive corporal punishment, then the person has not committed a felony.”', 'Significantly, as the trial justice neared the end of her instruction on second-degree felony murder, she noted that: “The decision as to whether the felony is inherently dangerous or reflects conscious disregard for the risk to human life rests on [the] fact[s] of the case.” And, as she told the jury, in determining whether the child abuse alleged in this case constituted an inherently dangerous felony, “you should consider all of the facts and circumstances proven at trial, including the nature and severity of the alleged punishment, the size and age of the child, as well as any disparity in size and strength between the victim and the [d]efendant.”', 'The trial justice also imparted an instruction on involuntary manslaughter. In doing so, she reiterated that “it is unlawful for a person having care of a child to knowingly or intentionally inflict physical injury on the child however slight the injury.” Drawing on her earlier instruction on felony child abuse, she then instructed the jury that there were only two “circumstances pertinent to this case where you could determine that the [d]efendant is guilty of involuntary manslaughter due to criminal negligence”: (1) when “the injury does not constitute serious', '- 12 - bodily injury”; and (2) when “the injury results from the imposition of non-excessive corporal punishment.” With that, the trial justice concluded her instructions to the jury.', 'But before sending the jury out for a recess, the trial justice summoned the attorneys for a sidebar. After briefly clarifying an instruction on an issue irrelevant to defendant’s appeal, the trial justice turned to defendant’s attorney, inquiring whether he had any objections to the jury instructions. He began by lodging the following objection:', '“Judge, I think the first issue that comes to my mind is that felony', 'murder rule that was not charged in the Indictment, and my', 'understanding on the felony murder rule is a typical situation', 'where a person goes into a bank, robs a bank and then one of the', 'people shoots the security guard, so even though in that particular', 'case if the driver of the car didn’t go into the bank he would be', 'liable because of that shooting. And I think the facts of this case', '[are] very different. Felony murder rule doesn’t apply in this', 'particular case.” However, the trial justice disagreed, explaining that: “I do think that it does. I think there’s case law to that effect, and I think it only makes sense because the [d]efendant requested a charge on manslaughter, actually requested an involuntary manslaughter[] charge.” This, according to the trial justice, had created a dilemma. If she did not instruct the jury on second-degree felony murder, she explained, there would be “a huge gap” in the jury instructions with respect to the jury’s decision regarding defendant’s intent.', 'The trial justice explained that, because an instruction on voluntary manslaughter was clearly unwarranted, if she gave instructions on first- degree murder, second-degree murder, and involuntary manslaughter, but did not give an instruction on second-degree felony murder, then the jury “could determine that [defendant] acted unlawfully” in a manner that “rose to the level of [a] felony * * * in violation of Brend[a]n’s Law” but also find him not guilty of involuntary manslaughter. “So[,]” the trial justice reasoned, “we would have a situation where [defendant] would be convicted if he acted', '- 13 - lawfully but criminally negligent and acquitted if he acted unlawfully amounting to a felony * * *.” That, the trial justice concluded, made no sense. Accordingly, she overruled defendant’s objection.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice’s instruction on second-degree felony murder was erroneous in three ways, any of which, in his view, warrants a new trial. First, defendant contends that that instruction deprived him of his due process rights—namely, his right to fair notice and his right to present a meaningful defense—because the indictment was silent as to second-degree felony murder or as to felony child abuse, which the trial justice used as the predicate felony for the second-degree felony murder instruction in this case.', 'As we have explained, “[m]urder is defined by § 11-23-1 as ‘[t]he unlawful killing of a human being with malice aforethought.’” State v. Diaz, 46 A.3d 849, 861 (R.I. 2012). Under § 11-23-1, “first-degree murder is ‘[e]very murder perpetrated by poison, lying in wait, or any other kind of willful, deliberate, malicious, and premeditated killing’ or any murder committed during the commission of certain enumerated felonies.” Id. (quoting § 11-23-1). Second-degree murder, on the other hand, is “any killing of a human being committed with malice aforethought that is not defined by statute as first-degree murder.” Id. at 862 (quoting State v. Parkhurst, 706 A.2d 412, 421 (R.I. 1998)). Of particular relevance to this case, it is well settled that “[t]his Court has recognized three possible ‘theories of second-degree murder, each grounded in a different aspect of malice aforethought.’” Id. (quoting State v. Gillespie, 960 A.2d 969, 976 (R.I. 2008)). We have distilled those theories of second-degree murder to the following formulation:', '“The first theory involves those killings in which the defendant', 'formed a momentary intent to kill contemporaneous with the', 'homicide. * * * The second theory includes felony murder for', 'inherently dangerous felonies that are not expressly listed within', 'the statutory definition of first-degree murder. * * * The third', 'theory of second-degree murder involves those killings in which', '- 14 -', 'the defendant killed with wanton recklessness or conscious', 'disregard for the possibility of death or of great bodily harm.” Id.', '(internal quotation marks omitted).', 'It is true that the indictment in this case did not expressly charge defendant with second- degree felony murder or with felony child abuse, but only that he caused the death of Marco Nieves, in violation of § 11-23-1, which proscribes murder in both the first and second degree. However, based on our caselaw describing the three ways in which the state can prove second- degree murder, see Diaz, 46 A.3d at 862, we cannot say that the trial justice’s jury instructions deprived defendant of fair notice of the charges asserted against him. Second-degree felony murder is a well-established theory of proving the requisite intent for second-degree murder, and, in this case, there was overwhelming evidence adduced at trial that could lead a jury to conclude that defendant’s physical abuse of six-year-old Marco Nieves constituted felony child abuse, in violation of Brendan’s Law—just as the trial justice instructed. Although it appears that the trial justice sua sponte instructed the jury regarding felony child abuse, it is significant that she did not instruct the jury that he could be convicted of it as a standalone criminal offense. Rather, the trial justice instructed that felony child abuse could serve as the predicate felony for second- degree felony murder. Accordingly, we reject defendant’s contention that he was deprived of fair notice and an opportunity to present a meaningful defense solely because the trial justice gave an instruction on second-degree felony murder based on felony child abuse. 6', 'Next, defendant contends that, based on the doctrine of merger, there should not have been an instruction on second-degree felony murder and, he argues, the trial justice erred when she gave such an instruction. As a threshold matter, we have grave reservations as to whether 6', 'Moreover, our review of the evidence in this case also demonstrates that the jury could just have easily determined that defendant’s conduct amounted to “wanton recklessness or conscious disregard for the possibility of death or of great bodily harm[,]” another theory of second-degree murder. State v. Diaz, 46 A.3d 849, 862 (R.I. 2012).', '- 15 - this issue is properly before us, given the rather broad objection that defendant made to the instruction at sidebar. See State v. Crow, 871 A.2d 930, 935 (R.I. 2005). Nonetheless, even if the objection were properly preserved, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not err on this issue.', 'As defendant has correctly indicated, the doctrine of merger, as articulated by the California Supreme Court in People v. Ireland, 450 P.2d 580 (Cal. 1969), provides “that a second degree felony-murder instruction may not properly be given when it is based upon a felony which is an integral part of the homicide and which the evidence produced by the prosecution shows to be an offense included in fact within the offense charged.” Ireland, 450 P.2d at 590. However, we note that this doctrine has evolved since Ireland was decided, in part because of confusion surrounding the interplay between merger and second-degree felony murder. For instance, in People v. Sarun Chun, 203 P.3d 425 (Cal. 2009), the California Supreme Court, in an effort to clarify that confusion, reframed its merger doctrine:', '“When the underlying felony is assaultive in nature, * * * we now', 'conclude that the felony merges with the homicide and cannot be', 'the basis of a felony-murder instruction. An ‘assaultive’ felony is', 'one that involves a threat of immediate violent injury. * * * In', 'determining whether a crime merges, the court looks to its', 'elements and not the facts of the case. Accordingly, if the', 'elements of the crime have an assaultive aspect, the crime merges', 'with the underlying homicide even if the elements also include', 'conduct that is not assaultive.” Sarun Chun, 203 P.3d at 443.', 'In Rhode Island, however, we have eschewed the California approach and have taken a different approach to second-degree felony murder. Rather than have “the court look[] to [the] elements [of the predicate felony] and not the facts of the case[,]” Sarun Chun, 203 P.3d at 443, we leave it to the factfinder “to consider the facts and circumstances of the particular case to determine if [a] felony was inherently dangerous in the manner and the circumstances in which it', '- 16 - was committed * * *.” 7 State v. Stewart, 663 A.2d 912, 919 (R.I. 1995). If the factfinder determines that a defendant committed an inherently dangerous felony, then that felony may serve as the predicate felony for second-degree felony murder. Id.', 'We have considered this approach to be more straightforward than the merger doctrine, and it avoids the potential for confusion that has resulted from its adoption elsewhere. See, e.g., Sarun Chun, 203 P.3d at 427. But see State v. Jones, 155 A.3d 492, 508 (Md. 2017) (adopting the merger doctrine “to maintain the integrity of the different levels of culpability of murder and manslaughter and to ameliorate its perceived harshness”).', 'Our jurisdiction’s check on the harshness of the felony murder rule is the requirement that “[t]o serve as a predicate felony to a charge of second-degree murder, a felony that is not specifically enumerated in § 11-23-1 must * * * be an inherently dangerous felony.” Stewart, 663 A.2d at 918. If the factfinder concludes that the underlying felony was in fact inherently dangerous, then “[t]he intent to commit the underlying felony will be imputed to the homicide, and a defendant may thus be charged with [and convicted of] murder on the basis of the intent to commit the underlying felony.” Id. at 920; see also Diaz, 46 A.3d at 862. Nothing defendant has raised in this case has persuaded us to alter that approach.', 'In the record before us, there is substantial evidence upon which the jury could have relied to determine that defendant committed an inherently dangerous felony. The defendant, a two-hundred-twenty-pound adult man, punched Marco Nieves, a six-year-old boy standing four- feet-one and weighing seventy-six pounds, with such force that the blow ruptured Marco’s intestine. It is difficult to fathom how those facts do not demonstrate the commission of an 7', 'In State v. Stewart, 663 A.2d 912 (R.I. 1995), we expressly “decline[d] [the] defendant’s invitation to adopt the California approach in determining whether a felony is inherently dangerous to life and thus capable of serving as a predicate to a charge of second-degree felony murder.” Stewart, 663 A.2d at 919.', '- 17 - inherently dangerous felony, in violation of Brendan’s Law. Because we decline to adopt the merger doctrine as it has been formulated by the California Supreme Court, the question of whether a felony is inherently dangerous in Rhode Island remains in the hands of the factfinder, not the court. Stewart, 663 A.2d at 919, 920.', 'The final issue that defendant presses on appeal with respect to the instruction on second- degree felony murder arises out of the trial justice’s use of the phrase “however slight” when she was discussing Brendan’s Law. Again, despite the preservation problem relating to this issue, we will briefly address why defendant’s argument misses the mark.', 'Brendan’s Law provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“(b) Whenever a person having care of a child, as defined by § 40-', '11-2(2), whether assumed voluntarily or because of a legal', 'obligation, including any instance where a child has been placed', 'by his or her parents, caretaker, or licensed or governmental child', 'placement agency for care or treatment, knowingly or', 'intentionally:', '“(1) Inflicts upon a child serious bodily injury, shall be guilty of', 'first degree child abuse.', '“(2) Inflicts upon a child any other physical injury, shall be guilty', 'of second degree child abuse.” Section 11-9-5.3(b). Despite the nature of the injury inflicted, it is a felony to commit either first-degree child abuse—which requires proof of a “serious bodily injury”—or second-degree child abuse—which requires proof of merely “any other physical injury[.]” Sections 11-9-5.3(b), (e). A “serious bodily injury” is one that:', '“(1) Creates a substantial risk of death;', '“(2) Causes protracted loss or impairment of the function of any', 'bodily parts, member or organ, including any fractures of any', 'bones;', '“(3) Causes serious disfigurement; or', '“(4) Evidences subdural hematoma, intercranial hemorrhage and/or', 'retinal hemorrhages as signs of ‘shaken baby syndrome’ and/or', '‘abusive head trauma.’” Section 11-9-5.3(c).', '- 18 - The term “other physical injury” is “any injury, other than a serious bodily injury, which arises other than from the imposition of nonexcessive corporal punishment.” Section 11-9-5.3(d).', 'Here, in instructing the jury on Brendan’s Law, the trial justice stated that, save for the exception regarding nonexcessive corporal punishment, “under Rhode Island law, where a person having care of a child knowingly or intentionally inflicts any physical injury upon the child, however slight, he or she is guilty of a felony * * *.” (Emphasis added.) Later, the trial justice reiterated that “it is unlawful for a person having care of a child to knowingly or intentionally inflict physical injury on the child however slight the injury.” However, although the descriptor “however slight” may have deviated to some extent from the statutory definition of any “other physical injury” set forth in Brendan’s Law, we are of the opinion that the trial justice’s jury instruction, when viewed in its entirety, was not erroneous. See Delestre, 35 A.3d at 891.', 'When she instructed the jury, the trial justice quoted directly from Brendan’s Law in defining “serious bodily injury.” 8 It follows, then, that anything other than a “serious bodily injury”—meaning any “other physical injury”—could be understood as a physical injury “however slight” inflicted upon a child. Although those are not the precise words set forth in the statute, in our view, the trial justice’s characterization of “any other physical injury” as being synonymous with an injury “however slight” did not so distort the statute’s language as to mislead or confuse the jury. See Florez, 138 A.3d at 793. As we have said on innumerable occasions, it is not our role to pick apart single phrases from the rest of the jury instructions and search for error; rather, it is our task to examine the jury instructions “in the context in which 8', 'The trial justice explained that: “For purposes of [Brendan’s] [L]aw, the term ‘serious bodily injury’ means physical injury that creates a substantial risk of death or causes protracted loss or impairment of the function of any body parts, member or organ, including any fractures of any bones[,] or causes serious disfigurement.”', '- 19 - they were rendered.” Delestre, 35 A.3d at 891 (quoting Kittell, 847 A.2d at 849). Viewed through that prism, it is clear to us that the trial justice’s instruction to the jury on second-degree felony murder, using Brendan’s Law as the predicate felony, on the whole, was detailed and thorough, and more than adequately covered the law. Id.', 'C', 'Causation', 'We turn now to what was defendant’s primary defense at trial: whether his conduct was the proximate cause of Marco Nieves’s death. He contends that the trial justice’s instruction on that issue was erroneous.', 'At trial, the thrust of defendant’s case was that, although his punch may have injured Marco, it was Marco’s mother, Ms. Oliver, who ultimately caused the child’s death because she failed to get Marco the medical care that, defendant argued, would have saved his life. To support that defense, defendant proffered expert testimony from Elizabeth Laposata, M.D., who specializes in forensic pathology and who once served as Rhode Island’s chief medical examiner. Doctor Laposata testified that, in her opinion, Marco’s injury was “a survivable injury[,]” and that, had he been brought to the hospital within hours of his being injured, “surgery could have been performed to sew up the hole [in his duodenum] * * *.” But, Dr. Laposata explained, because “the time period” from when Marco was injured to when he was brought to the hospital—which she estimated was fifteen or sixteen hours—“was so long[,] he went into shock and could not be revived.” Of note, Dr. Laposata also testified that Marco Nieves “died from peritonitis due to an untreated perforation of the duodenum due to blunt force trauma.”', 'In support of his causation defense, defendant also pointed to a text message that Ms. Oliver sent to him in the midst of their lengthy exchange on October 3, 2009. At 5:17 p.m., after', '- 20 - writing that Marco’s stomach was tight, his eyes were rolling, and he was still vomiting, Ms. Oliver sent defendant the following text message: “please tell me wea my blunt is cuz im stress like wtf i cut down a whole lot mike like seriously i take 1 or 2 hits and it relaxxes me[.]” 9', 'Based on Dr. Laposata’s testimony and Ms. Oliver’s concern about obtaining marijuana, which apparently outweighed her concerns for medical care for Marco, defendant argued that the proximate cause of Marco’s death was not his own conduct, but rather Ms. Oliver’s failure to get Marco medical treatment. The trial justice included an instruction on the doctrine of intervening causation in her charge to the jury. As she described it,', '“The Doctrine of Independent Intervening Cause', 'recognizes that a person’s misconduct may not be a proximate', 'cause of the death of another if it’s rendered remote in the causal', 'sense because of an intervening act or acts of a third person.', 'However, for an intervening act or omission of a third person to', 'relieve a [d]efendant of criminal responsibility for causing a death,', 'the intervening act must be the sole proximate cause of the death.”', 'On appeal, defendant argues, as he did to the trial justice, that the instructions to the jury on causation were insufficient because they did not require the jury to consider whether Ms. Oliver’s failure to obtain medical treatment was an unforeseeable, intervening cause of Marco Nieves’s death. In other words, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in explaining the circumstances under which Ms. Oliver’s conduct could replace his own as the proximate cause of Marco’s death. We do not agree.', 'Although independent intervening cause is a doctrine that most often arises in the arena of civil cases, e.g., Contois v. Town of West Warwick, 865 A.2d 1019, 1027 (R.I. 2004), we are not wholly without precedent in other contexts. In In re Leon, 122 R.I. 548, 410 A.2d 121 9', '“Blunt” is slang for a cigar filled with marijuana. As we recently explained, “[i]f one empties the contents of a cigar, it can be filled with marijuana and resealed. The finished product is a blunt.” State v.

In re Leon, 122 R.I. at 550, 555-56, 410 A.2d at 123, 125, 126. However, this Court rejected that argument, affirming the trial justice’s decision to exclude evidence regarding the facility’s training on fire emergencies and the fire department’s response time. Id. at 556, 557, 410 A.2d at 126.', 'Analogizing the respondent’s argument in that case “to those raised in situations in which the victim of a violent act has sought medical treatment which” does not “cur[e] * * * his wounds” or save his life, In re Leon, 122 R.I. at 556, 410 A.2d at 126, we explained that:', '“An injury from which the victim bleeds to death is the', 'proximate cause of the decease even if the loss of blood might', 'have been stopped had medical aid been promptly obtained.', 'Obviously the fact that a doctor was not at hand to render', 'immediate aid cannot be regarded as a superseding cause; but the', 'result is not dependent upon unavailability.

Therefore, “proximate cause is not superseded, nor the act that produced it excused, by the failure on the part of those who might have assisted, cured, or rescued the victim to exercise a higher quality of skill or efficiency or a more appropriate response in the face of emergency when their actions might have favorably affected the result.” Id.', '- 22 -', 'The Supreme Judicial Court in our sister state of Massachusetts has explained the doctrine in this way: “The general rule is that the intervening conduct of a third party will relieve a defendant of culpability only if such an intervening response was not reasonably foreseeable.” Commonwealth v.

We embrace that analysis here.', 'With that in mind, after carefully examining the trial justice’s instructions to the jury regarding causation in their entirety, it is our opinion that they adequately and correctly covered the law. See Delestre, 35 A.3d at 891. It is clear to us that the jurors were properly informed about the law of proximate cause and the doctrine of intervening causation and that they were availed of the opportunity to find that, as defendant had argued, Ms. Oliver’s conduct superseded defendant’s as the proximate cause of Marco Nieves’s death. After listening to the competing experts presented by defendant and by the state, 10 and after absorbing the trial justice’s thorough instructions on this issue, the jury determined that the physical beating inflicted by defendant had proximately caused Marco’s death.', 'Indeed, based on the evidence in this case, it is difficult for us to fathom how the punch of a two-hundred-twenty-pound adult male to the stomach of a small child—so forceful in its impact that it ruptured the child’s duodenum—could be replaced by that child’s mother’s 10', 'As noted above, Dr. Thomas Gilson testified that the cause of Marco’s death was peritonitis and that the manner of death was homicide. Similarly, Dr. Linda Snelling, who treated Marco, testified that, although Marco could have survived had he been brought to the hospital while he was still alive, he nonetheless died from “an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest as a result of his abdominal injury, and that prolonged arrest led to his multiple organ failure and his death.”', '- 23 - delayed call to emergency services as the proximate cause of death. To borrow from what the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts wrote in Garcia, Marco Nieves’s “death follow[ed] as a consequence of [defendant’s] felonious and wicked act, [and] it does not alter its nature or diminish its criminality to prove that other causes cooperated in producing the fatal result.” Garcia, 18 N.E.3d at 668 (quoting McLeod, 477 N.E.2d at 985). The focus for the jury in this case was on “not what would have happened, but what did happen * * *.” In re Leon, 122 R.I. at 556, 410 A.2d at 126 (quoting Perkins, supra, at 715-16). As the trial justice correctly informed the jury, Ms. Oliver’s failure to seek medical treatment for her son until nearly a day after defendant’s assault on her son did not necessarily break the chain of proximate cause.', 'Furthermore, what defendant’s argument overlooks is that he, too, had a duty to care for Marco. The trial justice described precisely that point of law to the jury:', '“[I]f you find that the [s]tate has met all of the other elements of', 'the crime charged, even if you find that the failure to obtain', 'medical treatment was a cause of Marco’s death, that finding will', 'not preclude a verdict of guilty.

One person can have a legal duty to assist a victim in', 'getting medical treatment. There are certain situations in which a', 'duty is created to render aid, to obtain medical assistance for', 'another if needed.” One of those situations, as the trial justice explained, occurs when a “duty [is] imposed” based on “the person’s relationship to the injured party, such as the custodial parent of a sick child.” The trial justice instructed that Marco’s mother, Ms. Oliver, fell into that category. 11 The other 11', 'See State v. Robat, 49 A.3d 58, 80 (R.I. 2012) (citing State v.

Having been properly charged, the jury found that Ms. Oliver’s conduct did not absolve defendant of the consequences of his own acts. child’”). In May 2016, Ms. Oliver pleaded guilty to manslaughter and received a twenty-year sentence of imprisonment, with 105 months to serve and the remainder suspended.', '- 25 -', 'III', 'The Testimony about Prior Bruising', 'The defendant’s final argument is that the trial justice erred when she allowed Alexandra Correia, the girlfriend of Marco Nieves’s father, Rafael Nieves, to testify about an incident in which she observed a softball-sized bruise on Marco’s back. The defendant argues that this “other acts” evidence was inadmissible under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and, even if it were admissible, it should have been excluded under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence because its relevance was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial impact on the jury. On the other hand, the state contends that, not only was the testimony admissible under Rule 404(b) and not unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403, but it also became relevant because of a question defendant himself asked of Guida Andrade, Ms. Correia’s mother. As a result, the state argues, defendant “opened the door” to Ms. Correia’s testimony.', 'In our opinion, the record establishes that defendant did indeed open the door to Ms. Correia’s testimony. Prior to trial, the state had filed, but later withdrew, a motion in limine to introduce testimony from Ms. Correia. As noted above, Ms. Correia is the girlfriend of Marco’s father and also is the daughter of Ms. Andrade. She was prepared to testify to an incident where she observed bruising on Marco’s back; however, before trial, the state decided not to pursue that line of inquiry.', 'During the cross-examination of Ms. Andrade, who had testified for the state, the following exchange took place between her and defense counsel:', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] When [Marco] would come for', 'Sunday dinner, what time would he be taken home?', '“[MS.

Did you ever see any bruises', 'on him?', '“[MS. ANDRADE:] No.” (Emphasis added.) When defendant asked Ms. Andrade whether she had ever seen any bruises on Marco’s body, Ms. Correia’s once marginally relevant testimony about seeing prior bruising became far more relevant. The trial justice recounted the events as follows:', '“On cross-examination it was the defense attorney who explored', '[Ms. Andrade’s] opportunities to observe the boy’s body and', 'elicited testimony from her that she had those opportunities and', 'never saw any bruises.', '“As I understood it, there had been previous rulings or', 'agreements that [Ms. Correia], the daughter of this woman, could', 'not offer testimony that she observed bruises when she bathed the', 'boy because, frankly, bruises on the boy could mean any number', 'of things. They’re not connected necessarily to this [d]efendant.', 'Whether she saw bruises on the boy in January of ‘09 or December', 'of ‘08 does not in any way lead to the reasonable inference that', 'they were caused by [d]efendant. Not at all. So it wasn’t coming', 'in.', '“Then [defense counsel] asked [Ms. Andrade] if she', 'observed bruises, as though that was relevant, and she said no.', 'Now, [the prosecutor] said, ‘Ah, ha. You opened the door. I want', 'to be able to call [Ms. Correia] and ask if she saw bruises.’” Ultimately, over defendant’s objection, the trial justice allowed the state to put Ms. Correia on the stand. 12', 'According to Ms. Correia, sometime in late December 2008 or early January 2009, Marco visited Ms. Correia and his father, Rafael, 13 at her apartment. During that visit, Rafael bathed Marco. At some point during that bath, Rafael called Ms. Correia into the bathroom. 12', 'The trial justice also decided that she would give a cautionary instruction to the jury, which she provided after Ms. Correia testified. 13', 'We refer to Rafael Nieves by first name to avoid confusion. In doing so, we intend no disrespect.', '- 27 - When she entered the bathroom, she noticed bruising on Marco’s back. From her vantage point of only a few inches away, Ms. Correia described what she observed as a bruise that was “[t]he size of a softball.” When Rafael asked Marco how he had gotten the bruise, the boy initially said that he had fallen. But, upon further prompting from his father, Marco told Rafael and Ms. Correia, “Mommy’s boyfriend hit me.” Ms. Correia testified that, when Marco admitted this, he appeared “upset” and “sad.” 14', 'A', 'Standard of Review', '“We have long held that ‘decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v.

Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 147 (R.I. 2009)).', 'B', 'Discussion', 'The defendant argues that Ms. Correia’s testimony was inadmissible under Rule 404(b), and, alternatively, even if it were admissible under that rule, that it should have been excluded under Rule 403. In defendant’s view, because Ms. Correia did not specify who Marco was referring to when he said “Mommy’s boyfriend hit me[,]” the testimony was speculative and not relevant to defendant’s intent in this case. The crux of defendant’s argument is that, because the relevance of this speculative reference was low and the potential for undue prejudice was high, the testimony should have been excluded under Rule 403. Based on the recitation of events at trial, however, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not err when she allowed Ms. Correia to 14', 'At this juncture, the trial justice gave a cautionary instruction; there was no objection.', '- 28 - testify. The defendant, by interrogating Ms. Andrade about bruising, did indeed open the door to the relevancy of Ms. Correia’s testimony. Accordingly, it is our opinion that the trial justice was well within the considerable bounds of her discretion when she allowed the testimony.', 'Rule 404(b) provides, in pertinent part, that “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.” However, such evidence “may * * * be admissible” if it is offered “for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident, or to prove that defendant feared imminent bodily harm and that the fear was reasonable.” R.I. R. Evid. 404(b).', 'We conclude that the trial justice was correct in finding that Ms. Correia’s testimony was relevant to show defendant’s intent and lack of mistake or accident. From the outset of the trial, defendant’s intent was at issue. Indeed, defendant, who sought and received from the trial justice an instruction on involuntary manslaughter, argued to the jury that he had not intentionally killed Marco. Rather, defendant argued, the evidence supported a finding that he, at most, accidentally injured Marco while administering a form of corporal punishment to the child. However, Ms. Correia’s testimony tended to show that Marco had been beaten and bruised before, squarely addressing the questions of intent and lack of mistake or accident. We perceive no error with the admission of that evidence in this case. See State v. Brown, 900 A.2d 1155, 1162 (R.I. 2006) (affirming the trial justice’s admission of “intent-related Rule 404(b) evidence” because the “defendant opened the door by declaring to the jury in his opening statement that [the victim’s] injuries resulted from an accident and that [the] defendant never intended to hurt her”).', 'The defendant next maintains that, even if Ms. Correia’s testimony were admissible under Rule 404(b), it nonetheless should have been excluded under Rule 403. Again, we', '- 29 - disagree. Pursuant to Rule 403, “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” But when defendant elicited from Ms. Andrade that she had not observed bruising on Marco’s body, the relevance of Ms. Correia’s perhaps once marginally relevant testimony increased, and it was no longer substantially outweighed by the concerns delineated in Rule 403. In other words, the balancing analysis prescribed by Rule 403 tilted in the state’s favor after defendant opened the door. 15 Moreover, despite the fact that, as defendant points out, Ms. Correia did not specifically identify defendant as “Mommy’s boyfriend[,]” we agree with the trial justice that this testimony did not mislead the jury. Accordingly, in our view, the trial justice did not err in allowing Ms. Correia’s testimony once defendant opened the door to its relevancy.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the judgment of conviction is affirmed. The papers shall be returned to the Superior Court. 15', 'With respect to Rule 403, “[w]e have said that ‘[u]nless evidence is of limited or marginal relevance and enormously prejudicial, the trial justice should not act to exclude it.’” State v.

2,State : v. : Willie Washington. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Willie Washington, was found guilty by a jury of four offenses in connection with a shooting that occurred in Providence on November 15, 2014.1 Following the denial of his motion for a new trial, the defendant was sentenced to a total of sixty years to serve, with twenty years of that sentence designated as nonparolable.', 'On March 8, 2016, the defendant timely appealed from the judgment of conviction.', 'This appeal has traveled somewhat of an unusual course since it was docketed. Approximately one year after the appeal was filed, on April 28, 2017, defendant filed in this Court a motion to hold the appeal in abeyance and remand the matter to the Superior Court to allow him to seek a new trial based on alleged violations of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963); the state objected. This Court denied defendant’s motion to hold the appeal in abeyance, but granted the remand motion. This Court remanded the portion of the record necessary for the 1', 'The offenses are: count 1, carrying a firearm without a license, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11- 47-8(a); count 2, assault with a dangerous weapon by discharging a firearm and causing injury to Rudy Basquez, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(2); count 3, possession of a firearm with a previous federal court conviction, in violation of § 11-47-5; and count 4, assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2.', '-1- Superior Court to hear and decide defendant’s Brady-related motion for a new trial. On June 19, 2017, a hearing on the alleged Brady violation was held before the same justice of the Superior Court who presided over defendant’s trial. Four days after the hearing concluded, defendant filed a motion to recuse the trial justice. The trial justice held a hearing on defendant’s recusal motion on June 26, 2017; and, on July 19, 2017, the trial justice issued a decision denying both the Brady-related motion for a new trial and the recusal motion.', 'This matter is again before this Court. The defendant now challenges his conviction on five grounds, contending that the trial justice erred by: (1) denying defendant’s motion to suppress two witnesses’ show-up identifications; (2) admitting the recording of an anonymous 911 call at trial; (3) “failing to implement the letter and spirit of this Court’s remand order” in the trial justice’s consideration of defendant’s Brady claim; (4) failing to find that the state withheld information in violation of Brady after dialing the anonymous 911 caller’s phone number and speaking with an individual prior to trial; and (5) denying defendant’s motion to recuse. After careful consideration of defendant’s arguments and a thorough review of the record, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'A', 'The Shooting', 'It is undisputed that on November 15, 2014, at approximately 1 a.m., Rudy Basquez, Jr., a food-delivery driver, was shot in the arm in a road-rage incident. Basquez was driving on Huxley Avenue in Providence after making a food delivery on the Providence College campus when he saw his brother, Michael Pickering, a food-delivery driver for another establishment,', '-2- parked on Huxley Avenue. Basquez stopped his vehicle next to Pickering’s, and the two conversed; in doing so, they blocked traffic in both directions. During their conversation, a dark- colored SUV pulled up behind Basquez’s car, and its driver yelled profanities and repeatedly honked the SUV’s horn because Basquez’s vehicle was blocking his passage. Basquez and the driver of the SUV both exited their vehicles and a verbal argument took place. As Basquez and the SUV driver returned to their respective vehicles, Basquez observed the passenger door of the SUV open and heard “multiple pops”; Basquez suffered a gunshot wound to his arm. The SUV subsequently drove off.', 'B', 'Pretrial Motions', '1', 'Show-Up Identifications', 'Prior to trial, defendant sought to suppress identifications made by two percipient witnesses. At a hearing on defendant’s motion, the following evidence emerged.', 'Testimony of Laura Ferretti and Brianna Sheetz', 'On the evening of November 15, 2014, Laura Ferretti and Brianna Sheetz were visiting friends at Providence College together, and they attended a party. They each claimed to have consumed one beer approximately two hours before the incident. At 1 a.m., Ferretti and Sheetz were sitting in Sheetz’s car waiting for friends before they began their drive back home to Connecticut. Ferretti was sitting in the driver’s seat and Sheetz was sitting in the passenger’s seat, when a smaller vehicle pulled up alongside Sheetz’s car. The driver of the smaller vehicle stopped to talk with someone, whom the women could not see, on the other side of the street. A larger vehicle then pulled up behind the smaller vehicle. Ferretti described the larger vehicle as a', '-3- “greenish-blue” Jeep, “like an SUV.” Sheetz similarly described the larger vehicle as an SUV. When asked the color of the SUV, Sheetz first stated that she did not recall, then subsequently stated, “It was light-colored, I believe.”', 'Then, a heated argument between the occupants of the two vehicles erupted. Ferretti testified that the SUV honked at the smaller car, and the man in the smaller car exited his vehicle and “mouth[ed] off” at the SUV driver. Ferretti then saw someone exit the SUV, but she did not recall from which door he exited. Sheetz testified that both drivers were outside of their vehicles during the argument. Both Ferretti and Sheetz then witnessed an occupant of the SUV fire several gunshots in the direction of the smaller vehicle. Ferretti testified that, once the gunshots began, she and Sheetz put their seats back and made no further observations. Sheetz, however, recalled that when Ferretti told her “to get down,” she did not duck immediately, but instead continued to watch as the shooter entered the passenger-side door of the SUV and the vehicle drove off.', 'Ferretti testified that the shooter was a tall, average-build, African-American male with a black beard who was wearing a dark-colored sweatshirt and a dark-colored beanie. Sheetz described the shooter as “very tall,” with a muscular build, a “light African-American” skin tone, and wearing a “dark jacket, navy blue probably, or black” with no hood, and a beanie hat. Sheetz described the shooter’s face as round with facial hair and noted that her opportunity to observe the shooter’s face was “okay.” When Ferretti was asked if she “g[o]t a good look at [the shooter’s] face,” she testified “Yes” and described the viewing conditions as well-lit under the street lamps. Ferretti further testified that she observed the shooter for the “entire time that he * * * walked out of his car and shot at the [victim,]” which lasted approximately one minute or', '-4- less. Sheetz, however, was uncertain regarding the length of the incident, but indicated that she observed the shooter for a few minutes.', 'Ferretti and Sheetz both spoke to officers at the scene following the shooting and then were transported to the Providence police station. Approximately one hour after the shooting, Ferretti and Sheetz were driven separately to another location to participate in two discrete show- up identifications. Ferretti recalled that, prior to the show-up, Detective Ronald Riley, Jr. informed her that “[the suspect] was going to come out of the police car that they had put him in, and we were just going to look at him and see if we recognized him.” When they arrived to the show-up location, Ferretti sat in a police vehicle wearing her contact lenses and viewed the suspect, without any problem, from approximately thirty-one feet away.', 'The suspect was removed from a marked police cruiser without handcuffs and under spotlights. Ferretti testified that there were approximately five officers present at the show-up who were either standing near the suspect or sitting inside the six marked police cruisers parked close by. Ferretti identified the suspect as the shooter, had “no doubt” in her identification, and, in particular, recognized the suspect’s dark-colored sweatshirt and his beard, and noted that he had the “same face” as the shooter.', 'During the pretrial hearing, Ferretti identified defendant in the courtroom as the shooter.', 'Prior to the show-up with Sheetz, Detective Robert Melaragno informed her that she would be viewing “a possible suspect” and instructed her “that * * * if [she] knew who he was, to identify him.” While sitting in a police cruiser, Sheetz observed a suspect, well-lit by the cruiser spotlights, from approximately thirty feet away. Sheetz observed two or three officers near the suspect, but she could not recall if there were others in the vicinity. She testified that she “knew it was him when [she] saw him” and that “[h]e was the exact same person as the man', '-5- from the shooting. He was the same height, same build, same outfit, same face.” During the pretrial hearing, Sheetz stated that she had no doubt that it was the same person; however, during the show-up, she had told Det. Melaragno that she was only 90 percent certain. She testified that she had slightly minimized her expression of certainty during the show-up because she “didn’t want to be wrong,” but testified that she “think[s] that [she] was always sure.” On cross- examination, when asked why her disposition changed from uncertain to certain, Sheetz explained that she “had time to think about it.” During the pretrial hearing, however, Sheetz was unable to identify defendant in the courtroom as the shooter.', 'Testimony of Patrolman Matthew McGloin', 'Patrolman Matthew McGloin had been a member of the Providence police department for six years. On the night of the shooting, Officer McGloin heard a radio broadcast regarding a shooting on Huxley Avenue that referenced a license plate that he subsequently determined to be actively registered to defendant. In an effort to locate defendant, he researched defendant’s visitor list from an earlier incarceration, which included defendant’s girlfriend’s Providence address.', 'Officer McGloin and Patrolman Sean Lafferty then proceeded to that address to investigate. Upon arrival, Officer McGloin observed a pickup truck with the engine running parked on the street adjacent to the residence. The officers drove by the pickup truck, shined a spotlight inside, and recognized the driver to be Sterling Washington.2', 'After surveilling the residence, the officers followed as Sterling Washington and an unidentified passenger drove away in the pickup truck. The officers attempted to stop the pickup 2', 'The defendant noted in his brief that the familial relationship between Sterling Washington and defendant is unclear from the record. The state indicated that, following the shooting, Bazquez identified Sterling Washington, through a photo array, as the driver of the SUV. At trial, Basquez testified that he had “picked out the gentleman that [he] argued with [at the scene]” from the photo array.', '-6- truck; the pickup truck slowed down but failed to stop, and the unidentified occupant jumped out and ran. Officer McGloin recognized that person to be defendant. After radioing for backup assistance, Officer McGloin and Officer Lafferty chased defendant on foot. Later testimony at trial revealed that the officers had directed defendant to stop, eventually tackled him, placed him in handcuffs, and took him into custody.', 'Testimony of Detective Ronald Riley, Jr.', 'Detective Ronald Riley, Jr., a member of the Providence police department, had been a detective for seven-and-a-half years. Detective Riley had responded within five minutes of the police radio broadcast reporting the shooting on Huxley Avenue. At the scene, Det. Riley spoke to witnesses Ferretti and Sheetz. After Ferretti and Sheetz had been transported to the police station,3 Det. Riley learned that a suspect had been apprehended. Approximately ninety minutes after the shooting, Det. Riley drove Ferretti to the show-up location. Prior to conducting the show-up, Det. Riley instructed Ferretti that “she was going to be viewing an individual and if she recognized that individual, to tell [him] so.” Detective Riley further testified that, under street lights and alley lights, the suspect was removed from the back of a police cruiser, was standing approximately twenty-five to thirty feet away from Ferretti, was not handcuffed, and was illuminated by cruiser spotlights.', 'Detective Riley noted that Ferretti positively identified the suspect as the shooter. 3', 'Detective Riley testified at trial that, prior to the show-up, Ferretti had provided him with a description of the shooter indicating that he was a “black male, approximately six feet tall, wearing dark clothes, dark hoodie, and a darker-colored beanie * * * [with] not a full beard, but a beard”; however, Ferretti’s description was not recorded until after the show-up procedure had taken place.', '-7-', 'Testimony of Detective Robert Melaragno', 'Detective Robert Melaragno testified that he had been a member of the Providence police department for twenty-one years and a detective for sixteen years. On the evening of the shooting, Det. Melaragno was tasked with transporting Sheetz to the show-up at approximately 2:30 a.m. Prior to the show-up, he instructed Sheetz that “we were going to view an individual, and she was to view [the suspect] and tell [him] if she recognized [the suspect].” When Det. Melaragno arrived with Sheetz to the show-up location, his vehicle’s high beams were trained on the area where the suspect would be presented for identification, approximately twenty to twenty-five feet away. The defendant was removed from the back seat of a police cruiser, without handcuffs, and was surrounded by one or two officers, with other officers in the area. He testified that Sheetz identified the suspect as the shooter and noted that she was 90 percent certain in her identification. After transporting Sheetz back to the police station, Det. Melaragno obtained a recorded statement from her.', 'Trial Justice’s Decision', 'After hearing the testimony of the aforementioned witnesses, the trial justice rendered a decision on defendant’s motion to suppress the identifications made by Ferretti and Sheetz. The trial justice found that the show-up procedures were marred by “some suggestivity[.]”', 'He concluded, however, that the witnesses’ identifications were nonetheless admissible because the suggestiveness of the identifications was “overcome by the reliability and the independent memories of the two witnesses.”', '-8-', '2', 'Admissibility of the Recording of the 911 Call', 'During the same pretrial hearing, defendant also contested the admissibility of a recording of a 911 call purporting to provide the license plate number of the shooter’s vehicle.4 The defendant argued that the 911 call was inadmissible because it did not fall under any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. Specifically, defendant contended that the recording provided no foundation to find that the anonymous caller personally observed the license plate. Ultimately, the trial justice found that the caller “was a percipient witness” to the license plate because he identified the buildings on campus located in the vicinity of the shooting, indicated that he heard gunshots, demonstrated a sense of urgency due to the frightening circumstances. In addition, the trial justice also pointed out that the caller stated “I need you to get here” and the call was received at the time of the shooting. The trial justice determined that no evidence supported defendant’s argument that the caller did not personally observe the license plate. The trial justice found that the caller’s statements about the license plate indicated that he did, in fact, see the license plate. Accordingly, the trial justice found that the 911 call satisfied the requirement for the excited-utterance exception to the hearsay rule and deemed it admissible.', 'C', 'Trial', 'The trial began on December 2, 2015. On December 8, 2015, a jury convicted defendant of four counts: count 1, carrying a firearm without a license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47- 8(a); count 2, assault with a dangerous weapon by discharging a firearm and causing injury to Rudy Basquez in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(2); count 3, possession of a firearm with a previous 4', 'The license plate number provided in the 911 call was in fact not completely accurate in that it was missing one digit.', '-9- federal court conviction in violation of § 11-47-5; and count 4, assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced to a total of sixty years to serve, with twenty years nonparolable. Approximately one week later, defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied. Then, on March 8, 2016, defendant filed a notice of appeal to this Court and argued that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress the show-up identifications and in admitting the anonymous 911 call into evidence.', 'D', 'Remand Hearing', 'Over a year later, on April 18, 2017, according to an affidavit from an assistant public defender, the Public Defender’s office spoke with a Providence College student who identified himself as Chase Rasch. During the phone call, Rasch informed the Public Defender’s office that he had called 911 on the night of the shooting, had not seen the license plate himself, and had spoken with a state prosecutor prior to trial, during the summer of 2015.5 This phone call with Rasch prompted defendant to file in this Court a motion to hold the appeal in abeyance and remand the matter to the Superior Court on April 28, 2017, alleging that the state had committed a Brady violation by not disclosing this pretrial phone call with Rasch.', 'The defendant’s first memorandum in support of his motion to remand alleged that the state failed to disclose material and exculpatory evidence related to the 911 call, in violation of defendant’s right to due process under both the Rhode Island and United States Constitutions. The defendant contended that the state withheld the following information: (1) the state’s phone call with the 911 caller prior to trial; (2) the identity of the 911 caller; (3) Rasch’s interactions with police at the scene, namely that he provided police with his name and contact information; 5', 'It was later revealed that the 911 caller’s name is Stephen Charles Rasch.', '- 10 - and (4) the fact that the state decided not to call Rasch as a witness at trial, list him in discovery, or disclose his identity.', 'Then, in a second memorandum submitted to this Court, defendant indicated that, on May 1, 2017, according to an affidavit from a second assistant public defender, the Public Defender’s office spoke again with Rasch. According to that affidavit, Rasch called to make a correction to his previous statement: he had actually spoken with the prosecutor during the week of Thanksgiving 2015—immediately preceding defendant’s trial—and not during the summer of 2015, as he had previously reported.', 'On May 15, 2017, this Court denied defendant’s motion to hold the appeal in abeyance, but granted his motion to remand and ordered that a hearing on defendant’s Brady-related motion for a new trial take place in the Superior Court within ninety days.', '1', 'Brady Violation', 'On remand, a hearing on defendant’s Brady-related motion for a new trial took place on June 19, 2017, before the same trial justice who presided over defendant’s trial. See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). At the hearing, the following testimony and documentary evidence was presented.', 'Testimony of Special Assistant Attorney General Peter Roklan', 'Special Assistant Attorney General Peter Roklan testified that he had been a special assistant attorney general for more than ten years. He indicated that the recording of the 911 call was requested on November 18, 2015, twelve days prior to the scheduled trial date.', 'He explained that a few weeks prior to trial, Special Assistant Attorney General Joseph McBurney joined the prosecutorial team, noticed that the 911 recording was not in the case file, and ordered', '- 11 - it immediately. Roklan testified that he was not seeking any particular information from the 911 recording, but that “[i]t was just something that [they] realized [they] didn’t have.” He testified that the state received the 911 recording on November 23, 2015, and sent it to defense counsel the following day, November 24, which was two days before the Thanksgiving holiday and one week prior to trial. During the afternoon of November 24, Roklan dialed the 911 caller’s phone number and spoke to someone. Roklan explained that the individual did not provide a name or “anything of substance[,]” and only relayed that “they wanted nothing to do with the case.” He did not recall much of what was said during the seven-minute and forty-two-second phone call, only that he came away unsure as to whether the individual was in fact the 911 caller. Roklan maintained that he did not learn that another person was on the scene with the 911 caller during the phone call, reasoning that, if he had, he would have pursued that person as a potential witness.', 'Roklan testified that he had no explicit recollection of informing defense counsel about the phone call, but noted, “I think we talked about it, but I don’t have a specific memory of ever saying that we actually reached someone.” In addition, he stated that the fact he had reached someone was “not something that we were trying to hide or not tell [defense counsel].” Roklan further noted that the 911 call was not essential evidence to the state’s case because they had still intended to proceed to trial without it.', 'Testimony of Stephen “Chase” Rasch', 'When Rasch testified at the remand hearing, he was a rising senior at Providence College originally from Dallas, Texas.', 'When the shooting occurred, he was a nineteen-year-old freshman. Rasch’s testimony and interviews with police shortly before the remand hearing confirmed that he was indeed the anonymous 911 caller from the night of the shooting and that', '- 12 - he did not see the license plate, but rather was relayed the license plate number by Alberto Batista. He explained that he had been willing to, and did, speak with police at the scene, but was steadfast in his opposition to testifying at trial.', 'A year after the shooting, on November 24, 2015, Rasch had received a phone call from Roklan.', 'At the time, Rasch was on his way to the airport to return to Dallas for the Thanksgiving holiday break from school. He testified that Roklan identified himself when he called and explained that he worked at the Attorney General’s office. Rasch confirmed that he was scared, utterly shocked, nervous, caught off guard, and confused when he answered Roklan’s phone call because he had been under the impression that his 911 call was anonymous. He further testified that he was not cooperative and noted that traveling to the airport was “a stressful time.” Rasch did not recall whether Roklan asked if he was the 911 caller or for his name. Rasch did recall telling Roklan that he was with another individual at the scene of the shooting, but noted that he did not provide Roklan with that individual’s name or any other information about that individual.', 'Rasch testified that he took down Roklan’s name and telephone number and, after the call concluded, immediately texted the information to Batista, the individual present at the scene with him. Rasch consistently maintained that he did not want to testify and was afraid of being a witness at trial. Rasch stated, “I can tell you with certainty, I did not give [Roklan] any of my information or in any way that would cause me to have to be a witness within the trial.”', 'Rasch did not speak with Roklan about the license plate during that phone call because he did not even realize that he had provided a license plate number during his 911 call until Gil Wilson, a Texas-based private investigator hired by defendant’s girlfriend, told him that he had. Rasch had spoken on the phone with Wilson at approximately 9 p.m. on March 17, 2017—St.', '- 13 - Patrick’s Day—while he was with friends.', 'Rasch provided Wilson with the name of the individual who accompanied him at the scene of the shooting, Batista. Then, approximately one week later, Rasch spoke on the phone with Edward Pelletier, a local investigator also contacted by defendant’s girlfriend. Rasch informed Pelletier that, during his 2015 phone call with Roklan, he had declined Roklan’s request to be a witness. He testified that the phone call from Roklan caught him “extremely off-guard,” whereas, by the time he spoke with Pelletier, he was “well accustomed to receiving numerous phone calls on a daily basis” regarding the case and was therefore “more prepared to talk” about the shooting at that point in time.', 'In addition to speaking with Wilson and Pelletier, on April 18, 2017, Rasch spoke on the phone with two attorneys from the Public Defender’s office. On May 1, 2017, Rasch called the Public Defender’s office to provide the text messages that he had sent to Batista immediately following his phone call with Roklan and to correct his previous statement regarding the timing of the phone call with Roklan. He informed the Public Defender’s office that his phone call with Roklan took place before Thanksgiving, the week prior to trial, and not during the summer of 2015, as he had previously stated.', 'On May 1 and 2, 2017, Detective Angelo A’Vant of the Providence police department conducted two in-person, recorded interviews with Rasch.', 'During the interviews, Rasch indicated that he did not disclose Alberto Batista’s name to Roklan, nor did he disclose the fact that it was Batista who saw the license plate, not Rasch.', 'Rasch described himself as “standoffish” during the call with Roklan. He noted that, because he feared that he would have to testify at trial, he made it clear to Roklan that he did not want to be part of the case.', '- 14 -', 'Testimony of Special Assistant Attorney General Joseph McBurney', 'Special Assistant Attorney General Joseph McBurney testified that he became involved in the case on November 16, 2015, approximately two weeks prior to trial. He noted that Rasch had not been included in the state’s case file and was never mentioned in his conversations with the lead detective in the case.', 'In preparation for the pretrial motions, McBurney and Roklan decided that Roklan would handle defendant’s motion to suppress the show-up identifications because Roklan was more knowledgeable about the eyewitnesses; and McBurney would handle defendant’s motion in limine to exclude the 911 call because he was more skilled at legal research in that area. At trial, McBurney conducted the examination of Michael Pickering, the victim’s brother, who had provided police with three potential license plate numbers for the shooter’s vehicle at the scene, and Officer Thomas Richards, who spoke with Pickering at the scene about the license plate numbers. Based on Officer Richards’ police report, McBurney had assumed that Pickering had seen the license plate himself; however, McBurney later learned from defense counsel that Pickering had obtained the possible license plate numbers from other unknown sources at the scene.', 'In regard to Roklan’s pretrial phone call with Rasch, McBurney testified that, although he was unsure when it had occurred, he had “a recollection of telling [defense counsel] that we got an individual who was uncooperative, [and] wouldn’t give a name.” He further recalled that, in response, defense counsel informed him that her investigator encountered the “same problems.” McBurney further added in his testimony that the individual that Roklan spoke with had not indicated whether he was in fact the person who made the 911 call.', 'McBurney also acknowledged that, during the hearing on defendant’s motion in limine to exclude the 911 call,', '- 15 - he did not inform the trial justice that the state had reached someone by dialing the 911 caller’s phone number, but explained that such a disclosure was not warranted because the phone call had revealed only an anonymous person who did not want to provide any information. McBurney noted that, if he had learned the caller’s name and that he was a student at Providence College, he would have sought a subpoena for his testimony.', 'Testimony of Assistant Public Defender Sarah Potter', 'Assistant Public Defender Sarah Potter testified that she had been employed by the Public Defender’s office for eight years and had worked on this case from its inception. On October 29, 2015, Potter learned that Pickering did not personally observe the license plate at the scene, but that he had been relayed the potential license plate numbers from unknown sources at the scene. Potter shared that information with Roklan in a passing conversation in the hallway of the courthouse at some point before the originally-scheduled trial date. She testified that neither Roklan nor McBurney informed her that Roklan had reached someone at the 911 caller’s phone number prior to trial.', 'During the hearing on defendant’s motion in limine regarding the admissibility of the 911 call, Potter informed the trial justice that she and an investigator for the Public Defender’s office had attempted to call the phone number associated with the 911 call, but were unsuccessful in reaching the caller. She had instructed the investigator not to leave a voice mail, so as not to “spook” the caller. It was not until sometime after defendant’s case was on appeal that Potter learned the identity of the 911 caller. Potter also testified that, after the appeal had been docketed, Roklan informed her, in another passing conversation, that Rasch’s father had contacted the Attorney General’s office.', '- 16 -', 'Trial Justice’s Decision', 'In a later written decision, the trial justice fully credited Roklan’s testimony that he did not learn from the pretrial phone call whether Rasch was in fact the 911 caller nor did he learn that another individual accompanied Rasch at the scene. The trial justice did not deem credible Rasch’s testimony. Accordingly, the trial justice determined that the state did not commit a Brady violation, and he denied defendant’s Brady-related motion for a new trial.', '2', 'Recusal Motion', 'Following the hearing on the Brady-related motion for a new trial, but prior to the trial justice’s issuance of his decision, defendant filed a motion requesting the recusal of the trial justice, and a hearing was held before the same justice. The defendant’s recusal request was based on the fact that McBurney had been working on another case with the trial justice’s daughter, a special assistant attorney general, in what was scheduled to be her first jury trial. The defendant deemed this significant because defendant alleged that, in deciding the Brady-related issue, the trial justice was tasked with weighing McBurney’s credibility against Potter’s credibility because McBurney had testified that he told Potter about the state’s pretrial phone call with Rasch, and Potter testified that the state had not.', 'Therefore, defendant argued that McBurney’s professional association with the trial justice’s daughter created an appearance of impropriety even though the case on which they had been working had been resolved on the day of the recusal hearing and prior to the issuance of the trial justice’s decision on defendant’s Brady allegations.', 'In his decision, the trial justice found that defendant failed to identify the correct “credibility contest” at issue in the case. He found that his examination of the testimony at the', '- 17 - remand hearing was not based on a “credibility contest” between McBurney and Potter, but instead rested on his assessment of Rasch’s credibility. He further explained that his evaluation of Rasch’s testimony was determinative because, if Rasch did not relay to Roklan any information that would trigger a Brady violation, then defendant’s motion was meritless. He proffered that, if a credibility comparison was necessary, then that comparison was between Roklan and Rasch, not McBurney and Potter. In addition, the trial justice found that defendant failed to put forth any evidence demonstrating the existence of any judicial bias. The trial justice also questioned the timing of defendant’s motion—filed after the remand hearing—and surmised that defendant was merely judge-shopping. Accordingly, he denied defendant’s recusal motion.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Following the trial justice’s decisions on remand, the case was once again before this Court on appeal. The defendant asserts several arguments on appeal. He maintains that the trial justice erred by: (1) denying his motion to suppress the two show-up identifications; (2) admitting the recording of the 911 call at trial; (3) “failing to implement the letter and spirit of this Court’s remand order”; (4) failing to find that the state had committed a Brady violation; and (5) denying defendant’s motion to recuse.', 'A', 'Show-Up Identifications', 'The defendant contends that the two show-up procedures were impermissibly suggestive. Under our well-established jurisprudence, the inquiry to determine whether an identification procedure, such as a show-up, violated a defendant’s right to due process of law is a two-step analysis. See State v. Texter, 923 A.2d 568, 573 (R.I. 2007).', 'First, the trial justice must', '- 18 - determine whether the show-up was unnecessarily suggestive. Id. at 574. If the trial justice finds that the show-up was unnecessarily suggestive, then he or she must look at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether the identification was nevertheless reliable. Id.', 'The defendant asks this Court to adopt a rule embraced by the Wisconsin Supreme Court requiring suppression of an identification absent a showing of exigency or necessity.6 Specifically, he avers that use of the show-up procedure was unnecessary here because police had probable cause to arrest defendant prior to the show-ups; he points out that “the shooter escaped in a car registered to [defendant,]” defendant was located by the police “nearby” the scene of the shooting, and defendant “tried to evade the police.” In the alternative, defendant asks this Court, under the second step of the analysis, to hold that the factors in Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972), traditionally employed by this Court, fail to accurately assess reliability. 7 See State v. Patel, 949 A.2d 401, 412 (R.I. 2008); see also Biggers, 409 U.S. at 199. In support of his argument, defendant urges this Court to join Massachusetts8 and New York9 in finding “an unduly suggestive procedure [that] results in identification” per se excludable, thereby negating the second step of the analysis. Lastly, defendant argues that, even if this Court continues to 6', 'See State v. Dubose, 699 N.W.2d 582, 596, 599 (Wis. 2005) (holding that evidence obtained from a show-up is not admissible unless the show-up was necessary and that a show-up is not necessary unless (1) the police lacked probable cause to make an arrest or (2) exigent circumstances prevented use of a photo array or lineup). 7', 'The Neil v.

Goulet, 21 A.3d 302, 311 (R.I. 2011)). This independent examination requires this Court to “view the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to the state.” State v. Santos, 64 A.3d 314, 319 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Goulet, 21 A.3d at 311).', '2', 'Analysis', 'In his consideration of the first step of the two-step analysis, the trial justice found that “some” suggestiveness existed in the show-up procedures employed by the police in the present case. The trial justice pointed out that defendant “was brought from a cruiser, spotlighted, there were other officers around[,]” and the witnesses testified that “they assumed that they were going to see a suspect.” As additional evidence of suggestiveness, defendant refers to the Providence police department’s deviation from its own policy governing show-up identifications.10 The Providence police department’s policy instructs that officers conducting show-up identifications 10', 'In 2010, the Rhode Island General Assembly enacted G.L. 1956 § 12-1-16, which created a task force composed of members of the criminal justice community charged with “develop[ing] guidelines for policies, procedures and training with respect to the collection and handling of eyewitness evidence in criminal investigations by law enforcement agencies in Rhode Island.” The Providence police department codified an order that includes several of the task force’s recommendations. General Order 360.08 (2013).', '- 20 - should not display to the witness a suspect detained in a department vehicle. It further directs officers to give the witness four specific instructions before he or she views the suspect.11 Here, defendant was presented to both Ferretti and Sheetz after he was removed from a marked squad car, and neither Ferretti nor Sheetz received explicit instructions pursuant to the department’s policies. Detective Riley instructed Ferretti that “she was going to be viewing an individual and if she recognized that individual, to tell [him] so.” Detective Melaragno instructed Sheetz that “we were going to go, and we were going to view an individual, and she was to view him and tell [Det. Melaragno] if she recognized him.” Although we underscore the importance of the task force’s efforts, recognize the dangers associated with eyewitness identification, and encourage the Providence police department to follow its internal procedures, the department’s departure from those procedures does not require exclusion of evidence at trial under Rhode Island law if the identifications were nonetheless reliable. See State v. Gallop, 89 A.3d 795, 803 n.6 (R.I. 2014) (noting that the failure to follow policies and procedures created pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-1-16 does not necessarily render an identification procedure constitutionally deficient); Patel, 949 A.2d at 412 (holding that independently reliable identifications can be admitted into evidence even if suggestive in nature). 11', 'General Order 360.08, the subject title of which is “Eyewitness Investigation: Photographic Line-Ups, Physical Line-Ups & Show-Ups,” sets forth the following procedure, in pertinent part:', '“Prior to the show-up, Department personnel shall provide', 'the following instructions to the victim/witness and ask the', 'victim/witness if he/she understands same:', '“a.

That the victim/witness should not feel compelled to', 'make an identification; and', '“d. Regardless of whether an identification is made, the', 'investigation will continue.” General Order 360.08 III.A.4.', '- 21 -', 'The trial justice, finding “some suggestivity” in the show-up identification procedures in this case, continued on to the second step of the analysis to determine, based on the Biggers factors, whether the identifications were nonetheless reliable. The Biggers factors include: (1) the witness’s opportunity to observe the suspect at the time of the crime; (2) the witness’s level of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness’s prior description of the suspect; (4) the witness’s certainty in his or her identification at the time of the confrontation; and (5) the amount of time that elapsed between the crime and the identification procedure. Patel, 949 A.2d at 411. Although this Court has traditionally employed the Biggers factors in its analysis, see id., defendant instead encourages this Court to adopt an exigency or necessity requirement that must be met before police can utilize a show-up identification procedure. The defendant also cites to Massachusetts and New York cases to support his argument that Rhode Island should reject the totality-of-the-circumstances approach set forth in Biggers and adopt a rule that an impermissibly suggestive identification is per se excludable.', 'We note, however, that “[t]his Court never has adopted a per se rule of exclusion when police officers have employed a procedure in which they show * * * a single individual to a witness for the purpose of identifying a suspect.” Patel, 949 A.2d at 411. “We have expressly stated that such a per se rule would ‘often frustrate rather than promote justice in situations wherein an identification is reliable despite its unnecessarily suggestive nature.’” Texter, 923 A.2d at 574 (quoting State v. Turner, 561 A.2d 869, 871 (R.I. 1989)). “Moreover, as this Court has previously indicated, the prosecution is not required to demonstrate that exigent circumstances existed which necessitated the use of a show-up procedure rather than another type of procedure.” Id.; see also Patel, 949 A.2d at 411 (concluding that “we never have required the state to show evidence of exigency when [a show-up] procedure is used”). Thus, we', '- 22 - continue to look to the Biggers factors to determine whether the identification was independently reliable.', 'The first factor the trial justice considered was the witnesses’ opportunity to observe the suspect at the time of the crime. The trial justice heard testimony from both Ferretti and Sheetz regarding their opportunity to observe the shooter during the commission of the crime. Ferretti had been sitting in the driver’s seat of Sheetz’s car, with Sheetz in the passenger’s seat, when her attention was drawn to an argument between occupants of two cars. Once the gunshots began, Ferretti recalled that she and Sheetz put their seats back and she could no longer see what was happening outside. Sheetz testified that, despite Ferretti directing her to get down when the gunfire started, she continued to watch and “didn’t get down immediately.” With respect to Ferretti’s testimony that she observed the shooter for one minute, the trial justice concluded that one minute “is a fair amount of time[,]” particularly while both witnesses were staring at the shooter.', 'The trial justice next considered the second factor—the witnesses’ level of attention. He found that each witness’s degree of attention was “quite focused,” as no distractions were present.', 'In regard to the third factor, defendant argues that the accuracy of both witnesses’ descriptions of the suspect was tainted because the only recorded descriptions from the witnesses were taken after the show-up procedure and, therefore, were influenced by the witnesses’ observations of defendant during the show-up. However, we note that, while this testimony was not elicited at the pretrial hearing, Det. Riley, who transported Ferretti to the show-up, testified at trial that, prior to the show-up, Ferretti provided him with a description of the shooter that matched defendant, but the description had not been recorded until after the show-up was', '- 23 - conducted. Detective Melaragno, who transported Sheetz to the show-up, testified that he had not spoken to Sheetz prior to the show-up because, before he had the opportunity to record a formal witness statement, he was notified that a suspect had been detained. He explained that “we wanted to go down and do the show-up prior to spending time doing the witness statement.” The trial justice determined that “the general description[s]” given by Ferretti and Sheetz matched defendant.', 'Fourth, the trial justice analyzed the witnesses’ degree of confidence in their identifications. The trial justice noted that the witnesses’ level of certainty at the time of their identifications differed: Ferretti was undoubtedly certain and Sheetz was only 90 percent certain. The trial justice further noted that Ferretti’s “certainty was demonstrable” and that, over time and with more thought, Sheetz testified at the pretrial hearing that she was certain of her identification. We note, however, that Sheetz’s testimony regarding her increased certainty was elicited before she failed to identify defendant in the courtroom at the pretrial hearing.12', 'Fifth, the trial justice addressed the amount of time that had elapsed between the commission of the crime and the witnesses’ identifications of the suspect. The trial justice found that this factor was not “of any great moment” in this case because the show-up occurred “within an hour or so” of the shooting.', 'After examining each of the five factors, the trial justice found that any suggestiveness surrounding the witnesses’ identifications was “overcome by the reliability and the independent 12', 'This Court is aware of studies that have proffered that a witness’s confidence in his or her identification does not necessarily correlate with its accuracy. The defendant argues that a “witness’s degree of certainty is least useful in determining reliability[,]” whereas the prosecution points out that the research is not conclusive. In the context of this case, even if the trial justice had treated this factor as neutral, it would not have affected his determination that the identifications were reliable in the totality of the circumstances. Suffice it to say that a witness’s degree of certainty in an identification should be weighed with great caution.', '- 24 - memories of the two witnesses.” We conclude that the trial justice, after considering the totality of the circumstances, was not clearly erroneous in his finding that the Biggers factors weighed heavily in the state’s favor, thereby rendering both show-up identifications independently reliable and properly admitted at trial.', 'B', 'Admissibility of the Recording of the 911 Call', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred by allowing a recording of the then- anonymous 911 call to be admitted as evidence at trial. Specifically, defendant argues that the 911 call, which was admitted under the excited-utterance exception to the hearsay rule, lacks any indicators that the caller was a percipient witness to the SUV’s license plate number relayed during the 911 call. On appeal, the state admits that “it appears that defendant’s assessment of the 911 phone call prior to trial was correct: The 911 caller did not personally obtain the license plate number at the scene, but received it from a third-party witness.” Therefore, the state “assumes arguendo that the recording constitutes inadmissible hearsay” and argues that the erroneous admission of the 911 call at trial nevertheless amounted to harmless error because the evidence was cumulative.', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews “a trial justice’s decision regarding the admissibility of evidence pursuant to the excited-utterance exception to the hearsay rule under an abuse of discretion standard.” State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 118 (R.I. 2006). “It is well settled in this jurisdiction that ‘[a]ny decision made by a trial justice concerning the admission of excited utterances shall', '- 25 - not be overturned unless clearly wrong.’” Id. (quoting State v. Krakue, 726 A.2d 458, 462 (R.I. 1999)).', '2', 'Analysis', 'In general, “[h]earsay is ‘a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.’” State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299, 314 (R.I. 2008) (quoting R.I. R. Evid. 801(c)). “Hearsay is not admissible except as provided by law.” Id. The excited-utterance exception provides that “[a] statement that otherwise is hearsay is admissible if it ‘relat[es] to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.’” Id. (quoting R.I. R. Evid. 803(2)). Further, for the excited-utterance exception to apply, “the declarant must have had firsthand knowledge of the event to which the utterance pertains” because “[e]xcitement alone, without the opportunity to observe, cannot meet the essential test of reliability.” State v. Dame, 488 A.2d 418, 425 (R.I. 1985) (quoting In re Kim, 445 A.2d 295, 296, 297 (R.I. 1982) (concluding that in order for hearsay to be admitted under the excited-utterance exception as a reliable piece of evidence, the declarant must have personally made the observation).', 'At the time of the pretrial hearing, the 911 caller was an anonymous person and the trial justice admitted the evidence under the excited-utterance exception to the hearsay rule after listening to the recording and determining that the caller’s statements during that call supported a finding, in his opinion, that the caller had seen the SUV’s license plate. We perceive no abuse of discretion by the trial justice based on the information before him at that time. See Morales, 895 A.2d at 118. However, when the Public Defender’s office spoke on the phone with Rasch one', '- 26 - year after trial, it came to light that Rasch was the anonymous 911 caller and did not personally observe the license plate; rather, the number was relayed to him by a third party. We shall therefore assume, as does the state, that the recording of the 911 call was inadmissible hearsay.', 'Consequently, we must determine whether the admission at trial of the 911 call as evidence of the SUV’s license plate number warrants a new trial or whether it was harmless error. “[T]he admission of hearsay evidence is not prejudicial when the evidence is merely cumulative and when [the] defendant’s guilt is sufficiently established by proper evidence.” State v. Watkins, 92 A.3d 172, 189 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Robinson, 989 A.2d 965, 979 (R.I. 2010)). “‘[C]umulative evidence’ is ‘that which tends to prove the same point to which other evidence has been offered.’” Id. (quoting Robinson, 989 A.2d at 979). “The test to determine whether or not an item of evidence is cumulative ‘is a retrospective one, administered at the close of all the evidence to determine whether the admission of certain evidence was harmless in light of all the evidence admitted on that point.’” Id. (quoting Robinson, 989 A.2d at 979).', 'The defendant argues that the admission of the 911 call was not harmless because it was the strongest evidence of the SUV’s license plate number presented at trial. We disagree. The 911 call provided only additional cumulative evidence of the license plate number. At trial, the following evidence was presented regarding the SUV’s license plate. After the SUV pulled away from the scene, Pickering, the victim’s brother, called 911 and told the operator that the shooter was in a blue Volvo. Pickering also informed Officer Richards, with whom he spoke at the scene, that he had seen a blue Volvo SUV and provided three potential license plate number combinations relayed to Pickering by “a guy that came up to [him] and said that he got the plate * * *.” Officer Richards then called the police dispatcher to determine if any of the three potential license plate numbers were a match for a blue Volvo SUV. The first two plate numbers', '- 27 - did not match Pickering’s description of the vehicle, but the third was a match for a 2006 blue Volvo registered to defendant. The jury, therefore, could follow a trail of evidence that led from the license plate numbers that Pickering relayed to Officer Richards, to Pickering’s description of the shooter’s vehicle, to Ferretti and Sheetz’s testimony that the shooter was an occupant of a blue-green SUV, to a blue 2006 Volvo registered to defendant. The evidence adduced at trial clearly pointed towards defendant, without the assistance of the inaccurate license plate number provided by Rasch’s 911 call.', 'The defendant further contends that the recording of the 911 call “packed an emotional gut punch” at trial that was prejudicial to defendant because “the caller sounded like a distressed college student, terrified by this shooting on his campus.” We note, however, that the 911 evidence was not the only time the jury heard from “terrified” students and eyewitnesses who were present at the scene of the shooting: the victim, his brother, Ferretti, Sheetz, and three students who were freshman at Providence College at the time of the shooting all testified at trial. Each of the student witnesses provided testimony that demonstrated the fear experienced by those who found themselves caught in the midst of the on-campus shooting. Pickering’s testimony, as the victim’s brother, was particularly emotionally charged as he described watching his brother suffer a gunshot wound and explained that he “thought [his] brother was dead.” Therefore, we conclude that the emotional nature of Rasch’s 911 call is cumulative in light of the other emotional testimony adduced at trial.', 'Additionally, defendant contends that the state’s reference to the 911 call in its closing argument further demonstrates the import of the 911 evidence to the state’s case and, thus, its prejudicial effect on defendant at trial. During its closing argument, the state reminded the jury that:', '- 28 -', '“We have that anonymous 911 phone call * * *. You heard that', 'call. And, again, I urge you to listen to it upstairs. You can hear', 'the person’s voice. They’re nervous. They’re distressed. They’re', 'right there at the scene. They tell you which dorms are right there,', 'Guzman and Davis. They’re clearly there. They tell you that they', 'heard the shots and that they have the license plate. You can hear', 'it in the voice, I have the plate, he’s trying to get the plate to the', 'police. And what does he tell the police or what does he tell 911?', '43862. He gives five digits. He doesn’t give a full six digits. He’s', 'missing one. He’s missing that second digit. The defendant’s', 'plate is 483-862. That 911 caller just missed that second digit, that', '8.” Although the state’s reference to the 911 call in its closing argument drew the jury’s attention again to the 911 call, the evidence presented at trial indicated that defendant was identified by two eyewitnesses during show-ups, was located by police less than a mile from the shooting, and fled from police with Sterling Washington—a man identified in a photo array by the victim as the driver of the Volvo SUV in which the shooter escaped.', 'We are convinced that the 911 call was merely cumulative and harmless because defendant’s guilt was sufficiently established by proper evidence. Thus, defendant was not unduly prejudiced by its admission, even if erroneous.', 'C', 'Brady Violation', 'We next consider defendant’s post-judgment Brady-related motion for a new trial that was heard by the trial justice pursuant to this Court’s remand order. The state’s eleventh-hour request for the 911 call, less than two weeks before the trial was scheduled to commence, left both the state and defendant in a difficult position, as they separately attempted to reach the then- anonymous 911 caller days before trial, over the Thanksgiving holiday. The defendant was not successful in reaching the 911 caller and was under the impression that the caller remained', '- 29 - anonymous. Therefore, the only information regarding the 911 caller known to defense counsel prior to trial was that he was a male caller with a Dallas phone number.', 'Over one year after trial, while the appeal of this case was pending before this Court, the Public Defender’s office spoke with Rasch, who indicated that he was the 911 caller and that he had spoken with a state prosecutor during the summer of 2015. Then, three days after defendant filed a motion to remand based on this information, the Public Defender’s office had a second phone call with Rasch during which he corrected his previous timeline of events and indicated that he had spoken with the state prosecutor during his Thanksgiving holiday break from school, which was the week prior to trial. The defendant alleged in his papers in support of his remand motion that “the state deliberately suppressed and misstated the facts * * *.” Ultimately, after the hearing, the trial justice denied defendant’s Brady-related motion for a new trial, finding that the state learned “absolutely nothing of value” during the pretrial phone call with Rasch.', 'On appeal, defendant makes several arguments in support of his allegation that the state’s failure to disclose its pretrial phone call with Rasch violated Brady. He maintains that the trial justice erred by interpreting this Court’s remand order as narrowly directing the Superior Court to review the matter for only a deliberate Brady violation. Moreover, he contends that the trial justice’s finding that the state did not commit a deliberate Brady violation was an error. He avers that, even if the state’s failure to disclose was not deliberate, the pretrial phone call was nonetheless favorable to defendant’s case and material to the determination of his guilt, and the nondisclosure thereof constituted a Brady violation.', '- 30 -', '1', 'Standard of Review', '“When reviewing a trial justice’s decision with respect to whether a violation of Rule 16 or Brady occurred, this Court affords great deference to the trial justice and will not disturb that ruling unless he or she has committed clear error.” State v.

These alleged facts included: the identity of the 911 caller, Rasch’s conversation with police at the scene during which Rasch provided his name and contact information, the pretrial phone call between Rasch and the state, the state’s decision “not to call Mr. Rasch as a witness, list him in discovery, or disclose his identity to the defense[,]” and, in the alternative, the state’s pretrial phone call “to an unknown individual who refused to cooperate.”', 'With respect to whether the state learned the identity of the 911 caller during the pretrial phone call, the trial justice found that it was “inconceivable that Rasch, who so desperately wanted to conceal his identity in order to avoid becoming a witness in the case, would have revealed his name and contact information” to Roklan. He also pointed out that Rasch had testified during the remand hearing that he believed his 911 call was completely anonymous until he received the call from Roklan. In addition, the trial justice took note of Rasch’s testimony that the first time he disclosed his identity as the 911 caller, and named Alberto Batista as the individual who was with him at the scene, was to private investigator Gil Wilson, after defendant had already been convicted. The trial justice noted “Rasch’s numerous credibility failings throughout his testimony[,]” and particularly those in regard to whether he identified himself during the pretrial phone call or whether he informed Roklan about Batista’s presence at the', '- 32 - scene. In contrast, the trial justice fully credited Roklan’s testimony and found that Roklan obtained “absolutely nothing of value” from the call.', 'The trial justice further determined that any new information that defendant discovered after the Public Defender’s office’s phone calls with Rasch “was entirely unknown to the state before trial[.]” We agree that the testimony elicited at the remand hearing illuminated the phone call in a different light than that initially described by defendant in his papers submitted to this Court in support of his motion to remand. The defendant’s preliminary characterization of the state’s pretrial phone call with Rasch was likely a consequence of haste, lack of readily available information, and disconcerting suspicions as to why this phone call was not disclosed.', 'The defendant also contends, in the alternative, that, even if the state did not learn the 911 caller’s identity or other pertinent information from the call, the fact of Rasch’s unwillingness to cooperate with the state’s case was nevertheless favorable information to defendant and this information could have been utilized by defendant at trial to impeach the 911 call evidence. The defendant further avers that, if his defense counsel had known that the state had successfully reached the 911 caller prior to trial, counsel would have further investigated the 911 call and pursued a continuance of the trial date.', 'The trial justice found that “[t]he other evidence produced at [defendant’s] trial was simply too powerful to overcome.” We are also of the opinion that evidence that the 911 caller was unwilling to testify at trial, even if used effectively by defense counsel to attack the anonymous 911 caller’s credibility, would not have made “the difference between conviction and acquittal” in light of the totality of the evidence adduced at trial. Tempest, 141 A.3d at 685. Thus, Rasch’s unwillingness to cooperate with the state is not material to defendant’s guilt or punishment under a Brady analysis. Id. at 683.', '- 33 -', 'Overall, the trial justice noted that, even if the state did fail to disclose the pretrial phone call to defendant, such nondisclosure was not made either “for the purpose of obstruction” or as “evidence which the state could possibly have recognized as ‘high value’ to the defense.” In addition, he indicated that the pretrial phone call was “factually barren, entirely uninformative in every way, and not at all ‘sufficiently central to the criminal case’ to constitute ‘material’ information.” The trial justice found “that there is no way by which this empty phone call would have supported any possibility—much less ‘a reasonable probability’—that the results of this case would have been different * * * or that confidence in the outcome of this case would have been undermined.” In sum, he noted that “the state’s attorneys never concealed anything of material importance from the defendant, either deliberately or, for that matter, inadvertently.”', 'We conclude that the trial justice did not clearly err in determining that the state did not commit a Brady violation. Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s Brady-related motion for a new trial.', 'D', 'Recusal Motion', 'The defendant also contends that the trial justice erred in denying the motion to recuse himself. Specifically, defendant argues that “a reasonable person would question [the trial justice’s] ability to remain impartial” because Special Assistant Attorney General McBurney was set to mentor the trial justice’s daughter, who was also a member of the Attorney General’s office, in connection with an unrelated trial. He argues that this mentorship was particularly troubling because the crux of the Brady-related motion for a new trial was the trial justice’s weighing of McBurney’s credibility against Assistant Public Defender Potter’s credibility. The defendant maintains that this credibility comparison surfaced when McBurney testified that he', '- 34 - told Potter about the state’s pretrial phone call and Potter testified that she did not recall the same.', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'When a party argues on appeal that a trial justice should have recused himself or herself due to bias or prejudice, we must “scrutinize closely whatever is asserted to have disclosed prejudice of a character and in such degree as to work a disqualification.” State v. McWilliams, 47 A.3d 251, 257 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Howard, 23 A.3d 1133, 1135-36 (R.I. 2011)).', '2', 'Analysis', 'We have held that “[t]he party seeking recusal bears the burden of establishing that ‘the judicial officer possesses a personal bias or prejudice by reason of a preconceived or settled opinion of a character calculated to impair his [or her] impartiality seriously and to sway his [or her] judgment.’” Howard, 23 A.3d at 1136 (quoting Mattatall v. State, 947 A.2d 896, 902 (R.I. 2008)). In addition, “justices have an equally great obligation not to disqualify themselves when there is no sound reason to do so.” McWilliams, 47 A.3d at 260 (emphasis in original) (quoting State v. Mlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 999 (R.I. 2011)). “To prevail on a recusal motion based on bias, a party must show that there are facts present such that it would be ‘reasonable for members of the public or a litigant or counsel to question the trial justice’s impartiality.’” In re Jermaine H., 9 A.3d 1227, 1230 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In re Antonio, 612 A.2d 650, 653 (R.I. 1992)).', 'The trial justice concluded that the heart of the Brady-related motion for a new trial was Rasch’s credibility and not “a credibility contest” between McBurney and Potter as defendant had maintained. He determined that his assessment of the Brady motion required an examination', '- 35 - of Rasch’s testimony to determine what information was disclosed to Roklan during the pretrial phone call and whether the state’s failure to disclose that information violated Brady. The trial justice found that defendant failed to meet his “substantial burden” of proving judicial bias, see In re Jermaine H., 9 A.3d at 1230, and noted that a trial justice should not recuse himself or herself unless there is sound reason to do so. See Kelly v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 740 A.2d 1243, 1246 (R.I. 1999). We agree.', 'We are satisfied that the defendant has failed to put forth any facts establishing a personal bias, prejudice due to a preconceived opinion, or any reason for a member of the public to question the trial justice’s impartiality, aside from the defendant pointing out that McBurney and the trial justice’s daughter were both special assistant attorneys general who worked in the Attorney General’s office and had a professional relationship that might have been akin to that of a supervisor-supervisee. See Mlyniec, 15 A.3d at 1000 (“[R]ecusal is not in order by a mere accusation that is totally unsupported by substantial fact.”) (quoting State v. Clark, 423 A.2d 1151, 1158 (R.I. 1980)). It is insufficient for the defendant to merely allege that there was an appearance of impropriety because one of the prosecutors in the defendant’s case had a working relationship with the trial justice’s daughter, without asserting any supporting evidence that would demonstrate judicial bias. Thus, the defendant has failed to meet the “substantial burden” required to prevail on a recusal motion. In re Jermaine H., 9 A.3d at 1230 (quoting In re Shawn B., 864 A.2d 621, 624 (R.I. 2005)).

3,No. 2016-354-Appeal. (15-271-3) In re Madlyn B. : In re Luke B. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. A skeletal survey revealed that Luke, a four- month-old infant, had suffered fourteen fractures, for which there was no obvious explanation. Luke’s mother, Kimberly Warrington (Kimberly or mother), appeals from a Family Court decree declaring that she neglected and abused her two children, Madlyn and Luke.1 For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'The Department of Children, Youth and Families’ Case', 'Because Kimberly’s primary appellate argument challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, we summarize the relevant testimony elicited at trial in some detail.', 'Luke was born on October 22, 2014; Madlyn was almost three years old at the time. Luke and Madlyn were patients at Kingstown Pediatrics, a medical practice that included Michelle McCloskey, M.D. Luke was seen by members of Kingstown Pediatrics on October 28, 1', 'We refer to Ms. Warrington and her children, as well as others involved in the case, by their first names; no disrespect is intended.', '-1- November 4, and November 10, 2014, and each appointment resulted in normal evaluations. At the time of trial, Dr. McCloskey had been in the Kingstown Pediatrics practice for approximately two-and-a-half years. By virtue of her care of Luke and Madlyn, Dr. McCloskey was aware of allegations of domestic violence concerning Kimberly and the children’s father, Andrew (Andrew or father). Doctor McCloskey described Kimberly as “respectful and cooperative” and “a very caring mother.” Between October 2014 and the end of March 2015, Luke was brought to Kingstown Pediatrics for a total of nine visits. On November 21, 2014, Luke was examined by Dr. McCloskey’s colleague for his one-month well-check visit. Luke’s medical records from that visit reflect that Kimberly reported that Luke was “very fussy” and the records denote, under the assessment section, “[f]ussy infant syndrome.” Luke’s fifth doctor’s visit took place on December 12, and Dr. McCloskey later testified that no signs of distress were observed at that time.', 'Kimberly returned to work, after a maternity leave, in late December 2014. Kimberly had been employed at Portsmouth High School in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, for five years as a “special educator,” leading a behavior program for students who are at risk. She had earned a bachelor’s degree in education from Rhode Island College and completed some master’s courses at the University of Rhode Island and Rhode Island College.', 'Kimberly routinely worked Monday through Friday from approximately 7:15 a.m. to 2:15 p.m. and arrived home between 3:15 p.m. and 5:30 p.m. each afternoon. For the previous twelve years, she had also coached softball. During the winter season, in the evenings or on weekends, she gave pitching lessons and conducted clinics; and, in the spring, she coached high school softball. Kimberly indicated that she did not go out at night on a regular basis after Luke was born and that she would drink alcohol “[v]ery rarely.”', '-2-', 'When Kimberly was at work, her mother and father took care of Luke either at Kimberly’s home or at their home. Kimberly’s mother, Joan Warrington (Mrs. Warrington), typically watched Luke from 6:30 a.m. until 3 p.m., unless Kimberly had afternoon meetings, in which case it might be later. Madlyn was in daycare at North Kingstown Daycare. When Kimberly’s parents watched Luke at their home, her father, Lee Warrington (Mr. Warrington), was present and would be left alone with Luke only for short periods of time if Mrs. Warrington had an errand to run. Kimberly noted that two exceptions to this schedule were the last week of December, for Christmas break, and February vacation week, February 16 to 20, 2015, when Kimberly stayed with Luke because she was home from work. Kimberly was also off from work on Martin Luther King Day and January 26, when Madlyn was home sick.', 'Kimberly was dating a man named Mike Buffrey between January and March 2015, but she testified that it was not serious and that he would not stay at her house.2 One time, Buffrey watched Luke for approximately thirty minutes while Kimberly ran an errand; when she returned home, Luke “appeared fine,” as he remained sleeping in his car seat. When Kimberly coached softball, which would last approximately one hour, she would sometimes bring Madlyn and Luke with her, and Julie Culhane, her friend and neighbor, would watch the children while she coached. Kimberly also testified that, during February vacation, “maybe somebody from the YMCA” watched Luke, but she noted that she could not recall.3 In addition, Kimberly’s sister, Kathryn Warrington, babysat Luke and Madlyn one night when Kimberly attended a birthday 2', 'As part of the presentation of Kimberly’s case, as respondent, she testified and indicated that she and Luke and Madlyn may have slept at Mike Buffrey’s house once because it was late, but she noted that she could not recall for sure. 3', 'Joshua Cottle, a child protective investigator for the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF), testified that he did not interview any individuals at the YMCA daycare program because he was not informed that Luke ever attended daycare at the YMCA. He was told that Mrs. Warrington watched Luke while Kimberly was at work and that Madlyn attended daycare.', '-3- party. During her testimony, when Kimberly was asked if she was Luke’s primary caregiver, she responded in the affirmative and stated “I am his mom.” She also indicated that, in addition to Mrs. Warrington, Andrew, Andrew’s mother and her partner, and Andrew’s sister would also care for Luke.', 'On December 22, 2014, Dr. McCloskey examined Luke for his two-month well-check visit. It was then that Kimberly first noticed a mark on Luke. At that time, she did not know it was a bruise, describing it as a “discoloration,” and pointed it out to Dr. McCloskey. Kimberly recalled that Dr. McCloskey was not sure what the mark was, but that the doctor conjectured that it was some discoloration or possibly the “start of a birthmark.” Then, on January 30, 2015, Luke was brought to the Kingstown Pediatrics due to a cough, and was diagnosed with bronchiolitis and wheezing and prescribed treatment with a nebulizer. Kimberly again pointed out the same bruise to a nurse practitioner because it was still “yellowing.” Kimberly testified that the nurse was similarly unsure as to what the mark was and told her “to just keep an eye on it.”', 'Kimberly testified that, in mid-February, she called Kingstown Pediatrics to ask if she could give Luke rice cereal because she thought that he wanted to eat more. She was told to wait until the four-month well-check visit so that the doctor could examine Luke and make a determination at that time. On February 27, 2015, Dr. McCloskey examined Luke for his four- month well-check visit; and Kimberly, Mrs. Warrington, and Madlyn were present. During the visit, Kimberly alerted Dr. McCloskey to two bruises that she had recently noticed: one on Luke’s right buttock and one on his chest. When Dr. McCloskey examined Luke’s buttock, his skin appeared “normal”; and the mark on his chest was “a very small fading yellow discoloration that looked at the end of a bruising process.” Doctor McCloskey informed Kimberly that,', '-4- because the bruise was barely noticeable, “[she] didn’t know for sure if it was a resolving bruise at the very end of the healing process or another different type of skin lesion.” According to Dr. McCloskey, Kimberly told her that “[s]he thought that [the bruises] could have been due to the car seat straps being too tight.” Doctor McCloskey testified, however, that she had never seen an infant of four months suffer bruising from car seat straps. Doctor McCloskey further testified that, during that visit, she did not observe any other bruising or concerning marks on Luke’s skin. Kimberly testified that Luke had “a little mark on his bottom” and “tiny little marks on his side[,]” but she explained that she did not bring them to anyone’s attention because “it didn’t seem like anyone was overly concerned and he never was in any apparent distress, and so [she] thought [Luke] bruise[d] easily * * *.”', 'Doctor McCloskey was concerned at that four-month visit because Luke’s weight had decreased to “just above” the tenth percentile, down from the fiftieth percentile at his two-month well-check visit. Doctor McCloskey testified that a drop in percentile is not uncommon, but she noted that it is cause for concern when an infant’s growth “decreased by two large standard[-]deviation percentile points[.]” During that visit, Dr. McCloskey discussed Luke’s eating and drinking with Kimberly and recommended that she increase his intake.', 'She characterized Kimberly’s response to that conversation as “[a]ppropriate.”', 'Ultimately, Dr. McCloskey recommended that Luke have bloodwork done because his bruising was abnormal and unexplained. Mrs. Warrington testified that the bloodwork was requested to determine the cause of Luke’s bruising, and recalled that a possible explanation for his bruising was low iron levels. Mrs. Warrington further recalled that Dr. McCloskey did not seem concerned about Luke’s bruises. Doctor McCloskey testified that Kimberly “seemed open to taking him [to get bloodwork done] and told [Dr. McCloskey] that she would take him the', '-5- next day.” Doctor McCloskey also advised Kimberly to call the office if she noticed any new bruising on Luke.', 'On Monday, March 2, 2015, Kimberly called Kingstown Pediatrics and informed an office secretary that Mrs. Warrington, who had been babysitting Luke, noticed a thumb-sized bruise on Luke’s chest. Mrs. Warrington testified that the bruises were not there on Friday, but appeared on Monday and were “blackish/grayish” in color. According to Dr. McCloskey, she received the message that Kimberly had called, and she returned Kimberly’s call and left a voice mail indicating her concern regarding the new bruise and asked Kimberly to bring Luke for the bloodwork and back to her office for an examination. Doctor McCloskey testified that Kimberly did not return her phone call that day, nor on the following day, so she called Kimberly again and left a message repeating her concerns and requests that the bloodwork be completed. By the next day, Dr. McCloskey still had not received a return call from Kimberly.', 'On Thursday, March 5, 2015, Dr. McCloskey again called Kimberly, and Kimberly answered. Doctor McCloskey testified that in her practice she had never had to call a parent three times without receiving a response. Doctor McCloskey relayed her concerns about Luke and her requests for bloodwork and to examine Luke.', 'When Dr. McCloskey mentioned Kimberly’s lack of response to her phone calls, she testified that Kimberly replied, “Well, I am a busy woman.” Doctor McCloskey explained that at that point in time “[she] was very concerned about Luke and [that she] was further concerned that it didn’t seem like mom was too concerned.” That same day, Kimberly had the bloodwork completed and brought Luke to Kingstown Pediatrics for an examination. Kimberly testified that she never received any voice', '-6- mails from Dr. McCloskey and noted that it was her understanding that she had two weeks to obtain the bloodwork.4', 'Kimberly also did not recall Dr. McCloskey ever expressing any concern over Luke’s bruising. Instead, she remembered Dr. McCloskey indicating that “[i]t could be something from like vitamins so let’s just check it out first.” She only recalled Dr. McCloskey telling her that “[e]verything looks really great but I am concerned about the weight[.]” Mrs. Warrington similarly recalled that Dr. McCloskey did not indicate that the bloodwork was urgent. She explained that, if Dr. McCloskey had expressed urgency, she would have taken Luke to undergo bloodwork because Kimberly had a work commitment.', 'When Dr. McCloskey examined Luke on March 5, 2015, she found three new bruises, yellow-green in color, “one on each side of his upper chest and one on his abdomen.” Upon observing this bruising, Dr. McCloskey recommended that Luke be taken to Hasbro Children’s Hospital. According to Dr. McCloskey, Kimberly initially asked if the hospital visit could be postponed until the results of the bloodwork were obtained. Doctor McCloskey testified that she was “too concerned” because “this [was] not normal for his age and he need[ed] to go to the children’s hospital right now.” Doctor McCloskey testified that Kimberly was worried about driving to the hospital because of the snowy road conditions. Therefore, Dr. McCloskey called an ambulance for Kimberly and Luke “[b]ecause [she] felt very strongly that he needed to go to the hospital for further examination.” Doctor McCloskey also examined Madlyn and found no markings. After Kimberly and Luke left in the ambulance for the hospital, Dr. McCloskey called the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) twenty-four-hour hot line and reported 4', 'Kimberly disputed at trial that Dr. McCloskey called her three times. She submitted her phone records indicating that she called Kingstown Pediatrics on March 2, 2015, and did not receive a return call until March 5, 2015.', '-7- that Luke had unexplained bruising. Overall, Dr. McCloskey affirmed that during all her visits with Luke, Kimberly was cooperative and that Luke appeared to be a “happy baby” who showed no signs of distress.', 'Luke was admitted through the emergency department at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, where he was seen by Dana Kaplan, M.D., a fellow in child-abuse pediatrics. Doctor Kaplan interviewed Kimberly as part of her standard procedure, but she noted that it was difficult to extract information from Kimberly regarding the chronological history of Luke’s bruises because of her “emotional state.” She described Kimberly as “emotionally labile” because “at one moment she was crying, visibly anxious, shaking and at another moment she would be calm and collected and be able to answer a question.” She further testified that “[Kimberly] was tangential at times which mean[t] [the doctor] would ask her a question and she would go off in a different direction and [the doctor] would [frequently] have to redirect her.” Kimberly informed Dr. Kaplan that Luke had bruising within the past few days and that she had brought Luke to the pediatrician. Then, Kimberly corrected her statement and noted that the bruises were noticed approximately six to eight weeks ago. Doctor Kaplan observed bruises on Luke’s right chest, his left rib cage, and his abdomen. During Dr. Kaplan’s physical examination of Luke, she noticed a bump on Luke’s upper left extremity “that shouldn’t have been there[.]” She ordered a skeletal x-ray to gather more information. Kimberly and Luke stayed in the hospital overnight awaiting the skeletal survey, which was set to take place the following day.', 'Doctor Kaplan recalled during her testimony that she was concerned about Luke based on Kimberly’s statement that she had noticed the bruises six to eight weeks prior. Doctor Kaplan testified that bruises do not take six to eight weeks to heal. Additionally, Dr. Kaplan was concerned because, in reviewing Luke’s medical records for his pediatrician visit on February', '-8- 27, 2015, there was no record of an abdominal bruise; yet, on March 5, he presented with the new abdominal bruise. Kimberly informed Dr. Kaplan that she did not know how the bruising occurred, but after being questioned further, Kimberly posited that because of the location of the bruises, the bruising could have been caused by the car seat straps. Doctor Kaplan investigated the car seat theory by placing Luke in the car seat, but she determined that a car seat buckle would not create “enough of a force * * * to cause bruising in an infant.”', 'According to Dr. Kaplan, Kimberly explained that she “was very overwhelmed,” “[t]here was a lot of stress going on in her life,” and she and her husband were undergoing a divorce that included “a significant custody battle[.]” Kimberly further explained to Dr. Kaplan that “she felt overwhelmed with both kids and with having to go back to work.” Kimberly also indicated that she was the primary caregiver and, in addition, noted that her mother also took care of the children. Kimberly further reported that Luke had short visits with his father in January and March.', 'At the conclusion of the interview, Kimberly asked Dr. Kaplan, “Am I reacting normal to this?” Doctor Kaplan testified that she did not know how to respond to Kimberly’s question. Doctor Kaplan “found it concerning that [Kimberly’s] question was not about [Luke’s] welfare[,] but [instead] about how she was acting and [Dr. Kaplan’s] perception of her.” Doctor Kaplan concluded that Kimberly should participate in an inpatient psychiatric-hospital program, which is “an intensive program for women specifically who are postpartum [and] having issues with depression and anxiety.”', 'Joshua Cottle, a DCYF child protective investigator (CPI), also interviewed Kimberly, Mr. and Mrs. Warrington, Andrew’s mother and her partner, and Andrew’s sister; he also examined Luke and visually assessed Madlyn at the hospital. Kimberly indicated to Cottle that', '-9- Luke’s bruising could have been caused by the car seat or could have occurred when Luke was picked up. Kimberly described Luke as “a very easy baby to care for, that he consistently [went] to bed on a schedule and that he [ate] consistently on a schedule as well.” She did not indicate that Luke was ever fussy or in pain. Kimberly denied abusing Luke. On March 7, 2015, Cottle also met with Andrew.', 'According to Dr. Kaplan, the results of the skeletal survey showed that Luke had suffered eleven rib fractures, a fracture in his left arm of the radius and the ulna, and a “classic metaphyseal lesion of the right lower extremity.” Three of his rib fractures were close to the spine, and the other rib fractures were either on his side or near the front of his rib cage. Doctor Kaplan testified that bruising is “generally apart from the fractures * * * for a variety of reasons.” In addition, she noted that bruising in a four-month-old infant is “incredibly” unusual because a baby does not “move enough to cause an injury[.]” Doctor Kaplan opined that Luke’s rib fractures may have occurred by compression when Luke was being held.', 'She further concluded that Luke’s fractures “occurred outside the realm of normal caretaking.”', 'According to Dr. Kaplan, the fracture on Luke’s lower extremity was located where his leg met his foot and appeared to be a chipped bone. Doctor Kaplan called that type of injury a “metaphyseal lesion.” Doctor Kaplan explained that there are two mechanisms that can cause “classic metaphyseal lesions.” The first is caused by “a very forceful pulling, twisting or wrenching of the extremity.” The second is called “sheer injury” that occurs when “a baby and the[ir] legs [are] dangling and they are moving back and forth and the two parts of the bone are rubbing against each other,” causing microfractures at the end of the bone. Doctor Kaplan next described the two fractures in Luke’s left forearm.', 'She characterized them as “oblique fractures,” which occur “when there is * * * a force going straight up and down but also a bone', '- 10 - in motion so there is some motion to the bone to cause that particular type of fracture, not a full[-]on twist but some motion of the bone.”', 'In examining the x-rays, Dr. Kaplan concluded that Luke’s fractures were healing and she estimated that they were more than ten days old. She further testified that the fractures “probably” occurred within the past two months, but she noted that she could not provide an exact time frame. She further indicated that an estimation that they occurred in the past three months, on the other hand, “would seem a bit on the longer side.” When asked if she could “say with a reasonable degree of medical certainty whether all fourteen fractures occurred at the same time[,]” Dr. Kaplan replied that she “couldn’t say that they all occurred at the same time.” She explained that, approximately two weeks following the fractures, a callus, or new bone, would have started to form and would have begun to stabilize the fractures. She noted that, during the two weeks following the fractures and before the callus formed, Luke would have experienced significant pain and the injuries would have been swollen. Doctor Kaplan further explained that, during the two-week window, “significant” pain should have been apparent when placing Luke in a Onesie, for example, because his fractures were not stabilized.5 She postulated that “every time the baby were to breathe, it may have been painful because [he would have been] pressing against those fractures and causing pressure[.]” Doctor Kaplan opined that a caretaker who lived with the child should have noticed that Luke was in pain during that two-week healing period.', 'Doctor Kaplan noted that the results of the bloodwork ordered by Dr. McCloskey were normal and only indicated that Luke had a “slightly low” vitamin D level. She explained that babies who are deficient in vitamin D can show signs of bones that are not mineralized; however, she determined that Luke’s bones were “normally mineralized” and, thus, concluded that his 5', 'A “Onesie” is “[a] trademark for a one-piece article of clothing for infants * * *.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1232 (5th ed. 2011).', '- 11 - vitamin D deficiency would not have caused the fourteen fractures. Luke’s other markers for bone mineralization, liver function, and noncontrast head CT were all normal. In addition, he was tested by a geneticist for osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare metabolic bone condition, and for rickets, both of which were negative. Doctor Kaplan testified that, in her opinion and to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the cause of Luke’s injuries was abuse.', 'Doctor Kaplan surmised that none of the fractures could have occurred during the most recent visit with Andrew, on March 1, 2015, because that date was only about six days prior to the hospital visit, and Luke’s x-rays showed a “pretty significant callus.” She estimated that Luke’s injuries occurred at least ten days prior to the x-rays.', 'In regard to Andrew’s contact with the children, he had visited Luke in the hospital when he was born. In addition, he had two visits with Luke prior to a two-hour visit on December 28, 2014. In her text exchanges with Andrew to arrange the visits, Kimberly tried “not to engage in any argumentative type of behaviors.”', 'Kimberly “felt safest with supervision” during the children’s visits with their father because of the couple’s history of domestic violence. A subsequent visit with Andrew took place on January 18, 2015. Andrew testified that the visit was supervised at all times from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. The next visit lasted two hours and took place on March 1, 2015, from 9 to 11 a.m. Andrew testified that there was a long gap between visits with Luke because one of the visits was only with Madlyn, and the next three proposed visits were snowy days, on two of which, Andrew agreed, the conditions made it too dangerous to drive.', 'Madlyn had more frequent and longer visits with her father than did Luke. Kimberly testified that, if Luke did not accompany Madlyn on visits with their father, it was because Andrew had not requested to see Luke. However, Andrew testified that he asked to see Luke', '- 12 - every time he saw Madlyn. Andrew noted that Kimberly had custody of Madlyn, but that they had yet to return to the Family Court to set visitation for Luke because he had not been born at the time of the last court date. Andrew’s mother testified that she never observed Luke in distress, even when Andrew changed his diapers or dressed him.', 'At the hospital, on March 6, 2015, Dr. Kaplan and the medical team, including CPI Cottle, informed Kimberly about Luke’s fractures and notified her that Luke and Madlyn would be placed in DCYF custody for a seventy-two-hour hold because Cottle made a finding of physical abuse. Kimberly began to cry and stated to Dr. Kaplan, “I should have never told you all those things I told you before.” Doctor Kaplan testified that Kimberly’s statement “struck [her]” because “[w]e had just told her that her son had been badly injured, a lot of fractures and bruises, and it concerned me that again her focus was that she shouldn’t have told me what her mental status was and what her feelings were and her anxiety, and that that became the focus, less so her son’s health.” Cottle testified that Kimberly “plainly stated that these injuries did not occur at her home and that the injuries must have occurred while on a visitation with Luke’s father.” Kimberly denied causing the fractures to Luke and testified that she did not know who caused them. Two weeks later, Dr. Kaplan conducted a follow-up examination and noted that Luke did not have any new bruises and that a new skeletal x-ray showed no new injuries.', 'B', 'Kimberly’s Motion to Dismiss', 'After DCYF rested its case, Kimberly moved to dismiss DCYF’s abuse and neglect petition, contending that DCYF had failed to prove its case by clear and convincing evidence. DCYF and the Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) both objected to Kimberly’s motion to dismiss. Kimberly argued that DCYF lacked probable cause to support its petition, and she', '- 13 - pointed to the fact that the police had failed to arrest Kimberly. However, CASA noted that Kimberly’s attorney had waived a probable-cause hearing in the Family Court.', 'Kimberly specifically contended that DCYF failed to demonstrate through testimony that she was a “bad” mother, citing to Dr. McCloskey’s testimony and the fact that Kimberly “showed up to all the appointments * * *. She took care of her children. They were clothed properly. They were bathed properly.” Kimberly further argued that DCYF failed to show that she was overwhelmed by her situation or that she was a drinker or attended a lot of parties. In addition, she contended that DCYF failed to prove that Luke had ever shown any signs of distress. Kimberly analogized the present case to In re Adner G., 925 A.2d 951 (R.I. 2007), and argued that here, as in In re Adner G., DCYF failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that no one other than Kimberly had significant access to Luke. See In re Adner G., 925 A.2d at 957.', 'In rendering his decision on Kimberly’s motion to dismiss, the trial justice indicated that DCYF had to prove its allegations by clear and convincing evidence. He took note of the vehement and unequivocal statements by Kimberly and Mrs. Warrington denying that they had inflicted injury upon Luke.', 'He found that Kimberly and Mrs. Warrington were the main caregivers for Luke.', 'He further noted that the testimony was clear that Andrew had no unsupervised contact with Luke, and he credited paternal grandmother’s testimony to that end. The trial justice found both Dr. McCloskey and Dr. Kaplan “very credible, particularly Dr. Kaplan.” The trial justice acknowledged Dr. McCloskey’s testimony that it was unusual for a four-month-old to have bruising and her concerns that Kimberly had not been responsive to her requests to obtain Luke’s bloodwork. He noted Dr. Kaplan’s testimony that the fractures, when they had occurred, would have caused Luke distress and substantial pain during any movement of the broken bones, and particularly when he was being bathed or clothed. The trial justice', '- 14 - acknowledged Dr. Kaplan’s testimony that the fractures were “between two months of age and ten days before the examination in March of 2015[.]” He also took note of Dr. Kaplan’s description of Kimberly’s reaction when she was informed that her son had suffered fourteen fractures. The trial justice further noted Dr. Kaplan’s conclusion that Kimberly was “labile,” inappropriate, and showed a lack of concern for Luke. In addition, he noted Dr. Kaplan’s testimony that the fractures were nonaccidental.', 'Overall, the trial justice characterized the case as circumstantial and, thus, one that required reasonable inferences based on the evidence presented. Because the trial justice found that Kimberly was the primary caregiver, even though other individuals were involved in Luke’s caretaking, he concluded by clear and convincing evidence that the cause of Luke’s injuries was “likely the mother and that she either knew who caused them or caused them herself[.]” Thus, he found that DCYF had indeed met its burden of proof at that stage of the proceedings, and Kimberly’s motion to dismiss was denied.', 'C', 'Kimberly’s Defense', 'Kimberly called a number of witnesses to testify, some for the second time, as part of her defense, including her sister Kathryn and Mr. and Mrs. Warrington.', 'Kathryn testified that she had been living with Kimberly and the children. She described Kimberly as a consistently “very caring person” who “always wanted to be a teacher[.]” She noted that her sister regularly had a job and that she traveled, attended college, double-majored, and always continued to play softball. Kathryn coached with her sister and described Kimberly as “great with the team[.]” She described Kimberly’s marriage as “rocky at best,” but she noted that otherwise things were normal and Kimberly was a “happy mom,” particularly after Andrew', '- 15 - moved out. Kimberly had called Kathryn from Hasbro Children’s Hospital after she learned of Luke’s injuries. Kathryn described Kimberly as “emotionally flooded” during that phone call and speculated that was because “[Kimberly] was being asked question after question after question after question * * * [and she] hadn’t eaten in hours.” Kathryn testified that the next day, when she picked Kimberly up at the hospital, “[Kimberly] was crying and crying and crying and crying.”', 'Mr. Warrington also testified for the defense. He described Kimberly as “[a] good student [and] good child.” He noted that Kimberly was “unhappy at times when she was going through the difficulties with the ex-husband * * *.” He explained that she was “a good mother, normal mother, very loving * * *.” He noted that he thought Kimberly was handling the stress of her divorce with her two young children “very well.” He indicated that he was angry when he learned that Luke had been injured because “somebody did that to [his] grandson or it happened to [his] grandson * * *.” When asked who he was angry with, he responded “[h]ow it happened, who did it, whatever, however it happened.”', 'Mrs. Warrington also testified for a second time. She described Kimberly as a “good little girl” with a “normal childhood.” She testified that she observed Kimberly undergo two normal pregnancies with Madlyn and Luke, and that, after Luke was born, Kimberly was “a mother that was very happy” who “love[d] her children.” Mrs. Warrington described Andrew as “very violent[.]” Mrs. Warrington also indicated that Andrew and Kimberly “could not get along.” She testified that “[she] know[s] what kind of person [her] daughter is and [she] know[s] she would never hurt her children.” Mrs. Warrington described Luke as “a very, very good baby” and expressed “[t]hat’s why I can’t believe any of this is going on. He was incredibly good.” She indicated that the only time Luke was cranky was when he had a bad cold and cough', '- 16 - and “was on a nebulizer.” She further testified that she had “no idea” what happened to Luke and stated “[t]hat’s what we’re all trying to figure out.” She denied causing Luke’s injuries.', 'Brian Hayden, Ph.D., an adjunct professor of psychology at Brown University with a Ph.D. in clinical psychology, also testified during Kimberly’s defense. He was contacted by DCYF to conduct an evaluation of Luke’s family and had informed Kimberly that he would be reporting back to DCYF. As part of his evaluation, Dr. Hayden met with Kimberly and observed her with her children. In addition, he spoke with Dr. Kaplan. During their first session, on May 2, 2015, Dr. Hayden interviewed Kimberly and administered a series of psychological tests for over three hours.', 'Doctor Hayden first obtained background information from Kimberly. Subsequently, he administered a Rorschach inkblot test in person, and then Kimberly filled out the remainder of the test forms. He explained that the “confluence” of the tests and the interview “make[] [his] interpretation [of the findings] more valid[.]” Kimberly left after she filled out the psychological forms, and then Dr. Hayden evaluated her responses.', 'Out of respect for Kimberly’s privacy, we shall not explicate the results of Dr. Hayden’s testing and evaluations. Suffice it to say that the personality tests did not indicate impulsivity or a personality disorder, and Dr. Hayden found Kimberly to be “quite open, genuinely concerned about her children, genuinely confused about what had happened to her child and wanting to know answers[.]”', 'On May 26, 2015, Dr. Hayden conducted an observation of Kimberly with her two children at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Warrington. Doctor Hayden characterized Kimberly’s behavior towards Madlyn during the observation as “perfectly appropriate” and “very loving.” He noted some initial wariness by Madlyn when Kimberly first arrived. He indicated that the wariness lasted “a little bit longer than one would have expected[,]” but he attributed it to', '- 17 - Madlyn’s likely lack of understanding as to why she was removed from her mother’s care. He further observed that Luke appeared “perfectly comfortable” with his mother. He concluded that he witnessed “nothing that would suggest that [Kimberly] would have been abusive towards either of her children.” He further noted that, after speaking with Dr. Kaplan regarding the “tremendous distress” that the fractures would have caused Luke, “it just didn’t add up.” He recommended to DCYF that they continue the children’s contact with Kimberly, but have it restricted and supervised because he “couldn’t just arbitrarily undo [the DCYF plan].”', 'Doctor Hayden separately administered the same tests to Andrew, and he also interviewed him and observed him with the children. He conducted a more extensive and detailed aggression questionnaire due to his knowledge of the history of domestic abuse between Andrew and Kimberly. Doctor Hayden concluded that “father has more of an anger issue than mother[.]” Andrew indicated to Dr. Hayden that he wanted to know who injured Luke. During Dr. Hayden’s observations of Andrew with the children, the interactions were “mutually constructive, calm, and evidence[d] emotional warmth and bonding.”', 'Doctor Hayden recommended to DCYF that Andrew continue to receive supervised visits during the abuse investigation period. He also recommended that the length of those visits be extended by one hour to foster Andrew’s bonding with Luke, and that Andrew complete an anger-management class.', 'Kimberly also presented several witnesses who had known her from two years to over twenty years, either as a friend or as a softball coach. They all testified that she had a reputation in the community for truthfulness. Julie Culhane, one of the witnesses, also testified that, when her children attended softball pitching lessons with Kimberly, which could range from one to', '- 18 - three times per week, she would watch Madlyn and Luke. She noted that she would occasionally be alone with the children in a hallway or at a field.', 'Additionally, Kimberly testified for a second time and provided a more detailed description of her time with her children. She described that time as “awesome,” and she said that her children were “just fantastic.” She provided testimony that further elaborated on her prior testimony regarding Dr. McCloskey’s allegedly unreturned phone calls. Over CASA’s and DCYF’s objection, the trial justice admitted, as a full exhibit, Kimberly’s phone records. The phone records indicated and Kimberly testified that she had called Kingstown Pediatrics on Monday, March 2, to report the new bruises and did not receive a return call until Thursday, March 5, at 11:30 a.m., contrary to Dr. McCloskey’s testimony that she called Kimberly three times that week without receiving a response.', 'Kimberly also testified that she had placed a call to DCYF on March 2, 2015, the day following Luke’s visit with Andrew. She left a message indicating that she had concerns about her children and asked DCYF to return her call. She was worried because Luke had “additional marks on him” and “Madlyn came back from [the] visit with an entirely different change of clothes without real reason” and she thought Madlyn was “exhibiting some odd behaviors.”6 She testified that DCYF did not return her call.', 'Kimberly clarified that Luke had most recently visited with Andrew on January 18 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and March 1 from 9 to 11 a.m. Kimberly further noted that the children did not 6', 'Doctor McCloskey noted in Madlyn’s medical records, on the same day that Luke was sent to Hasbro Children’s Hospital, that Kimberly told her that, when Madlyn returned from her visit with Andrew on March 1, 2015, she had exhibited “strange” behavior, such as “trying to kiss and touch mom’s and maternal aunt’s private area[s].” Doctor McCloskey further noted that Madlyn’s exam was normal, but she indicated, however, that Madlyn’s behavior, as described by Kimberly, was “unusual and concerning.” She further indicated that in addition to notifying DCYF about Luke’s bruising, she also notified DCYF about Madlyn’s behavior.', '- 19 - sleep at Andrew’s home during those visits. After Kimberly and Mrs. Warrington picked Luke up on March 1, Kimberly readied him for bed, fed him, changed his diaper, and fed him the next morning. Then, later that morning, Mrs. Warrington noticed new bruises on Luke and contacted Kimberly. Kimberly then called Kingstown Pediatrics.', 'Doctor McCloskey testified on May 24, 2016, that Luke was still her patient and that she had not noticed any new bruising since he was removed from Kimberly’s care. In addition, she testified that “[Luke had] made steady inclines back to the [fiftieth] percentile” and “[h]e’s doing great. He’s growing. His most recent weight was between the [fiftieth] to [seventy-fifth] percentile.”', 'On June 21, 2016, the trial justice issued his decision. He concluded that Kimberly “inflicted or allowed to be inflicted upon these children physical abuse; that both children [were to be] committed to the care, custody and control of the director of DCYF until further order of the court[.]” Kimberly timely filed a notice of appeal on July 7, 2016.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Rule 17(b) of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings sets forth the standard under which abuse determinations are to be made[,]” providing that a “[d]etermination that a child is abused, neglected, or dependent shall be made upon clear and convincing evidence.” In re Adner G., 925 A.2d 951, 957 (R.I. 2007) (quoting R. Juv. P. 17(b)). “[T]he clear and convincing standard requires that the fact-finder form a ‘clear conviction without hesitancy of the truth of the precise facts in issue.’” Id. (quoting Parker v.

Specifically, Kimberly argues that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence—namely Dr. Hayden’s testimony, evidence that Kimberly “acted responsibly in caring for her children,” and Kimberly’s phone records.', 'We note, however, that the trial justice thoroughly and methodically examined each of the witnesses’ testimony, including the separate testimony of those witnesses who testified for both DCYF and Kimberly.', 'The trial justice considered Dr. Hayden’s testimony and indicated that he was “a strong witness” for Kimberly, particularly in his finding that Kimberly did not possess the type of personality that would cause her to injure Luke.', 'Furthermore, he credited Dr. Hayden’s acknowledgment of the limitations of his psychological testing. Thus, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not overlook Dr. Hayden’s testimony.', 'Moreover, the trial justice did not overlook testimony that Kimberly was responsible in caring for her children. Rather, he carefully reviewed the positive testimony by family, friends, and community members that was presented on behalf of Kimberly and noted that the witnesses consistently remarked that she was “an excellent mother” and had “good character” and a “loving nature towards her children.” In addition, the trial justice described Kimberly as lighting up when she spoke about her children in her testimony, and he added that “[s]he showed without question that she clearly loves these children.”', 'We further note that, although the trial justice acknowledged the “confusion” regarding phone calls to and from Dr. McCloskey in March 2015, he did not attempt to resolve the discrepancy between Dr. McCloskey’s testimony that her calls to Kimberly went unreturned and Kimberly’s cell phone records, which only reflected Kimberly’s initial phone call to Kingstown Pediatrics and Dr. McCloskey’s phone call during which she spoke with Kimberly. We do not conclude therefrom, however, that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material', '- 22 - evidence. On appeal, Kimberly suggests that the phone records belie the great concern about Luke to which Dr. McCloskey testified at trial. Be that as it may, the sequence of phone calls and messages, and indeed Dr. McCloskey’s concern, pale in comparison to the undisputed evidence that Luke sustained fourteen unexplained nonaccidental fractures.', 'Overall, the trial justice’s decision was predicated on three central findings. First, he identified Kimberly and Mrs. Warrington as Luke’s primary caregivers. Specifically, he found that both Kimberly and Mrs. Warrington were Luke’s primary caregivers during the time Luke’s injuries likely occurred. In addition, the trial justice noted that Kimberly and Mrs. Warrington “repeatedly and vehemently denied that either of them were responsible for the [fourteen] fractures suffered by Luke.” The trial justice found credible Mrs. Warrington’s “strenuous denial that she did any harm to her grandson.” In contrast, the trial justice found that Kimberly’s “denial as to any knowledge of how [Luke’s] injuries were caused [was] not credible * * *.” We give both credibility determinations great deference. See Guertin v. Guertin, 870 A.2d 1011, 1020 (R.I. 2005) (concluding that “[i]n a trial without a jury, credibility determinations are within the sound discretion of the trial justice”).', 'Second, the trial justice determined that the time frame for Luke’s injuries set forth by Dr. Kaplan did not correlate with Luke’s visits with Andrew.', 'The trial justice cited the testimony of Kimberly, Andrew, and Dr. Kaplan as the basis for his finding that Andrew did not cause Luke’s injuries. In addition, he noted Andrew’s mother’s testimony that Luke’s visits with Andrew were all supervised. The trial justice further acknowledged that Kimberly had called DCYF on March 4, 2015. The trial justice also pointed out the fact that, during the divorce proceedings, Kimberly never accused Andrew of abusing Luke.', '- 23 -', 'Third, he credited Dr. Kaplan’s testimony that Luke’s injuries were consistent with child abuse and likely caused him substantial pain during the two weeks following the fractures. Kimberly contends, however, that, because the evidence at trial showed that Luke was never observed to be in distress, the inference that she either abused Luke or allowed him to be abused was unsupported because there were other reasonable inferences to be made regarding the cause of Luke’s injuries: “metabolic disorder could be the culprit as medicine in this area is still evolving, or, others involved who had sufficient and significant access to Luke over a substantial amount of time could have caused the injuries.” The trial justice, however, found Dr. Kaplan’s testimony that Luke’s fractures were “non[]accidentally caused and were consistent with child physical abuse” to be “convincing, compelling, and weighty[.]” Moreover, the trial justice found that it was “reasonable to infer” that Kimberly, as Luke’s primary caregiver, “either perpetuated said physical abuse upon her son or allowed same to occur * * *.” We note that Luke had since been seen by Dr. Kaplan, who testified that a new skeletal x-ray had not revealed any new fractures; and, at the time of trial, Luke continued to be in the care of Dr. McCloskey and had suffered no further bruising and had gained weight.', 'We conclude, after a thorough review of the record, that legally competent evidence exists to support these findings by the trial justice. Therefore, we find no error in the trial justice’s denial of Kimberly’s motion to dismiss or in his grant of DCYF’s petition alleging abuse and neglect.', 'B', 'Kimberly’s Fundamental Rights and DCYF’s Temporary Hold on the Children', 'On appeal, Kimberly contends that her fundamental rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution were violated because DCYF placed a seventy-', '- 24 - two-hour hold on her children without further investigation and without reasonable suspicion after Luke’s skeletal survey revealed fourteen fractures. However, Kimberly and Andrew both waived their right to a probable-cause hearing on DCYF’s ex parte petition. See R. Juv. P. 15(c)(5) (providing that a parent has a right to a probable-cause hearing on the ex parte petition). Therefore, we conclude that Kimberly’s challenge to the temporary hold on the children was not preserved for appeal.', 'C', 'Luke’s Other Caregivers and In Loco Parentis', 'Kimberly maintains that Luke’s other caregivers should be held to the same standard of care to which she is held as a parent. In support of her contention, she points to In re Adner G., cited supra, which similarly involved a DCYF abuse and neglect petition. In re Adner G., 925 A.2d at 953. There, a justice of the Family Court found that the parents had abused their seven- week-old infant, Jadnerisse. Id. at 953, 956. The mother had testified that, since Jadnerisse’s birth, she had always been concerned with the frequency of the baby’s crying, so she had brought Jadnerisse to see numerous medical professionals and was consistently told that Jadnerisse’s crying was normal and that she was healthy. Id. at 954. However, a skeletal x-ray of Jadnerisse revealed that she had suffered numerous fractures, in various stages of healing, caused by “non[]accidental trauma.” Id. at 955, 956. The doctor who examined Jadnerisse testified that Jadnerisse’s leg fractures that prompted her admission to the hospital were acute and had probably occurred within the past twelve to twenty four hours. Id. at 956.', 'Because of Jadnerisse’s acute leg fractures and her other older injuries, the doctor testified that she could not “rule out” the parents or the daycare provider as the cause of her injuries. Id. The daycare provider had been caring for Jadnerisse, while mother worked, from morning until approximately', '- 25 - 3:30 p.m. Id. at 954. Both parents “vehemently denied” causing Jadnerisse’s injuries, but were unable to provide an explanation as to how the trauma occurred. Id. at 956.', 'This Court concluded in In re Adner G. that a reasonable inference would be deemed supported when either: (1) the injuries to the child were so obvious “that they could not have gone unnoticed by anyone ostensibly caring for the child,” or (2) that “the person accused of the abuse was the sole custodian and caretaker of the child when the injury took place.” In re Adner G., 925 A.2d at 960. After a review of the record, we concluded that neither factor was present to support the inference that Jadnerisse’s parents caused her injuries. Id. Specifically, we held that “someone other than the parents had significant access to the child during the time when the injuries probably were inflicted” and, therefore, this Court concluded that “the inference that only the parents could have inflicted the injuries (or allowed another to do so) was not reasonable.” Id. Our conclusion was based on evidence showing that Jadnerisse was cared for approximately eight hours a day during the week by a daycare provider, who did not testify, at a daycare outside of the home, where two teenagers may have been living at the time. Id. at 961. Thus, we held that the evidence was “insufficient to permit a reasonable inference to be drawn that it was [the parents], and not the daycare provider or some other person present at the daycare facility, who abused Jadnerisse.” Id. at 962.', 'Here, the trial justice distinguished the facts of the present case from those contained in In re Adner G. The trial justice found that Luke’s only primary caregivers were Kimberly and Mrs. Warrington, who cared for Luke while Kimberly was at work. The trial justice in In re Adner G. pointed out that the doctor was unable to “rule out” either the parents or the daycare provider as the perpetrator(s) of the abuse. Id. at 956. We note that, here, the trial justice heard testimony from both Kimberly and Mrs. Warrington, unlike in In re Adner G., where the daycare', '- 26 - provider was not called to testify. Id. at 961. In his decision in the present case, the trial justice found credible Mrs. Warrington’s denial that she caused any harm to Luke. On the other hand, he found Kimberly’s denial not credible. Such credibility determinations are “within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Guertin, 870 A.2d at 1020. Therefore, because we have concluded that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive any material evidence, we will not disturb his credibility determinations.', 'Moreover, in regard to Kimberly’s in loco parentis argument, we note that “the law holds [a parent] to a greater level of substantial responsibility and awareness concerning the well-being of [his or her child] than it otherwise might in the case of an adult relative or a stranger.” In re Nicole B., 703 A.2d 612, 618 (R.I. 1997) (determining that parents who provided no explanation for their child’s critical injuries are held to a higher level of responsibility for their child’s well- being due to their status as parents). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not err in his findings: Kimberly “was [Luke’s] prim[ary] caregiver and [that] it is reasonable to infer that [Kimberly] either perpetrated said physical abuse upon [Luke] or allowed same to occur[.]”', 'D', 'Rule 803(4) and the Physicians’ Testimony', 'Kimberly argues that, pursuant to Rule 803(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, only statements made for purposes of diagnosis or treatment are admissible through a physician’s testimony as an exception to the hearsay rule.

Furthermore, the trial justice explained his ruling based on his interpretation of Kimberly’s counsel’s objection as it related to the doctor’s impression of Kimberly’s level of concern for Luke, not as a hearsay objection. Then, the direct examination of Dr. McCloskey proceeded along the same line of questioning, without further objection or clarification by Kimberly’s counsel. “[A] general objection at trial will not suffice to preserve an issue for appeal ‘when the context does not supply the specific ground for the objection.’” In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273, 1280 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 646 (R.I. 2006)). “[I]n order to satisfy the strictures of our raise-or-waive rule, an evidentiary objection must be sufficiently focused so as to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis for said objection * * *.” Id.

However, during Kimberly’s “tearful” testimony on February 23, 2016, Kimberly’s counsel did not raise any objection to Andrew’s presence at that time.8 See In re Shy C., 126 A.3d at 435 (determining that an issue must be raised and articulated at trial in order for it to be properly preserved for appellate review).', 'On March 1, 2016, following Andrew’s testimony, Kimberly’s counsel noted Andrew’s presence in the courtroom, objected to it, and argued that Kimberly may call him to testify again as part of her defense and that, therefore, he should be sequestered.

This case of first impression is before the Supreme Court on appeal by the defendant, the Rhode Island Troopers Association (RITA), from a judgment granting declaratory and equitable relief in favor of the plaintiff, the State of Rhode Island (the state).', 'The Superior Court declared that the Governmental Tort Liability Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 31 of title 9, vests the Attorney General with the nondelegable, nontransferable legal duty to determine whether the state should provide a defense and indemnification in a civil action brought against a state employee. The Superior Court also permanently enjoined arbitration of issues related to the Attorney General’s decision to decline to provide a defense and indemnification for Rhode Island State Trooper James Donnelly-Taylor (Trooper Taylor) in a pending federal civil rights action brought against him in his individual capacity. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the first six declarations and vacate the remaining two declarations in the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case stems from an incident that occurred on February 26, 2014, when two members of the Rhode Island State Police, Trooper Taylor and Trooper Gregory Palmer (Trooper Palmer), initiated a traffic stop of Lionel Monsanto (Monsanto) after observing him speeding in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.', 'When the officers learned that Monsanto’s driver’s license had expired, he was arrested and transported to the State Police Lincoln Barracks for processing.1 After he was processed and booked, Monsanto was escorted to a cellblock. It was then that Trooper Taylor is alleged to have entered the cellblock and physically assaulted Monsanto multiple times. This incident was captured on a video recording that graphically depicts the foregoing episode.2 The events of that evening were presented to a grand jury. Trooper Taylor was indicted on a charge of assault, to which he subsequently entered a plea of nolo contendere. During his plea colloquy, Trooper Taylor knowingly waived his constitutional rights and admitted to the underlying facts in the indictment, including that he assaulted Monsanto. A judge of the Sixth Division District Court accepted the plea and ordered the case to be filed in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 12-10-12. Trooper Taylor also was ordered to perform twenty-five hours of community service work. The criminal disposition subsequently was expunged in accordance with § 12-10-12(c). No criminal record resulted from this disposition.', 'On March 24, 2016, Monsanto filed suit against the following defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island: the State of Rhode Island; Trooper Taylor, 1', 'As a result of Monsanto driving on an expired license, as well as subsequent events that transpired during the traffic stop, multiple charges were brought against Monsanto, all of which were later dismissed by the Department of the Attorney General. 2', 'This video recording was sealed pursuant to a protective order.

O’Donnell, individually and in his official capacity.', 'Mr. Monsanto alleged federal civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983; conspiracy to violate plaintiff’s civil rights; assault and battery; malicious prosecution; false imprisonment and false arrest; intentional infliction of emotional distress; and violations of G.L. 1956 § 9-1-35 and G.L. 1956 § 31-21.2-3,3 causes of action based on alleged racial harassment by racial profiling. The complaint also seeks punitive damages.', 'On April 8, 2016, the Attorney General received a written request for representation from Trooper Taylor. This request stated, in pertinent part:', '“I respectfully request legal representation and indemnification', 'with regard to the * * * civil action filed [by Monsanto].

The court, in its discretion, may also restrain', 'and enjoin such future acts by the defendant.” In addition, G.L. 1956 § 31-21.2-3 provides that:', '“No state or municipal law enforcement officer or law enforcement', 'agency shall engage in racial profiling. For purposes of this', 'chapter, ‘racial profiling’ means the detention, interdiction or other', 'disparate treatment of an individual on the basis, in whole or in', 'part, of the racial or ethnic status of such individual, except when', 'such status is used in combination with other identifying factors', 'seeking to apprehend a specific suspect whose racial or ethnic', 'status is part of the description of the suspect, which description is', 'timely and reliable.”', '-3-', 'limited to, 42-28-20, and the Rhode Island State Police Troopers', 'Association Collective Bargaining Agreement, section 29.17.” On May 15, 2016, the Department of the Attorney General responded:', '“Pursuant to R.I.

An affidavit also was submitted to the Superior Court by the Department of the Attorney General that stated, in relevant part:', '“Prior to making the determination in 2016 that the State of Rhode', 'Island would not defend or indemnify James Donnelly Taylor in', 'the federal action Monsanto v. State, et al., No. 16-0147, the', 'Department of Attorney General had available to it: information', 'from the criminal proceedings in State v. Lionel Monsanto,', 'including reports from the Rhode Island State Police; information', 'from the criminal proceedings in State v. James Donnelly Taylor,', 'including reports, a video of the incident at the Lincoln Barracks in', 'February of 2014, and the fact that Donnelly Taylor was indicted', 'by a grand jury and later pled nolo contendere in the Sixth District', 'Court to a charge of misdemeanor assault on Monsanto. There was', 'also privileged communication and exchange of information', 'between the Department of Attorney General and the Department', 'of Public Safety.” The Attorney General’s refusal to provide a defense to Trooper Taylor in his individual capacity was based on the Attorney General’s determination that Trooper Taylor’s conduct fell “outside the scope of his employment” and amounted to willful misconduct in accordance with §§ 9-31-8 and 9-31-9, provisions of the Governmental Tort Liability Act.4 The RITA filed a grievance on 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-31-8 provides:', '-4- Trooper Taylor’s behalf with the State Police alleging a violation of the applicable collective bargaining agreement (CBA), specifically, Article 29.17.5 In that grievance, RITA asserted that the state must', '“honor its contractual obligations contained in Article 29.17 and', 'shall provide Trooper Donnelly Taylor with full legal defense of', 'all claims asserted in Monsanto v. State of Rhode Island et al., and', 'shall also provide Trooper Donnelly Taylor with full', '“Except as provided in § 9-31-9, the attorney general shall, upon a', 'written request of an employee or former employee of the state of', 'Rhode Island, defend any action brought against the state', 'employee or former state employee, on account of an act or', 'omission that occurred within the scope of his or her employment', 'with the state.” In addition, G.L. 1956 § 9-31-9 states:', '“The attorney general may refuse to defend an action referred to in', '§ 9-31-8 if he or she determines that:', '“(1) The act or omission was not within the scope of employment;', '“(2) The act or the failure to act was because of actual fraud,', 'willful misconduct, or actual malice;', '“(3) The defense of the action or proceeding by the attorney', 'general would create a conflict of interest between the state of', 'Rhode Island and the employee or former employee;', '“(4) Within ten (10) days of the time he or she is served with any', 'summons, complaint, process, notice, demand, or pleading, the', 'employee or former employee fails to deliver the original or a copy', 'thereof to the attorney general or his or her designee; or', '“(5) The state employee or former state employee refuses to', 'cooperate fully with the attorney general’s defense.” 5', 'Article 29.17 of the CBA states, in pertinent part:', '“The State shall provide legal counsel for any legal action arising', 'out of conduct of State Troopers acting within the scope of their', 'employment. The State shall also provide full indemnification for', 'any liability, expenses or damages of any nature incurred by State', 'Troopers resulting from any legal action arising out of conduct', 'performed within the scope of employment.

On June 30, 2016, RITA filed a “Demand for Arbitration” and sought the following remedy:', '“A determination that the State honor its obligations contained in', 'Article 29.17; that the State provide Trooper Donnelly-Taylor with', 'full legal defense of all claims asserted against him in Monsanto v.', 'State of Rhode Island et al. and/or full indemnification for all', 'liabilities, expenses and damages of any nature resulting from that', 'legal action; that the State shall be directed to reimburse to Trooper', 'Donnelly-Taylor all legal fees and expenses incurred by him with', 'respect to the representation in that legal action; and that the State', 'reimburse the Rhode Island State Troopers Association for any', 'damages it suffered as a result of the State’s flagrant violation of', 'Article 29.17.”', 'Based upon an agreed statement of facts filed by the parties in Superior Court, it is undisputed that the arbitrator, at the request of RITA, issued a subpoena seeking thirty-one categories of documents. The state did not make the requested production, but instead sought to have the subpoena quashed. Monsanto thereafter filed a third amended complaint in the federal court action; and Trooper Taylor, in his individual capacity, responded by filing a cross-claim and a third-party complaint against the Governor of Rhode Island, the General Treasurer of Rhode Island, and the Director of the Department of Administration, all in their official capacities; the Attorney General, in his individual and official capacities; and then-colonel of the', '-6- State Police Steven G. O’Donnell, in his individual and official capacities.6 Although Trooper Taylor’s third-party complaint and cross-claim raised numerous allegations, the case on appeal before this Court centers on the claims arising from the Attorney General’s refusal to defend and indemnify Trooper Taylor in his individual capacity in that federal action.7', 'On February 27, 2017, the state filed a “Verified Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief” in the Superior Court that requested, inter alia, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief against the arbitration of RITA’s grievance; a declaration that the grievance is not arbitrable; and a declaration that the Governmental Tort Liability Act “tasks the Attorney General with the non-delegable, non-transferable, sole legal duty to determine when and whether, in an action filed against a state employee, to provide a defense and/or indemnification[.]” The state also sought a declaration that Article 29.17 of the CBA is valid only when read in conjunction with the Governmental Tort Liability Act. On March 28, 2017, a justice of the Superior Court granted temporary injunctive relief and stayed the arbitration.', 'On June 20, 2017, another hearing was held before a second trial justice of the Superior Court regarding the request for declaratory relief, based upon an agreed statement of facts. On July 6, 2017, the trial justice issued a judgment with eight declarations that generally mirror the state’s request for relief. The judgment declares:', '“A.', 'Any further activity and arbitration proceedings related in', 'any way to Defendant RITA’s Demand for Arbitration * * * is 6', 'This cross-claim and third-party complaint was stayed pending trial on Monsanto’s claims. That trial was expected to be conducted later in 2018. 7', 'The state asked the federal court to certify a question to this Court, including, inter alia, whether the Attorney General had the authority to refuse to defend and indemnify a state employee in accordance with the Attorney General’s common law, constitutional, and statutory authority; or whether defense and indemnity issues were not within the exclusive purview of the Attorney General.

Although RITA purports to frame this issue as a monetary contractual provision, it pays scant attention to the mandate, in both the statute and the CBA, that the act or omission giving rise to the suit must occur in the course of one’s employment. It is RITA’s contention that the record on this issue has not been fully developed because of the status of the federal court litigation; yet nonetheless RITA submitted this matter to arbitration.', 'The RITA further argues that a contractual right to defense and indemnification is separate from a statutory right to defense and indemnification; and that the CBA provision at issue in this case complies with and supplements the Governmental Tort Liability Act. In addition, RITA argues that the state’s position encroaches upon the General Assembly’s authority to determine the financial terms for state employees, as well as the Governor’s power to enter into collective bargaining agreements.', 'In response, the state argues that the Attorney General is vested with the nondelegable common law, constitutional, and statutory authority to determine whether state employees who are sued in their individual capacity are entitled to representation and indemnification by the state. The state argues that the Governmental Tort Liability Act vests the Attorney General with the sole and nonreviewable discretion to determine whether an employee’s conduct was outside the scope of his or her employment, or due to willful misconduct or other enumerated disqualifying factors. Accordingly, the state contends that the Attorney General has the authority to decline to defend a state employee whose conduct is outside the scope of his or her employment or based on willful misconduct. The state further contends that the interpretation of the CBA urged by RITA invades the Attorney General’s duties and is therefore erroneous.', '-9-', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that “[t]he decision to grant or to deny declaratory relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is purely discretionary.” Sullivan v. Chafee, 703 A.2d 748, 751 (R.I. 1997). We accord great deference to the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a declaratory judgment action. Houde v. State, 973 A.2d 493, 498 (R.I. 2009). However, questions of law are reviewed de novo. Id. “Accordingly[,] we review a declaratory decree of the Superior Court with an eye to whether the court abused its discretion, misinterpreted the applicable law, overlooked material facts, or otherwise exceeded its authority.” Sullivan, 703 A.2d at 751.', 'Analysis', 'We begin by noting that the declaratory judgment that was requested by the state, and issued by the Superior Court, is unnecessarily broad because it extends beyond the question of the statutory authority of the Attorney General set forth in the Governmental Tort Liability Act. Therefore, we deem it appropriate to narrow the issues raised on appeal to: (1) whether the Attorney General’s authority to refuse to provide a defense to a state employee is an arbitrable issue under a collective bargaining agreement; and (2) whether, in accordance with the Governmental Tort Liability Act, the Attorney General is vested with the statutory authority to determine whether a state employee is entitled to legal representation when sued in his or her individual capacity “on account of an act or omission that occurred within the scope of his or her employment with the state”; and whether that authority is delegable or transferable.', 'Furthermore, we are mindful that the issues in this case arose from litigation that is pending before the United States District Court. We proceed to decide this case with full', '- 10 - appreciation of the need for an efficient resolution of claims brought against the state by a member of the public.', 'The Decision Granting Injunctive Relief', 'This Court has held that conflicts that arise between state law and a collective bargaining agreement are tasked to the judiciary to resolve.', 'Vose v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 587 A.2d 913, 914 (R.I. 1991). Thus, “an arbitrator cannot resolve a labor dispute by issuing a ruling that would conflict with or compromise the statutory authority or legal obligations of a department of state government.” State v.

Woonsocket School Committee, 770 A.2d 834, 838 (R.I. 2001)).', 'In the case at bar, RITA filed a grievance contending that the state violated the CBA, specifically Article 29.17, by its refusal to provide to Trooper Taylor legal counsel as well as its refusal to provide to Trooper Taylor full indemnification for any liabilities, expenses, or damages resulting from a legal action arising out of conduct performed by Trooper Taylor within the scope of his employment. In its demand for arbitration, RITA sought an arbitral award declaring that the state must, in accordance with Article 29.17 of the CBA, provide Trooper Taylor with full legal defense of all claims asserted against him in the federal court action and full indemnification for all liabilities, expenses, and damages arising out of the legal action.', 'The RITA argues that there is no direct statutory language that gives the Attorney General the exclusive right to determine whether an employee acts within the scope of employment for the purposes of the state providing representation or determining indemnification. It also asserts that the Attorney General has no authority to interfere with or to seek to nullify financial obligations that bind the state in a collective bargaining agreement with state employees. Moreover, RITA argues that no conflict exists between the CBA and the Governmental Tort Liability Act and therefore the CBA is enforceable and arbitration is the appropriate remedy in this case.', '- 12 -', 'In response, the state argues that the remedy sought through arbitration is in conflict with the Attorney General’s authority to decline representation in accordance with the narrow circumstances set forth in § 9-31-9. The state maintains that Article 29.17 of the CBA is valid only when read in conjunction with the Governmental Tort Liability Act, which vests the Attorney General with discretion to decide matters of defense and immunity of state employees. The state argues that this Court is confronted with an issue of state law that cannot be determined by arbitration. Finally, the state posits that arbitration of the Attorney General’s decision to decline representation and indemnification would cause a “usurpation of the exclusive statutory authority of the department.”', 'The trial justice concluded that the issues raised in the grievance are not arbitrable. The trial justice declared at the hearing on the state’s request for a permanent injunction that to arbitrate the issues in this case would “violate the Attorney General’s powers and obligations” and that “[t]he Attorney General holds a constitutional office with specific and significant responsibilities to the people of Rhode Island.” The trial justice held that the Attorney General is vested with authority to determine whether to undertake a defense of state employees and that RITA’s challenge to that authority is not arbitrable. We agree.', 'The issues raised in the grievance must be viewed in light of the Governmental Tort Liability Act. Specifically,', 'as set out above, § 9-31-8, titled “Defense of state employees‒Attorney general,” declares:', '“Except as provided in § 9-31-9, the attorney general shall, upon a', 'written request of an employee or former employee of the state of', 'Rhode Island, defend any action brought against the state', 'employee or former state employee, on account of an act or', 'omission that occurred within the scope of his or her employment', 'with the state.” (Emphasis added.)

Article 29.17 of the CBA—the provision under which RITA asserts its grievance—states:', '“The State shall provide legal counsel for any legal action arising', 'out of conduct of State Policemen acting within the scope of their', 'employment. The State shall also provide full indemnification for', 'any liability, expenses or damages of any nature incurred by State', 'Policemen resulting from any legal action arising out of conduct', 'performed within the scope of employment. With respect to the', 'provision of legal counsel in criminal matters, any legal action', 'includes alleged criminal conduct arising out of conduct of the', 'State Policemen acting within the scope of their employment.”', '(Emphasis added.)', 'There exists a common thread between the above-quoted provision of the CBA and the statutory scheme of the Governmental Tort Liability Act: A state employee’s entitlement to a defense and indemnification is limited to cases in which the conduct giving rise to the suit was performed within the scope of his or her employment and does not fall within the disqualifying factors set forth in § 9-31-9. Whether an employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment, and is therefore entitled to a defense provided by the state, is a question that in the first instance is textually committed to the Attorney General. “The attorney general may refuse to defend an action * * * if he or she determines that * * * [t]he act or omission was not within', '- 14 - the scope of employment.” Section 9-31-9. The Attorney General’s authority to make this determination is statutorily prescribed in §§ 9-31-8 and 9-31-9.', 'Accordingly, this is the controlling law on this issue; it is not a question capable of resolution by an arbitrator. See Rhode Island Alliance of Social Services Employees, Local 580, SEIU, 747 A.2d at 469 (labor disputes and grievances that seek to modify applicable state law are not subject to arbitration because the arbitrator has no power to do so); see also City of Cranston, 115 A.3d at 978 (“[A]rbitration awards that contravene state law are unenforceable because the arbitrator has no authority to make them.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). In fact, Article 29.17 is silent as to how, when, and by whom a determination is made that an employee’s conduct falls within the scope of employment. We are therefore of the opinion that the issues raised in this case are not arbitrable within the collective bargaining process. We uphold the trial justice’s decision to permanently enjoin the arbitration proceedings, and we affirm Declarations A, B, D, E, and F of the judgment.', 'The Decision Granting Declaratory Relief', 'Having affirmed the trial justice’s decision to permanently enjoin the arbitration proceedings, this Court now turns to the trial justice’s remaining declarations. The state requests that this Court affirm the declaration that the Attorney General possesses the nondelegable, nontransferable, sole legal duty to determine whether a state employee was acting within the scope of his or her employment and therefore is entitled to a defense and indemnification. Specifically, Declaration C in the Superior Court judgment provides as follows:', '“The Governmental Tort Liability Act tasks the Attorney General', 'with the non-delegable, non-transferable, sole legal duty to', 'determine when and whether, in an action filed against a state', 'employee, to provide a defense and/or indemnification, however', 'this declaration is made without prejudice to any future litigant', 'who wishes to challenge any portion of the statute as unclear or', '- 15 -', 'ambiguous or any party who seeks a construction of the language', 'by the courts; [i]n particular, regarding the definition of term', '‘within the scope of employment’ as set forth in the Act.” The parties have framed the issue in this case as resting on the Attorney General’s common law, constitutional, and statutory authority to determine whether a state employee who is sued in his or her individual capacity is entitled to representation and indemnification at taxpayer expense. Certainly, this Court has consistently recognized and affirmed the Attorney General’s assertion of common law and constitutionally derived authority to carry out the important functions of the office on behalf of the people of this state. See State v. Lead Paint Industries Association, Inc., 951 A.2d 428, 471, 473 (R.I. 2008) (“[T]he Rhode Island constitution recognizes the Office of the Attorney General and provides for its continued existence with all the powers inherent at common law; it also provides that the General Assembly may imbue the Attorney General with powers in addition to those common law powers. * * * In the course of exercising those powers, the Attorney General is vested with broad discretion.”); McKenna v. Williams, 874 A.2d 217, 223 n.4 (R.I. 2005) (“We cannot presently conceive of any circumstances when it would be the role of the Superior Court or this Court to question [the Attorney General’s] decision to represent or decline to represent a state official who is sued in connection with his or her duties.”); Mottola v. Cirello, 789 A.2d 421, 424 (R.I. 2002) (“The Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island holds a constitutional office with specific and significant responsibilities to the people of Rhode Island.”).', 'Historically, the state and its subdivisions had enjoyed immunity from suit since the dawn of the Republic. “The doctrine of governmental tort immunity was imported to the United States in the early part of the 19th century [and served] to deny tort recovery against state and municipal governments.” Calhoun v. City of Providence, 120 R.I. 619, 626, 390 A.2d 350, 353', '- 16 - (1978). This Court recognized the doctrine as applied to municipal corporations in Wixon v. City of Newport, 13 R.I. 454 (1881). Time marched on, however; and, on February 9, 1970, this Court joined a growing number of jurisdictions and announced the demise of immunity for cities and towns in Becker v. Beaudoin, 106 R.I. 562, 261 A.2d 896 (1970). However, we granted a brief stay of execution until June 30, 1970, in order to afford the General Assembly an opportunity to enact legislation “limiting or regulating the prosecution of such claims as arise after said June 30, 1970.” Becker, 160 R.I. at 572, 261 A.2d at 901. The Legislature responded, and the Governmental Tort Liability Act was conceived. Although in Becker we specifically declared that our decision “does not in any manner abolish or limit the sovereign immunity that inheres in the state itself[,]” the new legislation provided otherwise. Id. at 572, 261 A.2d at 901- 02. The Governmental Tort Liability Act declared that the state and any political subdivisions were liable in all actions of tort, subject to statutory limitations on damages.', 'Over the years, this Court has had occasion to pass upon, and indeed limit, the extent of the state’s waiver of sovereign immunity, including the public duty doctrine and its judicially created exceptions. This Court refused to “attribute to the Legislature the intent to wipe away all barriers to state liability and thereby radically depart from established conceptions of state tort responsibility without a clear statement regarding such a change.” Calhoun, 120 R.I. at 629, 390 A.2d at 355; see, e.g., Knudsen v. Hall, 490 A.2d 976, 978 (R.I. 1985) (holding that state was not liable in the absence of a special duty owed to plaintiffs by the state); Andrade v. State, 448 A.2d 1293, 1295 (R.I. 1982) (concluding that prejudgment interest was not available in negligence action against state); Ryan v. State, Department of Transportation, 420 A.2d 841, 843 (R.I. 1980) (Court recognized public duty doctrine). In Catone v. Medberry, 555 A.2d 328 (R.I. 1989), we recognized both the need to immunize government officials from the threat of litigation for', '- 17 - effective governing or for the performance of an activity inherently sovereign in nature, as distinct from a personal-injury claim arising out of the negligent operation of a motor vehicle or other tortious behavior. Catone, 555 A.2d at 333.', 'However, we are aware of only a single occasion when the discretion exercised by the Attorney General in the defense of the state and its agent against claims brought pursuant to the Governmental Tort Liability Act has been challenged.8 In Mottola, cited supra, this Court was called upon to address, inter alia, a sua sponte order by a justice of the Superior Court that directed defense counsel, retained in accordance with a liability insurance policy in the name of the state, to withdraw his appearance in the action and further ordered the Attorney General to enter his appearance on behalf of the state. Mottola, 789 A.2d at 422. We vacated the order and reiterated that “the Attorney General is independent from other branches of government, including the judiciary.” Id. at 424 (citing In re House of Representatives (Special Prosecutor), 575 A.2d 176, 179 (R.I. 1990)). In Mottola, we also had occasion to address the role of the Attorney General in the context of the Governmental Tort Liability Act, and declared that, in deciding whether to undertake a defense of the employee, the Attorney General acts within the exclusive exercise of his or her statutory authority. Id. at 424-25. We held that “[i]t is not the province of this Court, or the Superior Court, to dictate how the Attorney General elects to carry out the statutory functions of his office.” Id. at 425. We do not retreat from that holding in the case before us. However, although the historical powers of the Attorney General are of more than passing interest, we are satisfied that the express language of the Governmental Tort Liability Act controls the resolution of the issues in this appeal. 8', 'In fact, it was disclosed by the state at oral argument that this is the only instance in which the Attorney General has declined to represent a state employee in an action in accordance with § 9-31-9.', '- 18 -', 'Pursuant to § 9-31-9, the Attorney General is vested with the authority to refuse to defend an action on behalf of a state employee if the Attorney General determines that (1) the state employee’s conduct was not within the scope of employment; or (2) the state employee engaged in willful misconduct or actual malice. In the case at bar, the Attorney General declined to provide Trooper Taylor a legal defense in his individual capacity on the grounds that Trooper Taylor’s assault on Monsanto was intentional and was not within the scope of his employment as a Rhode Island State Trooper. The Attorney General based his decision on the fact that Trooper Taylor was indicted by a grand jury and pled nolo contendere to misdemeanor assault upon Monsanto. Moreover, the record includes a video recording that captured Trooper Taylor’s assault upon Monsanto. We are of the opinion that the information before the Attorney General supports the decision that Trooper Taylor’s conduct fell outside the scope of his employment as a Rhode Island State Trooper and that a jury could conclude that he acted willfully.', 'It is important to note that the state, citing this Court’s decision in Mottola, 789 A.2d at 425, submits that the decision of the Attorney General to refuse to defend a state employee whose conduct is deemed to fall within one of the disqualifying factors set forth in § 9-31-9 is not reviewable.', 'We reject this contention.', 'Judicial review of the Attorney General’s discretionary decision is available to an employee who has been denied the benefits of § 9-31-8. We are convinced that the General Assembly enacted § 9-31-8 with the intention to protect state employees against tort claims that may arise out of the conduct that occurred within the scope of their employment. See State v. Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association, 941 A.2d 219, 221 (R.I. 2008). Although the protection for a state employee is not limitless and is indeed cabined by § 9-31-9, a state employee, acting within the scope of his or her employment, should be able to rely on the protection of the Governmental Tort Liability Act and seek judicial review', '- 19 - of a decision that denies such protection. Nonetheless, the question of when and under what specific circumstances that review may be undertaken is not before this Court, and we need not speculate at this time.', 'Lastly, we address RITA’s somewhat shifting position in this appeal that began with a demand for a legal defense and indemnification of Trooper Taylor, including indemnification for punitive damages, and has moved toward a request for indemnification or the payment of private counsel. The RITA argues in its brief that “[t]he right to decide whether [the Attorney General] will defend an employee does not give the Attorney General the power to decide whether an employee is entitled to any financial support from the state * * *.” The RITA directs this Court to § 9-31-12, which is the statutory authority that permits “[t]he state [to] reserve[] the right to determine whether or not it will indemnify any employees defended pursuant to §§ 9-31-8 ‒ 9-31-11, if a judgment is rendered against the employee.” Section 9-31-12(a). The RITA argues, however, that § 9-31-12(b) tasks the judiciary with the “final decision” on whether the state will indemnify a state employee, not the Attorney General. These arguments are misplaced; § 9-31-12 applies when a determination has been made by the Attorney General that the conduct giving rise to the suit was within his or her employment and a state employee is thereafter defended in accordance with § 9-31-8. See Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association, 941 A.2d at 221 (“In 1995, § 9-31-12 * * * was amended * * * in order to provide increased liability protection for state employees, for tort claims based on conduct that occurred within the scope of their employment * * *.”); Mottola, 789 A.2d at 423-24 (holding that the language of § 9-31-12(b) is unambiguous and requires that the employee’s conduct fall within the scope of employment and was not fraudulent, malicious, or the result of willful misconduct). Section 9-31-12(b) does not apply to cases in which the Attorney General has refused to provide', '- 20 - a defense based on one of the enumerated disqualifying factors under § 9-31-9. Thus, as we discussed supra, we are of the opinion that the Governmental Tort Liability Act is an orderly statutory scheme enacted by the General Assembly that vests the Attorney General with the authority to determine whether the state employee qualifies for defense and indemnification. It does not interfere with the Governor’s power to enter into collective bargaining agreements, nor does it encroach upon the General Assembly’s authority to determine the financial terms of state employees.', 'The RITA further argues that § 9-31-11, which becomes operable when the Attorney General has a conflict of interest, serves to limit the Attorney General’s authority to determine indemnification to his or her office, and does not afford the Attorney General the authority to dictate the financial obligations of the state as a whole.9 The RITA directs this Court to the holding in Mottola, a case in which we held that § 9-31-11 requires that the state pay for reasonable attorney’s fees when the Attorney General “determines that it is not in the best interest of the state or the employee to undertake the defense * * *.” Mottola, 789 A.2d at 424- 25. The holding in Mottola is not relevant to the facts of this case. The Attorney General in the instant case did not find there to be a conflict of interest that prevented him from representing Trooper Taylor, but rather he found that Trooper Taylor was disqualified from defense and 9', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-31-11, titled “Conflict—Payment of counsel fees by state,” provides:', '“In the event there is a conflict of interest or the attorney general', 'determines it is not in the best interest of the state or the state', 'employee or former state employee to represent him or her, the', 'state shall pay for reasonable counsel fees; provided, however, that', 'the attorney general shall consult in advance with the prospective', 'counsel to establish the parameters within which the state will be', 'liable for attorneys’ fees; and provided, further, that their', 'reasonableness shall ultimately be reviewed and approved by the', 'court before paid.”', '- 21 - indemnification provided by the state. Accordingly, we affirm Declaration C of the judgment, and we vacate Declarations G and H as superfluous to the issues in this case.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the first six declarations and vacate the remaining two declarations in the judgment of the Superior Court.

This case came before the Supreme Court on May 2, 2018, on appeal by the defendant, Bruce Moten (defendant), from a Superior Court judgment of conviction on eight counts and from the denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice imposed two consecutive sentences of life imprisonment for murder and for discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, death resulting; two consecutive sentences of twenty years to serve for felony assault and discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence; three consecutive sentences of ten years to serve for felony assault, discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, and conspiracy; and a suspended sentence of ten years, with probation, for carrying a pistol without a license. The sentences imposed for the two counts of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence were ordered to be nonparolable.', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by allowing Providence Police Detective Theodore Michael to offer a lay opinion regarding the location of a particular cell phone at a certain point in time and by denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The case on appeal arises out of a long-standing feud between two rival gangs that left one young man deceased and another man injured from gunshot wounds. The two Providence gangs, “Young Niggas in Charge” (YNIC) and its youth affiliate, the “Triple Y,” and a gang known as the Chad Brown gang, or the “Triple C,” had been embroiled in a grudge match that eventually erupted in 2014. Tensions began to rise during the summer of 2014 when Henry Lopez (Henry) and Tevin Briggs (Tevin),1 members of YNIC, were at a local car wash and noted the presence of Triple C members Kendrick Johnson (Kendrick), Sean, and Tito in the vicinity. Upon observing the Triple C members, Tevin began to shoot at the rival gang, striking the car wash itself. The following day, at the same car wash, Henry was speaking to his fellow YNIC member, Antonio Fortes (Tone), who had driven up in a rented Buick with tinted windows. Triple C members Kendrick, Delacey Andrade (Delacey), and Terry Robinson (Terry) also were present at the car wash. After Tone departed in the Buick, Henry refused to disclose to Tito, a rival Triple C member, the identity of the persons inside Tone’s Buick; the Triple C members took off in an unsuccessful pursuit of Tone.', 'Some months later, on the morning of October 22, 2014, the defendant, Bruce Moten, called his fellow YNIC member Henry and asked him for a ride to the Garrahy Judicial Complex so that he could pay some court fines. Henry picked up defendant and Tevin in his black Infiniti, and the three men drove around smoking marijuana for some time before arriving at the courthouse. Prior to entering the courthouse, defendant stashed his 9 mm handgun in Henry’s glove compartment, and Tevin hid his .45-caliber handgun in the pouch on the back of Henry’s seat. After defendant paid his fines, Henry, defendant, and Tevin went to the courthouse snack 1', 'We refer to the individuals involved in this case by either their first names or nicknames in order to avoid confusion. We do not intend any disrespect by doing so.', '-2- bar, where they encountered Brian and Dizzle, two other YNIC members. Brian and Dizzle told Henry, defendant, and Tevin that they “got into a situation” when they were surrounded by members of Triple C on the fourth floor of the courthouse. Henry, defendant, and Tevin then left the courthouse and drove around for approximately one hour before receiving a phone call from Tone that Kendrick was “slipping”2 at the PC Mart on the corner of Douglas Avenue and Eaton Street in Providence. The defendant suggested that Henry follow Kendrick, who was known to drive a Camry, and Henry headed to the PC Mart. When Henry, defendant, and Tevin arrived at the PC Mart in Henry’s black Infiniti, they immediately saw Kendrick’s black Camry and noticed that Kendrick, Terry, and Delacey were exiting the store. Henry began to tail the black Camry as it traveled down Douglas Avenue and onto Fillmore Street, at which point Kendrick’s Camry pulled into the parking lot of the Chad Brown housing complex. As soon as Henry parked on the side of the road, defendant and Tevin pulled up their hoods, had their guns in the waistbands of their sweatpants, and exited the vehicle, leaving Henry at the wheel. After hearing multiple gunshots, Henry drove to the intersection of Fillmore and Oregon Streets, and defendant and Tevin ran to the Infiniti with their guns in their hands. Henry sped off to the home of one of his girlfriends, Yahaira Montanez (Yadi).3', 'A bystander, Charlene Rainey, heard the gunshots as she drove away from a nearby Dunkin’ Donuts; she reported the shooting to the Providence police at approximately 11:30 a.m. Rainey also saw two young men run by her car, both wearing black hoodies. The police and emergency medical personnel arrived at the crime scene to find Terry gunned down and 2', 'According to Henry’s testimony, “slipping” is a term used to indicate that someone has let his or her guard down. 3', 'Henry was also dating Marilyn Ramos at the same time and had given her a ride to the courthouse earlier on the morning of October 22, 2014, where he saw Kendrick’s Camry at the courthouse before switching cars and picking up defendant and Tevin.', '-3- deceased4 and Delacey injured from a gunshot wound to the buttocks.5', 'Providence BCI detectives recovered 9 mm and .45-caliber cartridge casings and a .45-caliber intact bullet. Approximately sixty to ninety minutes after the shooting, the police broadcast a description of the car involved in the shooting—a black Infiniti with tinted windows.', 'Meanwhile, at Yadi’s house, located at 49 Tappan Street in Providence, Henry and Tevin asked Yadi to drive the black Infiniti to Courtney Rivers’s (Courtney) home located at 67 Alaska Street in Providence.6 As instructed, Yadi and her friend Jennifer Martinez (Jennifer) drove Henry’s Infiniti to Courtney’s house, and Courtney and Henry’s brother, Juan, drove Yadi and Jennifer back to Tappan Street. When Yadi returned to her home, she found Henry, defendant, and Tevin sitting at her kitchen table with their guns on the table, discussing what had just transpired. The defendant went into Yadi’s bathroom to wash his hands and asked Yadi for a garbage bag. Yadi testified that she saw a gun near the sink and that defendant told her, “It was either us or them[,]” and he displayed scars on his stomach. Before leaving Yadi’s house, Henry hid the guns belonging to defendant and Tevin in Yadi’s bedroom.', 'Later that evening, at the apartment building in which both Henry and Tone lived, on Cherry Street in Pawtucket, Henry disclosed to Yadi and Jennifer the events surrounding the shooting earlier in the day. Henry then joined Tone, Tevin, defendant, Courtney, and Juan inside Tone’s apartment.

Henry immediately asked Juan to call their cousin Danny Gomez (Danny), the putative owner of the Infiniti, and direct him to retrieve the vehicle from the Providence police station.7 Although he initially maintained that he was the owner of the black Infiniti, Danny eventually revealed to the Providence police that the car actually belonged to Henry.', 'Approximately three weeks after the October 22, 2014 shooting, Henry fled to Puerto Rico. He returned to Providence for a short period of time before Christmas 2014; but, when he was informed that Yadi’s friend Jennifer had appeared before the grand jury, he again departed. Henry was eventually apprehended in the Dominican Republic and extradited to Providence.', 'On April 10, 2015, defendant was indicted in Providence County Superior Court and charged with nine felony counts: Count 1—murder, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-23-1 and 11-23-2; Count 2—discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, death resulting, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(3); Count 3—assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of § 11-5-2 and G.L. 1956 § 12-19-39; Count 4—discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, injury resulting, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(2); Count 5—assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of §§ 11-5-2 and 12-19-39; Count 6—discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(1); Count 7—conspiracy, in violation of § 11-1-6; Count 8—carrying a pistol without a license, in violation of § 11-47-8(a); and Count 9—carrying a pistol without a license, in violation of § 11-47-8(a). On the same day, Tevin, Henry, and Tone also were indicted on the same nine counts. While Henry was being held at the Adult Correctional Institutions, defendant urged him to take the case to trial. Instead, 7', 'Although Henry owned the black Infiniti and paid the car insurance for the vehicle, the vehicle was registered in his cousin Danny Gomez’s name in order to prevent the car from being seized by law enforcement if the police caught Henry for selling drugs and to avoid paying the taxes that he owed on the vehicle.', '-5- Henry entered into a cooperation agreement with the state, in which he agreed to plead guilty to second-degree murder, discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, and other related charges, in exchange for a fifty-year sentencing cap. Tevin also entered a guilty plea on several charges in exchange for the dismissal of the remaining counts. On November 5, 2015, superseding indictments were filed against defendant and Tone, charging them with the same nine original counts. The defendant and Tone were tried together before a jury in Superior Court beginning on October 4, 2016, and the trial spanned ten trial days.', 'Yadi testified at trial with respect to the events that occurred on October 22, 2014, the day of the shooting. She testified that she did not realize what had happened that morning when Henry, Tevin, and defendant were at her home until she watched the news that afternoon and saw Henry’s black Infiniti on television described as being connected to a homicide in the Chad Brown housing complex. She testified that she told Henry she did not want the guns in her home and that he told her “[n]ot to worry about it.” She also testified that, later in the evening, while she and Henry were at Henry’s uncle’s house, Henry told her that Tevin and defendant “both had guns. They went out the car with guns[,]” and that “they shot somebody.” Despite feeling “used” by Henry, Yadi continued to see him over the next year. In fact, she reunited with Henry during his second flight attempt in Puerto Rico. Yadi also testified that around the same time, during the winter of 2015, she and defendant began to exchange messages on Facebook; and, in January 2015, defendant took Yadi out to dinner. Yadi testified that, on one occasion, defendant bought her an outfit from Victoria’s Secret and that, when he gave her the outfit, he said, “Snitches get stitches.”', 'Henry also testified at trial with respect to the fatal shooting. He testified that defendant and Tevin both exited his black Infiniti with their guns in their waistbands. He also stated that', '-6- defendant and Tevin both ran back to the Infiniti with their guns in their hands after gunshots had been fired. Once defendant and Tevin were back in the Infiniti, according to Henry, defendant stated that Tevin was “crazy” “[b]ecause he ran up to the car. He ran up to the car shooting.” He further testified that Tevin recounted the details of the shooting once the three men were inside Yadi’s house:', '“Tevin was telling me that he chased down—he chased down', 'Terry Robinson and—but first he said he was shooting at the car,', 'and his gun jammed, and said that—that Terry Robinson peeked', 'his head out between these cars while his gun jammed. And then I', 'guess when Terry Robinson seen him with the gun jammed, he', 'took off running and then Tevin unjammed the gun and started', 'chasing him, shooting at him.” Henry also admitted that he fled to Puerto Rico because he “thought [the police were] going to come looking for [him].”', 'Henry’s testimony was corroborated by a wealth of technical evidence at trial, introduced by the state. Surveillance footage depicted Henry, Tevin, and defendant parking and entering the Garrahy Complex. Another surveillance video showed Kendrick’s black Camry at PC Mart. A video compilation from the Chad Brown area depicted the black Infiniti driving around the vicinity of the crime scene, two men walking towards Fillmore Street and then running back towards the Infiniti, and the Infiniti speeding down Fillmore Street.', 'Henry’s credibility was also enhanced by corroborating cell-site data and cell phone records. The state introduced Agent Jennifer Banks, of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Cellular Analysis Survey Team (CAST), as an expert witness in historical cell-site analysis. Agent Banks testified that she was provided with three sets of cell phone records from three different phone companies, and that she then obtained the cell tower listing from those providers for the hours between 9 a.m. and noon on October 22, 2014; and, based on this data, she created', '-7- maps that showed the location of those cell sites used during that particular time frame. The various maps that Agent Banks composed as part of her analysis were introduced into evidence and were presented in conjunction with her testimony at trial. Agent Banks testified that, based on her analysis and collected data, the cell phones belonging to Henry, defendant, and Tevin were all located in the downtown Providence area between 9 and 10 a.m., and then, at approximately 10:58 a.m., all three phones indicated movement slightly north to an area east of Providence College. She also testified that defendant’s phone moved towards Douglas Avenue at 11:04 a.m.:', '“This phone, as you recall, in the 10:00 to 11:00 hour had moved', 'north up east of Providence College, and then at 11:00 a.m. you', 'see another registration here up east of Providence College, then', 'moves at 11:04 to a tower covering here, near the, you know, near', 'Route 7, which I believe is Douglas Street here and Admiral Street,', 'that general area, and then moves southeast to this 11:08', 'registration here, which covers this western side of the tower. And', 'then by 11:31, that phone is using the northeast sector of this', 'tower, and then moves back to the 30-degree sector here by', '11:38.” In addition to collecting data, Agent Banks also conducted a field survey to validate her conclusions, in which she drove through all of the streets in the Providence College to downtown Providence area in order “to collect what radio frequencies were in that area and which were the most dominant towers of coverage.”', 'Based on her research and analysis, Agent Banks concluded that defendant’s phone was in or near the area of the shooting at the time in question:', '“[PROSECUTOR:] So based on your analysis, would it be', 'consistent to say that this phone was in or near the area of 100', 'Fillmore Street at this time?', '“[BANKS:] Yes. The Fillmore Street address is right on the', 'boundary of where there’s dominant and possible coverage.', '“* * *', '-8-', '“[PROSECUTOR:] And based on these two maps you were', 'able to create through this drive-test analysis, what was the general', 'location of Bruce Moten’s phone during the time period of 11:38', 'and 12:00 p.m.?', '“[BANKS:] The [defendant’s] phone is using this tower, which', 'provides coverage northeast of Providence College to extend to', 'these dominant areas.', '“* * *', '“[PROSECUTOR:] And would the phone be consistent with being', 'in or near the area of 49 Tappan Street on the map?', '“[BANKS:] Yeah.

The defendant objected to Det. Michael offering an expert opinion in the field of historical cell-site analysis, to which the state responded that the testimony on historical cell-site analysis was being offered by Agent Banks and that Det. Michael would only testify about the data he physically extracted from the various cell phones.

It need not be conclusive and has no special status in the evidentiary framework of a trial.” Id. at 890 (quoting Morra, 791 A.2d at 477).', 'Further, “[w]hen ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v.

Michael’s testimony that Courtney’s phone was not at the Fillmore Street parking lot in Providence at the time of the shooting severely undercut defendant’s contention that it was Courtney, and not defendant, who had been one of the shooters. The defendant further contends that Det. Michael was neither qualified as an expert in historical cell-site analysis nor did he possess the knowledge and training to render a technically sound opinion. However, after a thorough examination of the record, we deem defendant’s arguments with respect to Det. Michael’s testimony to be waived.', 'This Court has long adhered to the raise-or-waive rule. See State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 468 (R.I. 2013). It is this Court’s policy that, “if an issue was not preserved by specific objection at trial, then it may not be considered on appeal.” Id.

Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008) (“It is well settled that a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.”).', 'Clearly, there is nothing in the record before us to suggest that defendant wanted to exclude Det. Michael’s testimony at trial. The state suggests that defendant did not object at trial because the context of Det. Michael’s testimony was clear and it was understood that he was simply testifying with respect to the locations of the various cell phones, not the locations of the various actors.', 'Further, defense counsel undercut Det. Michael’s testimony on cross- examination when she implied that it was possible that Courtney could be at one location and his cell phone could be at a different location:', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] And you were assuming that he was', 'the one who placed that telephone call, right?', '“[DET. MICHAEL:] I was.', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL:] You realized that someone else could', 'have had his phone, though, right?', '“[DET. MICHAEL:] Absolutely.” Although there is nothing to suggest that this cross-examination was not part of defendant’s trial strategy, whether defendant intentionally failed to object to Det. Michael’s testimony is of no moment to this appeal, because the absence of an objection renders the issue not properly before us. The defendant is not entitled to a “do over” simply because he is not satisfied with how his', '- 15 - trial strategy panned out. Accordingly, we deem this issue waived and need not reach the merits of defendant’s claim.', 'The second issue defendant raises on appeal is his assertion that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence. The defendant contends that he was entitled to a new trial because the only evidence incriminating him as a principal shooter came from Henry, who, he alleges, had a motive to lie based upon his plea agreement. It is well settled that, when deciding a motion for a new trial based upon the weight of the evidence:', '“The trial justice must consider, in the exercise of his [or her]', 'independent judgment, all the material evidence in the case, in the', 'light of his [or her] charge to the jury and pass on its weight and', 'the credibility of the witnesses, determine what evidence is', 'believable, and, decide whether the verdict rendered by the jury', 'responds to the evidence presented and does justice between the', 'parties.” McGarry v.

Nonetheless, his testimony was, in my', 'view, very credible, ensnaring Bruce Moten as a co-conspirator as', 'well as a principal in these shootings.” The trial justice also noted the presence of corroborating evidence in the record:', '“I need not catalogue or neatly list here all of the other evidence,', 'including the wealth of cell phone history, as well as the video', '- 16 -', 'recordings of the Infiniti and black Camry, which were offered in', 'evidence to corroborate Henry Lopez’s testimony.”', 'In the case at bar, the trial justice carefully performed his duty as a thirteenth juror, considering all of the material evidence in the record and independently weighing that evidence. The trial justice passed upon the credibility of the testimony by Henry and Yadi and found both witnesses to be quite credible, a finding to which this Court accords great deference. See State v. Giard, 155 A.3d 1193, 1200 (R.I. 2017) (“It is noteworthy that we ‘accord [ ] deference to the credibility determinations of the hearing justice,’ * * * because ‘[w]e do not have the same vantage point as [him or her], and we are unable to assess the witness’ demeanor, tone of voice, and body language.’”) (quoting State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 778 (R.I. 2012); State v. Woods, 936 A.2d 195, 198 (R.I. 2007)). He also determined that the verdict rendered by the jury responded to the evidence presented and stated:', '“These jurors took their responsibilities most seriously, and their', 'split verdict, acquitting Antonio Fortes [Tone] while convicting', 'Bruce Moten, demonstrates their careful parsing of the evidence', 'and their assiduous adherence to the [c]ourt’s instructions to weigh', 'the evidence and give each defendant separate attention.', '“* * *', '“The verdict convicting Bruce Moten was absolutely a correct one,', 'and the motion for new trial is denied.” The defendant does not advance any other reason or argument why his motion for a new trial should have been granted.

The Superior Court entered a consent order embodying the terms of the agreement. Sadly, however, the relationship between these neighboring family members did not remain harmonious.', 'Yet another lawsuit was spawned when the defendants fenced the fifteen-foot-wide confines of the easement that was created by the agreement and consent order. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants’ actions stymied their ability to tow boats to and from their dock because they could no longer (1) navigate the “elbow” of the right-of-way or (2) execute a three- point turn at the water’s edge, thereby frustrating the purpose of the consent order and the easement.

Arnold. 5 In 1927, Thomas conveyed Lot 24 on Charlestown Tax Assessor’s Plat 7 to members of his family, creating the so-called “Lighthouse property.” The deed included the following grant:', '“a right of way to shore of Charlestown Pond or Bay, and the', 'facilities of large crib dock and small boat house, and also a right', 'of way to the ocean beach over the land of the Grantor and the', 'privilege of building a small bath house for two families and guest', 'not further than twenty (20) feet south of the large bath house now', 'owned by the Grantor.”', 'At all times relevant to this dispute, plaintiffs owned the Lighthouse property, Lot 24. Lying east and south of the Lighthouse property and separating it from the Charlestown Pond is Lot 23, owned by the Mahony family. South of Lots 23 and 24 and fronting the pond is Lot 31- 2, owned by defendants. The defendants live on the adjoining Lot 31-1. See Appendix (relevant portion of Charlestown Tax Assessor’s Plat 7). 3', 'Unless otherwise noted, we glean the facts from the amended joint statement of undisputed facts and from the written decision of the trial justice. 4', 'As the trial justice in this case so aptly remarked: “I think this case is really sad. It’s a case where people with so much have so little, and they’re playing games and that’s what’s most troubling.” 5', 'Because many of the individuals referenced in this opinion share the same last name, it is necessary to refer to some of them by their first names. We intend no disrespect by doing so.', '-3-', 'Eventually, the scope and nature of the rights conveyed to plaintiffs in the original 1927 easement became the subject of litigation. In 2007, plaintiffs brought suit against the Mahonys, seeking “a declaration giving them the right to pass by foot or vehicle across Lot 23 en route to the Pond on alternative theories of express or prescriptive easement.” Then, in 2008, plaintiffs also sued defendants in a separate action, likewise seeking “a declaration of vehicular access to Charlestown Pond across Lot 31-2 on the same alternative easement theories * * *.” The Mahonys and defendants lodged trespass counterclaims against plaintiffs in those cases. At the heart of both actions was the Lighthouse property’s access to its floating, seasonal dock at the shore of the pond.', 'A justice of the Superior Court (the first trial justice) consolidated the cases, and a nonjury trial commenced on July 26, 2010. On the second day of trial, however, the proceedings were suspended so that the parties could attempt to negotiate a settlement. Over the course of the next three days, the parties and counsel discussed the location and size of plaintiffs’ right-of-way to the pond as well as their dock. The parties and their counsel walked the site to make sure that the evolving terms of a working agreement accurately tracked the field conditions. These negotiations proved fruitful, ultimately resulting in an agreement, and the parties presented the first trial justice with a proposed consent order detailing the agreement’s terms on July 30, 2010. After reviewing the contents of the consent order and polling each party individually to verify his or her assent to the terms of the agreement, the first trial justice approved the settlement. She applauded the parties and counsel for their difficult but successful negotiations, remarking that she had never before “witnessed this long of a settlement process while still potentially retaining the case for trial.” Thereafter, the consent order was entered as an order of the Superior Court.', '-4-', 'B', 'The Consent Order', 'The consent order began:', '“1.', 'This Consent Order shall resolve, declare, and', 'determine for all purposes the presently disputed rights, duties and', 'obligations of the parties with respect to easements (express,', 'implied, or prescriptive) benefiting the real estate now known as', 'Lot 24 * * * over real estate now known as Lot 23 * * * and Lot', '31-2 * * * including but not limited to any and all such easements', 'or rights of way as they relate to Lots 23 and 31-2 as are expressed', 'in that certain 1927 deed from Thomas L. Arnold * * *.” The consent order then created two easements benefiting plaintiffs’ property. 6 The first was the “Pedestrian / Golf Cart Easement,” which would begin at the southern edge of Lot 24 and cross Lot 23, the Mahony property, and could be, under the terms of the easement, accessed by foot or a small vehicle no larger than a golf cart for the purpose of accessing and transporting supplies to the Lighthouse property’s dock.', 'The second, and most important, was the “Launching and Retrieval Easement” across both Lot 23 and Lot 31-2, defendants’ property. The Launching and Retrieval Easement would begin at the southern edge of Lot 24 and cross Lot 23, where it would intersect with the Pedestrian / Golf Cart Easement at the bottom of Lot 23.

Notwithstanding the extensive efforts that they undertook to settle their property dispute, and notwithstanding their pact to amicably resolve future disputes arising out of the settlement without running to court, the owners of Lot 24—plaintiffs—and Lot 31-2— defendants—were back in the Superior Court a mere two years after entering into the consent order. 7 On June 13, 2012, plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging that defendants had constructed a fence along the southern boundary of the fifteen-foot-wide easement on Lot 31-2. 8 According to plaintiffs, as a result of the newly erected fence, they were no longer able to launch and retrieve their boat by using the Launching and Retrieval Easement. Doing so, plaintiffs claimed, required that they have the ability to turn their vehicle around at the shore to get the trailing boat into the water, which thereby required that they temporarily stray beyond the confines of the easement for that limited purpose. The plaintiffs also complained that the fence extended to the elbow of the easement—where it makes a sharp turn at the boundary of Lots 23 and 31-2—and, consequently, a vehicle towing a boat could not traverse that part of the easement. These obstructions, plaintiffs alleged, prevented them from using the Launching and Retrieval Easement for its intended purpose—that is, launching and retrieving their boats. The plaintiffs 7', 'The owners of Lot 23, the Mahonys, were not involved in the 2012 lawsuit. 8', 'The plaintiffs later filed an amended complaint, and defendants responded with an answer to the amended complaint and counterclaim. Therefore, in this opinion, all references to the pleadings are to the amended pleadings.', '-8- stated that they had discussed the issue with defendants, but that their discussions had borne no fruit.', 'That was not the only dispute as to the terms of the consent order that was raised in the complaint. The plaintiffs also claimed that the post-and-chain device that had been installed in 1988, as discussed in § 6(i) of the consent order, had not spanned the entire north-south width of the right-of-way; rather, it left a “courtesy gate” approximately three feet wide on the northern side of the path so that pedestrians could easily walk down to the Lighthouse dock. The plaintiffs alleged that defendants had reinstalled the post-and-chain device in the location permitted by the consent order, but that the new device stretched across the entirety of the easement, thereby preventing pedestrian access without unlocking the chain or ducking under it. The plaintiffs claimed that, when they alerted defendants to this discrepancy, defendants refused to reinstall the courtesy gate.', 'Lastly, there was a dispute regarding the relocated Lighthouse dock itself. The plaintiffs described the Lighthouse dock that existed prior to entry of the consent order as “a floating dock accessed by a ramp secured by two posts roughly four feet high inserted in the ground. These posts also marked the site where the owners of Lot 24 would install the Lighthouse Dock each season.”', 'However, plaintiffs alleged that the posts had disappeared in December 2009. According to plaintiffs, when defendants applied to CRMC for permission to relocate the dock, the plan that they submitted with the application, and which CRMC had approved, neglected to include the dock posts because defendants considered them to be “unsightly.” The plaintiffs alleged that “CRMC considers the omission of these posts on the approved plan as immaterial, and will re-issue the prior dock approval administratively upon production of a plan that shows the posts.” Nevertheless, plaintiffs contended, defendants refused to permit plaintiffs to install', '-9- the dock posts at the terminus of the Launching and Retrieval Easement, and they refused to submit a plan showing the posts for approval by CRMC.', 'In sum, plaintiffs asked the Superior Court to: (1) declare and adjudicate that plaintiffs had the right under the consent order to go beyond the strict fifteen-foot-wide confines of the Launching and Retrieval Easement to turn vehicles around when launching and retrieving boats, and enter a permanent injunction ordering defendants to remove the fence along the perimeter of the easement on Lot 31-2; (2) enter a mandatory permanent injunction ordering defendants to reinstall the courtesy gate for pedestrians that existed with the 1988 post-and-chain device; and (3) declare and adjudicate that plaintiffs had the right to install the dock posts as they existed at the old Lighthouse dock.', 'The defendants filed a counterclaim, alleging that plaintiffs had refused to acknowledge and execute an amended and restated consent order with the final definitive plan, consistent with CRMC’s approval of the relocated Lighthouse dock, attached thereto in accordance with the consent order. Therefore, defendants alleged breach of contract and sought (1) a declaratory judgment in their favor, (2) an injunction requiring plaintiffs to accept the final definitive plan and execute a stipulation of dismissal of the lawsuits giving rise to the consent order, and (3) an award of attorneys’ fees and costs.', 'D', 'The Trial Testimony', 'On July 16, 2014, the case proceeded to a one-day, nonjury trial before a second justice of the Superior Court (the trial justice). James H. Arnold testified for plaintiffs, and Lillian B. Arnold testified for defendants. We summarize those parts of their testimonies that are pertinent to this appeal.', '- 10 -', 'James testified that he has been a seasonal resident at the Lighthouse property for his entire life. He said that, from 1978 until 2010, he helped launch boats at the old Lighthouse dock location. That, he explained, required a vehicle towing a boat trailer to execute a three-point turn to “back the trailer into the water to deposit or pick up the boat.” He said that that was what had occurred every time a boat had been launched. He testified that different vehicles and different boats had been used over the years; the largest hauling vehicle had been an SUV and the smallest a Cub Cadet tractor. At the time of trial, James said that he owned a seventeen-foot boat trailer that was used to haul a fourteen-foot skiff or sailboat.', 'James testified that, before plaintiffs could relocate the Lighthouse dock to the shore at the end of the Launching and Retrieval Easement, defendants installed a wooden fence on Lot 31-2 along the boundary of the easement and right at the location where plaintiffs would need to execute a three-point turn. 9 According to James, the presence of the fence made that task impossible, thus nullifying the benefit of the easement. Further, James said that plaintiffs could not even reach that end part of the easement due to the installation of a chain barrier at the elbow of the easement, where the easement crossed from Lot 23 onto Lot 31-2. James said that, to his knowledge, it was the Mahonys who had installed those chains on the northern side of the easement. The southern side, on defendants’ property, was confined by a wooden fence like that which existed farther down the easement in the area of the dock. Consequently, according to James, plaintiffs’ ability to launch and retrieve boats was completely frustrated because it was not feasible to “get around [that curve] with a vehicle of any sort and a boat trailer.” 9', 'Although parts of James’s testimony refer to a chain barrier first being installed where the three-point turn would be necessary, he clarified that it was indeed a wooden fence that had been placed there eventually. The final definitive plan shows that sections of the perimeter of the Launching and Retrieval Easement are lined by chains and others by a fence. Our review of the record indicates that the disputed three-point-turn location involves the wooden fence.', '- 11 -', 'James testified that he understood the terms of the consent order and that he was present when it was negotiated. Also, he acknowledged that he knew at the time he agreed to the consent order that the fifteen-foot width of the Launching and Retrieval Easement would be inadequate to make the necessary three-point turn. He said that, rather than negotiating for a greater width, he had simply presumed plaintiffs “would continue to do what [they] had done for the previous [thirty-one] years”—namely, go outside the confines of the easement for the purpose of navigating a three-point turn. James testified that he has not used the Launching and Retrieval Easement to launch a boat since defendants erected the wooden fence along the southern bound of the easement.', 'James also discussed the issues of the post-and-chain device and the dock posts. He explained that, prior to entry of the consent order, the device consisted of a chain that was hooked into a tree and extended most of the way across the easement to a post, leaving an open space of a few feet to the side of the post. As a result, people walking down to the dock could go around the chain rather than having to duck under it. According to James, however, after the consent order was entered, defendants extended the post-and-chain device across the entire north-south width of the Launching and Retrieval Easement. James testified that he had not addressed the so-called courtesy gate in the consent order because he was under the impression that the device had to be the same as had existed in the past.', 'With respect to the dock posts, James said that they had existed at the previous Lighthouse dock location from the time the dock was built in 1978 until the posts went missing in 2009. He testified that he had received permission from CRMC to replace them but had never done so. He conceded that, at the time the Lighthouse dock was being relocated in accordance with the consent order, the application that had been submitted to CRMC by defendants, which', '- 12 - he had approved, made no mention of the dock posts. James explained that the posts are necessary so that the ramp that leads to the floating dock can be extended and for the dock to be replaced in its precise location each spring. He said that, without the posts, plaintiffs must leap over the water’s edge to reach the dock at high tide.', 'Lillian, meanwhile, testified that she had lived in or visited the Arnolda section of Charlestown since 1959. At the time of trial, she and her husband, codefendant Thomas Jr., were permanent residents of Charlestown, living in a home on Lot 31-1; they also owned Lot 31-2. Lillian explained that the fifteen-foot width of the Launching and Retrieval Easement was important to defendants during the intensive consent order negotiations because their son planned to build a home on Lot 31-2. According to Lillian, the local zoning ordinance had setback requirements that would require the house to be located near the right-of-way.', 'Lillian acknowledged that she did not recall whether defendants had notified plaintiffs before they erected the fence along the perimeter of the Launching and Retrieval Easement. However, it was her belief that plaintiffs had been aware of it because the fence was depicted on the engineering plan submitted to CRMC. Lillian also discussed the possibilities of using different sized vehicles to launch boats and another option of using a ball-hitch on the front of a vehicle to push boats along the right-of-way, and thereby eliminate the necessity of a three-point turn. Lillian testified that defendants had fulfilled their end of the bargain by clearing the easement area of certain trees and by leveling the ground.', 'With regard to the courtesy gate and dock posts, Lillian maintained that those topics had never been addressed during the course of negotiations, nor were they addressed in the consent order. She further explained that the so-called courtesy gate had never been installed for the benefit of the Lighthouse property owners, and problems with trespassers over the years had', '- 13 - necessitated a chain spanning the entire width of the right-of-way. Lillian also testified about her suspicion that plaintiffs desired to install permanent dock posts in cement, unlike those installed at the original Lighthouse dock. Finally, Lillian attested that, as of June 1, 2010, she had expended approximately $16,600 in legal fees defending against plaintiffs’ suit.', 'E', 'The Decision', 'The trial justice rendered a written decision on May 14, 2015. First, as to the Launching and Retrieval Easement, the trial justice determined that the consent order unambiguously specified the width of the easement and did not provide any exception to its terms. The trial justice found that plaintiffs were aware, when they negotiated and entered into the consent order, that fifteen feet was insufficient space to execute a three-point turn. Nonetheless, they accepted that term based on their assumptions that no fence would be erected and that they would be able to go beyond the agreed-upon confines of the easement to turn around. The trial justice found that the only beneficial width term that plaintiffs were able to successfully negotiate was to increase the cleared space on the easement from eight to ten feet. Thus, giving the terms of the consent order their plain and ordinary meaning, and after reviewing the circumstances surrounding the negotiation of the consent order, the trial justice concluded that the width of the Launching and Retrieval Easement was fifteen feet, ten of which were to remain cleared. Accordingly, the trial justice declared that the easement provided plaintiffs with no authority to go beyond the fifteen-foot right-of-way, and she denied their request for injunctive relief.', 'Second, with respect to the post-and-chain device, the trial justice determined that the consent order was silent with respect to the courtesy gate. The trial justice found that the post- and-chain device permitted by the consent order and the courtesy gate that existed historically', '- 14 - were two different features, and plaintiffs had failed to negotiate for such a gate. Therefore, she concluded that it would be inappropriate for her to consider extrinsic evidence to modify an unambiguous agreement. The trial justice again denied plaintiffs their requested injunctive relief.', 'Third, concerning the dock posts, the trial justice likewise determined that there was no reference to the posts in the consent order and that she was constrained from adding such a term to the agreement. The trial justice found that plaintiffs were put on notice of and given an opportunity to object to the absence of the dock posts in the engineering materials, photograph, and plan submitted to CRMC. In fact, the trial justice found that James had personally presented the CRMC approval letter to the town for the purpose of recording it in the land evidence records. Thus, the trial justice declared, plaintiffs did not have the right to reinstall posts at the relocated floating dock.', 'Finally, regarding defendants’ counterclaim for breach of contract, the trial justice found it to be undisputed that the parties had entered into a valid and binding contract in the form of the consent order. The trial justice thus decided that plaintiffs’ failure to comply with the terms of the consent order—in particular, their refusal to approve the definitive plan, execute an amended and restated consent order, and terminate the previous lawsuits—constituted a breach of contract, and she ordered them to comply therewith. At a subsequent hearing, the trial justice denied defendants an award of attorneys’ fees. The plaintiffs timely appealed, and defendants cross- appealed with respect to the denial of their request for attorneys’ fees.', '- 15 -', 'F', 'The Appeal', 'In this case, we are confronted with the same issues as was the trial justice below: whether plaintiffs have the right under the consent order to (1) stray beyond the express dimensions of the Launching and Retrieval Easement for the purpose of launching and retrieving boats; (2) install dock posts at the relocated Lighthouse dock; and (3) enjoy the benefits of a courtesy gate next to the post-and-chain device. The plaintiffs also raise evidentiary issues concerning the trial justice’s consideration of evidence surrounding the negotiation of the consent order.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Our standard of review in this case is deferential. First, “[w]e accord great deference to the findings of fact of a trial justice sitting without a jury, and will disturb such findings only when the justice misconceives or overlooks material evidence or otherwise is clearly wrong.” Whittemore v. Thompson, 139 A.3d 530, 540 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Granoff Realty II, Limited Partnership v. Rossi, 823 A.2d 296, 298 (R.I. 2003)). Moreover, “[w]hen the Superior Court exercises its discretion to issue * * * a [declaratory] judgment, its decision should remain untouched on appeal unless the court improperly exercised its discretion or otherwise abused its authority.” Sullivan v. Chafee, 703 A.2d 748, 751 (R.I. 1997). And, in a similar vein, “a decision to grant or deny injunctive relief is discretionary in nature, and such a decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of abuse of discretion or error of law.” Rose Nulman Park Foundation ex rel. Nulman v. Four Twenty Corp., 93 A.3d 25, 28 (R.I. 2014) (quoting North End Realty, LLC v.

Of course, “whether a contract is clear and unambiguous is a question of law.” Id. (quoting Beacon Mutual Insurance Co., 11 A.3d at 648). And if “a contract is determined to be clear and unambiguous, then the meaning of its terms constitute[s] a question of law” as well. Id. (quoting Young v. Warwick Rollermagic Skating Center, Inc., 973 A.2d 553, 558 (R.I. 2009)). We have said that “[a]lthough [a consent order] receives a court’s imprimatur, [it] is in essence a contract and therefore must be construed as a contract * * *.” Vanderheiden v.

Here, then, we will consider de novo whether the consent order was clear and unambiguous and, if so, the meaning of its terms.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Evidentiary Issues', 'Before we begin our de novo review of whether or not the consent order was ambiguous, we first must address plaintiffs’ argument that the trial justice erroneously admitted and considered certain irrelevant evidence. The contested evidence revolves around (1) the length and intensity of the negotiations that resulted in the consent order and (2) defendants’ subjective reasons for insisting on the width of the Launching and Retrieval Easement.', 'We can easily dispatch the second of those perceived errors. Our review of the trial justice’s decision makes abundantly clear that she never, as plaintiffs allege, “relied” on', '- 17 - defendants’ intent to limit the easement to fifteen feet wide. Indeed, the only mention of subjective intent is contained within the trial justice’s recitation of the trial testimony. The trial justice simply recited Lillian’s testimony that defendants’ son planned to build a house on Lot 31-2 near the easement and thus needed to confine its bounds as far as possible.', 'Furthermore, we are equally convinced that the trial justice’s apparent consideration of the length and intensity of the parties’ settlement negotiations was not reversible error. The plaintiffs suggest that that evidence was not relevant. But it is fundamental that, “[w]hen sitting without a jury, a trial justice is vested with broad discretion to hear evidence [and] pass on the merits of a claim * * *.” Connecticut Valley Homes of East Lyme, Inc. v.

Viewing the agreement in its entirety, and giving its language its plain, ordinary, and usual meaning, the consent order is not reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation. See W.P. Associates, 637 A.2d at 356. It is detailed and organized, employs clear and articulate wording, defines dimensions, refers to external sources with the utmost specificity, and is generally well-drafted and thorough. It contains no sections that are confusing, internally inconsistent, or that simply do not make sense. The agreement speaks for itself.', 'Additionally, the parties’ intent in entering into the consent order is manifestly expressed therein. The agreement begins by explicitly setting forth its purpose: to “resolve, declare, and determine for all purposes the presently disputed rights, duties and obligations of the parties with respect to easements * * * benefiting the real estate now known as Lot 24 * * * over real estate now known as Lot 23 * * * and Lot 31-2 * * *.” The consent order then proceeds to lay out the terms of the parties’ agreement as to each disputed right, duty, and obligation pertaining to those easements.', 'However, the parties disagree as to the meaning of three particular terms contained in the consent order. We will apply de novo review to those terms. Bucci, 68 A.3d at 1078. If we “find[] that the terms of an agreement are clear and unambiguous, the task of judicial', '- 19 - construction is at an end and the agreement must be applied as written.” W.P. Associates, 637 A.2d at 356.', '1', 'The Launching and Retrieval Easement', 'The first disputed term of the consent order concerns the Launching and Retrieval Easement. According to plaintiffs, the purpose of that section of the consent order was to establish an easement by which plaintiffs can launch and retrieve boats, and therefore it is in fatal conflict with the fifteen-foot-width provision contained therein. The plaintiffs argue that, in such a case of conflict, the express purpose of the Launching and Retrieval Easement prevails over its dimensions. The defendants disagree, maintaining that there is no conflict and that the consent order is unambiguous as to the width of the easement.', 'The plaintiffs are correct in their assertion that the intent of the parties must control if the purpose of the agreement is clear from its terms. See Haffenreffer v. Haffenreffer, 994 A.2d 1226, 1233 (R.I. 2010); W.P. Associates, 637 A.2d at 356; Hill v. M.S. Alper & Son, Inc., 106 R.I. 38, 47, 256 A.2d 10, 15 (1969). Where plaintiffs go astray, however, is in their assertion that the intent of the parties in agreeing to the terms of the consent order was for plaintiffs to have the ability to launch and retrieve boats. The clear and unequivocal purpose of the consent order was to resolve all disputes between the parties arising out of any purported easement rights. The creation of the Launching and Retrieval Easement was but one term contained in that entire agreement. The purpose of the consent order was not, therefore, for plaintiffs to be able to launch and retrieve boats, and that is not the intent to which we are tasked with giving effect. To be sure, one dispute that was resolved in the parties’ settlement agreement centered on their respective rights as to the Launching and Retrieval Easement. But it is our task to look to the', '- 20 - intent underlying the entire agreement, and not one isolated section of it. See Colonial Penn Insurance Company v. Mendozzi, 488 A.2d 734, 736 (R.I. 1985) (“[I]n [carrying out our primary task of] ascertaining the intent [of the parties], we must look at the instrument as a whole and not at some detached portion thereof.” (quoting Woonsocket Teachers’ Guild, Local 951 v. School Committee of Woonsocket, 117 R.I. 373, 376, 367 A.2d 203, 205 (1976))).', 'As further support for their purpose-trumps-conflicting-provision argument, plaintiffs rely on this Court’s opinion in Carpenter v. Hanslin, 900 A.2d 1136 (R.I. 2006). However, that reliance is unavailing. In Carpenter, this Court adopted the trial justice’s decision. Carpenter, 900 A.2d at 1141-42. The plaintiffs now point to that trial justice’s ruling that “[i]ncidental and occasional use of property to the south of the right-of-way to accommodate the safe turning around of vehicles—but not parking, standing, loading or unloading—must be allowed.” Id. at 1149. But we cannot simply isolate that quote to afford plaintiffs the relief they seek. The factual and procedural underpinnings of Carpenter are key, and they are markedly distinguishable from what occurred in the matter before us.', 'In Carpenter, over the course of a three-day bench trial, the parties sought declarations concerning a disputed right-of-way to a pond where the “grantor * * * did not have a correct understanding as to the location of his property boundary and the rights-of-way he established in reference to the boundary * * *.” Carpenter, 900 A.2d at 1144, 1145. Not only that, but also the characteristics of the land itself had evolved since the original grant. Id. at 1145, 1146. It was clear to the trial justice that the grantor had intended for the grantees to enjoy vehicular access to the pond. Id. at 1145, 1148. Yet, whether because of the grantor’s incorrect presumptions or the since-altered terrain, the trial justice found that it was not possible for vehicles to traverse the right-of-way. Id. at 1149. In permitting the grantees to access that part of the property that', '- 21 - would make such vehicular travel possible, the trial justice found it to be “only reasonable that the operators of such vehicles be allowed to safely turn around after passage on the right-of-way * * *.” Id. Therefore, the trial justice allowed for “[i]ncidental and occasional use of property to the south of the right-of-way to accommodate the safe turning around of vehicles * * *.” Id.', 'Here, on the other hand, we are not confronted with such a daunting task. The parties were able to forgo a similarly challenging trial by reaching a settlement. In fact, in approving the terms of the consent order, the first trial justice remarked:', '“First of all, my compliments to all of you and all of the attorneys', 'that have worked diligently on crafting this resolution as well as all', 'of you as family members and parties. I indicated to counsel after', 'the first two days of trial in this matter that I felt that a solution', 'could better be crafted by the parties than by the Court, not only', 'because in ruling on a matter such as this there is risk to all of the', 'parties that the decision I make may not be one that’s acceptable', 'but, furthermore, often in crafting a resolution, you can address', 'issues in a way that go[es] beyond even what the Court is asked to', 'do and resolve matters more fully and I believe, after reviewing the', 'consent order, that that’s exactly what has happened in this case.” It is for that very reason that we are reviewing the consent order as a contract, and not as an easement, which was the situation faced by the trial justice in Carpenter. The parties here reached an agreement to resolve their dispute; they, with counsel, walked the property and engaged in lengthy, intensive negotiations to craft a resolution that was acceptable to both plaintiffs and defendants. That resolution was memorialized in a writing that was particular and precise. The plaintiffs now seek to avoid the plain terms of the very agreement that they negotiated and willingly entered into by asking this Court to allow them to go beyond the specified fifteen-foot width of the Launching and Retrieval Easement, as the trial justice did in Carpenter. We will not do so. The consent order is a contract, and its terms with respect to the width of the easement are clear and unambiguous.', '- 22 -', 'The plaintiffs also seem to argue that the consent order was infected by a latent ambiguity as to the width of the Launching and Retrieval Easement, and that it was not until after they entered into the consent order and then tried to tow their fourteen-foot boat on an even longer trailer, attached to an SUV, that they discovered the conflict between their ability to launch and retrieve boats and the specific fifteen-foot confines of the easement. In that sense, both parties cite to extrinsic evidence about the historical use of the easement, the types of boats and vehicles that had been used, and whether other methods of transporting a boat might be successful within the parameters of the right-of-way. Here, however, we give great weight to the finding of the trial justice that plaintiffs were aware at the time they agreed to the consent order that fifteen feet was an insufficient amount of space to execute a three-point turn but that they agreed to that limitation anyway, based on a presumption that they would be permitted to go beyond those parameters. The record does not support the notion that any ambiguity developed after entry of the consent order. Therefore, we need not delve into the wide world of boat-towing-versus- pushing, front-versus-rear-ball-hitch, and tractor-versus-truck hypotheticals raised by the parties. See Botelho v. City of Pawtucket School Department, 130 A.3d 172, 176-77 (R.I. 2016) (“[I]n situations in which the language of a contractual agreement is plain and unambiguous, its meaning should be determined without reference to extrinsic facts or aids.” (quoting JPL Livery Services, Inc. v. Rhode Island Department of Administration, 88 A.3d 1134, 1142 (R.I. 2014))).', 'We are of the firm opinion that the section of the consent order that established the Launching and Retrieval Easement is clear and unambiguous. We thus have “no reason not to accept the [consent order] and apply it at face value.” Young, 973 A.2d at 559. The width provision of the consent order is as clear as day: The easement shall be fifteen feet wide. In erecting a fence at that fifteen-foot boundary, on their own property, defendants were simply', '- 23 - asserting their own rights under the consent order. Perhaps that was a petty gesture—a classic “gotcha” maneuver, as plaintiffs see it. But the point remains: The agreement is clear and each side negotiated it with eyes wide open. See Rivera v. Gagnon, 847 A.2d 280, 285 (R.I. 2004) (“It is a basic tenet of contract law that the contracting parties can make as good a deal or as bad a deal as they see fit * * *.” (quoting Durfee v.

Our de novo review of that section of the consent order, however, leads us to the very same conclusion that was reached by the trial justice. The consent order is plain and unambiguous as to its allowance of a specific post-and-chain device in a particular location. The so-called courtesy gate—in other words, space left open to the side of the post- and-chain device, not a feature of the device itself—may have existed in a previous arrangement, but the agreement at issue, specific as it may be, is simply silent as to that point. We cannot add that term to this contract. See Young, 973 A.2d at 559-60.', '3', 'The Dock Posts', 'Lastly, we reach the same conclusion with respect to the third disputed term, the dock posts. The consent order clearly and unambiguously lays out the process for the parties to follow and describes their respective duties in attempting to obtain CRMC approval to relocate the', '- 24 - Lighthouse dock. All that is mentioned in the agreement is the relocation of the floating dock itself; there is no reference whatsoever to tall, permanent dock posts that would be entrenched on shore. The plaintiffs have no one to fault but themselves for not including the dock posts in—or noticing they were missing from—the materials submitted to CRMC for approval.', 'It was incumbent upon plaintiffs, if the posts were important to them, to at least demand their inclusion in the CRMC materials, if not in the consent order itself.', 'C', 'Attorneys’ Fees', 'The defendants have cross-appealed from the trial justice’s denial of their request for attorneys’ fees. This Court “staunch[ly] adhere[s] to the ‘American rule’ that requires each litigant to pay its own attorney’s fees absent statutory authority or contractual liability.” Danforth v. More, 129 A.3d 63, 72 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Shine v. Moreau, 119 A.3d 1, 8 (R.I. 2015)). In arguing, then, for an award of attorneys’ fees in their favor, defendants claim both statutory authority and contractual liability.', '“[T]he issue of whether there exists a basis for awarding attorneys’ fees generally is legal in nature, and therefore our review of such a ruling is de novo.” Danforth, 129 A.3d at 72 (quoting Shine, 119 A.3d at 8). “If it is determined that there is an adequate legal basis for such an award, then we review a trial justice’s decision awarding or denying attorneys’ fees for an abuse of discretion.” Id.', 'Certainly, G.L. 1956 § 9-1-45 might provide a basis for awarding attorneys’ fees in this case.

The defendants did prevail in a civil action arising from a breach of contract; the trial justice thus had statutory authority to award attorneys’ fees to defendants if, within her considerable discretion, she determined that they were warranted. 10 However, she made no such award.', 'We review that denial for an abuse of discretion, “remain[ing] mindful that the decision to grant or deny attorney’s fees is vested within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Danforth, 129 A.3d at 72.', '“In light of [that] discretion[,] * * * we need not loiter long over this assignment of error.” Danforth, 129 A.3d at 72. The trial justice noted that the plaintiffs had conducted themselves the same way from 1978 until 2010: “[H]e would take the boat, attach the boat trailer to his car, travel down this right-of-way to the water, conduct a three-point turn, * * * put the boat in the water, and then haul it out.” In that sense, the trial justice observed, “[W]hy wouldn’t he have expected that he would[] be able to continue that? And now there[] [are] fences.” Therefore, the trial justice found that, even though the plaintiffs did not prevail, there was a justiciable issue, and she denied the defendants an award of attorneys’ fees. We can see no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s ruling, and thus decline to disturb it.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be returned to that tribunal. 10', 'The defendants also argue that the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9, provides a statutory basis for such an award, but this Court has never once held that “costs” under § 9-30-10 include attorneys’ fees. And finally, defendants argue that, because the trial justice found plaintiffs to be in breach of the contract, § 18 of the consent order is a source of contractual liability that provides a basis for awarding attorneys’ fees. We have even graver reservations about whether the “sanctions” contemplated by the consent order encompass attorneys’ fees. Nonetheless, we give great deference to the trial justice’s ultimate decision to deny defendants fees in this case, and we discern no abuse of discretion.', '- 26 - AppendixSTATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET', 'James H.

7,State : v. : Curtis Maxie. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Curtis Maxie, appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury found him guilty of three counts of first-degree sexual assault, one count of sex trafficking of a minor, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of a minor. On appeal, the defendant challenges his convictions on count 4, sex trafficking of a minor in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-67-6, and count 6, conspiring to do so. He argues that § 11- 67-6, which has since been repealed, was fatally defective because it failed to state a crime. The defendant further contends that count 4 was duplicitous, depriving him of fair notice of the charge against him.', 'Finally, the defendant maintains that certain evidence of uncharged misconduct should have been excluded from his trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of conviction with respect to counts 4 and 6 and affirm the judgment in all other respects.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Emily, the victim in this story, endured a tumultuous childhood marked by abusive, if not absent, biological parents. 1 She was adopted by her aunt and uncle, but that did not put an end to her troubles. In that home as well, Emily was also abused and neglected. It should come as no surprise, then, that Emily was prone to running away from home. That tendency, coupled with her penchant for fighting, led to her placement in a behavioral school and contacts with the Family Court. In April 2014, at the age of sixteen, Emily ran away from home once again. This time, however, the story took an even darker turn.', 'With nowhere to go, Emily ended up at the home of her friend’s mother in Providence. Emily and that woman had smoked marijuana together previously, and Emily enjoyed her company. When Emily arrived, her friend was not at home, but his twenty-year-old brother, Marquis Melia, was present. After Emily spent the night there, Melia convinced her to go with him to Pawtucket to smoke with his friend. As it turned out, that friend was defendant.', 'Melia referred to the nearly sixty-year-old defendant as “Pimp.” Late at night on April 16, 2014—the night Emily arrived at Melia’s mother’s house—Melia sent the following text message to defendant: “Hey pimp I got a fresh catch all american white g[i]rl 18.” Sitting on the couch, Emily could actually see Melia typing the message and could make out the words “fresh catch” in the text, but she was in the dark as to what that meant. Sadly, she would soon find out.', 'As Melia would later testify, defendant’s interest was immediately piqued by the prospect of a “fresh catch.” Melia knew “[100] percent” that that would be the case. He also knew that, 1', 'We use a pseudonym to protect the privacy of the minor victim.', '-2- with defendant’s help and expertise, they would be able to “put [Emily] to work” “[h]aving sex with men for money.” Just moments after receiving Melia’s text message, defendant began pressuring Melia to bring Emily to his home that very night, despite the late hour. When Melia resisted, saying that it was too late to take a bus but that they would be there the next day, defendant offered to pay for a cab. But when Melia would not heed that suggestion because Emily wanted to sleep, defendant offered his outlook: “F**k what she want. Get the b***h in the cab before you won’t have a b***h [in] the morning to do any fool.” Melia reassured defendant that he would get Emily there the next day and “have her ready to go.” By that, Melia meant that they would “take pics and post” them to Backpage. 2', 'The defendant was eager. Early the next morning, April 17, defendant sent a text message to Melia that he was ready to take pictures of Emily. As Melia knew, defendant had “some nylons and high heels for all of them, for all the women he had over there and he would snap pictures in his bedroom while they were on his bed posing.” Melia responded that he and Emily would be over by noon and that “she ready.” In fact, she was not ready for what was in 2', 'As a result of heinous crimes arising out of transactions on that website, this Court has twice had occasion to discuss Backpage: it was “a classified advertising website where individuals [could] list a variety of products and services. Until January 2017, Backpage included an adult section containing different subcategories of various sex work professions, including escorts and strippers.” State v. Tejeda, 171 A.3d 983, 987 n.1 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Adams, 161 A.3d 1182, 1187 n.1 (R.I. 2017)). Recently, federal authorities seized the website, which had been long accused of enabling prostitution and sex trafficking of minors, took it offline, and indicted the company’s top executives on a variety of charges. The chief executive of Backpage pleaded guilty in California and Texas state courts and in federal court in Arizona to money laundering and conspiracy to facilitate prostitution, and he pled guilty to human trafficking on behalf of the company. As part of his plea agreement, he agreed to testify against other company officials and to take down every Backpage website. See Charlie Savage & Timothy Williams, U.S. Seizes Website Accused in Sex Trafficking, N.Y.

When they arrived at defendant’s house, Emily thought defendant was nice and respectful, but that would soon change. The defendant sent Melia on an errand to buy a “Vanilla card,” which is, in essence, a prepaid credit card—it is purchased with cash, and then it can be used without being traced. There was a charge to post an advertisement on Backpage, so when the ad concerned illicit activity, anonymity was crucial, and defendant was no novice. Unfortunately, however, Melia was. It took two trips to the store before Melia purchased the correct card.', 'Meanwhile, Emily was left alone with defendant. The two were on the couch when defendant pulled Emily by her arm toward him and removed her clothing. The defendant lay down on top of Emily and removed her underwear. All the while, she was telling him to stop. He did not. Instead, defendant proceeded to remove his own clothing. He told Emily that he needed to see if she was “[g]irlfriend experience.”', 'The defendant then penetrated Emily vaginally, ignoring her pleas to stop and overpowering her pushes on his chest. 3 But that was not enough for defendant. The defendant said he needed to “try [Emily] out” in all ways. So he grabbed her head and penetrated her orally as well. 4', 'Soon, Melia returned from his first foray at the store. After Emily answered the door, she pulled Melia into the hallway, slapped him in the face, and told him, “I feel violated.”', 'He responded: “We have to finish what we came here for.”', 'When Melia returned from his second trip to the store, he noticed that Emily looked sad and was wearing high heels. The defendant was sitting at his computer, and Melia could see that 3', 'This act formed the basis for the first count of first-degree sexual assault. 4', 'This act formed the basis for the second count of first-degree sexual assault.', '-4- he had already taken pictures of Emily posing in high heels, a bra, and underwear.', 'The defendant had his phone plugged in to his laptop, uploading the pictures and “cropping them, making them perfect for the ad” on Backpage. In no time, the ad was posted by defendant. It contained pictures of Emily with a caption listing a fake name and her height and weight and claiming that she was “new to the area and looking for a few good men to spend some quality time with[,]” and “guaranteed to please.” The ad then listed two phone numbers: defendant’s and Melia’s. The two had made an agreement that they would evenly split any money they made from selling Emily’s services each day.', 'Mere minutes after the ad went up on Backpage, “men looking for sex” started calling on each of their phones. The defendant would hand the phone to Emily to answer their calls. He also provided her with a script, listing directions to his house and the sexual acts that she would offer to perform, with corresponding prices. The defendant instructed Emily to relieve the men of their money as soon as they walked through the door. “At least five or six” men showed up the first day.', 'That first night, defendant fell asleep in the living room, so Melia and Emily took defendant’s bedroom. At almost two o’clock in the morning on April 18, Melia received a text message from defendant: “Hey Mark how you know that I didn’t want to sleep in my bed. Damn you could have asked. Anyway, tell baby I need to f**k real fast. Then you[] guys can have the bed. Mark, I need to f**k.” Melia then got up and told Emily he was going to take a shower. All of a sudden, defendant entered the bedroom and got on top of Emily, who was lying in bed in a t-shirt and underwear. Emily resisted again, telling defendant to stop and pushing on his chest.', '-5- But again, she could not stop him. The defendant pulled Emily’s underwear to the side and penetrated her. 5', 'The next day, defendant put Emily back to work. Whenever a man showed up, Emily would answer the door. The defendant and Melia would then hide in the back hallway. The defendant taught Emily to take the man’s money, bring him into the bedroom, put the money in a bedside drawer, and then perform whatever sexual act the man had purchased. Meanwhile, defendant and Melia were listening, and they could hear when the man left.', 'In between customers, defendant would enter the bedroom, take the money, and change the sheets. Then it would happen all over again, upwards of fifteen times per day in Emily’s estimation.', 'However, things did not go according to plan for Melia. Almost immediately, Melia and defendant started to argue over the money. According to Melia, the pair was supposed to share the earnings on a daily basis, but Melia never saw a cent.', 'When Melia confronted him, defendant became possessive: “This b***h is going to get me my money[.]” At that point, Melia had had enough, and he decided to leave. But defendant would not let Emily leave with him.', 'As a result, the horrors continued for Emily. At some point, a first-time customer, closer in age to Emily, a nineteen-year-old named Jeremy, appeared to be Emily’s savior. He told her he had a place for her to stay and that he would buy her food and clothes. He returned to defendant’s house to see Emily a second time, and then a third time. That last visit, Emily left with Jeremy. She escaped out the front door with him once defendant went to wait in the back hallway, thinking it was just another customer. Realizing what was happening, defendant ran outside, screaming, “What are you doing with my girl?” Nevertheless, Emily was able to get away. She and Jeremy traveled to Massachusetts. 5', 'This act formed the basis for the third count of first-degree sexual assault.', '-6-', 'But Jeremy turned out to be no savior. Emily said that he started off treating her “[r]espectfully.” He even brought her to a movie, the first one she had seen in a theater. Soon enough, though, Jeremy told Emily that “he wanted [her] to make him some money”—in other words, to do what she had been doing for defendant. When Emily would not oblige, Jeremy sent a text message to defendant, saying that Emily wanted to come back. He then drove her to defendant’s house and simply dropped her off at the front door.', 'Immediately, things picked up where they had left off. The exact same protocol was followed for every customer, and defendant continued to provide condoms, lubricant, clothing, and food for Emily. In the meantime, defendant had also broadened his enterprise and found himself another girl, Brooklyn. The fact that defendant had two girls operating out of the same one-bedroom apartment quickly became problematic. On April 24, around 3:45 in the afternoon, defendant texted Brooklyn that Emily was “still with the date[.]” Brooklyn responded, “Yes, and my hundred dollar date is here. WTF.” However, the scheduling problem did not continue.', 'That is so because, on that very same night, there was a knock at defendant’s door. Thinking it was a customer, Emily opened it. To her surprise, standing in the doorway were two uniformed police officers. Emily’s parents had reported to the Pawtucket police that she had run away weeks earlier and that someone had informed them that he had seen Emily’s ad on Backpage. When Emily answered the door, she was frightened and gave the officers a false name. But the officers persisted because she matched the description of the runaway child; eventually she was forthright as to her identity. Emily was placed into custody as a result of an outstanding Family Court bench warrant. Brooklyn, too, was arrested for drug possession and placed in a police car. At that point, alone in defendant’s apartment with one of the responding officers, Emily stated that defendant had been prostituting her.', '-7-', 'At the Pawtucket police station, Emily was interviewed by a detective. She identified a photograph of defendant, and told the detective that defendant was the man who had been prostituting her and who had sexually assaulted her. After the interview, Emily was brought to the hospital for examination. Meanwhile, around two o’clock in the morning, several officers again converged on defendant’s apartment. There was no response to their knocks, but they could hear a female crying inside. Fearing that the woman was being held against her will, the officers forced the door open. Inside, they found defendant and a woman; defendant was arrested.', 'On June 18, 2014, a grand jury indicted defendant on three counts of first-degree sexual assault (counts 1, 2, and 3), one count of sex trafficking of a minor (count 4), and one count of conspiring with Melia to commit the crime of sex trafficking of a minor (count 6). 6 He was then served with a habitual offender notice. The defendant moved to dismiss counts 4 and 6, the charges of sex trafficking of a minor and conspiracy, on the ground that the statute that he was charged with violating, § 11-67-6, was fatally flawed in that it failed to properly state a crime. After the motion was denied, the case proceeded to trial.', 'At trial, the state offered evidence that demonstrated that defendant had not allowed incarceration to bring a halt to his money-making endeavors. Approximately five months after his arrest, while he was being held at the Adult Correctional Institutions awaiting trial, defendant made several recorded telephone calls. On those calls, he could be heard bragging that he would “get outta” prison given the weakness of the state’s case: “[A]ll they doin is gettin[g] these 6', 'Melia was also indicted as a co-defendant on one count of sex trafficking of a minor and one count of conspiracy with defendant. He entered into a plea agreement with the state in exchange for his cooperation and testimony against defendant. On the charge of sex trafficking of a minor, Melia was sentenced to fifteen years at the ACI, with five to serve and the remainder suspended with probation; on the conspiracy charge, he received a concurrent ten-year sentence, again with five years to serve and the remainder suspended with probation.', '-8- girlfriends that I had over my house criminating themselves they ain’t never busted no date over my house with them girls”; “there ain’t no case if * * * you ain’t got the clientele”; and “[w]hy would they want to come to [c]ourt and * * * say they been over my house and spent money.” So, defendant said, he was planning to “be home a lot sooner than people think[.]” But, as the recordings reveal, being in prison had really hampered defendant’s ability to earn money. First, he asked how the newest “fresh catch” was “standing up[.]” He then carried on about his craving to “move” a girl from in prison: “I gotta have somebody, I gotta have somebody trying to stack some kind of money for me * * * no bulls**t. You know? Pimping in the joint man!” The recording reveals that defendant found that remark to be humorous, repeating his brilliant idea and laughing. The defendant boasted that, if he was not incarcerated, he would “be moving b****es like crazy right now.”', 'The defendant was convicted on all counts. He was sentenced to forty-five years at the ACI on each of the three counts of first-degree sexual assault, all to run concurrently; the maximum forty years’ imprisonment on count 4, sex trafficking of a minor, to run consecutive to the sentences for the sexual-assault counts; ten years in prison for the conspiracy count (count 6), concurrent to the sentence for count 4; and an additional fifteen-year sentence as a habitual offender, consecutive to the sentences imposed on all counts.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, defendant claims the following errors. First, he argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to dismiss counts 4 and 6 of the indictment. The defendant argues that his motion should have been granted because (1) the statute under which he was charged, § 11-67-6, failed to state a crime and (2) count 4, which he asserts merely parroted the', '-9- plethora of verbs set forth in § 11-67-6, was duplicitous and denied him adequate notice of the criminal act he committed. 7 Second, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to pass after Melia remarked while testifying that defendant “ran a prostitution sting right out of his apartment” and that defendant had a “long history” with prostitution.', 'Finally, defendant avers that the trial justice erred in admitting the recordings of certain telephone conversations he had had while he was being confined awaiting trial. He argues that those recordings were (1) irrelevant to the crimes with which he was charged, (2) improperly admitted as character evidence under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and (3) should have been excluded under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence because they were unduly prejudicial.', 'A', 'The Motion to Dismiss', 'Count 4 of the indictment charged:', '“That [defendant] * * * on or about day or date between the 2nd', 'day of April, 2014 and the 24th day of April, 2014, exact day and', 'date unknown to the Grand Jurors, in the City of Pawtucket, in the', 'County of Providence, did recruit, employ, entice, solicit, isolate,', 'harbor, transport, provide, persuade, obtain, or maintain [Emily], a', 'minor, for the purposes of commercial sex acts, in violation of', '§ 11-67-6 of the General Laws of Rhode Island, 1956, as amended', '(Reenactment of 2002).” Count 6 of the indictment further charged defendant with conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of a minor. Section 11-67-6, which has since been repealed, provided, in pertinent part, that: 7', '“The term ‘duplicity’ refers to the joining of two or more offenses, however numerous, in a single count of an indictment.” State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1253 (R.I. 1998). As we have explained, one of the dangers of duplicity is that “[i]f an indictment is duplicitous, a general verdict of guilty will not reveal whether the jury found defendant guilty of only one crime and not the other, or guilty of both.” State v. Thibedau, 157 A.3d 1063, 1077-78 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Saluter, 715 A.2d at 1253).', '- 10 -', '“(b) Any person who:', '“(1) Recruits, employs, entices, solicits, isolates, harbors,', 'transports, provides, persuades, obtains, or maintains, or so', 'attempts, any minor for the purposes of commercial sex acts; or', '“(2) Sells or purchases a minor for the purposes of commercial sex', 'acts; or', '“(3) Benefits, financially or by receiving anything of value, from', 'participation in a venture which has engaged in an act described in', 'subdivision (1) or (2); or', '“(c) Every person who shall commit sex trafficking of a minor,', 'shall be guilty of a felony and subject to not more than forty (40)', 'years imprisonment or a fine of up to forty thousand dollars', '($40,000), or both.”', 'As noted above, before trial, defendant moved to dismiss counts 4 and 6 pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The defendant argued to the trial justice that those counts should be dismissed because they were based on a violation of § 11-67- 6, a statute that he asseverated did not actually state a criminal offense. In defendant’s view, the statute contained a gap between subsections (b) and (c) wherein the conduct described should have been defined as a crime, and, because it was not so defined, § 11-67-6 did not actually set forth a crime. The trial justice, however, disagreed. Employing the canon of construction that statutes of the same subject matter should be harmonized and read together, the trial justice turned to § 11-67-3 for guidance and concluded that it was clear that the General Assembly intended to criminalize sex trafficking of a minor, despite the failure of § 11-67-6 to explicitly say so. 8 In the trial justice’s view, § 11-67-6 was ambiguous and not, as defendant had argued, without force and effect; therefore, she denied defendant’s motion to dismiss. 9 8', 'Unlike G.L. 1956 § 11-67-6, § 11-67-3—which generally criminalized sex trafficking of all persons, not just sex trafficking of minors—did not contain a gap. Section 11-67-3, which also has since been repealed, stated that:', '“Whoever knowingly:', '“(a) Recruits, entices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by', 'any means, or attempts to recruit, entice, harbor, transport[,]', '- 11 -', 'On appeal, defendant’s central argument is that count 4 of the indictment, which charged him with violating § 11-67-6, should have been dismissed under Rule 12(b)(2) because of the glaring infirmities of the statute. For that same reason, he argues that count 6 of the indictment, which charged him with conspiring to commit sex trafficking of a minor, should also have been dismissed because, in his view, there can be no conspiracy without an underlying crime. Whether § 11-67-6 encompasses a crime is a question of law that we review de novo. State ex rel. Town of Tiverton v. Pelletier, 174 A.3d 713, 718 (R.I. 2017) (stating that “questions implicating statutory interpretation are questions of law and are, therefore, reviewed de novo by this Court”).', 'In 2009, the General Assembly amended chapter 67 of title 11, enacting P.L. 2009, ch. 188 and P.L. 2009, ch. 192.

Therefore, as written, § 11-67-6 contained a definitional section, a section describing various conduct, a penalty section, and two other sections relating to obstruction and knowledge of the victim’s age. The defendant’s issue is with the section that describes conduct, subsection (b).', 'In between subsections (b) and (c), there is something obviously missing. The parties have referred to this as the “hanging or.” In subsection (b), there is a description of conduct, the', '- 13 - conduct which defendant was charged with committing in this case. 10 However, after the so- called “hanging or” in subsection (b), § 11-67-6 jumps to subsection (c), the penalty section. What this case ultimately centers on is what this Court is empowered to do about that gap.', 'The defendant contends that the language missing from the statute—language stating that the conduct described therein amounts to the crime of sex trafficking of a minor—renders it fatally flawed. He suggests that it was necessary for the General Assembly to have included language in § 11-67-6 to the effect of “shall be guilty of the felony of sex trafficking of a minor.” Thus, defendant maintains that, without words to that effect, § 11-67-6 lacks the force of law. The defendant further argues that if, as the trial justice ruled, the gap in § 11-67-6 renders its statutory language ambiguous, this Court should apply the rule of lenity and construe its terms narrowly and in his favor.', 'On the other hand, the state argues that the statute, while admittedly awkwardly drafted, is not so deficient as to render it unenforceable. Relying on the fact that § 11-67-6 contains a penalty section, the state avers that the statute clearly and unambiguously states a crime—that is, sex trafficking of a minor. Alternatively, the state contends that, if we consider § 11-67-6 to be ambiguous, then we, as the trial justice did, should employ the tools of statutory construction to effectuate what was the plain intent of the General Assembly in enacting § 11-67-6: to criminalize sex trafficking of a minor.', 'Generally, where the language of “a statute is susceptible of more than one reasonable meaning[,]” it is ambiguous. Drs. Pass and Bertherman, Inc. v. Neighborhood Health Plan of 10', 'Specifically, as delineated in the bill of particulars, the state alleged that defendant violated § 11-67-6 by recruiting, employing, enticing, soliciting, isolating, harboring, transporting, providing, persuading, obtaining, or maintaining Emily for the purpose of commercial sex acts. Before trial, the state agreed to eliminate the terms “persuade” and “obtain” from the jury instructions.', '- 14 - Rhode Island, 31 A.3d 1263, 1269 (R.I. 2011). And, when confronted with ambiguous statutory language, we turn to our familiar tools of statutory construction in an effort to effectuate the intent of the General Assembly. In re Proposed Town of New Shoreham Project, 25 A.3d 482, 505 (R.I. 2011). Here, however, there is no ambiguity, no language that is susceptible of more than one reasonable meaning, no language to construe. The gap after the “hanging or” in § 11- 67-6(b) is a statutory flaw that cannot be repaired without the addition of language that criminalizes the conduct described in the statute, a task that goes beyond statutory construction and strays into the realm of statutory draftsmanship. Therefore, we are compelled to conclude that § 11-67-6 failed to state a crime, and that defendant’s motion to dismiss counts 4 and 6 of the indictment should have been granted.', 'There is no doubt that, subject to constitutional limitations, the General Assembly is vested with immense power to define criminal offenses. State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1255 (R.I. 1998); Hazard v. Howard, 110 R.I. 107, 111, 290 A.2d 603, 606 (1972); State v. Jorjorian, 82 R.I. 334, 339, 107 A.2d 468, 470-71 (1954). As we said long ago,', '“[i]t is well settled that the legislature has the right of control in all', 'matters affecting the public safety, morals, health and welfare, on', 'the ground that such exercise of power falls within the police', 'power of the State, which is vested exclusively in the legislative', 'branch of the State government. A power of such broad and', 'varying scope is also incapable of exact definition.” Creditors’', 'Service Corp. v. Cummings, 57 R.I. 291, 303, 190 A. 2, 10 (1937). Nonetheless, while the Legislature’s power to define crimes may be broad and difficult to channel by definition, it is also true that, to achieve the force and effect of law, the Legislature must actually define the acts it intends to punish as crimes. After all, it is well-settled law that “a crime is made up of two parts, forbidden conduct and a prescribed penalty.” 1 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Substantive Criminal Law § 1.2(d) at 18 (3d ed. 2018). “The former without the latter is', '- 15 - no crime.” Id. at 18-19. It follows, then, that the latter, a prescribed penalty, without the former, forbidden conduct unequivocally defined as an offense, also is no crime. See id. Just as we have held that every criminal statute must contain a penalty, State v. DelBonis, 862 A.2d 760, 768 (R.I. 2004), so too must every criminal statute state what constitutes a crime. In this respect, § 11-67-6 is fatally deficient because it is missing one of the two essential components of an effective criminal statute—the statement that the acts that it describes are crimes.', 'The paucity of caselaw on this topic should come as no surprise and lends further credence to its elemental nature in the law. Indeed, our caselaw in this area has focused only on criminal statutes that have failed to contain a penalty. See, e.g., State v. Tessier, 100 R.I. 210, 211, 213 A.2d 699, 699 (1965) (recognizing “the hornbook principles that every criminal statute must provide for a penalty and that a conviction for a violation of a statute containing none cannot stand”). However, our research reveals one court that has confronted a criminal statute that was similarly afflicted with an egregious drafting error. In State v. Archuletta, 526 P.2d 911 (Utah 1974), the Utah Supreme Court considered a statute which provided, in pertinent part, that “[a] person commits aggravated assault if he commits assault as defined in § 76-5-101.” Archuletta, 526 P.2d at 911. However, § 76-5-101 did not define the term “assault.” What it actually defined was the term “prisoner.” Id. Noting that “[t]his [was] an obvious statutory error[,]” the Utah Supreme Court reasoned that “[t]he legislature undoubtedly meant to have Sec. 76-5-103(1) read, ‘A person commits aggravated assault if he commits assault as defined in section 76-5-102,’ etc.”', 'Id. at 911-12.', 'Yet, as that court concluded, although the Utah legislature may have intended to criminalize aggravated assault, it had not actually done so, and, as a result, the trial court’s decision to quash the criminal information was affirmed. Id. at 912.', '- 16 -', 'In Archuletta, the Utah Supreme Court provided concise reasoning that we embrace as persuasive here. As that court explained, “[t]he statute does not set forth the crime of aggravated assault at all. Even though the rule of strict construction of a criminal statute is not the law in Utah,[] there is nothing to construe where there is no ambiguity in the statute.” Archuletta, 526 P.2d at 912. Significantly, as the court held: “There is nothing ambiguous about the statute in the instant matter; it simply does not state a crime, and we are not empowered to state one for the legislators simply because it seems certain that they intended to state one themselves.” Id. We conclude that the same is true in this case.', 'Here, too, our Legislature’s statute, § 11-67-6, is afflicted with an obvious drafting error. The General Assembly listed a range of conduct in subsection (b), cut short by the so-called “hanging or,” and a penalty provision in subsection (c). It is likely true that, after the “hanging or” in § 11-67-6, the Legislature intended to include language linking the conduct that it described in subsection (b) to the felony punishment that it provided in subsection (c). But, as was the case in Archuletta, the Legislature’s intent to create a crime does not overcome its overt failure to do so.', 'It is well settled that the power to define crimes rests not with this Court, but with the General Assembly. Saluter, 715 A.2d at 1255. As we have explained, “[n]o authority exists for this Court or the trial court in a criminal case ‘to supplement or to amend a statute enacted by the General Assembly.’” DelBonis, 862 A.2d at 768 (quoting State v. Carter, 827 A.2d 636, 644 (R.I. 2003)). Section 11-67-6 fails to state a crime, and for us to view that statute as the state urges us, we would be required to redraft it, not merely to interpret or construe it. That, plainly, we cannot do. Id. (citing State v. Calise, 478 A.2d 198, 201 (R.I. 1984), for the proposition that', '- 17 - “this Court has neither the authority nor the competence to rewrite a penal statute to conform to the state’s concept of how it should have been written”). 11', 'In our opinion, no amount of statutory construction in this case can fill the gap or repair the flaw created by the absence of language setting forth a crime in § 11-67-6. As we have explained above, a criminal statute’s inclusion of a punishment without the inclusion of a criminal offense is a statute without any force and effect. See Archuletta, 526 P.2d at 912. This Court does not draft laws, it interprets and construes them. We simply cannot construe that which is not there to be construed. 12 Accordingly, count 4 of the indictment, which charged defendant with violating § 11-67-6, and count 6 of the indictment, which charged him with conspiring to violate § 11-67-6, should have been dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2). 13 11', 'Of note, in 2017, the General Assembly repealed § 11-67-6 when it repealed the entirety of chapter 67 of title 11, replacing that chapter with a new statutory scheme aimed at criminalizing human trafficking, codified as G.L. 1956 chapter 67.1 of title 11. See P.L. 2017, ch. 232; P.L. 2017, ch. 260. It is also noteworthy that, in 2015, the General Assembly amended § 11-67-6, leaving alone the gap contained in subsection (b), but increasing the punishments contained in subsections (c) and (d), see P.L. 2015, ch. 42, § 1; P.L. 2015, ch. 45, § 1, calling to mind the maxim that this Court “presume[s] that the General Assembly knows the state of existing relevant law when it enacts or amends a statute.” Power Test Realty Company Limited Partnership v. Coit, 134 A.3d 1213, 1222 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Retirement Board of Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island v. DiPrete, 845 A.2d 270, 287 (R.I. 2004)). 12', 'In response to our dissenting colleague’s reference to Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes’ artful quote in Roschen v. Ward, 279 U.S. 337, 339 (1929), we pause to note that, in our view, that case—and, in turn, that quote—is inapposite here. Roschen was a civil case in which injunctive relief was sought, and it centered on whether a statute regulating the sale of eyeglasses could be interpreted in a way that was broader than the words of the statute allowed. Roschen, 279 U.S. at 339. Here, however, we have an incomplete criminal statute, one which the Roschen court agrees is subject to a more exacting scrutiny. Id. (“We agree to all the generalities about not supplying criminal laws with what they omit * * *.”). Respectfully, there is a difference, in our opinion, between a court “using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean[,]” id., and a court supplying language setting forth one of the two fundamental elements of a valid criminal statute where none exists. We agree that common sense dictates that the General Assembly intended to criminalize sex trafficking of a minor; however, we disagree with the dissent that the General Assembly actually did so. 13', 'We agree with defendant that, although the crime of conspiracy is itself a separate offense, count 6 should also have been dismissed because without count 4, there was no underlying crime', '- 18 -', 'B', 'Melia’s Remarks', 'Next, defendant contends that the trial justice erred when she denied his motion to declare a mistrial after Melia said on the witness stand that defendant “ran a prostitution sting right out of his apartment” and that defendant had a “long history” with prostitution.', 'At the outset, the record reveals that, following each of those remarks, defendant immediately objected and moved to strike. Each time, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion to strike and issued a cautionary instruction, instructing the jurors that they were not to use Melia’s testimony regarding any uncharged crimes “as evidence that [defendant] acted in conformity with that other behavior” or “as evidence that [defendant] acted in conformity with those prior acts on the dates in question[,]” respectively. Shortly after the trial justice struck Melia’s comment regarding defendant’s “long history” with prostitution, Melia and the prosecutor engaged in the following colloquy:', '“[PROSECUTOR]: Let me just ask you. Do you think this', 'would be something that the Defendant would be interested in?', '“[MELIA]: Hundred percent, yes.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: And had he ever had a conversation with', 'you about that previously?', '“[MELIA]: About —', '“[PROSECUTOR]: About bringing a girl to his house.', '“[MELIA]: Yes.” on which to base the conspiracy charge. See G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6 (“Except as otherwise provided by law, every person who shall conspire with another to commit an offense punishable under the laws of this state shall be subject to the same fine and imprisonment as pertain to the offense which the person shall have conspired to commit, provided that imprisonment for the conspiracy shall not exceed ten (10) years.” (emphasis added)). Moreover, because we hold that defendant should have prevailed on his argument that § 11-67-6 failed to state a crime, we need not address his duplicity argument. Finally, we decline to, as the state suggests in its brief, find defendant guilty of the lesser-included offense of general sex trafficking, in violation of § 11-67-3. In this case, the jury was not instructed on a violation of § 11-67-3, and we will not unilaterally impose a conviction on that ground now.', '- 19 - Defense counsel then asked for a sidebar and moved to pass the case.', 'At sidebar, defense counsel argued that Melia’s characterization of defendant was unduly prejudicial. Specifically, he said:', '“It just seems that the Prosecution is portraying my client as an', 'ongoing pimp operation, and I think that this type of', 'characterization is unfair to the Defendant and more so it’s overly', 'prejudicial. If it were the first time, I’m okay with it. But it', 'appears that this is going to be an ongoing problem with this', 'particular witness.” After explaining that she had already stricken Melia’s remarks and that she was allowing Melia’s other testimony about defendant’s interest in prostitution solely as evidence of Melia’s state of mind—namely, to explain why Melia had brought Emily to defendant’s apartment—the trial justice denied the motion to pass. On appeal, defendant argues that that was done in error. We disagree.', 'It is well settled that “[a] trial justice’s ruling on a motion to pass the case ‘is entitled to great weight.’” State v. Rosario, 14 A.3d 206, 214 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Grant, 946 A.2d 818, 826-27 (R.I. 2008)). Therefore, “[o]n appeal, a trial justice’s ruling on a motion to pass the case ‘will be disturbed * * * only if he or she was clearly wrong.’” Id. (quoting Grant, 946 A.2d at 827). We discern no such error here.', 'C', 'The Telephone Conversations', 'The defendant’s final contention is that the trial justice erred in admitting recordings of certain telephone calls that he had made from the ACI while he was awaiting trial. However, after a careful review of the record, it is our opinion that this issue has been waived. It is no secret that “[t]his Court staunchly adheres to the ‘raise or waive’ rule.” State v. Barros, 148 A.3d 168, 174 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 (R.I. 2011)). “As we', '- 20 - have said on innumerable occasions, ‘a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.’” Id. at 172 (quoting State v.

(citing Rule 103(a)(1) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence).', 'Our review of the record in this case shows that defendant did not lodge an objection specific enough to escape the Damoclean swing of our raise-or-waive rule. During the trial, after attempting to introduce testimony unrelated to this issue, the state requested another sidebar. At sidebar, the state informed the trial justice that it wished to play recordings of phone calls that defendant had while he was at the ACI awaiting trial. To guide the jury, the state had transcripts of those recordings on hand. After the state made its request, the trial justice asked counsel for defendant whether he had any objections. Defense counsel’s response was brief: “Well, the first four pages [of the transcripts], I’m not so sure that the material is really relevant unless you have someone who can interpret some street language.”', 'The sidebar continued, with the trial justice peppering the state with several questions, such as, “Who was [defendant] talking to * * *?” and “[W]here is the relevance?” After the state explained the context of the phone calls, the trial justice then mentioned Rule 404(b), asking, “is it my understanding that the transcripts or the actual recording is going to be offered under [Rule] 404(b) to show signature crime, a design, an MO, that he is someone who panders even when he’s inside the ACI? Is that what you’re telling me about?” The state answered, “Yes.”', '- 21 - As the sidebar was wrapping up, defense counsel then told the trial justice: “I’m here at the bench and I’m running into [Rule] 404(b) walls.” The trial justice responded: “Well, your exception is noted, sir. * * * Overruled.”', 'With the sidebar complete, the state then put an employee of Global Telling Company on the stand, through whom the state would introduce the disk containing the recordings of defendant’s phone calls. 14 After the state established a foundation for admitting the disk, it moved to admit the disk as a full exhibit. As defendant began to object, the trial justice asked him, “For the reasons discussed at sidebar?” He responded: “Yes, for the same reasons.” The trial justice overruled defendant’s objection, and the recordings were admitted into evidence and played for the jury.', 'Based on the generalized nature of those objections, it is our opinion that the defendant has waived his ability to challenge the trial justice’s decision to admit the recordings on the grounds that they (1) were irrelevant; (2) were improperly admitted under Rule 404(b); and (3) should have been excluded under Rule 403. Other than generally stating at sidebar that he was “running into [Rule] 404(b) walls[,]” and thereafter relying on that broadly-worded objection as the basis for objecting when the state moved to admit the disk of recordings as a full exhibit, defense counsel remained silent. In our view, the content of the colloquy at sidebar, even when coupled with the defendant’s later objection, was insufficient to properly preserve this matter for appellate review. See State v. Blandino, 171 A.3d 21, 29 (R.I. 2017). Accordingly, we consider the issue to be waived. See Barros, 148 A.3d at 172. 14', 'Global Telling Company is a company that provides phone systems for individuals to make calls while they are imprisoned in the ACI.

We affirm the judgment in all other respects. The papers shall be returned to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Robinson, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur in the several holdings set forth in the majority opinion, and I also concur in the reasoning underlying those holdings—except that I respectfully but quite vigorously dissent from the majority’s decision to vacate the convictions on Counts Four and Six, and I disassociate myself from the majority’s reasoning in that regard. While I appreciate the thoughtfulness with which the majority has reached its conclusion that the statute at issue in this case 1 contains a “flaw that cannot be repaired without the addition of language that criminalizes the conduct described in the statute,” I simply cannot agree that such additional language is necessary for the purpose of giving fair notice as to what conduct is prohibited and as to what criminal penalties may be imposed on a person who engages in such conduct. In my judgment, a reading of the statute in its entirety makes it clear precisely what conduct is being criminalized and what would be the penalty for committing the crime. I candidly acknowledge that there is an obvious incompleteness about the statute; undoubtedly, the drafter had planned to add a phrase after the rather notorious “hanging 1', 'The statute at issue is G.L. 1956 § 11-67-6, and it is quoted in full in the majority opinion.

Factor, 41 A.3d 994, 1002 (R.I. 2012) (“The plain meaning approach, however, is not the equivalent of myopic literalism, and it is entirely proper for us to look to the sense and meaning fairly deducible from the context.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see generally Davis v.

It would, of course, have been even better if those acts were explicitly declared in so many words to be criminal. In my judgment, however, it is a totally fair and unavoidable inference from this unambiguous statute, when read in its entirety, that the described conduct was legislatively deemed to be criminal.

No logical legislative purpose would be served by explicitly setting forth a series of penalties to be imposed if the conduct were not criminal.

While the statute at issue would have been better if it had specifically added language to the effect that engaging in such conduct was criminal, I do not believe that such additional language was necessary; the presence of criminal penalties in the same statute where particular activities of a sexual nature are itemized more than suffices to give the reasonable person fair notice that the referenced conduct is criminal in nature.

8,v. : City of Providence et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court.', 'The plaintiff, Tara J. Cancel (Cancel), as Administratrix of the Estate of Ira Lukens (Lukens), appeals from a Superior Court summary judgment entered in favor of the defendants, the City of Providence and various city officials (collectively the city).1 Cancel asserts that there remain genuine issues of material fact regarding whether the city knew of the dangerous condition of a pothole on a street in Roger Williams Park (the park) and whether it “willfully and/or maliciously failed to warn” of the pothole, which would strip the city of the protection against liability afforded under Rhode Island’s Recreational Use Statute, G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 32 (RUS). This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The city officials named as defendants include James J. Lombardi, in his capacity as Treasurer for the City of Providence; Joseph Salem, in his capacity as Director of Roger Williams Park Services; Russel Knight, in his capacity as Director of Providence Public Works; Sal Solomon, in his capacity as Superintendent of the Highway Division for the City of Providence; and Wendy Nilsson, in her capacity as Superintendent of Providence Parks and Recreation.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On June 9, 2014, Lukens was thrown from his bicycle after striking a pothole on a road in the park.2 Cancel filed a complaint on September 28, 2015, wherein she alleged that Lukens suffered serious personal injuries as a result of the city’s negligence in maintaining the park. Cancel subsequently filed an amended complaint alleging, in addition to negligence, willful and/or malicious failure to warn, inspect, and/or repair the roadway within the park. The amended complaint further asserted that the city’s conduct was a direct and proximate cause of Lukens’ injuries.', 'On January 20, 2017, the city filed a motion for summary judgment. The matter was argued in the Superior Court on April 19, 2017, after which the hearing justice deferred her ruling so that Cancel could depose the Superintendent of the City of Providence’s Department of Parks. The matter was heard again on July 17, 2017, and the hearing justice thereafter granted the city’s motion for summary judgment. Judgment entered on August 11, 2017. Cancel filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.” Newstone Development, LLC v. East Pacific, LLC, 140 A.3d 100, 103 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Daniels v. Fluette, 64 A.3d 302, 304 (R.I. 2013)). “We will affirm a [trial] court’s decision only if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material 2', 'Ira Lukens has since passed away.

(quoting Daniels, 64 A.3d at 304). “Furthermore, ‘the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.’” Id. (quoting Daniels, 64 A.3d at 304). “[S]ummary judgment should enter against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case * * *.” Id. (quoting Lavoie v. North East Knitting, Inc., 918 A.2d 225, 228 (R.I. 2007)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Cancel argues that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the city “knew of the dangerous condition and willfully and/or maliciously failed to warn against it.” Under § 32- 6-3,', '“an owner of land who either directly or indirectly invites or', 'permits without charge any person to use that property for', 'recreational purposes does not thereby:', '“(1) Extend any assurance that the premises are safe for any', 'purpose;', '“(2) Confer upon that person the legal status of an invitee', 'or licensee to whom a duty of care is owed; nor', '“(3) Assume responsibility for or incur liability for any', 'injury to any person or property caused by an act of', 'omission of that person.” The purpose behind the RUS is to encourage landowners to open their property to the public for recreational use by limiting landowner liability. Pereira v. Fitzgerald, 21 A.3d 369, 371 n.1 (R.I. 2011); Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1043 (R.I. 2010). Persons using such property are treated as though they are trespassers, meaning that the landowner owes them no duty “other than to refrain from willful or wanton conduct.” Berman, 991 A.2d at 1043, 1044. Moreover, such a duty arises only after the trespasser has been “discovered in a position of peril.” Cain v.', '-3- Johnson, 755 A.2d 156, 161 (R.I. 2000); see Tantimonico v. Allendale Mutual Insurance Co., 637 A.2d 1056, 1057 (R.I. 1994).', 'Cancel argues that an exception to the RUS applies in this case under § 32-6-5(a)(1), which provides that landowner liability will not be limited “[f]or the willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering the user’s peril[.]” Cancel points to the testimony of Joseph Salem and Robert McMahon to support her assertion. She asserts that, during his deposition, Salem, the Director of Roger Williams Park Services, testified that there is no regular schedule for inspection of the roadways within the park. However, Salem also testified that the strip of road where the pothole was located was driven over daily by McMahon, the then Superintendent of the park. Likewise, McMahon confirmed that he traveled over the area in question at least two to three times per week on his way into the park and once per week while he was leaving the park. Cancel also asserts that the photographs of the pothole make it “clearly foreseeable that any reasonable person would recognize [that] a pothole of this size should be remedied, repaired or marked off so as to not cause a danger to the public.”', 'It is undisputed that the park is open to the public free of charge and that Lukens was engaged in the recreational activity of riding his bicycle at the time he was injured.3 Therefore, immunity under the RUS clearly applies to the city.', 'The remaining issue is whether the exception provided in § 32-6-5(a)(1) also applies. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 32-6-2(4) of the RUS provides that “[r]ecreational purposes” include “bicycling.”', '-4-', 'This Court had occasion to examine this exception to the RUS in Berman, cited supra.4 The plaintiff in Berman sustained catastrophic injuries when he walked down a path leading off Newport’s famed Cliff Walk and the ground beneath him gave way, causing him to fall approximately twenty-nine feet to the rocks below. Berman, 991 A.2d at 1042. In Berman, this Court analyzed the two distinct phrases of § 32-6-5(a)(1). Id. at 1049.', 'First, this Court considered whether or not the City of Newport had “discover[ed] the user’s peril[.]” Id. This Court interpreted the term “discovering” as used in § 32-6-5(a)(1) liberally and held that it included incidents where the City of Newport had not come upon a specific user in peril but had been put on sufficient notice of a dangerous condition. Id. at 1050, 1051.', 'This Court in Berman determined that the City of Newport knew that the plaintiff was in a position of peril because the City of Newport had actual notice of the defective condition of the Cliff Walk due in large part to the knowledge that individuals had fallen to their death from the defect in the past. Berman, 991 A.2d at 1050. This Court held: “It is because of the multiple incidents of death and grievous injury that we conclude that the [City of Newport] may not successfully defend this claim based on an assertion that it had no specific knowledge of [the plaintiff] or any peril confronting him.” Id. at 1051. This Court further emphasized that “it is the number of serious injuries flowing from a known risk that brings us to this conclusion today.” Id.', 'This Court, in Berman, next considered the terminology “willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity” and concluded that the language imposed a duty upon the City of Newport, thereby precluding the City of Newport from “invoking the RUS as a shield against liability for [the plaintiff’s] injuries.” Id. at 1052. 4', 'We consider Berman here because it was relied upon by plaintiff. We note, however, that Berman is readily distinguishable from the facts at hand.', '-5-', 'In the case now before us, the only evidence that the city had any notice concerning the pothole is McMahon’s and Salem’s deposition testimony that McMahon traveled in the area at least several times per week on his way to and from the park. Although McMahon denied having notice or knowledge of the pothole, Cancel asks this Court to question the veracity of McMahon’s testimony and queries, “How could someone admit to driving over the defect * * * and then claim to have no notice[?]” She has proffered no evidence, expert or otherwise, however, that demonstrates that the pothole was, in fact, present at any of the times that McMahon drove over the roadway or that the city had received any complaints or other notice concerning the condition of the roadway.', 'The facts of this case are more akin to those cases in which this Court has refused to apply § 32-6-5(a)(1). See Carlson v. Town of South Kingstown, 111 A.3d 819, 821, 824, 825 (R.I. 2015) (distinguishing the case from Berman and refusing to apply § 32-6-5(a)(1) where the plaintiff stepped into a divot at a town park and sustained injuries, because there was no showing “that the town knew of the particular hole that injured [the] plaintiff or of similar persons injured by similar defects in the park”); Lacey v. Reitsma, 899 A.2d 455, 456, 458 (R.I. 2006) (holding that § 32-6-5(a)(1) was inapplicable where the plaintiff, a nine-year-old boy, veered over a cliff on his bicycle in a state park because there was no evidence that the defendants discovered the plaintiff “in a position of peril and then failed to warn him” of the potentially dangerous condition).', 'In the case under review, plaintiff “bears the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon [the] mere allegation[]” that McMahon must have had knowledge of the pothole. See Newstone Development, LLC, 140 A.3d at 103 (quoting Daniels, 64 A.3d at 304). After viewing the evidence in the light most', '-6- favorable to the nonmoving party, we cannot conclude that there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning the city’s knowledge of the dangerous condition or “discover[y] [of] the user’s peril[.]” Section 32-6-5(a)(1).', 'Moreover, the evidence in this case cannot support an assertion that the city willfully or maliciously failed to guard or warn against the pothole. See § 32-6-5(a)(1). In Berman, this Court made a clear distinction between the facts presented in that case and those presented in Quick v. Stone Mountain Memorial Association, 420 S.E.2d 36 (Ga. Ct. App. 1992). Berman, 991 A.2d at 1052. This Court noted that, under the facts in Quick, “the park officials ‘were unaware of any other accidents that had occurred in th[e]area.’” See id. (quoting Quick, 420 S.E.2d at 38). The Berman Court again heavily relied on the fact that the City of Newport had knowledge of past accidents that had occurred as a result of “the Cliff Walk’s latent dangerous condition.” Id. at 1053.', 'In the instant case, there is no evidence that the city had actual knowledge of the pothole, had received complaints regarding the condition of the roadway, or had notice of any past incidents resulting from the condition of the roadway. Therefore, we conclude that summary judgment was appropriately granted.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

9,Angel Navarro : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The applicant, Angel Navarro,1 appeals from a postconviction-relief judgment in favor of the State of Rhode Island and against Navarro. In those proceedings, Navarro challenged the trial court’s acceptance of his nolo contendere plea on a second-degree murder charge. Navarro’s plea was “capped” at sixty years, with forty years to serve and twenty years suspended with probation following his release, and the maximum sentence was imposed.', 'This matter came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On August 19, 1999, Alfred C. Moon, M.D., was found dead inside his residence. From 1999 to 2004, police investigated Dr. Moon’s mysterious death, to no avail. Then, on June 23, 1', 'Mr. Navarro is also identified in the record as Victor Medina, an apparent alias.', '-1- 2004, after police received information about a potential suspect, Navarro was arrested. On July 8, 2005, a grand jury indicted Navarro for murder in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-23-1 and 11- 23-2. On November 16, 2006, Navarro entered into a plea agreement, whereby he pled nolo contendere to an amended charge of second-degree murder, and his sentence was “capped” at sixty years, with forty years to serve and the twenty-year balance suspended with probation.', 'The plea proceedings began with the state’s motion to amend the charge to second-degree murder, which the hearing justice granted. Next, the hearing justice asked if Navarro understood that by entering his plea he would be giving up the rights contained in the plea form; to which Navarro responded, “Yes.” The hearing justice then asked Navarro if he had reviewed the plea form with his attorney (trial counsel). Navarro again responded in the affirmative. At this point, trial counsel asked the hearing justice for an opportunity to speak with Navarro about “a question” regarding, as the attorney described it, “the back end of the number which I did not go over with [Navarro].” Then, trial counsel and Navarro conferred off the record.', 'Subsequently, the hearing justice informed Navarro that he was giving up his right to a trial and explained to Navarro what it meant to give up that right. The hearing justice then asked Navarro if he had any questions, to which Navarro responded, “No, your Honor.” Following Navarro’s acceptance of the prosecution’s statement of the facts as true, the hearing justice informed Navarro that the plea was capped and agreed upon by Navarro, the state, and trial counsel. The hearing justice further explained that the sentence could be no more than sixty years with forty years to serve and asked Navarro: “If I accept your plea and cap that sentence with those years, you can’t change your mind later on about this. Do you understand?” Navarro responded that he understood. The hearing justice indicated that the sentencing was to be held at a separate hearing, at which time the court would consider a presentence report and the', '-2- recommendations of the state and trial counsel. The hearing justice further informed Navarro that he would also have an opportunity to address the court.', 'Again, the hearing justice said to Navarro: “If the maximum sentence is imposed that can be imposed under this agreement, you could end up spending [forty] years in prison. Do you understand that?” Navarro replied, “Yes.” The hearing justice then warned Navarro that during the entire sixty-year sentence, if imposed, he would have to abide by the terms of his probation, to which Navarro again responded that he understood. Lastly, the hearing justice asked Navarro if he had any questions, to which Navarro replied, “No.”', 'On December 13, 2006, the same justice conducted Navarro’s sentencing hearing. At that time, Dr. Moon’s colleague, his two sons, and his daughter addressed the court. Navarro’s mother and wife2 also addressed the court, as did Navarro. In his statement, Navarro apologized to Dr. Moon’s family and expressed remorse.', 'During the sentencing hearing, trial counsel made a sentence recommendation on Navarro’s behalf. He stated that “[Navarro] is sincere when he says that his only wish and prayer would be to reverse the events of August 17, 1999 that led to such a tragedy” and that Navarro “has admitted to being responsible for the death of Dr. Moon.” Trial counsel described Navarro’s difficult upbringing and pointed out that the totality of his criminal past was nonviolent and related to his challenges with addiction. Trial counsel chronicled the events that occurred on the night of the murder from Navarro’s perspective and provided a very detailed recitation of the circumstances that led to Dr. Moon’s death. He noted that Navarro had been released from prison three days prior to Dr. Moon’s murder, after serving time for heroin 2', 'We note that the transcript of the sentencing hearing is missing three pages that we presume include part of Navarro’s wife’s statement to the court.', '-3- possession. Earlier that day, Navarro had “sniffed” two bags of heroin and had been drinking heavily.', 'Additionally, trial counsel cited to his research on sentences in other second-degree murder cases, which revealed terms of less than five years to up to forty years to serve. He further noted that the average sentence of the thirty-six cases he examined was fifty years with twenty-seven years to serve. He distinguished the instant case from others, arguing that in this case “[t]here was a degree of provocation and an element of self-defense.” He further argued that Navarro’s sentence should be reduced because he had taken responsibility for Dr. Moon’s death, showed genuine remorse, and demonstrated “a true sense of trying to right his wrongs.”', 'Furthermore, trial counsel explained that Navarro had “assisted the prosecution in the United States District Court for charges that occurred while [Navarro] was serving at the [Adult Correctional Institutions] and witnessed an alleged crime.”', 'In summation, trial counsel recommended that Navarro be sentenced to forty years with fifteen to twenty years to serve, and trial counsel also recommended that Navarro participate in treatment for anger management and substance abuse.', 'After reviewing the facts of the case, the hearing justice noted that, for four years while law enforcement worked to solve Dr. Moon’s murder, Navarro failed to take responsibility and remained at large. In addition, the hearing justice noted the severity of the attack, Navarro’s criminal history, his likelihood of rehabilitation, and trial counsel’s research on sentencing in second-degree murder cases. The hearing justice sentenced Navarro to the maximum sentence under the capped plea agreement: sixty years imprisonment, with forty years to serve and twenty years suspended with probation following Navarro’s release.', '-4-', 'On September 11, 2009, Navarro filed a pro se application for postconviction relief. Navarro sought to have his sentence vacated pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1. He essentially asserted two arguments in support of his application for postconviction relief: (1) ineffective assistance of counsel and (2) failure by the hearing justice to adequately explain to Navarro his waiver of constitutional rights when he pled nolo contendere. On October 23, 2009, the state filed its answer and a motion to dismiss Navarro’s application for postconviction relief. On September 21, 2010, Navarro’s court-appointed counsel for his postconviction-relief application (postconviction counsel) entered an appearance on his behalf.', 'Prior to the postconviction-relief hearing, postconviction counsel filed a motion to withdraw in accordance with the procedures outlined in Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000). See also Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 455-56 (R.I. 2012) (indicating that in Shatney, we set forth a mechanism that allows “an attorney * * * appointed to represent an indigent applicant [to] withdraw from that representation when it becomes clear, after a reasonable investigation, that some or all of the applicant’s claims lack merit”).', 'On October 20, 2011, a justice of the Superior Court heard the parties on Navarro’s application for postconviction relief. The postconviction-relief justice noted that “[t]he [c]ourt * * * appointed an attorney to investigate the petitioner’s claim to determine if there was any merit to the same.” Navarro’s postconviction counsel indicated that he had been “appointed in this case to represent Mr. Navarro in his [postconviction-relief] petition.”', 'Postconviction counsel reported to the justice that, after he obtained the case, he met with Navarro approximately four times.', 'In addition, postconviction counsel stated that he reviewed all pertinent exhibits and transcripts. He also spoke with trial counsel “at length at least four times regarding the actual plea.” Postconviction counsel then submitted to the justice that, based on', '-5- his review of the case, Navarro understood the ramifications of his plea.', 'Moreover, postconviction counsel stated: “In my professional opinion, there is no reasonable avenue by way of [postconviction] [r]elief that Mr. Navarro could gain through this petition.” Therefore, he asked the justice for permission to withdraw as Navarro’s counsel. In response to his counsel’s request to withdraw, Navarro stated that he agreed with postconviction counsel’s summary of the facts relating to what postconviction counsel had done in his case.', 'At that point during the proceedings, the postconviction-relief justice told Navarro, “[I]t’s my responsibility * * * after I receive a report from an attorney * * * to kind of go through the facts myself to make sure that I think he’s covered everything. And I’m satisfied there is an accurate record to substantiate what he’s just said before the [c]ourt.” The justice further indicated that she “had a couple of opportunities” to review the record. She reviewed the plea form, the transcript of the plea hearing, the transcript of the sentencing hearing, postconviction counsel’s memorandum, and, in particular, the section in which postconviction counsel summarized his conversations with trial counsel.', 'The postconviction-relief justice found, after reviewing the entire record, that Navarro entered his plea “with knowledge, consent, voluntarily, understanding what was happening, the nature of the plea, [and] the consequences of it” and that Navarro’s trial counsel provided “more than adequate representation.” The justice also agreed with postconviction counsel’s conclusion that Navarro’s claims lacked merit and, accordingly, decided that she was “going to allow [postconviction counsel] to withdraw.” No order was entered as to either decision at that time.', 'Upon issuing her decision orally, the postconviction-relief justice informed Navarro that he had a right to further pursue the matter pro se. Navarro responded that he did not wish to pursue the matter, but instead he sought to file a motion for modification of his sentence. In', '-6- response, the justice scheduled a future status date and indicated that Navarro could utilize the time prior to his next court date to consider his strategy moving forward.', 'Navarro again informed the justice that he did not want to pursue his postconviction-relief application; however, the justice persisted in scheduling the matter for a further court date. She noted that the future date would give Navarro the opportunity to “talk to [postconviction counsel] about the sentencing issue * * *.” The justice further informed postconviction counsel that, after he spoke with Navarro, he would be allowed to withdraw as Navarro’s postconviction counsel.', 'In a letter dated October 29, 2011, Navarro wrote to an attorney (former counsel) who had represented him prior to his representation by trial counsel. In the letter, Navarro asked former counsel to send him the name of the prosecutor who had offered a plea deal that purportedly would have given Navarro assistance with his sentence if he provided testimony in an unrelated case. Former counsel sent a letter in response, wherein he provided Navarro with the prosecutor’s name and explained that the prosecutor did in fact consider Navarro’s testimony and that the prosecutor’s consideration resulted in a proposed thirty-two-year sentence. Former counsel further explained in the letter that, because Navarro decided not to take the thirty-two- year offer and instead retained a new attorney, Navarro would have needed to raise the previously proposed plea agreement at his sentencing hearing.', 'The matter was again before the postconviction-relief justice on March 16, 2012. At that time, Navarro discussed the letter that he had received from his former counsel regarding the offer of a thirty-two-year sentence. Navarro argued that the letter was “proof [he] was getting [thirty-two] years.” The postconviction-relief justice concluded, as former counsel stated in the letter, that Navarro had no plea agreement with the state and had not raised the state’s offer at his sentencing. She further informed Navarro that he needed to put forth “something different”', '-7- because in the prior hearing she had already decided that Navarro did not receive ineffective assistance from his trial counsel. Navarro responded by expressing his intention to file an appeal with this Court. The justice then instructed Navarro to speak with postconviction counsel about the timing of his appeal. In addition, the justice asked postconviction counsel to prepare an order that indicated she had accepted postconviction counsel’s Shatney memorandum, that Navarro had “nothing new to offer other than what [the postconviction-relief justice] discussed before,” and that Navarro intended to file an appeal.', 'On April 18, 2012, Navarro filed a pro se notice of appeal to this Court. During an August 1, 2012 status conference, Navarro stated: “I just wanted to appeal to the Supreme Court.” The postconviction-relief justice indicated that an order was to be entered in the case at the end of the week. The postconviction-relief justice then confirmed orally on the record that Navarro’s application for postconviction relief was denied; however, no order was entered at that time. On April 27, 2016, judgment entered on Navarro’s application for postconviction relief in favor of the state and against Navarro.3 On October 4, 2017, Navarro filed a motion for the appointment of counsel, which this Court granted.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Under Rhode Island law, a defendant can seek postconviction relief pursuant to § 10-9.1-1.

Pursuant to his ineffective- assistance-of-counsel argument, Navarro contends that he signed the plea form, which he', '-9- maintains was blank at the time, only because trial counsel informed him and his family that the sentence would be fifteen years or, at most, seventeen years. He further cites to a section of the plea transcript where his trial counsel asked the hearing justice for an opportunity to confer with Navarro about “the back end of the number * * *.” It is at that point in time, Navarro contends, that trial counsel informed him “not to worry about the number [forty] [because he] was going to serve in the teens.”', 'Navarro similarly supplements his judicial-error argument on appeal. He avers that the hearing justice failed to ask Navarro “if anybody made threats or promises” to him during the plea negotiations. He maintains that he would have responded in the affirmative to such an inquiry.', 'A', 'Ineffective Assistance of Counsel and Judicial Error', '“This Court adheres to the standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), when evaluating claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.” Chapdelaine, 32 A.3d at 941 (quoting Rodriguez v. State, 941 A.2d 158, 162 (R.I. 2008)). In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, an applicant must satisfy two criteria. Id. “First, the applicant must demonstrate that counsel’s performance was deficient, to the point that the errors were so serious that trial counsel did not function at the level guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.” Id. (quoting Rodriguez, 941 A.2d at 162). “This prong can be satisfied only by a showing that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” Id. (quoting Rodriguez, 941 A.2d at 162). In our evaluation of counsel’s performance, “a strong presumption” exists “that an attorney’s performance falls within the range of reasonable professional assistance and sound', '- 10 - strategy * * *.” Rivera v. State, 58 A.3d 171, 180 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Rice, 38 A.3d at 17). “Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.” Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 610 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Powers v. State, 734 A.2d 508, 522 (R.I. 1999)). “‘When evaluating a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel in a plea situation, the defendant must demonstrate a reasonable probability that but for counsel’s errors, he or she would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial’ and, importantly, that the outcome of the trial would have been different.” Id. at 610-11 (quoting State v. Figueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 500 (R.I. 1994)).', 'As noted above, at the conclusion of postconviction counsel’s presentation of his findings contained in his no-merit Shatney memorandum, the postconviction-relief justice informed Navarro that “it’s my responsibility at this point after I receive a report from an attorney * * * to kind of go through the facts myself to make sure that I think he’s covered everything.” The justice did not address the state’s motion to dismiss and instead proceeded to decide the matter on the merits. The justice indicated that she “had a couple of opportunities” to review the record of the case, in addition to her review of postconviction counsel’s memorandum, the plea form, the transcript of the plea hearing, and the transcript of the sentencing hearing. Specifically, the postconviction-relief justice reviewed the portion of postconviction counsel’s no-merit memorandum regarding his conversations with trial counsel related to the plea. Additionally, she acknowledged the statements by Navarro’s mother and wife at the sentencing hearing explaining Navarro’s background, his issues with addiction, how their lives would be impacted if Navarro was incarcerated for a long period of time, and their belief that Navarro was prepared to rehabilitate himself. The postconviction-relief justice also noted that Navarro and trial counsel both signed the plea form and that the hearing justice discussed the plea with Navarro, including', '- 11 - his attendant rights.', 'Moreover, she took note of Navarro’s statement to the court at the sentencing hearing.', 'The postconviction-relief justice also considered trial counsel’s representation of Navarro during the plea proceedings, including his “strong argument” on behalf of Navarro at the sentencing hearing; his “very impassioned” sentence recommendation; his argument that Navarro’s criminal past was only related to his addiction issues; his presentation of Navarro’s recollection of the events that took place on the night of the murder; and his research on sentences in second-degree murder cases, which trial counsel “discussed at length,” together with his conclusion that the average sentence was “far less” than the maximum sentence of forty years to serve under Navarro’s capped plea. Bearing in mind her thorough review of the entire record, we conclude that the postconviction-relief justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence in concluding that trial counsel’s representation was not deficient and did not “f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness.” Chapdelaine, 32 A.3d at 943 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-88).', 'In light of our determination that trial counsel’s performance was reasonable, we need not address the second prong of Strickland requiring that “counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced the defense in this case.” Neufville, 13 A.3d at 614 (concluding that a court should only reach the second prong of the Strickland test when it has determined that the attorney’s representation was deficient).', 'Additionally, Navarro contends that the hearing justice erred when he failed to ask Navarro “if anybody made threats or promises” to him during the plea negotiations. Specifically, in regard to the purported previous plea agreement, Navarro maintains that, had he known he would serve forty years, he would have taken the offer of thirty-two years to serve from former', '- 12 - counsel, “but [trial counsel] told [Navarro] that he can get [him] less time to serve that’s why [he] hired [trial counsel.]” “It is well settled in this state that ‘[g]uilty pleas are valid only if voluntarily and intelligently entered, and the record must so affirmatively disclose’ facts pertaining to those requirements.” Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 314 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Figueroa, 639 A.2d at 498). A defendant’s plea “will be vacated unless the record shows that the court has conducted an on-the-record examination of the defendant before accepting [the] plea [in order] to determine if the plea is being made voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.” State v. Frazar, 822 A.2d 931, 935 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Ouimette v. State, 785 A.2d 1132, 1136 (R.I. 2001)).', 'In her review of the proceedings, the postconviction-relief justice acknowledged the extended nature of the sentencing hearing. In addition, she thoroughly studied the transcript of the plea proceeding and concluded that the hearing justice who presided over said proceeding was “very clear” to Navarro as to “what the plea was—what the cap of the plea was.” She further found that the hearing justice informed Navarro of his rights in relation to the plea. She considered the hearing justice’s explanation to Navarro regarding the nature of the capped plea, as well as the hearing justice’s warning to Navarro that once he accepted the plea, he could not change his mind. She cited to the hearing justice’s statement to Navarro that if the maximum sentence was in fact imposed, he would have to serve forty years in prison; she also cited to the hearing justice’s follow-up question asking Navarro if he understood and Navarro’s affirmative answer. The postconviction-relief justice also took note of the hearing justice’s inquiry to Navarro as to whether he had any questions, to which Navarro replied, “No.” She further considered the hearing justice’s explanation to Navarro regarding the upcoming sentencing hearing. She also noted that, although trial counsel may have made a sentence recommendation', '- 13 - to the hearing justice during the sentencing proceedings that Navarro should serve between fifteen and twenty years, the hearing justice was nevertheless “very clear” at the plea hearing that Navarro “could very well end up serving [forty] years in jail.”', 'After her thorough review of the record, the postconviction-relief justice concluded that Navarro entered into the plea agreement “with knowledge, consent, voluntarily, understanding what was happening, the nature of the plea, [and] the consequences of it.” We agree; and we conclude that, in making her determination, the postconviction-relief justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence, nor did she clearly err in her denial of Navarro’s postconviction- relief application.', 'B', 'Shatney Proceedings', 'We note that at the outset of the postconviction-relief proceedings in Superior Court, the justice mischaracterized postconviction counsel’s role in Navarro’s case as an investigator appointed by the court to determine if Navarro’s claims had merit, as opposed to Navarro’s counsel in pursuit of postconviction relief. We have previously clarified that neither Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000)', '“nor its progeny contemplates the appointment of an objective or', 'independent lawyer who does not represent the applicant,’ and that', '‘[g]enerally, Shatney considerations should arise after counsel has', 'been appointed in accordance with § 10-9.1-5 and the applicant has', 'been provided with a meaningful discussion with counsel about the', 'issues that may or may not be suitable grounds for postconviction', 'relief.” Ramirez v. State, 89 A.3d 836, 840 (R.I. 2014) (quoting', 'Campbell, 56 A.3d at 456).', 'Despite the postconviction-relief justice’s mistaken description of postconviction counsel’s role, postconviction counsel properly represented Navarro pursuant to the requirements set forth in Shatney. Postconviction counsel described his role as being appointed to represent', '- 14 - Navarro in his postconviction-relief application. Postconviction counsel appropriately conducted his representation of Navarro by meeting with Navarro’s trial counsel “at least four times regarding the actual plea.” In addition, he met with Navarro four times and reviewed all the transcripts and exhibits that he deemed pertinent. Notwithstanding the brevity of postconviction counsel’s Shatney memorandum—only four pages—we conclude that his investigation of Navarro’s claims was reasonable under Shatney. Campbell, 56 A.3d at 455-56 (noting that according to Shatney, an attorney “may withdraw from * * * representation when it becomes clear, after a reasonable investigation, that some or all of the applicant’s claims lack merit”).', 'Furthermore, we are satisfied that the postconviction-relief justice was cognizant of this Court’s concerns with the Shatney procedures and made concerted efforts to ensure that Navarro understood his rights in the Shatney context. See Motyka, 172 A.3d at 1206 (recognizing that, when the court permits counsel to withdraw pursuant to Shatney, it must “advise the applicant that he or she shall be required to proceed pro se, if he or she chooses to pursue the application”) (quoting Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135). The postconviction-relief justice asked Navarro three times if he wanted an evidentiary hearing or to pursue the matter pro se, and each time he responded in the negative. Moreover, the justice brought Navarro into court on three separate occasions, and each time he was given an opportunity to be heard. On the third and final court date, August 1, 2012, the postconviction-relief justice noted that since the last court date:', '“[O]ur Rhode Island Supreme Court had entered or filed a case on', 'post[]conviction relief and my understanding from that case is that', 'I need to be very specific with you, sir, as to what you wanted to', 'do after [postconviction counsel] finished and presented his', 'Shatney memo. I gave you an opportunity to refile it and to argue', 'it again if you wish to. You told me you did not wish to do that. I', 'guess—I think I need to be clearer with you and indicate to you', 'that if you wish to produce any witnesses or have an evidentiary', 'hearing on the issues that you have raised in your post[]conviction', 'relief, you have the right to do that and proceed on this on your', '- 15 -', 'own. * * * Do you want to have—produce evidence or have an', 'evidentiary hearing on the issues that you have raised?” In response, Navarro replied: “I just wanted to appeal to the Supreme Court.”', 'We note that, after the postconviction-relief justice reviewed all the evidence, agreed with postconviction counsel that Navarro’s postconviction-relief application was without merit, accepted postconviction counsel’s no-merit Shatney memorandum, and indicated that she was “going to allow him to withdraw[,]” postconviction counsel’s representation of Navarro should have ceased. Instead, however, subsequent to her Shatney determination, the postconviction- relief justice informed Navarro that postconviction counsel could advise him on his plans to file a motion for “[s]entence modification.”', 'Recently, in Motyka, we questioned whether the proceedings in that case met the requirements set forth in Shatney. Motyka, 172 A.3d at 1207. We expressed concern when the applicant’s postconviction counsel appeared to be advising the applicant during the Shatney hearing while simultaneously arguing in support of his no-merit memorandum. Id. at 1207, 1207 n.3.', 'Additionally, we took issue in that case with the justice’s statement that she found postconviction counsel’s no-merit memorandum “justified” and “therefore” the applicant’s postconviction-relief application was denied and dismissed. Id. We clarified that a justice’s grant of a postconviction counsel’s motion to withdraw under Shatney is not determinative of the merits of an applicant’s postconviction-relief application. Id.', 'Here, the postconviction-relief justice asked postconviction counsel to continue to advise Navarro in the matter, specifically with respect to his appeal, while postconviction counsel concurrently offered his opinion that Navarro’s postconviction-relief application lacked merit. We reiterate that, in a Shatney proceeding, counsel may indeed seek to withdraw his or her representation “when it becomes clear, after a reasonable investigation, that some or all of the', '- 16 - applicant’s claims lack merit.” Campbell, 56 A.3d at 455-56.', 'In this case, once the postconviction-relief justice made her decision to grant the Shatney motion, postconviction counsel should no longer have been expected or allowed to represent Navarro at the subsequent two court dates. We note, however, that this case was heard by the postconviction-relief justice prior to a number of cases decided by this Court that clarify the requirements under Shatney. See, e.g., Motyka, 172 A.3d at 1208; Ramirez, 89 A.3d at 839-40; Campbell, 56 A.3d at 455-56. In addition, notwithstanding the postconviction-relief justice’s comments on the record that seem to conflate her Shatney review with her review of the merits of Navarro’s postconviction-relief application, she nevertheless conducted a thorough and independent review of the record in support of her denial of Navarro’s postconviction-relief application. Therefore, it is our opinion that any Shatney-related issues were cured.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For all the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment denying Navarro’s application for postconviction relief.

(Chase), for summary judgment with respect to all claims asserted by Pineda against Chase. This matter came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In 2008, Pineda attempted to refinance loans secured by mortgages on two properties that he owned in Providence. During the refinance proceedings, Pasquale Scavitti III (Scavitti), an attorney, acted as the settlement agent.1 Scavitti and Pineda had been acquaintances, and in 2006, Scavitti assisted Pineda with a previous refinancing for those same two properties. It is 1', 'Scavitti is now disbarred.', '-1- undisputed that in connection with Pineda’s 2008 refinancing, Scavitti defalcated funds disbursed by Chase that were intended to satisfy promissory notes secured by mortgages on Pineda’s two properties.', 'On November 26, 2008, Pineda filed a complaint in Superior Court naming both Chase and Scavitti as defendants.2 Pineda claimed that Chase agreed to issue him two new loans, each in the amount of $195,000, to pay promissory notes secured by mortgages on the properties,3 but that Scavitti, whom Chase engaged as its closing agent, converted the loan proceeds for his own use and failed to disburse them. Specifically, Pineda alleged breach of fiduciary duty, civil liability for a crime pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-1-2, breach of contract, conversion, and unjust enrichment. Subsequently, Chase moved for summary judgment. Chase contended that it could not be held liable for Scavitti’s tortious conduct under a theory of respondeat superior.', 'At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, Chase maintained that summary judgment was proper because Scavitti was not Chase’s attorney during the closing and therefore was not an agent of Chase. In the alternative, Chase contended that, even if Scavitti was Chase’s attorney, Scavitti’s defalcation of the loan funds was not within the scope of any alleged agency relationship with Chase. Pineda, on the other hand, argued that Chase was liable for Scavitti’s actions because Chase gave Scavitti the authority to receive and disburse the loan funds, and Scavitti’s malfeasance was within that authority.', 'In his bench decision, the hearing justice found that there was a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether Scavitti was acting as an agent of Chase at the time he absconded with the loan funds. However, the hearing justice ultimately determined that summary judgment was 2', 'Pineda later amended his complaint to add four additional defendants: The Bank of New York, Countrywide Servicing L.P., MERS, Inc., and New Century Mortgage Corporation. 3', 'Significantly, Chase represented at oral argument that it has canceled the promissory notes and discharged both mortgages.', '-2- appropriate because, even if Scavitti were an agent of Chase, there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Scavitti’s conduct was within the scope of the purported agency relationship with Chase. Specifically, the hearing justice relied on the Restatement (Second) Agency § 228(1)(c) at 504 (1958) for the proposition that a servant’s conduct is only considered within the scope of an agency relationship for respondeat superior purposes if “it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master.” He concluded that “there is no evidence, and none has been submitted by [Pineda], that the conduct of Mr. Scavitti would have been in any way, at least in part, for the purpose of serving the master, even if Chase was the master.”', 'Following the entry of summary judgment in favor of Chase, Chase filed a motion for the entry of final judgment under Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, to which Pineda assented. Final judgment was entered on January 29, 2016, and Pineda timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews a hearing justice’s grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. Fogarty v. Palumbo, 163 A.3d 526, 532 (R.I. 2017). In our review, we “employ[] the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.” Tarro v. Checrallah, 60 A.3d 598, 601 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Great American E & S Insurance Co. v. End Zone Pub & Grill of Narragansett, Inc., 45 A.3d 571, 574 (R.I. 2012)). “We will affirm a lower court’s decision only if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id. (quoting Great American E & S Insurance Co., 45 A.3d at 574). “Summary judgment is proper if no genuine issues of material fact are evident from ‘the', '-3- pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any’ and, in addition, the motion justice finds that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.” Lavoie v. North East Knitting, Inc., 918 A.2d 225, 227-28 (R.I. 2007) (quoting Super. R. Civ. P. 56(c)). “[T]he nonmoving party bears the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.” Great American E & S Insurance Co., 45 A.3d at 574 (quoting Narragansett Improvement Co. v. Wheeler, 21 A.3d 430, 438 (R.I. 2011)). “Therefore, summary judgment should enter ‘against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case * * *.’” Lavoie, 918 A.2d at 228 (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986)).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'Pineda raises several issues on appeal—namely, whether: (1) there is an issue of fact as to whether Scavitti’s defalcation was within the scope of his agency relationship with Chase; (2) the consequences of Scavitti’s defalcation should be borne by Chase; (3) the hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment was proper; and (4) the dismissal of the case violated Pineda’s constitutional right to a jury trial.', 'A', 'Agency Relationship between Scavitti and Chase', 'At the outset, we note that “[a]n agency relationship exists when: (1) the principal manifests that the agent will act for him, (2) the agent accepts the undertaking, and (3) the parties agree that the principal will be in control of the undertaking.” Credit Union Central Falls v.', '-4- Groff, 966 A.2d 1262, 1268 (R.I. 2009). In his decision, the hearing justice concluded that a genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to whether Scavitti was an agent of Chase. This finding is consistent with our previous conclusions that “the existence of an agency relationship sufficient to allow vicarious liability to attach * * * is an issue of fact[.]” McNulty v. Chip, 116 A.3d 173, 185 (R.I. 2015).', 'After reviewing the record de novo, we concur with the hearing justice’s conclusion that a genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to the question of agency. During his deposition, Scavitti discussed his relationship with Chase in regard to the real estate closing proceedings for Pineda’s two properties. Scavitti testified that Pineda selected Scavitti’s office to serve as the settlement agent in the closing proceedings. In his capacity as settlement agent, Scavitti testified that he received a package from Chase containing information pertinent to the closing, including the closing instructions. Scavitti also testified that his office signed the settlement statement as the settlement agent, prepared a title commitment binder and sent it to Chase, sent wiring instructions and additional documents to Chase, and received authorization from Chase to close the transaction. Scavitti also testified that the funds provided by Chase were wired to his office’s bank account. In addition, Scavitti testified that it was Pineda who paid him for his work.', 'Pineda, during his deposition, testified that when he decided to refinance his properties in 2008, he went to Scavitti’s office and completed the loan application. In addition, Pineda completed and signed a form entitled “Rhode Island Disclosures,” on which the box indicating “I DO want the Lender to choose a title attorney” was checked, but then crossed out, and the box indicating “I DO NOT want the Lender to choose an attorney” was checked, with Scavitti’s name and contact information provided.', 'Pineda testified that he did not know what the', '-5- document was because he could not read English, but agreed that his signature was inscribed at the bottom of the form.', 'In the present case, as in Groff, we are again wading in “the murky ethical waters of what is undoubtedly a common practice at real estate closings [and] we are reluctant to dive in” and decide the issue of agency at the summary-judgment stage. Groff, 966 A.2d at 1270, 1275 (affirming summary judgment on other grounds, but determining that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether an attorney who embezzled loan proceeds at a real estate closing, while acting as a closing agent, had an attorney-client relationship, and thus, an agency relationship, with the lender or the borrower); see Baker v. ICA Mortgage Corporation, 588 A.2d 616, 617-18 (R.I. 1991) (vacating a grant of summary judgment because a question of fact existed as to whether an attorney, who failed to apply loan proceeds to a mortgage, represented the mortgagee or was an agent of the mortgagor). Thus, we concur with the hearing justice’s finding that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether Scavitti was an agent of Pineda or Chase.', 'B', 'Scavitti’s Malfeasance and the Scope of His Alleged Agency Relationship with Chase', 'The hearing justice did not conclude his analysis upon finding that a genuine issue of material fact existed with respect to the question of agency. Instead, he proceeded to the scope- of-employment element of the agency test and decided that summary judgment was appropriate. On appeal, Pineda argues that the hearing justice erred in finding that, in addition to the elements needed to establish agency, he was also required to show that Scavitti’s defalcation benefited Chase. Chase maintains, however, that the hearing justice’s inquiry was properly focused on whether Scavitti acted within the scope of his alleged agency relationship with Chase when he', '-6- stole the loan funds for his own benefit. Chase further contends that, because it is undisputed that Scavitti acted in his own interest, Pineda’s claim must fail.', 'In applying the Restatement (Second) Agency approach, we have held that “[a]n employer is liable for the acts of an employee when the employee is acting within the scope of his or her employment.” Vargas Manufacturing Co. v. Friedman, 661 A.2d 48, 53 (R.I. 1995) (citing Restatement (Second) Agency §§ 140, 228).', 'In making his scope-of-employment determination, the hearing justice in the present case relied on the Restatement, which provides that the conduct of a servant is within the scope of employment if:', '“(a) it is of the kind he is employed to perform;', '“(b) it occurs substantially within the authorized time and space', 'limits;', '“(c) it is actuated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the master,', 'and', '“(d) if force is intentionally used by the servant against another, the', 'use of force is not unexpectable by the master.” Restatement', '(Second) Agency § 228 at 504. The hearing justice found no disputed facts pertaining to the third prong of the scope-of- employment test. An act is considered within the scope of an agency relationship only if the servant is at least partly motivated by his or her intent to serve the master. Id. Moreover, when examining the third prong, the Restatement provides that “[i]t is the state of the servant’s mind which is material.” Id. at § 235 cmt. a at 520. Therefore, in order to determine Scavitti’s intent, we must look to his manifestations and the attendant circumstances. Id.', 'After looking at the evidence presented, the hearing justice determined that Scavitti’s conduct in converting the loan funds was not motivated, in any part, by a purpose to serve Chase. It was, in fact, Scavitti’s uncontroverted testimony that his defalcation of the loan funds was in no way motivated by a purpose to serve Chase. During his deposition, Scavitti was asked “[W]hen you decided to take the loan proceeds and use it for a purpose other than what’s set', '-7- forth in the closing instructions from Chase, what interests of Chase were you advancing, if any?”—to which Scavitti responded, “None.” Moreover, Scavitti admitted that Chase’s closing instructions directed him to use the funds received from Chase to pay off the prior mortgage that preceded Chase’s loan, yet Scavitti failed to make that payment and acknowledged the fact that the “misapplication of the[] funds” did not benefit Chase. Thus, Scavitti’s defalcation was “so different from the act authorized that it [was] not within the scope of the employment” or the purported agency relationship. Restatement (Second) Agency § 228 cmt. d at 505. Moreover, Scavitti’s conduct was “clearly inappropriate” and “unforeseeable in the accomplishment of the authorized result.” Id. at § 231 cmt. a at 513. Additionally, Scavitti’s malfeasance caused Chase to not be placed in the first lien position on the property; therefore, instead of benefiting Chase, arguably his actions injured Chase. See Burke v. St. Pierre, 642 A.2d 671, 672 (R.I. 1994) (concluding that the servant’s actions were outside the scope of employment, rendering summary judgment proper because the servant acted without authorization from the master and “in direct contravention of company policy”).', 'As the moving party, Chase established that no genuine issue of material fact existed in regard to whether the alleged servant, Scavitti, acted within the scope of the alleged agency relationship and with the purpose of serving the alleged master, Chase. At that point, the burden shifted to Pineda to prove the existence of a disputed issue of material fact. See Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 391 (R.I. 2008) (concluding that once “the movant * * * establish[es] that there exists no genuine dispute with respect to the material facts of the case * * * [t]he nonmovant must, by competent evidence, prove the existence of a disputed issue of material fact”). Pineda contends that the record before the Superior Court included evidence that there was a disputed issue of material fact regarding whether Chase benefited from Scavitti’s', '-8- tortious conduct.', 'Specifically, he asserts that Chase benefited from Scavitti’s actions by receiving “two prima facie valid recorded mortgages upon the [p]laintiff’s realty, [and] two prima facie valid negotiable promissory notes held by * * * Chase * * * with a combined face value of approximately $400,000[].”', 'Additionally, he maintains that Chase benefited by receiving several installments of payments on the notes from Pineda subsequent to the closing of the loans. Furthermore, he contends that Chase accepted and held the payments under the notes in addition to other payments made before and at the closing.', 'However, Pineda failed to raise these alleged issues of fact before the hearing justice, thereby waiving this argument. See In re Shy C., 126 A.3d 433, 434, 435 (R.I. 2015) (noting that the raise-or-waive rule is a “long adhered to” and “important jurisprudential principle” providing that “an issue that has not been raised and articulated previously at trial is not properly preserved for appellate review”) (quoting State v.

11,Lauren Daley Ainsworth : v. : John Ainsworth. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The plaintiff, Lauren Daley Ainsworth, appeals from a July 22, 2015 order of the Family Court denying her motion to relocate with the parties’ four minor children from Rhode Island to Australia. Her several appellate contentions are summarized later in this opinion.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After reviewing the record and considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiff, Lauren, and defendant, John,1 were married in Australia on October 2, 1999, and four children were born of that marriage: Hope, Sydney, Jenny, and Jack.2 Lauren is a citizen of Australia with permanent residency status in the United States, while John is a citizen of the United States; the children have dual citizenship. On March 23, 2011, Lauren filed for divorce on the ground that irreconcilable differences between the parties had led to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage. On October 31, 2012, while the divorce proceedings were pending, Lauren filed a motion to relocate to Australia with the children. On December 7, 2012, a justice of the Family Court issued a decision pending entry of final judgment,3 which (in pertinent part) awarded joint custody of the children to the parties, with “physical possession” of the children being granted to Lauren and with John having “all reasonable rights of visitation.”4 More than a year later, a different justice of the Family Court conducted a hearing on Lauren’s motion to relocate, which hearing took place over the course of five days in July and August of 2014. On August 27, 2014, said justice issued a bench decision denying the motion to relocate; and, on July 22, 2015, a final order denying the motion to relocate was entered, from which Lauren timely appealed. We summarize below the pertinent testimony adduced at the hearing on Lauren’s motion to relocate. 1', 'We refer to the parties by their first names for the purpose of clarity only; we intend no disrespect by doing so. 2', 'The record reflects that all four children were born in the United States—Hope in January of 2001; Sydney in July of 2003; Jenny in November of 2007; and Jack in September of 2009. 3', 'See Rule 1.8 of the Rhode Island Family Court Rules of Practice. 4', 'A final judgment granting the divorce was not entered until July 22, 2015; the reason for the delay is not clear from the record.', '-2-', 'A', 'The Testimony of Lauren', 'Lauren testified that, at the beginning, her marriage to John was “really good,” but that it began to deteriorate after the first six months—a deterioration that she attributed to John’s alcohol abuse. Lauren recounted several instances of John’s behavior while he was intoxicated, including several occasions when John allegedly threw various objects at her in the presence of the children. She also testified about John’s purported abuse of the family dog and about a recurring situation in which John would allegedly drive up and down the street in front of their home in the presence of the children, “do[ing] burn outs” and “throw[ing] beer bottles.” She further testified about an incident in November of 2011, after the divorce proceedings had commenced and while the children were living primarily with her and occasionally visiting John. According to Lauren, on November 18, 2011, John became intoxicated while caring for the children during one of their visits with him. She stated that, on that date, she had received a “hysterical” phone call from Sydney, who said that she “couldn’t wake up daddy.” Lauren further testified that, upon receiving Sydney’s phone call and before driving to John’s residence, she had called the police and asked them to check on the children. The police report concerning that incident (a full exhibit at the hearing) stated that, when Lauren arrived to pick up the children, John “became very irate” and lunged at Lauren while “screaming for her to leave.”', 'Lauren next testified that, during the divorce proceedings, both prior to and subsequent to the issuance of the December 7, 2012 decision pending entry of final judgment, she, John, and the children began attending monthly counseling sessions with Dr. Brian C. Hayden. She stated that the purpose of the counseling sessions was to conduct “reunification therapy for all of the children with their father and then co-parenting for John and myself.” According to Lauren, these', '-3- sessions were successful; she added that, as a result, the Family Court allowed the children to “have unsupervised overnight visitation with their father.” However, Lauren further stated that, in spite of the apparent improvement in the relations between the parties, John still used his phone to record his interactions with her whenever she picked up or dropped off the children for visitation.', 'Lauren explained that she wished to relocate with the children to Australia because such a relocation would offer her significantly better economic prospects and would provide a better quality of life for her and the children and also because she was concerned about her father, who lived in Australia and who had, shortly before the filing of her motion to relocate, been diagnosed with a terminal illness. She testified that, despite the fact that she held a college degree from a university in Australia, she had been unable to find a well-paying, stable job in Rhode Island; she added that, as a result, she worked part-time cleaning houses, earning approximately $250 a week. She stated that, in contrast, she had been offered a management position at a store in Australia, at an approximate annual salary of $60,000. Lauren also testified that, while living in Rhode Island, she and the children had been relying on “food stamps” and heating assistance from the State of Rhode Island; she added that the house in which she resided with the children was then enmeshed in foreclosure proceedings. Lauren went on to state that, if she were permitted to relocate to Australia with the children, she and the children would be able to live in her parents’ home, rent-free, which would alleviate many of her financial concerns. Lauren also testified that she intended to seek further education in order to obtain a teaching degree as a way of improving her economic prospects. She testified as to her understanding that it would take “[s]even years part time; four years full time” to obtain a teaching degree in Rhode Island. She further testified as to her understanding that the pursuit of such a degree in Rhode Island would', '-4- cost her “[b]etween [$]80,000 and $100,000,” and she added that her lack of American citizenship made her ineligible for financial aid in this country. She stated that, in contrast, she could pursue a teaching degree at the University of Wollongong by paying an annual fee of $131.50 for full-time study; and a document reflecting her “Conditional Offer of Admission” to the graduate teaching program at that university was admitted as a full exhibit.', 'Lauren further testified that she believed that it was “very important for the children to have a strong relationship with both their mother and their father;” and, to that end, she proposed a visitation schedule whereby the children, if they were relocated to Australia, would fly to Rhode Island for visitation with John during their school breaks. She stated that, under her proposed visitation schedule, the children would visit their father in Rhode Island for two weeks in April, two weeks in July, and an additional six weeks in December and January; she clarified that the six-week visit would occur during the Australian Summer, when the school year in that country would be over. Lauren added that, in addition to the several proposed visits to Rhode Island by the children, John would be welcome to visit the children in Australia “whenever he liked.”', 'B', 'The Testimony of John', 'John testified that he had a “wonderful” relationship with his children. After acknowledging that his work as an “offshore fisherman” required regular absences from Rhode Island, John testified that he had been as actively involved in raising the children as he possibly could. He explained that, when he was on shore, he frequently took the children on bicycle rides and camping trips and participated in other outdoor activities with them. He further testified that he opposed Lauren’s motion to relocate to Australia with the children because, in his estimation,', '-5- it would cause his relationship with the children to “suffer greatly,” and he said that he was afraid that the children would grow to resent traveling from Australia to Rhode Island to visit him during their school breaks. He further testified that relocation would negatively impact the children’s relationships with his side of the family as well as their relationships with their school and church friends in Rhode Island.', 'While John admitted that he had suffered from an alcohol problem during his marriage to Lauren, he denied most of the alcohol-related misconduct about which Lauren testified, and he stated that he had never been convicted of the domestic assault charges which Lauren had lodged against him and which had served as the basis for the restraining orders that she had successfully sought. He did acknowledge, however, that, on November 18, 2011, police officers had removed the children from his care because he had, in his own words, “got[ten] drunk and passed out on the floor.” He testified that that incident had caused him to become temporarily estranged from his two oldest daughters, but he added that he had remained sober since that date and agreed that he was very proud that he had attended Alcoholics Anonymous.', 'John testified that, in April of 2012, during one of his visits with the children, he discovered a recording device which had been sewn into the clothing of one of the children; and he said that he believed Lauren was responsible for that device being there. (In an emergency motion filed with the Family Court on April 27, 2012, John had stated that he believed Lauren “ha[d] been serupticiously [sic] taping Dr. Hayden[’]s sessions as well,” and he asked the Family Court to prohibit Lauren from “alienat[ing] the minor children of the parties from their father.” Thereafter, the Family Court granted a “conditional [o]rder of removal” providing that the children would be removed from Lauren’s care if she continued to “record either audio or video of the minor children of the parties with their father, the counselors, father’s extended family or', '-6- any service providers during any visitations or otherwise.”) John further testified, however, that, despite what he characterized as Lauren’s attempts to alienate the children from him, the counseling sessions with Dr. Hayden were able to open the lines of communication between him and his two oldest daughters and that, as a result of the success of those sessions, he now enjoys regular, unsupervised visitation with all four children.', 'John stated that, when effectuating visitation, the parties would meet in public places to exchange the children, on which occasions he and Lauren did not speak to each other. He further admitted that he regularly used his iPhone to record the pick-up and drop-off interactions with Lauren in order “to protect [himself]” and “to keep [Lauren] honest.”5', 'C', 'The Testimony of the Guardian Ad Litem', 'The guardian ad litem, an attorney, testified that she became involved with the Ainsworth family in October of 2011 and that she thereafter submitted two reports to the Family Court: an interim report dated February 24, 2012 and a final report dated July 31, 2014. Both reports were admitted into evidence as full exhibits. In her interim report, the guardian ad litem stated that “relocation should only take place [at] a time when the relationship between Mr. Ainsworth and his youngest children has been firmly re-established and all avenues to re-establish the relationship between Mr. Ainsworth and his two older children have been exhausted.” In her final report, the guardian ad litem noted the practical difficulties that an international relocation would occasion for the parties, in view of the expensive and complex nature of international travel and the parties’ limited financial means. 5', 'Both John and Lauren testified in considerable detail about the poor quality of their relationship in the past and as of the time of the hearing. However, we see no necessity for narrating each and every detail of their testimonies in that regard.', '-7-', 'The guardian ad litem testified that, when she first became involved with the Ainsworth family, the relationship between John and Lauren was “very acrimonious;” and she recounted that, in 2012, Lauren had sewn a recording device into the clothing of one of the children. She added, however, that, since that incident, Lauren had become “very, very cooperative” with respect to arranging visitation and that, as a result, the children had “cemented and enriched” their relationships with John.', 'When asked about the children’s preferences with respect to the proposed relocation, the guardian ad litem admitted that, although she believed at least two of the children were old enough to express an opinion on the subject, she had not spoken directly to any of the children in “a long time,” estimating that approximately one year had elapsed since she had most recently had a conversation with any of the children. She testified in an internally inconsistent and noticeably halting manner as to the ages of the four children, and she admitted that she was “not sure” what grades the children were in.', 'The guardian ad litem’s final report recommended that Lauren “retain primary placement” of the children and that John continue to enjoy “frequent and liberal visitation” with the children. The final report of the guardian ad litem further stated that “relocation to Australia would certainly benefit [Lauren],” but she also noted that relocation would result in the children having only “minimal contact” with John. Additionally, her report stated that “the ability of the children to travel the distance from one continent to another at this point in their lives is very questionable, both from a feasibility and financial standpoint.” Although her final written report neither endorsed nor rejected the proposed relocation to Australia, the guardian ad litem testified unequivocally at the hearing that, in her opinion, relocation would not be in the best interests of the children.', '-8-', 'D', 'The Testimony of Christine McGrane', 'Christine McGrane testified that she was a registered nurse and that she had previously worked as a school nurse at the elementary school which Hope had formerly attended. She stated that she first encountered the Ainsworth family when Hope was in fourth grade, at which time she had provided Lauren with vouchers to purchase new shoes for the children. She testified that she thereafter kept the Ainsworth family “on [her] radar” with respect to their receiving various forms of assistance from the community, such as food for Thanksgiving, gifts at Christmastime, and heating assistance over the course of several winters.', 'E', 'The Hearing Justice’s Decision', 'On August 27, 2014, the hearing justice delivered a bench decision spanning twenty transcript pages denying Lauren’s motion to relocate.6 After summarizing the testimony of the witnesses and reviewing the exhibits introduced by both parties, the hearing justice stated that the “seminal question” in this case was “the feasibility of preserving the relationship between the non-relocating parent and [the] children through suitable visiting arrangements considering th[e] logistics and financial circumstances of the parties.”7 He questioned the practicability of Lauren’s proposed visitation schedule, which would require that the children make round-trip flights between Australia and Rhode Island several times each year; and he observed that such travel would impose “a very heavy financial burden” on the parties, neither of whom had “an abundance of money.” The hearing justice also found that “the testimony as well as the exhibits 6', 'A final order denying plaintiff’s motion to relocate was entered on July 22, 2015. 7', 'The phrase quoted by the hearing justice is from this Court’s opinion in Dupré v. Dupré, 857 A.2d 242, 258 (R.I. 2004).', '-9- presented in this case [indicated] that [Lauren] would not endeavor to actively foster a close and continuous relationship between the children and their father * * *.” The just-referenced finding was an important factor in the hearing justice’s ultimate conclusion that relocation would not be in the children’s best interests.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is a firmly established principle in family law that the paramount consideration in relocation cases is the best interests of the child or children.” DePrete v. DePrete, 44 A.3d 1260, 1271 (R.I. 2012) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The determination of what is in the best interests of the children is “appropriately placed in the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Dupré v. Dupré, 857 A.2d 242, 256 (R.I. 2004); see also Pettinato v. Pettinato, 582 A.2d 909, 913 (R.I. 1990). “On review, this Court will not disturb the findings of fact made by a justice of the Family Court with respect to the issue of custody and the best interests of the child[ren] unless the hearing justice abused his or her discretion in making such findings.” DePrete, 44 A.3d at 1270. Accordingly, we will affirm the Family Court’s ruling “unless the trial justice’s factual findings overlooked or misconceived material evidence or were clearly wrong.” McDonough v. McDonough, 962 A.2d 47, 52 (R.I. 2009); see also In re Estate of Ross, 131 A.3d 158, 166 (R.I. 2016).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The Pertinent Factors', 'This Court has set forth several factors that the hearing justice must consider in determining the best interests of the children when he or she is confronted with a motion to', '- 10 - relocate. First, the hearing justice must address the eight factors articulated in this Court’s opinion in Dupré. Second, the hearing justice must address such of the eight factors articulated in Pettinato as are relevant to the relocation issue. See Dupré, 857 A.2d at 257-59; Pettinato, 582 A.2d at 913-14.', 'In our opinion in Dupré, we identified the following factors that are to be considered “whenever a parent seeks to move with his or her children:”', '“(1) The nature, quality, extent of involvement, and duration of the', 'child’s relationship with the parent proposing to relocate and with', 'the non-relocating parent. * * *', '“* * *', '“(2) The reasonable likelihood that the relocation will enhance the', 'general quality of life for both the child and the parent seeking the', 'relocation, including, but not limited to, economic and emotional', 'benefits, and educational opportunities. * * *', '“(3) The probable impact that the relocation will have on the', 'child’s physical, educational, and emotional development.

It should also be noted that we have indicated that “[n]o single [Dupré] factor is dispositive” and that “[e]ach case will present its own unique circumstances that a trial justice must balance and weigh as he or she deems appropriate.” Valkoun v. Frizzle, 973 A.2d 566, 577 (R.I. 2009).', 'Our earlier decision in Pettinato had set forth the following factors that are to be “weighed in the best interests of the child analysis when relevant[:]”', '“1. The wishes of the child’s parent or parents regarding the child’s', 'custody.', '“2. The reasonable preference of the child, if the court deems the', 'child to be of sufficient intelligence, understanding, and experience', 'to express a preference.', '“3.

The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate a close', 'and continuous parent-child relationship between the child and the', 'other parent.” Pettinato, 582 A.2d at 913-14 (footnotes omitted). Just as we have said with respect to the Dupré factors, we have previously stated that, in assessing the Pettinato factors, “[t]he best interests of the child should not be determined by', '- 12 - assessing any one factor;” rather, “[t]he trial justice must consider a combination of and an interaction among all the relevant factors that affect the child’s best interests.” Id. at 914.', 'Additionally, we accord deference to the sound discretion of the hearing justice in assessing and weighing both sets of factors because “[i]t is the trial justice who is in the best position to determine what factors may be relevant on a case-by-case basis * * *.” Dupré, 857 A.2d at 257.', 'B', 'The Arguments on Appeal', 'Lauren makes three arguments on appeal. First, she contends that the hearing justice clearly erred in assessing the evidence because he gave “too much weight to [John’s] present appearance before the Court” and accorded too little weight to his past misdeeds, while also failing to give “adequate consideration” to the economic benefits that relocation would bring about for Lauren and the children. Further expounding on this argument, Lauren also contends that the hearing justice overlooked material evidence by failing to properly take into account the fact that the parties’ “utter loathing” for each other resulted in a “significant detriment” to the children. Second, Lauren argues that the hearing justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence when he “failed to acknowledge or address” the testimony of the school nurse (Christine McGrane), who, according to Lauren, had observed “the children at school and socially.” Third, Lauren contends that, in determining whether relocation would serve the best interests of the children, the hearing justice failed to properly apply the criteria set forth in the Dupré and Pettinato cases because there was no testimony about the children’s reasonable preferences with respect to the proposed relocation. We shall address each of these arguments in turn.', '- 13 -', 'C', 'The Argument as to the Weight of the Evidence', 'Lauren’s first argument on appeal is unavailing. In our view, the hearing justice appropriately weighed the Dupré factors (and the relevant Pettinato factors) and then proceeded to render a well-reasoned decision, which properly took into account all of the material evidence presented at the hearing.', 'In determining whether, as Lauren contends, the hearing justice accorded “too much weight to [John’s] present appearance before the Court” during the hearing while according too little weight to his previous misdeeds, we look to the hearing justice’s consideration of the first Dupré factor—viz., “[t]he nature, quality, extent of involvement, and duration of the child’s relationship with the parent proposing to relocate and with the non-relocating parent.” Dupré, 857 A.2d at 257. In assessing that factor, the hearing justice explicitly addressed John’s former alcohol abuse, finding that “[t]he breakup of [the] marriage was caused by [John’s] excessive drinking.” However, the hearing justice also acknowledged that, at the time of the hearing, both parents were engaged in meaningful relationships with the children; he found that “these children have a strong bond with their mother” and that John had regular contact and visitation with the children. He further found that John was “a member of [Alcoholics Anonymous]” and that he had been sober “since November, 2011.” He further observed that John “ha[d] done everything that the [Family Court had] required to re-establish his relationship with the children after the separation.”', 'Similarly, in assessing Lauren’s contention that the hearing justice failed to give adequate consideration to the positive economic benefits of relocation, we note the hearing justice’s analysis of the second and third Dupré factors. Id. at 258. In addressing the second Dupré factor', '- 14 - (viz., “[t]he reasonable likelihood that the relocation will enhance the general quality of life for both the child and the parent seeking the relocation, including, but not limited to, economic and emotional benefits, and educational opportunities”), the hearing justice specifically took into account the fact that “there [was] no doubt that * * * relocation would, in fact, serve to enhance the economic standing and well-being of the mother” and that, as a result, “the children’s economic standings would also be increased and favorably impacted.” Id. Likewise, in addressing the third Dupré factor (viz.,“[t]he probable impact that the relocation will have on the child’s physical, educational, and emotional development”), the hearing justice noted that, in view of the fact that the children had lived their entire lives in Rhode Island, where they attended school and were involved in their community, they had been “bonded to Rhode Island.” Upon reviewing the hearing justice’s findings and keeping in mind the applicable standard of review, we are unpersuaded by Lauren’s contention that the hearing justice improperly weighed the evidence with respect to John’s “present appearance before the Court” as compared with his past misdeeds or with respect to the potential economic benefits of relocation.', 'We would add that Lauren’s further contention that the hearing justice improperly weighed the impact that the parties’ “utter loathing” for each other had on the children is unpersuasive. The hearing justice expressly noted that the relationship between the parties was “horrible to put it mildly,” and he found that Lauren and John “d[id] not speak” except by email to arrange visitation, and that “[Lauren] doesn’t want to have anything to do with [John].” He cited as an example of the mistrust between the parties the fact that “on more than one occasion, the mother secretly placed electronic recording devices in the clothing of one or more of the children during visitation with their father * * *.” He further found that arranging visitation sometimes required between seventeen and twenty-four emails between the parties; and, he', '- 15 - accordingly questioned whether the parties would be capable of arranging international visitation on a regular basis, given the greater complexity inherent in such visitation. Then, after taking into account these considerations and the others previously mentioned, the hearing justice found that the petition for relocation to Australia should be denied.', 'It should go without saying that the “best interests” criterion requires a considered judgment to be made as to what will best serve the children. That is not to say, however, that the non-prevailing party in this case has failed to articulate legitimate arguments; nevertheless, in the end, a reasoned conclusion had to be made by the finder of fact. Conceivably, another judicial officer might have assessed the evidence in this case differently; but we perceive no reversible error in the conclusions reached by the hearing justice, and we are ever mindful of the principle that “we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for [that of the trial justice] even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.” Wellington Condominium Association v. Wellington Cove Condominium Association, 68 A.3d 594, 599 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Process Engineers & Constructors, Inc. v. DiGregorio, Inc., 93 A.3d 1047, 1052 (R.I. 2014); Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 41 (R.I. 2009); see generally Cone v. West Virginia Pulp & Paper Co., 330 U.S. 212, 216 (1947) (Black, J.) (stating, albeit in the context of a slightly different procedural issue, that there should be deference at the appellate level to the discretionary determination of “the judge who saw and heard the witnesses and has the feel of the case which no appellate printed transcript can impart”). After carefully scrutinizing the record, it is our view that the hearing justice pointed to sufficient evidence in the record to support his conclusion that the nature of the parties’ relationship militated against allowing Lauren to relocate to a distant country with the minor children. As such, we perceive no error in the weight he accorded to the negative relationship between the parties.', '- 16 -', 'D', 'The Argument as to the Testimony of Christine McGrane', 'Lauren’s second argument on appeal (viz., that the hearing justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence by failing to reference Christine McGrane’s testimony in his decision) is also unpersuasive. It is well established that a hearing justice “need not engage in an exhaustive review and analysis of all of the evidence and testimony presented at trial” so long as he or she “make[s] reference to such facts disclosed by the testimony as have motivated his or her conclusion.” Bitgood v. Greene, 108 A.3d 1023, 1028 (R.I. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also H.J. Baker & Bro., Inc. v. Orgonics, Inc., 554 A.2d 196, 202 (R.I. 1989) (concluding that the hearing justice need not refer to “every piece of evidence” so long as he refers to “the specific evidence that prompted his decision”). In the instant case, although the hearing justice did not mention Ms. McGrane by name, his decision did refer to the only truly salient aspect of her brief testimony—namely, that Lauren has historically suffered from financial hardships. Specifically, he found that, at the time of the relocation hearing, Lauren was unemployed, “surviving on food stamps and the generosity of friends and church members,” and that she was “in the process of having her home foreclosed * * *.” The record reflects that the hearing justice properly considered Lauren’s financial situation insofar as it was relevant to determining whether relocation would be in the children’s best interests. Accordingly, we perceive no reversible error in the hearing justice’s not mentioning Ms. McGrane by name in his decision and not delving into the details of her testimony.', '- 17 -', 'E', 'The Argument as to the Reasonable Preferences of the Children', 'With respect to Lauren’s third argument (viz., that the hearing justice abused his discretion by failing to hear testimony about the children’s reasonable preferences regarding the proposed relocation), we again perceive no error. Lauren bases this argument on the second Pettinato factor, which provides that, when passing on a motion to relocate, the hearing justice must consider “[t]he reasonable preference of the child, if the court deems the child to be of sufficient intelligence, understanding, and experience to express a preference.” Pettinato, 582 A.2d at 913. Although Lauren correctly notes that the hearing justice did not hear any testimony about the reasonable preferences of the “two oldest of the parties’ minor children,” it is nonetheless our view that the hearing justice properly assessed all of the Dupré factors and the relevant Pettinato factors and that he had no duty to act sua sponte to seek additional evidence, such as testimony by the children. While we recognize that judicial officers have the authority to call and interrogate witnesses, we are of the opinion that they are not usually obliged to call such witnesses when the parties have opted not to do so.

He stated that “[t]he Family Court relies on guardians ad litem * * * to advocate for the best interest of the child * * * [and] to bring to the Court’s attention the wishes and desires of the children.” He found that it had been more than a year since the guardian ad litem had spoken with the children, and he expressed that he was less 8', 'It is noteworthy that Lauren was represented by counsel (as was John) at the hearing on the motion to relocate.', '- 18 - than thrilled with her inability to adequately represent their interests.

12,Peter E. Ucci et al. : v. : Town of Coventry. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. This case arises out of a dispute concerning a very small piece of real property in the Town of Coventry (the Town), which property the Town contended had been dedicated to the Town (as a public street) in 1946. The Town appeals from a February 4, 2016 declaratory judgment of the Superior Court entered following the grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, Peter E. Ucci and John S. Ucci. The hearing justice’s grant of the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment was predicated on his determination that, even if he assumed for the sake of deciding that there had been a dedication, “[t]here [was still] nothing to support the position [of the Town] that this dedication was accepted either by public use or by official action.” On appeal, the Town contends that the hearing justice erred in so ruling. The Town further contends that the hearing justice erred by not dismissing plaintiffs’ action due to their alleged failure to join indispensable parties.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After reviewing the record and considering the written and oral submissions', '-1- of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The small piece of property at issue is roughly sketched on a recorded plat entitled “PLAN SHOWING LOTS 1, 2, 3 + 4 ON THE UCCI PLAT, OWNED BY ELVIRO and FILOMENA UCCI, Ray C. Matteson Eng’r, September 1946” (the 1946 Plat); it is a strip of land thirty-feet wide, one hundred ninety-three feet long on one side, and two hundred ten feet long on the other side.', 'The strip is bordered on its southern side by plaintiffs’ property (designated as Lot 3 on the 1946 Plat), on its eastern side by Benoit Street, on its western side by a body of water called “Middle Pond,” and on its northern side by a parcel of land designated as Lot 4. It is undisputed that the 1946 Plat does not, on its face, indicate the purpose of the disputed strip of land. It is further undisputed that the owner of Lot 4 is not a party to this case.', 'On October 9, 2013, plaintiffs filed a complaint against the Town in Superior Court, seeking a declaratory judgment1 to the effect that they were the owners in fee simple of the disputed strip of land. (The plaintiffs alleged in their Complaint that the Town had “designated the area in question as Tax Assessor’s Map 62 Lot 85.4 and [had] taxed the same to the Plaintiff[s],” which allegation the Town denied in its answer.) On November 24, 2015, the Town moved for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiffs did not own the disputed strip of land because, according to the Town, said strip of land was dedicated as a public way because it 1', 'The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9, “vests the Superior Court with the power to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed.” N & M Properties, LLC v. Town of West Warwick ex rel. Moore, 964 A.2d 1141, 1144 (R.I. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '-2- appears on the 1946 Plat, which had been recorded, and because lots were sold with reference to that plat.', 'The plaintiffs filed an objection to the Town’s motion for summary judgment as well as a cross-motion for summary judgment. In their memorandum of law, plaintiffs argued that, in order for private property to become a public street by way of dedication, there must be “a manifest intent by the land owner to dedicate the land in question called an incipient dedication or offer to dedicate” as well as “an acceptance by the public either by public use or by official action to accept the same on behalf of the municipality.” The plaintiffs argued that, even if the original owners of the 1946 Plat had offered to dedicate the strip of land at issue, the Town had never accepted that purported offer of dedication, either by public use or by official action and that, therefore, one of the mandatory requirements for there to be a dedication had not been satisfied.', 'On January 11, 2016, a justice of the Superior Court conducted a hearing on the cross- motions for summary judgment. At that hearing, the Town expressly conceded on the record that there had been no acceptance of the purported offer of dedication, either by public use or by official action. In light of that concession and after observing that “the standard for dedication requires both dedication and acceptance,” the hearing justice concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to the Town’s not having accepted the purported offer of dedication. Accordingly, on January 19, 2016, he granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs.', 'Judgment entered on February 4, 2016. The Town timely appealed from that judgment.', '-3-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.” Newstone Development, LLC v. East Pacific, LLC, 140 A.3d 100, 103 (R.I. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). We will affirm a trial court’s decision granting summary judgment “only if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). We have further stated that “the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). And it is a basic principle that “summary judgment should enter against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case * * *.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'III', 'The Indispensable Parties Contention', 'The Town contends that, because plaintiffs brought this action under the Declaratory Judgments Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9, their failure to join the abutting landowners as “indispensable parties” was fatal to their claims. See § 9-30-11. The Town avers that the hearing justice erred when he did not dismiss the case pursuant to Rule 12(b)(7) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In view of the Town’s failure to have preserved this issue, we do not consider it necessary to address this contention.', '-4-', 'While the Town, in the fifth of the eight affirmative defenses contained in its answer filed on November 18, 2013, did allude to plaintiffs’ alleged failure “to join an indispensable party,” at no time thereafter did it seek to flesh out the meaning of that terse sentence, which is worded in the singular and does not identify in any way who it was that the Town believed should be joined. In addition, the Town never brought the indispensable party issue to the attention of the trial court except in a single sentence uttered at the very end of the summary judgment hearing on January 11, 2016. In our view, the indispensable parties defense has not been adequately preserved for appellate review.2', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'This Court recently issued an opinion involving the issue of dedication of property to the public, wherein we summarized several of the basic principles that are pertinent to the instant case. Kilmartin v. Barbuto, 158 A.3d 735 (R.I. 2017), as amended (May 3, 2017). In that case, we recognized that “[i]t is well-settled that the dedication of property to the public is an exceptional and unusual method by which a landowner passes to another an interest in his [or her] property.” Barbuto, 158 A.3d at 747 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Barbuto opinion went on to state in no uncertain terms that there are two requirements for there to be a valid dedication of property to the public:', '“A valid dedication requires: (1) a manifest intent by the', 'landowner to dedicate the land in question, called an incipient', 'dedication or offer to dedicate; and (2) an acceptance by the public', 'either by public use or by official action to accept the same on 2', 'Cf. Direct Action for Rights and Equality v. Gannon, 713 A.2d 218, 222 (R.I. 1998) (holding that an objection as to the plaintiff’s standing was waived when that issue “was never raised before the trial justice”).', '-5-', 'behalf of the municipality.” Id. (emphasis added) (internal', 'quotation marks omitted).', 'This Court will not recognize a public dedication of private land absent clear and convincing evidence that the municipality accepted the purported dedication. As we said in Barbuto, “a proponent must prove the second element of incipient dedication, public acceptance of the offer of dedication, by clear and convincing evidence.” Id. at 747 n.20 (internal quotation marks omitted). If the proponent of dedication is unable to establish both incipient dedication and acceptance, then, as a matter of law, there has been no dedication of private land for public use. See Donnelly v. Cowsill, 716 A.2d 742, 747 (R.I. 1998) (stating that, in situations such as the one presented to us in the instant case, the party advocating for the existence of a dedication bears the burden of “demonstrat[ing] that the land was dedicated by its owner as a street or a road and that the public has accepted the dedication”) (emphasis added).', 'On appeal, the Town argues that the hearing justice erred when he granted summary judgment in favor of plaintiffs based on his determination that the Town never accepted the offer of dedication because, in the Town’s view, the hearing justice’s decision “ignor[ed] the irrevocability” of the dedication.', 'A', 'There Has Been No Acceptance', 'As we have previously noted, “this Court’s inquiry is not predicated solely upon ascertaining of an owner’s intent to dedicate—it is [also] necessary to prove acceptance of the road by the public in order to establish its dedication.” Drescher v. Johannessen, 45 A.3d 1218, 1230-31 (R.I. 2012); see also Newport Realty, Inc. v. Lynch, 878 A.2d 1021, 1034-35 (R.I. 2005). And we have explained that “acceptance by the public * * * is accomplished in one of two ways: acceptance of the street[] by official action or [by] public user.” Newport Realty, Inc.,', '-6- 878 A.2d at 1033. It will also be recalled that “a proponent must prove the second element of incipient dedication, public acceptance of the offer of dedication, by clear and convincing evidence.” Barbuto, 158 A.3d at 747 n.20 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Our judicial task is greatly simplified (as was that of the hearing justice) by the fact that counsel for the Town, with laudable candor, expressly conceded at the hearing on the cross- motions for summary judgment that, regardless of whether or not the original owners in 1946 had actually expressed a “manifest intent” to dedicate the disputed strip of land, the offer of dedication was never accepted by the Town. Id. at 747. A significant colloquy between the hearing justice and counsel for the Town proceeded as follows:', '“THE COURT: * * * But, the second step for dedication is', 'acceptance. You would agree with me?', '“[COUNSEL FOR THE TOWN]: Yes, your Honor. We do agree', 'that we have no acceptance by public use. This is -- it’s a very', 'small strip of road. * * *', '“THE COURT: Well, there are two methods to demonstrate', 'acceptance.', '“[COUNSEL FOR THE TOWN]: Yes.', '“THE COURT: One, as you mentioned, public use, and the other,', 'the official action. There is nothing to support the position that', 'this dedication was accepted either by public use or by official', 'action.', '“[COUNSEL FOR THE TOWN]: Yes. I did search the minutes', 'and I didn’t find anything within, I believe, five years is what I', 'searched.” It is clear from this colloquy that the Town explicitly conceded that there had been no acceptance, by either public use or official action, of the purported offer of dedication of the strip of land. As such, the hearing justice did not err in concluding that there was no genuine dispute of material fact as to that issue and in granting summary judgment for the plaintiffs on that basis.', '-7-', 'B', 'The Irrevocability Argument', 'Undaunted by the conceded lack of acceptance, the Town goes on to argue that the hearing justice “ignor[ed] the irrevocability of [the] dedication” in the instant case despite the fact that, according to the Town, “the irrevocability of dedication is firmly part of our state’s jurisprudence;” and, further, as the Town argued below, because the dedication was irrevocable, the Town “can formally accept the dedication at any time.” To support its position, the Town relies primarily on a phrase that is included in the following passage from this Court’s opinion in the case of Day v. Edmondson, 68 R.I. 382, 389, 27 A.2d 904, 907 (1942):', '“When * * * the original owner[] duly recorded the central plat and', 'conveyed lot 48 by specific reference to that plat and to that lot as', 'abutting on North avenue, which appeared as a platted street', 'thereon, she made an offer of dedication. In those circumstances', 'such offer or tender of dedication was irrevocable, so far as the', 'grantor alone was concerned; and it could not be rescinded or', 'revoked by her without the consent of the owners of all lots', 'abutting on North avenue.” (Emphasis added.)', 'We are unpersuaded by the Town’s argument about the irrevocability of a dedication.', 'This Court’s decision in Day is readily distinguishable from the instant case. In the Day case, it was undisputed that “[w]hen Lydia C. Nichols, the original owner, duly recorded the central plat and conveyed lot 48 by specific reference to that plat and to that lot as abutting on North avenue, which appeared as a platted street thereon, she made an offer of dedication.” Id. In light of those undisputed and very clear facts, the Court in Day went on to say: “In those circumstances such offer or tender of dedication was irrevocable, so far as the grantor alone was concerned * * *.” Id. (emphasis added). In stark contrast, the instant case is completely lacking in such absence of dispute. The facts in this case are unlike the situation in Day because the issue of incipient dedication has from the commencement of this litigation been hotly contested.', '-8- For that reason, we do not believe that the instant case is in any way controlled by the “irrevocable” language in Day, which the Court in that case tied to the specific factual context before it.', 'We reject the notion that a municipality may hold in abeyance forever its right to accept an offer of dedication. Rather, we are of the opinion that such an offer must be accepted within a reasonable period of time. And the plain, blunt fact is that, even assuming arguendo that there was an incipient dedication, the Town conceded before the hearing justice that it had not accepted the purported dedication.', 'It is noteworthy that other jurisdictions have also concluded that, for a dedication to be consummated, an offer of dedication must be accepted within a reasonable time. See, e.g., Katz v. Town of West Hartford, 469 A.2d 410, 413 (Conn. 1983) (“[T]o be effectual an acceptance must occur within a reasonable period of time after the intent to dedicate the property has been manifested.”); City of Venice v. Madison County Ferry Co., 75 N.E. 105, 107 (Ill. 1905); Baker v. Petrin, 95 A.2d 806, 810 (Me. 1953) (“If there was an intention to dedicate it must be accepted in a reasonable time.”). We are especially impressed by the lapidary language used in an opinion of the Supreme Court of Michigan issued well over a century ago: “A dedication must be accepted within a reasonable time or the offer will be considered as withdrawn.” Cass County v. Banks, 7 N.W. 49, 53 (Mich. 1880) (quoted with approval in 2000 Baum Family Trust v. Babel, 793 N.W.2d 633, 642 (Mich. 2010)).', 'In the instant case, the record makes it clear beyond peradventure that the Town did not accept the purported offer of dedication of the disputed strip of land within a reasonable period of time because it has conceded that it has never acted to accept the purported offer of dedication, either by public use or through official action. See Newport Realty, Inc., 878 A.2d at', '-9- 1033. We are of the opinion that the passage of sixty-seven years from the alleged offer of dedication in 1946 until the commencement of the instant litigation in 2013 certainly cannot be said to constitute a reasonable period of time. See Northern Trust Co. v. Zoning Board of Review of Town of Westerly, 899 A.2d 517, 520 (R.I. 2006) (mem.) (noting “the egregious nature of the delay” on the part of the plaintiffs who were challenging the legality of a subdivision). Accordingly, even assuming arguendo that those who recorded the 1946 Plat intended to offer to dedicate to public use the small strip of land at issue in this case, we are firmly of the opinion that there was no completed dedication of that parcel because the Town failed to accept the purported offer of dedication within a reasonable period of time and thereby forfeited its right to accept that purported offer.3', 'Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the hearing justice did not err in issuing his declaratory judgment in the plaintiffs’ favor after having granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record in this case may be remanded to that tribunal. 3', 'Our decision in this case constitutes no precedent as to the rights that interested parties other than the Town may have with respect to the strip of land at issue.', '- 10 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'Peter F.

13,"SMS Financial XXV, LLC : v. : David Corsetti et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The plaintiff, SMS Financial XXV, LLC (plaintiff or SMS), appeals from a Superior Court judgment denying its motion for summary judgment and granting the cross-motion for summary judgment brought by the defendants, David Corsetti (Corsetti) and 385 South Main Street, LLC (collectively defendants). This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Corsetti was the principal of 385 South Main Street, LLC, which owned property located at 385 South Main Street, Providence (the property). In 2007, Sovereign Bank loaned $1 million to defendants in exchange for a promissory note secured by a mortgage on the property. The defendants failed to make payments on the note and defaulted. Thereafter, Sovereign Bank proceeded with a short sale of the property and received approximately $700,000 from the sale.', '-1- After the sale, on September 2, 2010, defendants issued to Sovereign Bank a promissory note in the amount of $200,000 (the note) for the deficiency on the original note. On June 23, 2011, Sovereign Bank assigned its interest in the note to SMS. Sovereign Bank had lost the note, however, so it instead delivered to SMS an allonge and a lost note affidavit.1 The lost note affidavit was sworn to by a Senior Vice President of Sovereign Bank and stated that Sovereign Bank was unable to locate the original note and had “made a due and diligent search for the [n]ote but ha[d] not found” it.', 'On January 22, 2016, SMS brought suit against defendants in Superior Court for defendants’ alleged breach of the terms of the note. SMS sought judgment against Corsetti and 385 South Main Street, LLC, jointly and severally, for the payment of the note’s $200,000 principal amount, interest totaling $189,600 plus accruing interest, late fees, costs, and attorneys’ fees. The defendants raised multiple affirmative defenses in their answer, including estoppel, release, waiver, laches, unclean hands, and failure to mitigate damages. On July 25, 2016, SMS moved for summary judgment against defendants on the ground that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to defendants’ breach of the note.', 'The defendants objected to SMS’s motion for summary judgment and filed a cross- motion for summary judgment, asserting that SMS “is unable to enforce or collect upon” the note because the note was lost. Specifically, defendants referenced G.L. 1956 § 6A-3-309(a) of Rhode Island’s enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code (Rhode Island UCC), which governs the enforcement of lost, destroyed, or stolen instruments, and provides that: 1', 'An allonge is defined as “[a] slip of paper sometimes attached to a negotiable instrument for the purpose of receiving further indorsements when the original paper is filled with indorsements.” Black’s Law Dictionary 92 (10th ed. 2014).', '-2-', '“A person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce', 'the instrument if (i) the person was in possession of the instrument', 'and entitled to enforce it when loss of possession occurred, (ii) the', 'loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the person or a', 'lawful seizure, and (iii) the person cannot reasonably obtain', 'possession of the instrument because the instrument was destroyed,', 'its whereabouts cannot be determined, or it is in the wrongful', 'possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found', 'or is not amenable to service of process.” The defendants asserted that SMS was not entitled to enforce the note against them because the note was lost while in Sovereign Bank’s possession, the note had never been located, and SMS never had possession of the note.', 'On November 17, 2016, a justice of the Superior Court heard the parties on the cross- motions for summary judgment. SMS asserted that defendants were estopped from arguing that SMS could not enforce the note because it was lost. Specifically, SMS referenced a provision in the note that stated:', '“Upon receipt of an affidavit of an officer of Lender as to', 'the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Note or any other', 'Security Instrument which is not of public record, the undersigned', 'will issue, in lieu thereof, a replacement Note or other security', 'document in the same principal amount thereof and otherwise of', 'like tenor.” SMS contended that the provision obligated defendants to issue a replacement note, and that, given their failure to do so, defendants were estopped from raising the lost note as a defense. When the hearing justice inquired as to whether demand for a replacement note was made upon defendants, SMS acknowledged that demand was not made, but maintained that demand was not necessary under the above-quoted provision.', 'SMS also cited to § 6A-3-203(b), which governs the rights acquired by the transfer of an instrument, such as the note, and provides that a transfer “vests in the transferee any right of the', '-3- transferor to enforce the instrument, * * * but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly or indirectly, from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or illegality affecting the instrument.” SMS maintained that, because there was no allegation of fraud or illegality, it was therefore entitled to enforce the lost note.', 'In their argument, defendants noted that § 3-309(a) of the Uniform Commercial Code (the UCC) differed from § 6A-3-309(a) of the Rhode Island UCC. The former provides, in pertinent part:', '“A person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce', 'the instrument if:', '“(1) the person seeking to enforce the instrument:', '“(A) was entitled to enforce the instrument when', 'loss of possession occurred; or', '“(B) has directly or indirectly acquired ownership', 'of the instrument from a person who was entitled to', 'enforce the instrument when loss of possession', 'occurred; * * *.” U.C.C. § 3-309 (AM. LAW INST. &', 'UNIF. LAW COMM’N 2004) (emphasis added). The defendants distinguished this from the equivalent provision within the Rhode Island UCC, § 6A-3-309, explaining that, “[i]n Rhode Island, the original holder of that note, in possession of the note at the time that it was lost * * * can enforce it, but [its] assignee cannot enforce it.” The defendants noted that § 3-309 of the UCC was amended in 2002 to directly address and remedy scenarios like the instant matter and that “Rhode Island chose not to accept the amendment * * *.” The defendants maintained that the court should follow the plain language of § 6A-3- 309(a), especially in light of the UCC’s 2002 amendment, arguing: “[G]iven the fact that there is another statute that shows the amendment that would fix this issue, * * * the [S]upreme [C]ourt is obligated to follow the [G]eneral [A]ssembly’s determination and intent. They, the legislature, decided not to amend the UCC to provide for this scenario.”', '-4-', 'On January 17, 2017, the hearing justice issued a bench decision. He granted defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment based on two considerations. The first consideration was the “competing provisions of the UCC which here are implicated.” Specifically, the hearing justice found that § 6A-3-309, which governs the enforcement of lost, destroyed, or stolen instruments, conflicted with § 6A-3-203(b), which provides that the transfer of an instrument “vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument * * *.” The trial justice found that § 6A-3-309 “is a specific provision unique to lost, destroyed, or stolen instruments, unlike [§ 6A-3-203(b)] relied on by SMS.”', 'The second consideration that guided the hearing justice’s decision was that § 6A-3- 309(a) of the Rhode Island UCC differs from § 3-309(a) of the UCC. The Rhode Island version requires a person who is not in possession of an instrument that he or she seeks to enforce to have been “in possession of the instrument and entitled to enforce it when loss of possession occurred,” § 6A-3-309(a), whereas the UCC allows a person to enforce the instrument if he or she “directly or indirectly acquired ownership of the instrument from a person who was entitled to enforce the instrument when the loss of possession occurred.” U.C.C. § 3-309. The hearing justice determined that under § 3-309(a) of the UCC, SMS would be entitled to enforce the note “because it acquired it from Sovereign, which presumptively was entitled to enforce”; however, he determined that SMS could not enforce the note under “the version that has been adopted here in Rhode Island.” Accordingly, the hearing justice granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.', '-5-', 'SMS moved for “reconsideration” of the hearing justice’s decision.2 In support thereof, SMS maintained that, in rendering his decision, the hearing justice overlooked material evidence in the record, namely, the note’s provision that required defendants to issue a replacement note. On March 16, 2017, the hearing justice heard the parties on SMS’s motion for reconsideration. SMS asserted that it did not challenge the application of § 6A-3-309; rather, SMS solely raised the issue of the provision of the note that required defendants to issue a replacement note, which SMS maintained would have rendered § 6A-3-309 irrelevant.

The enforceability of the note goes to * * * the entire document.” The defendants further noted that the lost note affidavit executed by Sovereign Bank did not request a replacement note from defendants.

SMS maintains that defendants should therefore be estopped from raising defenses premised on the fact that the note was lost because defendants did not issue a replacement note as they were mandated to do. SMS does not challenge the hearing justice’s decision with respect to the application of § 6A-3-309; rather, it “limits its appeal to the [d]efendants’ refusal to issue a replacement note” because “[h]ad [d]efendants fulfilled their obligation to issue a replacement note when provided with a [l]ost [n]ote [a]ffidavit, the issue of who would be able to enforce the lost note would be moot, since an original note would exist.”', 'Because the present matter concerns a promissory note, which is a negotiable instrument, our analysis is governed by the Rhode Island UCC.4 We will first look to § 6A-3-203, which governs the transfer of instruments, because Sovereign Bank transferred its rights under the note 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 6A-3-104 defines a “negotiable instrument,” in pertinent part, as:', '“an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of', 'money, with or without interest or other charges described in the', 'promise or order, if it:', '“(1) Is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued', 'or first comes into possession of a holder;', '“(2) Is payable on demand or at a definite time; and', '“(3) Does not state any other undertaking or instruction by', 'the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in', 'addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order', 'may contain (i) an undertaking or power to give, maintain,', 'or protect collateral to secure payment, (ii) an authorization', 'or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or', 'dispose of collateral, or (iii) a waiver of the benefit of any', 'law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.”', '-8- to SMS. Section 6A-3-203(b) provides that the transferee of an instrument is vested with “any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument,” unless “the transferee engaged in fraud or illegality affecting the instrument.” Although at first blush § 6A-3-203(b) appears to indicate that SMS, as the transferee of the note, has the right to enforce the note, we must look to § 6A-3- 309, which addresses the enforcement of a lost note. In particular, § 6A-3-309(a) sets forth, in pertinent part, that “[a] person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument if (i) the person was in possession of the instrument and entitled to enforce it when loss of possession occurred * * *.” As the hearing justice perceptively noted, there is a conflict between § 6A-3-203(b) and § 6A-3-309(a). “When a specific statute conflicts with a general statute, our law dictates that precedence must be given to the specific statute.” South County Post & Beam, Inc. v. McMahon, 116 A.3d 204, 215 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Warwick Housing Authority v. McLeod, 913 A.2d 1033, 1036-37 (R.I. 2007)). Accordingly, § 6A-3-309(a) applies because it is specific to scenarios where the note is lost, stolen, or destroyed, such as the instant matter.', 'Under the plain language of § 6A-3-309(a), it is clear that SMS is not entitled to enforce the note because the note was in the possession of Sovereign Bank, not SMS, when it was lost. Indeed, SMS never had possession of the note. SMS does not contest this finding; it solely challenges defendants’ failure to issue a replacement note. It maintains that defendants should be estopped from raising any arguments premised on § 6A-3-309 because, had defendants issued a replacement note, § 6A-3-309 would be inapplicable. We reject this argument.', 'Pursuant to § 6A-3-309, SMS is not entitled to enforce the note’s provision mandating that defendants issue a replacement note. Under a plain reading of § 6A-3-309, “enforcement” refers to the ability to enforce all provisions of the instrument because its language does not limit enforcement of the instrument to the enforcement of the financial rights and duties under the', '-9- note.

Quinn, 173 A.3d 1272, 1276 (R.I. 2017) (“[W]hen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” (quoting Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1226 (R.I. 1996))). In the instant matter, “enforcement” as used in § 6A-3-309 would include SMS’s right—or lack thereof—to enforce the note’s provision that obliges defendants to issue a replacement note upon receipt of a lost note affidavit. Accordingly, because there is no issue of material fact pertaining to SMS’s inability to enforce the note and its provision obligating defendants to issue a replacement note, summary judgment was properly entered in defendants’ favor.', 'Lastly, we acknowledge SMS’s frustration that defendants are able to “escape liability.” SMS attributes defendants’ windfall to their failure to issue a replacement note; however, this is mistaken. Rather, defendants were able to “escape liability” from their obligations under the note because § 6A-3-309 of the Rhode Island UCC allows for the enforcement of a lost instrument that is not in the possession of the party seeking to enforce it only if he or she had possession of the instrument at the time it was lost. While this may be an issue of first impression in Rhode Island, this exact issue was addressed in Dennis Joslin Co., LLC v. Robinson Broadcasting Corp., 977 F. Supp. 491 (D.D.C. 1997). In Joslin, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia was tasked with determining whether the plaintiff, an assignee of a lost note, was entitled to enforce the note although it did not have possession of the note at the time it was lost. Joslin, 977 F. Supp. at 494. At the time, the language of D.C. Code § 28:3-309(a) was identical to that of § 6A-3-309(a) and required a person who sought to enforce a note to have had actual possession of the note at the time it was lost. Id. The Joslin court', '- 10 - concluded that the plaintiff could not recover under the note because the plaintiff was not in possession of the note when it was lost.

McLaughlin built a garage on his property in Tiverton, he did so in violation of the setback requirements set forth in Tiverton’s Zoning Ordinance. As the record indicates, and as is not in dispute, a portion of McLaughlin’s garage was within seven feet of his property boundary, twenty-three feet short of the side yard setback requirement of thirty feet. Those twenty-three feet have triggered a yearslong process that McLaughlin now seeks to partially unwind.', 'McLaughlin appeals from a September 2, 2016 order of the Superior Court denying his motion to vacate an earlier court order, entered on April 7, 2014, that compelled him to remove the garage from his property. As it stands now, over eleven years after McLaughlin first set out to build a garage, the Town of Tiverton has had the garage removed, and it holds a $69,300 lien on McLaughlin’s property arising from contempt fines that were imposed by a trial justice in', '-1- August 2015. 1 In this appeal, we are tasked with resolving the following issues: whether to vacate the April 7, 2014 order under Rule 60(b)(4) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure; whether to vacate it under Rule 60(b)(6); and whether McLaughlin is barred by the doctrine of res judicata from pursuing either of those two avenues.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we reverse the Superior Court order denying McLaughlin’s motion to vacate the April 7, 2014 order.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The relevant facts of this case are not in dispute, but they tell a rather complicated tale. In 2007, McLaughlin applied for and received a permit from the municipal Building Inspector to build a 40-by-60 foot garage on his property. As he would later admit to the Tiverton Zoning Board of Review and in a letter seeking a zoning variance, that permit was based on an erroneous site plan that McLaughlin had provided to the town. That plan, which McLaughlin himself prepared, inaccurately described the boundaries of his property.', 'Whether this error was inadvertent or intentional is unknown, but it is clear that McLaughlin’s garage was built well short of the side yard setback required by the Tiverton Zoning Ordinance.', 'A', 'McLaughlin’s Zoning Appeal', 'In 2010, spurred to action by a notice of violation issued by the zoning official, McLaughlin applied for a zoning variance from the Zoning Board of Review. 2 After a number 1', 'At oral argument, counsel for the town indicated that he was unaware of any present intention to place a lien on McLaughlin’s property for the cost of removing the garage. 2', 'It appears from our review of the record that the notice of violation was prompted, unsurprisingly, by one or more complaints from an abutting neighbor. In addition to skirting the', '-2- of continuances, the zoning board held a hearing on McLaughlin’s variance request on September 7, 2011. At that hearing, McLaughlin, who was represented by counsel, argued that the zoning board should grant him a variance from the setback requirement because he had exercised reasonable care in locating the area on which to build the garage. The financial hardship associated with moving the garage, McLaughlin asseverated, justified relief from the literal requirements of the ordinance.', 'After hearing from McLaughlin and also after taking testimony from one of McLaughlin’s abutting neighbors, the zoning board unanimously denied the variance application. In a letter dated October 3, 2011, the zoning board explained, among other things, that not only was McLaughlin’s garage in violation of the side yard setback requirement, but also that the garage was in violation of the front yard setback requirement.', 'Shortly after his variance request was denied, McLaughlin, now pro se, appealed to the Superior Court for relief. But there, too, his appeal for zoning relief was unsuccessful. In an October 4, 2013 bench decision, a justice of the Superior Court affirmed the zoning board’s denial of McLaughlin’s variance request.', 'That justice concluded that the only hardship McLaughlin faced was purely financial in nature, and the hearing justice held that such self- created financial hardship was not a sufficient ground justifying a variance. McLaughlin, still unsatisfied, then appealed that judgment to this Court. However, in January 2014, his appeal was dismissed as procedurally improper. 3 setback requirements, McLaughlin also appears to have encroached onto that neighbor’s property by clearing, filling, and grading the surrounding area. 3', '“It is well settled in this jurisdiction that there is no right of appeal to the Supreme Court from decisions of the Superior Court with respect to zoning appeals.” Lupo v.

The matter was scheduled for a hearing on April 7, 2014. Significantly, McLaughlin does not dispute that he received notice of that hearing.', 'However, McLaughlin did not appear on April 7.

An order entered, granting the zoning board’s motion and setting a ninety-day clock for McLaughlin to comply with the setback requirements of the Tiverton Zoning Ordinance.', 'On the very next day, April 8, 2014, McLaughlin filed a motion of his own.', 'He denominated his filing as a “Motion to Vacate Judgment/Reconsider[.]” However, a letter accompanying that motion referred to his pleading as a “[m]otion to reconsider judgment * * *.” A hearing on the motion was held on May 9, 2014.', 'At the beginning of that hearing, the hearing justice sought to clarify what McLaughlin was seeking in his motion. 4 After McLaughlin raised a host of grievances, many of which related to his already-decided zoning appeal, the hearing justice told McLaughlin:', '“I know of no provision in the rules, assuming you’re filing a', 'motion for reconsideration, I don’t know of any provision in the', 'rules for a motion for reconsideration.

Thus, McLaughlin assented to a partial remedy; the zoning board agreed to reset the ninety-day timeline. Thereafter, on May 20, 2014, the hearing justice entered an order affirming that McLaughlin would be required to move or remove his garage in compliance with the Tiverton Zoning Ordinance. However, the order also gave him ninety days from the May 9, 2014 hearing to do so.', 'C', 'The Removal of McLaughlin’s Garage', 'Over the course of the next two years, the zoning board’s efforts to remove McLaughlin’s garage plodded along. In October 2014, well after the ninety-day clock had struck midnight, the zoning board moved to adjudge McLaughlin in contempt. In August 2015, after holding a hearing on the zoning board’s contempt motion, a second justice of the Superior Court, whom we shall refer to as the trial justice, found McLaughlin in contempt of the May 20, 2014 order. As a result, the trial justice imposed fines totaling $69,300; $68,800 for McLaughlin’s failure to comply with the court order and $500 for the zoning board’s legal fees accrued in pursuing the motion. 7', 'Yet McLaughlin remained recalcitrant, and, in October 2015, the zoning board filed a motion to enforce, asking the Superior Court to allow the Town of Tiverton to remove the garage.

As the trial justice ordered, if McLaughlin did not reach full compliance by that time, the Town of Tiverton would be authorized to “enter [McLaughlin’s] property, remove the offending structure therefrom, and charge the entire cost of removal to [McLaughlin], without any further action of the [Superior] Court.”', 'McLaughlin did not remove his garage in time.

That request was denied', '-8- shortly thereafter.', 'On March 28, 2016, the Town of Tiverton removed the garage from McLaughlin’s property.', 'With his garage now dismantled, McLaughlin, at long last, obtained counsel. 8 It is worth noting that, although the garage had been removed, the Town of Tiverton has placed a lien on McLaughlin’s property for the $69,300 in fines imposed by the August 2015 contempt order.', 'D', 'The 2016 Motion to Vacate', 'On May 25, 2016, McLaughlin filed a motion to vacate the April 7, 2014 order. Significantly, that order served as the basis for all the subsequent court orders. McLaughlin posited that the April 7, 2014 order should be vacated under Rules 60(b)(4) and 60(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. He argued that, because the Superior Court lacked the subject matter jurisdiction to order him to remove the garage, the order was void under Rule 60(b)(4). That argument rested on the fact that, pursuant to § 45-24-62, Tiverton had not filed a separate action to obtain a removal order and thus the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction when it acted. With respect to Rule 60(b)(6), McLaughlin averred that the lack of a separate action brought by the town and the interests of justice justified relief from the operation of the order.', 'The zoning board opposed McLaughlin’s motion.', 'It argued that, not only did the Superior Court have jurisdiction to issue the April 7, 2014 order, but also that McLaughlin was barred from pursuing his motion to vacate by the doctrine of res judicata.

The trial justice held that the doctrine of res judicata barred McLaughlin’s motion to vacate. He concluded that McLaughlin’s April 8, 2014 motion to reconsider was, in effect, a motion to vacate and that any issues regarding the Superior Court’s subject matter jurisdiction should have been raised at that time. 9 Although he decided that the motion could be denied on that ground alone, the trial justice also opined that the Superior Court did in fact possess subject matter jurisdiction to grant the “Motion for Order to Comply”—thereby defeating McLaughlin’s argument that it was void under Rule 60(b)(4)—and that McLaughlin failed to show a reason justifying relief under Rule 60(b)(6). 10 In sum, the trial justice explained, “McLaughlin failed to prove that either the [April 7, 2014 order] was void or that extraordinary circumstances existed to justify vacating [it] in the interest of justice.” An order entered reflecting the trial justice’s decision denying McLaughlin’s motion to vacate on September 2, 2016.

In our judgment, it quite clearly does not. To us, the zoning board’s argument that the trial justice correctly applied res judicata sounds more in the doctrine of “law of the case” than it does in the doctrine of res judicata. As we have explained, the law-of-the-case doctrine generally holds that “after one judge has decided an interlocutory matter in a pending suit, a second judge on that same court, when confronted at a later stage of the suit with the same question in the identical manner, should refrain from disturbing the first ruling.” Richardson v. Smith, 691 A.2d 543, 546 (R.I. 1997). When the trial justice denied McLaughlin’s motion to vacate in 2016, he did so, in part, because of his concern for the finality of the hearing justice’s April 7, 2014 order. That sort of reasoning rings to the tune of law of the case, not res judicata. Compare id. with E.W. Audet & Sons, Inc. v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co. of Newark, New Jersey, 635 A.2d 1181, 1186 (R.I. 1994) (noting that res judicata is “[u]sually asserted in a subsequent action based upon the same claim or demand, [and] the doctrine precludes the relitigation of all the issues that were tried or might have been tried in the original suit”). Indeed, “[a]lthough this law-of-the-case doctrine does not have the finality of res judicata,” we have said that it “generally ought to be adhered to for the principal reason that it is designed to promote the stability of decisions of judges of the same court and to avoid unseemly contests and differences that otherwise might arise among 10', 'Of note, the trial justice also found that, while it was without merit, McLaughlin’s May 25,', '- 11 - them to the detriment of public confidence in the judicial function.” Richardson, 691 A.2d at 546 (quoting Salvadore v. Major Electric & Supply, Inc., 469 A.2d 353, 356 (R.I. 1983)). In denying McLaughlin’s 2016 motion to vacate, the trial justice was correctly concerned with grounding his decision in the interest of finality; however, it was a finality that should have been based on the law-of-the-case doctrine, not the doctrine of res judicata, because the order was made in the context of the same case. 11', 'B', 'Rule 60(b)(4)', 'Generally, “[a] Rule 60(b) motion to vacate is addressed to the trial justice’s sound judicial discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal, absent a showing of abuse of discretion.” Allen v. South County Hospital, 945 A.2d 289, 293 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Keystone Elevator Co. v. Johnson & Wales University, 850 A.2d 912, 916 (R.I. 2004)). However, when a party moves to vacate a judgment under Rule 60(b)(4), that deferential standard of review gives way to de novo review. As we have explained, “[t]his Court reviews de novo an appeal from a denial of a motion to vacate a judgment where the motion is based on an allegation that the judgment is void pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4).” In re Quigley, 21 A.3d 393, 398 (R.I. 2011). This is so “because ‘[a] judgment is either valid or it is not and discretion plays no part in resolving the issue.’” Id. (quoting Nisenzon v. Sadowski, 689 A.2d 1037, 1047 (R.I. 1997)). For that reason, “a Rule 60(b)(4) motion may be brought at any time.” Id. 2016 motion to vacate was timely under Rules 60(b)(4) and 60(b)(6). 11', 'Further, with particular respect to McLaughlin’s argument that the April 7, 2014 order should be vacated under Rule 60(b)(4), we also note that “a claim of lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.” Long v. Dell, Inc., 984 A.2d 1074, 1078 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Pollard v. Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429, 433 (R.I. 2005)).', '- 12 -', '“However, [a] judgment is not void merely because it is erroneous.” Allstate Insurance Co. v. Lombardi, 773 A.2d 864, 869 (R.I. 2001) (quoting Jackson v. Medical Coaches, 734 A.2d 502, 506 (R.I. 1999)). For a judgment to be vacated as void under Rule 60(b)(4), “the court entering the judgment” either must have “lacked jurisdiction” or “the court’s action [must have] amount[ed] to a plain usurpation of power constituting a violation of due process.” Id. (quoting Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1995)). In this case, McLaughlin argues that the April 7, 2014 order is void for each of those reasons. He contends that the Superior Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enter the order and that “the court’s action amount[ed] to a plain usurpation of power constituting a violation of due process.” Id. (quoting Hoult, 57 F.3d at 6).', 'We are satisfied that the April 7, 2014 order was not void. As this Court has explained, there is a fine distinction between the absence of jurisdiction and the exercise of jurisdiction. See Hartt v. Hartt, 121 R.I. 220, 227, 397 A.2d 518, 522 (1979). Indeed, we have remarked “that the distinction between the ‘appropriate exercise of power and the absence of power’ may at times be ‘blurry.’” Narragansett Electric Co. v. Saccoccio, 43 A.3d 40, 44 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Mesolella v. City of Providence, 508 A.2d 661, 665 (R.I. 1986)). As pertains to this case, there is a statute that clearly vests in the Superior Court the jurisdiction to order McLaughlin to remove his garage. It bears repeating that § 45-24-62 states that:', '“[T]he superior court * * * shall, upon due proceedings in the', 'name of the city or town, instituted by its city or town solicitor,', 'have power to issue any extraordinary writ or to proceed according', 'to the course of law or equity or both:', '“* * *', '“* * *', '“(3) To order the removal by the property owner of any building,', 'structure, sign, or improvement existing in violation of any zoning', 'ordinance enacted under the provisions of this chapter and to', 'authorize some official of the city or town, in the default of the', 'removal by the owner, to remove it at the expense of the owner;', '[and/or]', '- 13 -', '“(4) To order the reimbursement for any work or materials done or', 'furnished by or at the cost of the city or town[.]” Therefore, we are constrained to conclude that the Superior Court was vested with the subject matter jurisdiction to order McLaughlin to remove the garage. The only remaining question as to whether the order granting the zoning board’s “Motion for Order to Comply” is void under Rule 60(b)(4) centers on the manner in which the hearing justice exercised that jurisdiction.', 'In the parlance of our caselaw, this brings us to decide whether the April 7, 2014 order represents “a plain usurpation of power constituting a violation of due process.” See Allstate Insurance Co., 773 A.2d at 869 (quoting Hoult, 57 F.3d at 6). In our opinion, it does not. As McLaughlin admits, he received notice—albeit notice that he purportedly misread—of the April 7, 2014 hearing. Because it is undisputed that McLaughlin was provided with notice and afforded an opportunity to be heard, we cannot conclude that the April 7, 2014 order went so beyond the pale as to evince “a plain usurpation of power constituting a violation of due process.” Id. (quoting Hoult, 57 F.3d at 6).', 'Nevertheless, McLaughlin poses one last argument as to why that order is void. In McLaughlin’s view, the procedural posture of the case at the time when the order was entered justifies vacating it under Rule 60(b)(4). As McLaughlin correctly observes, when the zoning board filed its motion in March 2014, the case—which was McLaughlin’s appeal from a denial of his variance request—was already closed because final judgment had entered. The zoning board’s denial of McLaughlin’s zoning appeal had been affirmed, and McLaughlin’s appeal to this Court had been dismissed as procedurally improper. That posture, McLaughlin reasons, renders the April 7, 2014 order granting the zoning board’s motion void.', 'We do not agree. Because the Superior Court possessed the subject matter jurisdiction to order McLaughlin to remove his garage, and because the granting of the April 7, 2014 order did', '- 14 - not mark a “plain usurpation of power constituting a violation of due process[,]” the April 7, 2014 order was and is not void. See Allstate Insurance Co., 773 A.2d at 869 (quoting Hoult, 57 F.3d at 6).', 'C', 'Rule 60(b)(6)', 'In a final attempt to pry himself from the grasp of the April 7, 2014 order, McLaughlin argues that the unique circumstances of this case present a manifest injustice “justifying relief from the operation of the” order. See Super. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). We agree. At the outset, we note that McLaughlin shoulders a heavy burden in appealing the trial justice’s denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion to vacate. While we review the grant or denial of motions to vacate brought under Rule 60(b)(4) de novo, we employ a more deferential standard of review to motions brought pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6). See Allen, 945 A.2d at 293 (explaining that “[a] Rule 60(b) motion to vacate is addressed to the trial justice’s sound judicial discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal, absent a showing of abuse of discretion” (quoting Keystone Elevator Co., 850 A.2d at 916)).', 'Rule 60(b) provides, in relevant part: “On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party * * * from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: * * * [including for] (6) [a]ny other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.” However, a Rule 60(b)(6) motion to vacate “shall be made within a reasonable time * * *.” Super. R. Civ. P. 60(b); see also In re Quigley, 21 A.3d at 401-02. 12', 'First, McLaughlin contends that the Superior Court lacked the authority to entertain the zoning board’s request that he be ordered to remove his garage. In response, the zoning board', '- 15 - points to the language of § 45-24-62. On this point, we are in agreement with the zoning board. As explained above, pursuant to § 45-24-62(3), the Superior Court possessed the jurisdiction to order the removal of McLaughlin’s garage.', 'Second, McLaughlin posits that there was no competent evidence in the record establishing that his garage was in violation of the Tiverton Zoning Ordinance. Without that evidence, he argues, the zoning board had no grounds for obtaining the April 7, 2014 order. But, the zoning board maintains, that is not so. It cites McLaughlin’s own testimony before the zoning board from September 2011, when McLaughlin and the zoning board’s chairwoman engaged in the following exchange:', '“MADAM CHAIRWOMAN:', 'Mr. McLaughlin, when you', 'submitted your site plan, you represented to the building inspector', 'that the building met the setback requirements under the Tiverton', 'Zoning Ordinances?', '“[MCLAUGHLIN]: Yes, ma’am.', '“MADAM CHAIRWOMAN:', 'And after you had a survey,', 'you realized that was inaccurate?', '“[MCLAUGHLIN]: Yes, ma’am.” The zoning board cites that admission and the very fact that McLaughlin found it necessary to seek a zoning variance as proof that McLaughlin’s garage was in violation of the Tiverton Zoning Ordinance’s setback requirements. 13', 'However, for purposes of determining whether the trial justice erred in denying McLaughlin’s motion to vacate under Rule 60(b)(6), our analysis has less to do with the 12', 'On appeal, the zoning board has not argued that McLaughlin’s 2016 motion to vacate was not filed within a “reasonable time” pursuant to Rule 60(b). 13', 'As a third basis for vacating the April 7, 2014 order, McLaughlin also avers that the zoning board engaged in misleading, or even sanctionable, conduct in obtaining that order. However, on the record before us, we see no merit to that argument.', '- 16 - evidence of McLaughlin’s compliance (or lack thereof) with the setback requirements of the Tiverton Zoning Ordinance than it does with the process by which the zoning board obtained the April 7, 2014 order.', 'As the zoning board sees it, the reasons McLaughlin advances for vacating the April 7, 2014 order under Rule 60(b)(6) are repetitive and a mere restatement of the reasons he set forth in arguing that the order was void under Rule 60(b)(4). But in McLaughlin’s view, those arguments are precisely why the trial justice should have granted his motion to vacate. He contends that, because the zoning board failed to comply with § 45-24-62(3), the April 7, 2014 order should be vacated. According to McLaughlin, for the Town of Tiverton to have properly obtained an order requiring him to remove the garage, it should have filed a separate action in the Superior Court, not a motion for an order to comply filed by the zoning board in a zoning appeal.', 'It is perhaps an understatement to say that Rule 60(b)(6) rarely is invoked with success. Indeed, there is a dearth of cases in the jurisprudence of this Court in which we have found grounds justifying vacation under that rule. As this Court has explained, “Rule 60(b)(6) was ‘not intended to constitute a catchall and * * * circumstances must be extraordinary to justify relief.’” Allen, 945 A.2d at 297 (quoting Bailey v. Algonquin Gas Transmission Co., 788 A.2d 478, 483 (R.I. 2002)). Although “[t]he language of [Rule] 60(b)(6) * * * does vest the Superior Court with broad power to vacate judgments[,]” it is reserved for unique or extraordinary circumstances. Bendix Corp. v. Norberg, 122 R.I. 155, 158, 404 A.2d 505, 506 (1979). “A Rule 60(b)(6) motion can be granted only for some ‘other reason justifying relief’ than the reasons specified in Rule 60(b)(1) through (5) and ‘only in unique circumstances to prevent manifest injustice.’” Bailey, 788 A.2d at 482 (quoting Vitale v. Elliott, 120 R.I. 328, 332, 387 A.2d 1379, 1382 (1978)). Therefore, to put it another way, Rule 60(b)(6)’s “other reason clause should not', '- 17 - be applied unless there has been a showing by appropriate evidence of circumstances that would establish a uniqueness that puts the case outside of the normal and usual circumstances accompanying failures to comply with the rules.” Bendix Corp., 122 R.I. at 158, 404 A.2d at 506 (quoting Greco v. Safeco Insurance Co. of America, 107 R.I. 195, 198, 266 A.2d 50, 52 (1970)).', 'In our opinion, this case presents one of those rare occasions when unique circumstances do exist to justify relief under Rule 60(b)(6). The following facts, all of which are intertwined with one another, are particularly relevant to our conclusion on this point. First, and of particular significance, the removal action was not properly brought under § 45-24-62. As discussed above, § 45-24-62 vests the Superior Court with the power to assist cities and towns, such as the Town of Tiverton, in the enforcement of their zoning ordinances. To invoke that judicial aid, however, § 45-24-62 provides that there must be “due proceedings in the name of the city or town, instituted by its city or town solicitor * * *.” Although we have yet to squarely address whether the language of § 45-24-62 contemplates the bringing of a separate action, we embrace such a holding now. In a case remarkably similar to McLaughlin’s, this Court, in discussing § 45-24-62’s predecessor statute (G.L. 1956 § 45-24-7 (1970 Reenactment)), noted that the parties in that case had “conceded that enforcement of [the order mandating removal of the offending structure] would require a separate judicial proceeding.”', 'Zeilstra v. Barrington Zoning Board of Review, 417 A.2d 303, 309 (R.I. 1980) (emphasis added). We agree with what those parties long ago conceded: Section 45-24-62 requires a separate judicial proceeding. Thus we are of the firm opinion that the zoning board’s “Motion for Order to Comply” was not a “due proceeding” as required by the plain language of § 45-24-62. A motion to comply, filed by the zoning board, not the town, at the conclusion of a zoning appeal, simply does not pass muster.', '- 18 -', 'This leads us to the next significant fact driving our conclusion: the procedural posture of the case. This case involved an appeal of a denied variance; it was not an action instituted by the Town of Tiverton. In fact, the zoning board was a defendant in this case. In March 2014, when the zoning board moved for an order to comply, the zoning board remained a defendant, and the case remained postured as a zoning appeal. The solicitor did not file a separate complaint on behalf of the town setting forth McLaughlin’s alleged noncompliance with the Tiverton Zoning Ordinance.', 'Therefore, at no point did McLaughlin’s zoning appeal transform into a “due proceeding[] in the name of [the Town of Tiverton], instituted by its * * * town solicitor * * *.”', 'Furthermore, at the time the zoning board filed its motion, final judgment had entered. In other words, the controversy before the Superior Court—revolving around whether there were grounds justifying reversal of the zoning board’s denial of McLaughlin’s variance request under § 45-24-69(d)—had been resolved to a finality. The zoning board had prevailed, and this Court had dismissed McLaughlin’s appeal as procedurally improper. The zoning board’s filing of the “Motion for Order to Comply” was an effort to transform the case from a closed-out zoning appeal to a request for permanent injunctive relief—relief to which the zoning board is not entitled. See Zeilstra, 417 A.2d at 309. Although those facts do not, in our view, render the April 7, 2014 order void under Rule 60(b)(4), we are nonetheless of the opinion that it should have been vacated under Rule 60(b)(6).', 'The unique and narrow facts of this case motivate this Court to conclude that enforcing that order would constitute a manifest injustice. The interest of finality alone does not defeat the clear language of § 45-24-62. Had the Town of Tiverton filed an action in the Superior Court alleging that McLaughlin’s garage was out of compliance with the Tiverton Zoning Ordinance’s setback requirements, it may well have prevailed given the evidence in the record before us. But', '- 19 - the town did not do that. Process is important, and even though McLaughlin received notice and an opportunity to be heard, the town’s failure to comply with § 45-24-62 in obtaining permanent injunctive relief on April 7, 2014, is fatal. To uphold that order would permit, not prevent, manifest injustice. See Bailey, 788 A.2d at 482.', 'In other words, the confluence of the extraordinary facts in this case “establish[es] a uniqueness that puts the case outside of the normal and usual circumstances accompanying failures to comply with the rules.” See Bendix Corp., 122 R.I. at 158, 404 A.2d at 506 (quoting Greco, 107 R.I. at 198, 266 A.2d at 52). Under these narrow facts, there are reasons “justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.” Super. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). Accordingly, we hold that McLaughlin’s motion to vacate should have been granted. 14', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we reverse the Superior Court order denying McLaughlin’s motion to vacate the April 7, 2014 order. The papers in this case shall be remanded to the Superior Court.', 'Chief Justice Suttell, with whom Justice Goldberg joins, dissenting. The majority invokes Rule 60(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, which it admits “is reserved for unique or extraordinary circumstances[,]” to prevent manifest injustice. In doing so, I fear it has created a potential injustice to the Town of Tiverton and its taxpayers by exposing the town to possible liability for the removal of Mr. McLaughlin’s garage. As I do not believe that relief to plaintiff under Rule 60(b)(6) is warranted, I respectfully dissent. 14', 'By the time McLaughlin filed his 2016 motion to vacate in Superior Court, the garage already had been removed.', '- 20 -', 'I fully agree with my colleagues that the April 7, 2014 order granting the zoning board’s motion to move or remove the garage and imposing a fine for failure to do so was not void. As the majority notes, “the Superior Court possessed the subject matter jurisdiction to order McLaughlin to remove the garage[,]” even if it improperly exercised such jurisdiction. Therefore, because the Superior Court had jurisdiction, it became incumbent upon McLaughlin to articulate an objection to further proceedings, either because the removal action was not properly brought by the town under G.L. 1956 § 45-24-62 or because the pending case, a zoning appeal, had been resolved by a final judgment and therefore should have been closed. However, McLaughlin did not object to the proceedings until over two years later, by which time the garage had already been removed by the town.', 'In my judgment, McLaughlin’s objections to the proceedings were not timely, based on the facts and circumstances of this case. See Rule 60(b) (providing that a motion seeking relief from a judgment or order “shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one (1) year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken”). 1 1', 'Rule 60(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in part:', '“On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve', 'a party or a party’s legal representative from a final judgment,', 'order, or proceeding for the following reasons:', '“(1) Mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;', '“(2) Newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not', 'have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule', '59(b);', '“(3) Fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse', 'party;', '“(4) The judgment is void;', '“(5) The judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a', 'prior judgment upon which the judgment is based has been', '- 21 - By the time McLaughlin raised his objections to the April 7, 2014 order, he had seemingly acquiesced in the garage’s removal.', 'Rather than objecting, McLaughlin participated in the proceedings for an additional two years. The day after the April 7, 2014 order entered, he filed a motion to “reconsider.” At the hearing on the motion, McLaughlin did not argue that the zoning board lacked authority to seek removal of the garage. Instead, he explained that his primary concern was that he needed more time to comply with the April 7, 2014 order. By an order dated May 20, 2014, he was ultimately afforded an additional ninety days from May 9, 2014. By another order, dated August 5, 2015, McLaughlin was found in contempt of the May 20, 2014 order; then, he was given another ninety days from November 9, 2015, to remove the garage. He failed to do so; and, on March 28, 2016, the town removed the garage pursuant to the court order issued by a trial justice exercising the jurisdiction of the Superior Court. In my judgment, McLaughlin has forfeited any opportunity to seek redress for the removal of the garage based on procedural flaws.', 'The majority, however, has, in effect, vacated the original order of April 7, 2014, and it has thereby cast a shadow over the propriety of the town’s action in removing the garage. This not only may frustrate the town’s ability to seek reimbursement for the costs of the removal, but it exposes the town to potential liability for the removal itself. This, I believe, is a result not warranted under the circumstances of this case.', 'I recognize the procedural anomalies in these proceedings, and in the interest of justice, I might be willing to employ the supervisory powers of this Court to absolve McLaughlin of the', 'reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the', 'judgment should have prospective application; or', '“(6) Any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the', 'judgment.”', '- 22 - fines imposed against him.

This case came before the Supreme Court on March 6, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The defendants, Craig J. DiPetrillo and Rebecca M. DiPetrillo (defendants), appeal from a Superior Court judgment granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, William Coscina and Cheryl L. Bailey Coscina (plaintiffs), on count one of the plaintiffs’ complaint, sounding in adverse possession. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided without further briefing or argument. We vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The factual and procedural history of the case at bar is perplexing and unsettled. The plaintiffs own property located at 100 Paris Irons Road in Glocester (the Coscina property), and defendants own the abutting property located at 86 Paris Irons Road (the DiPetrillo property). This appeal arises out of a boundary dispute between the parties with respect to two tracts of land known as “Cheryl’s Front Pasture” and “Cheryl’s Back Pasture.” Although both tracts are part', '-1- of the DiPetrillo property, plaintiffs claim that they used both of these tracts as their own property for more than thirty-six years. The complaint alleged that Cheryl began using the front pasture and back pasture soon after she purchased the property in 1979, and that William, Cheryl’s husband, began using the tracts in 2008.1 With respect to the front pasture, plaintiffs claim that Cheryl used this area to keep farm animals and that her children rode all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) in that area as well. As to the back pasture, plaintiffs allege that Cheryl “re establish[ed] a neglected overgrown pasture by cutting saplings and small trees, clearing brush and continually mowing the pasture * * *.” The plaintiffs’ complaint further alleged that plaintiffs installed and maintained six-foot metal posts along the boundary line between Cheryl’s Back Pasture and the DiPetrillo property, and maintained a stone wall along the boundary line of Cheryl’s Front Pasture and the DiPetrillo property. The defendants purchased the 86 Paris Irons Road property in October 2013.', 'On February 4, 2014, plaintiffs filed a four-count first amended complaint. In count one, plaintiffs requested that they be adjudged the rightful owners of Cheryl’s Front Pasture and Cheryl’s Back Pasture by virtue of adverse possession; they alleged that Cheryl used both tracts for a period in excess of ten years, and that their use of the tracts was actual, open, notorious, hostile, continuous, exclusive, and under a claim of right. In counts two and three, plaintiffs sought injunctive relief and declaratory relief, respectively. In count four, plaintiffs alleged that the stone wall that encloses Cheryl’s Front Pasture has been acknowledged as the boundary line between the parties’ properties for a period in excess of ten years. In their answer to plaintiffs’ 1', 'Cheryl Coscina purchased the property at 100 Paris Irons Road with her then husband, Calvin C. Bailey. Mr. Bailey resided at the property with Cheryl from 1979 until 2004. In 2008, a three-tenths interest in the 100 Paris Irons Road property was conveyed to William Coscina, Cheryl’s current husband, with whom she resides at the property.', '-2- complaint, defendants denied the allegations and filed a counterclaim seeking to quiet title with respect to the areas in dispute.', 'On May 22, 2015, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on all four counts of the complaint and on defendants’ counterclaim. In support of their motion, plaintiffs submitted affidavits, maps, and photographic evidence of the property.2 Appended to each of the nineteen affidavits was a copy of a land survey similar to the land survey attached to plaintiffs’ complaint, but with additional handwritten notes identifying the front and back pastures, a horse enclosure, and woods to the west of the back pasture. The defendants filed an objection to plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on the basis of alleged inconsistencies with respect to the boundaries of the areas in dispute. Specifically, defendants claimed that the area demarcated as Cheryl’s Front Pasture in the affidavits was different from the area that had been identified as Cheryl’s Front Pasture in a demand letter that plaintiffs sent to defendants before this action was filed. The defendants also contended that plaintiffs had changed their allegations regarding the stone wall boundary divider.', 'The defendants also argued that the “form” style affidavits submitted by plaintiffs contained conclusions of law and were simply “boilerplate.” Finally, defendants averred that plaintiffs failed to provide an affidavit from a civil engineer or land surveyor with respect to the boundaries of the claimed tracts. Counsel for plaintiffs responded to defendants’ objection by filing her own affidavit declaring that she had prepared the handwritten notes on the copy of the land survey attached to the affidavits in support of plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment. 2', 'Affidavits were submitted by Cheryl, William, Cheryl’s ex-husband Calvin Bailey, and sixteen other individuals. All nineteen affidavits confirmed plaintiffs’ averments with respect to their use of the pastures in dispute.', '-3-', 'A hearing on plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment was held on July 14, 2015. The hearing justice noted that a metes and bounds description of Cheryl’s Back Pasture was not set forth on the survey that was attached to the complaint, and he questioned how a judgment for adverse possession could be entered without a metes and bounds description of the back pasture. The defendants agreed with the hearing justice’s concern, arguing that a material issue of fact existed because the survey that plaintiffs submitted did not contain a metes and bounds description of the back pasture and because the boundaries of the contested areas kept changing:', '“[COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANTS]: But in each of the surveys or', 'self-purported surveys that have been presented, that area changes.', 'In fact, at some point it’s straight down. At some point it’s curved.', 'There is about three or four different plot plans that have been', 'introduced that differentiate that whole side yard, and it’s the', 'contention of the defendants that they did use some of it. They', 'may have used some of it but they’re claiming more and more of', 'that and each time we come or get documentation regarding it, that', 'side pasture or back pasture continues to change and that’s been', 'the issue on the dimensions and the property lines itself.” Nonetheless, the hearing justice granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment solely as to the adverse possession count. Although the hearing justice found no genuine issue of material fact as to whether plaintiffs had established ownership by adverse possession, he was still troubled by the vagueness of the purported boundary line:', '“So the [c]ourt finds there is no genuine issue of material fact as to', 'whether or not there has been adverse possession of the', 'D’Petrillos’ property. The [c]ourt, however, does believe there is', 'an issue of fact as to what is the actual boundary line for purposes', 'of preparing a judgment of [metes] and bounds on the back line. I', 'believe it’s been explained there that it goes to the woods so the', '[c]ourt is going to grant—it’s not quite liability in damages', 'because there are no damages, you’re not seeking damages, but', 'I’m granting summary judgment on the fact that there has been', 'adverse possession.”', '-4- The hearing justice suggested that a survey of the back pasture was needed and that a more accurate survey of the front pasture should be conducted. Despite granting summary judgment for adverse possession, the hearing justice decided to allow defendants to dispute whether or not “that is the actual boundary[.]” An order was entered on August 13, 2015, granting plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment as to the first count of their complaint, denying summary judgment with respect to the remaining counts of their complaint and defendants’ counterclaim, and requiring plaintiffs to submit a new survey of the property in dispute to the court with an accurate metes and bounds description of the boundary lines. However, according to defendants, plaintiffs were observed clearing the disputed property after this ruling.', 'On August 20, 2015, plaintiffs filed a motion for entry of judgment for adverse possession and submitted a new survey of Cheryl’s Front Pasture and Cheryl’s Back Pasture containing a metes and bounds description. The defendants objected to plaintiffs’ motion due to the presence of disputed material facts based on their contention that plaintiffs have “continuously evolved and changed [the shape and size of the land in question] just during the course of this proceeding.” The matter was set down for an evidentiary hearing.', 'An evidentiary hearing took place on the question of where the boundary lines existed for the parcels. The plaintiffs presented the testimony of Richard Bzdyra, a licensed land surveyor, who testified that an ancient stone wall marked the boundary of the front pasture and that a demarcation of a tree line marked the boundary of the back pasture.3 Also, Mr. DiPetrillo testified at the hearing about the uncertainties surrounding the extent of plaintiffs’ claims. He testified that he used the back pasture to host cookouts and as a throughway into the woods, and that he cut the grass. According to Mr. DiPetrillo, when plaintiffs first informed him that they 3', 'This testimony conflicted with the allegations in plaintiffs’ complaint that six-foot metal posts actually marked the boundary of the back pasture.', '-5- were claiming part of his property by adverse possession, Cheryl’s Back Pasture was not part of the claim. Notably, Mr. DiPetrillo testified that, the day after the July 14, 2015 summary judgment hearing, there was an individual “plowing the overgrowth, trees and everything further back [on the back pasture].” The hearing justice acknowledged this factual dispute, noting that plaintiffs did not deny that someone had plowed the overgrowth on the back pasture after summary judgment was granted on the adverse possession claim. The hearing justice later asked Cheryl whether this was an area she had cleared in the past, to which Cheryl replied, “I used to clear that area.” The hearing justice ultimately determined that this newly-cleared area was included in Cheryl’s Back Pasture as set forth in the affidavits:', '“I wanted to know whether the cleared area was included in what', 'she was referring to [in] her affidavit or not because that’s the only', 'thing in my mind. If it had not been, then the line would have', 'gone to the cleared area but she said it was, and it was consistent', 'with her affidavit and clearing it, whether she violated the consent', 'agreement or not, is not before me but it is obvious in my mind', 'that this cleared area was part of the back pasture.” The hearing justice found Bzdyra to be a credible witness and accepted his testimony with respect to the boundary lines of both the front and back pastures.', 'The hearing justice stated that he was reluctant to grant plaintiffs’ motion for entry of judgment in light of the unresolved remaining claims in plaintiffs’ complaint and defendants’ counterclaim. However, after the parties filed a stipulation agreeing to dismiss the remaining counts of plaintiffs’ complaint and all counts of defendants’ counterclaim, judgment entered on November 25, 2015, in favor of plaintiffs on count one of their complaint. The defendants timely appealed.', 'On appeal, defendants argue that: (1) summary judgment was improper because an issue of material fact existed with respect to the boundary line of the back pasture; (2) the survey', '-6- submitted by plaintiffs in support of summary judgment would not have been admissible at trial because it was unauthenticated and contained handwritten notes inserted by plaintiffs’ counsel; and (3) the evidentiary hearing, conducted by the hearing justice, did not comply with either Rule 56(c) or Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.4 4', 'Rule 56(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, titled “Motion and Proceedings Thereon,” provides:', '“The motion shall be served at least ten (10) days before the time', 'fixed for the hearing.

State, 869 A.2d 1185, 1187 (R.I. 2005)).', 'Analysis', 'The defendants aver that the hearing justice erred by granting summary judgment on plaintiffs’ adverse possession claim. We note at the outset that, when he issued his bench decision, the hearing justice merely concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact as to adverse possession, but made no reference to whether adverse possession by plaintiffs had been established by clear and convincing evidence, which is an essential conclusion in adverse possession cases; nor did the hearing justice reference the elements essential to a claim for adverse possession.', 'See Carnevale v. Dupee, 783 A.2d 404, 410 (R.I. 2001) (“The party claiming title by adverse possession must prove each of these elements by ‘strict proof, that is, proof by clear and convincing evidence.’”) (quoting Anthony v. Searle, 681 A.2d 892, 897 (R.I. 1996)). The hearing justice stated:', '“[T]he [c]ourt finds there is no genuine issue of material fact as to', 'whether or not there has been adverse possession of the', 'DiPetrillos’ property. The [c]ourt, however, does believe there is', 'an issue of fact as to what is the actual boundary line for purposes', '-8-', 'of preparing a judgment of [metes] and bounds on the back line.', '* * * I’m granting summary judgment on the fact that there has', 'been adverse possession.” It is well settled that, “in order to establish adverse possession under [G.L. 1956] § 34-7-1,[5] a claimant’s possession must be actual, open, notorious, hostile, under claim of right, continuous, and exclusive.” Anthony, 681 A.2d at 897 (quoting Locke v. O’Brien, 610 A.2d 552, 555 (R.I. 1992)). The hearing justice’s bench decision was devoid of any proper adverse possession analysis and was conclusory in nature, particularly where the dimensions of the claimed land were in dispute. In Anthony, this Court promulgated the elemental requirements for adverse possession and declared, inter alia, that “[a] claimant makes a showing that the possession was ‘hostile’ if a determination is made ‘that the possession of the occupier is to a visible line in all events, regardless of the location of the true boundary line.’” Id. at 898 (emphasis added) (quoting LaFreniere v. Sprague, 108 R.I. 43, 50, 271 A.2d 819, 822 (1970)). We think it to be clear error to simply declare that plaintiffs proved adverse possession without addressing each element and the uncontradicted evidence that supports it. 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-7-1, titled “Conclusive title by peaceful possession under claim of title,” provides:', '“Where any person or persons, or others from whom he, she, or', 'they derive their title, either by themselves, tenants or lessees, shall', 'have been for the space of ten (10) years in the uninterrupted,', 'quiet, peaceful and actual seisin and possession of any lands,', 'tenements or hereditaments for and during that time, claiming the', 'same as his, her or their proper, sole and rightful estate in fee', 'simple, the actual seisin and possession shall be allowed to give', 'and make a good and rightful title to the person or persons, their', 'heirs and assigns forever; and any plaintiff suing for the recovery', 'of any such lands may rely upon the possession as conclusive title', 'thereto, and this chapter being pleaded in bar to any action that', 'shall be brought for the lands, tenements or hereditaments, and the', 'actual seisin and possession being duly proved, shall be allowed to', 'be good, valid and effectual in law for barring the action.”', '(Emphasis added.)', '-9-', 'Clearly, an accurate description of the “lands, tenements or hereditaments” is an essential element of the claim itself and not an issue that can be decided in the absence of a trial. The hearing justice based his decision granting summary judgment largely on the affidavits that plaintiffs submitted. The survey appended to each affidavit upon which the hearing justice relied was neither a final nor accurate survey of the property in dispute. After the hearing justice granted summary judgment, plaintiffs commissioned a new survey of the property containing a metes and bounds description, which may or may not have been based on activities occurring on the property after the July 14, 2015 hearing and which significantly differed from the original survey. The boundary lines to each portion of the claimed property appear different, and the area appears to have been expanded. We are of the opinion that it was error for the hearing justice to resolve this contested issue of fact between the parties. Simply put, without a clear demarcation of the boundary lines, and without clear and convincing evidence of the areas that were adversely possessed, there can be no summary judgment. See DelSesto v. Lewis, 754 A.2d 91, 95 (R.I. 2000) (holding that disputed material facts about the nature and extent of the contested area’s use precluded summary judgment); see also Anthony, 681 A.2d at 898 (“[T]he ultimate fact to be proved in adverse possession is that the claimant has acted toward the land in question as would an average owner, taking properly into account the geophysical nature of this land.”) (emphasis added) (quoting Gammons v. Caswell, 447 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I. 1982)). There were genuine issues of material fact as to the boundaries of the disputed areas in the present case that were not capable of resolution under Rule 56.', 'As a general matter, claims for adverse possession are not susceptible to summary judgment due to the fact-intensive nature of these actions. See M & B Realty, Inc. v. Duval, 767 A.2d 60, 65 (R.I. 2001); DelSesto, 754 A.2d at 95. The parties acknowledged that this Court has', '- 10 - not had occasion to uphold a grant of summary judgment on an adverse possession claim because these cases are fact-driven. At the evidentiary hearing in the case at bar, there was conflicting evidence with respect to the boundary lines of the contested parcels that differed from the affidavits upon which the hearing justice relied. The plaintiffs’ affidavits do not clearly describe the boundary of the back pasture, but declare that the plaintiffs erected and maintained a fence along the back pasture; however, in their memorandum in support of summary judgment filed on May 22, 2015, the plaintiffs argued that a stone wall enclosed the back pasture. This is conflicting evidence. The hearing justice acknowledged these disputed factual issues, noting that “there is an issue of fact as to what is the actual boundary line * * *.” In an attempt to resolve these factual issues, the hearing justice ordered an evidentiary hearing regarding the boundary of the back pasture and engaged in fact-finding, which is not permitted at the summary judgment stage.6 Accordingly, we conclude that granting summary judgment, in light of obvious disputed material facts, was erroneous. See Sola, 45 A.3d at 506. Because we are vacating the judgment of the Superior Court and remanding this case for trial, we not need address the plaintiffs’ remaining appellate arguments.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.

The plaintiffs own the remaining four units and have 29.2 percent of the voting share. The original declaration permitted only “Retail/Office,” “Office,” or “Residential” uses in the condominium. Specifically, Article 2.2(ff) expressly prohibited a restaurant use: “NO commercial kitchens or the preparation of or the service of food for consumption onsite shall be allowed.”', 'However, on December 23, 2016, defendant, as the majority-interest holder, unilaterally adopted and recorded a “second amendment” to the declaration that removed the language in Article 2.2(ff) that prohibited commercial kitchens and food service. In doing so, the second amendment expressly included “Restaurant Use” as a new permitted use relative to the units owned by defendant.', 'The second amendment, in relevant part, stated: “Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or in this Declaration, Units 103, 104, 105, 106 and 107 may have commercial kitchens and be used for the purpose of Restaurant Use.” The defendant also applied to the Newport City Council for a victualing license and to transfer a Class BV alcoholic beverage license for a restaurant that it intended to establish in its units.', 'The plaintiffs, in opposition to the second amendment, filed this declaratory judgment action in the Superior Court seeking a declaration that the second amendment was invalid and that to be valid, the adoption of the second amendment required unanimous consent of all the owners pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 34-36.1-2.17(d). The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The defendant argued that, because § 34-36.1-2.17(d) deals only with the restriction of uses, and because the second amendment in this case did not restrict the use or occupancy of any unit, the second amendment was valid.', 'On May 1, 2017, a hearing was held on the motions; the hearing justice ruled that there were no genuine issues of material fact in the case.

The hearing justice held that the statute required a change in use to be approved by the unanimous consent of all unit owners. Accordingly, the hearing justice granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and declared that the second amendment was invalid because unanimous consent from all unit owners was required to adopt the amendment and that no condominium units could be converted into a restaurant and bar without the unanimous consent of all unit owners.

The second amendment of the declaration indeed changed what was previously a restricted use in the condominium to a permitted use.

17,State : v. : Tory Lussier. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Tory Lussier, appeals from a judgment of conviction on one count of felony assault following a jury-waived trial in the Superior Court. A group consisting of the defendant, his friends, and his brother—most of whom were off-duty Marines—was involved in a late-night melee with some students from Brown University. After the brawl had subsided and the groups were heading their separate ways, the defendant ripped off his shirt, ran back toward the site of the donnybrook, and landed a punch to the head of Joseph Sharkey. According to the defendant, that punch was in defense of himself and his companions; according to the state, it was an uncalled-for sucker punch. The trial justice agreed with the state’s theory and found the defendant guilty.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The defendant contends that there was sufficient evidence of self-defense to require a finding of not guilty. The defendant further argues that the trial justice overlooked material evidence in', '-1- carrying out his fact-finding function.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant and his friends Joseph Ryan, Joseph Parrish, and Andrew Parrish were all United States Marines who had served in the same unit, and they had been deployed to Afghanistan together. They considered themselves to be brothers, and each knew the importance of always having each other’s back. Unfortunately, during the early morning hours of May 12, 2013, they became brothers in arms in a manner that they did not anticipate.', 'After the four Marines returned from active duty, they made plans to get together and enjoy a night socializing in Providence. The defendant, Ryan, Joseph, Andrew, and defendant’s younger brother, Derek, first convened for dinner. 1 Eventually, they made their way to the East Side of the city, where the comrades spent the remainder of their night drinking at a bar located near Brown University. The defendant estimated that he had consumed at least seven drinks at the bar, and he described himself as having been intoxicated that night. The defendant was known to his friends to sometimes become irritable and angry when he was drinking. Shortly before the 2:00 a.m. closing time, the group left the establishment in search of late-night food. Trouble ensued, however, while they were en route to their vehicles. 1', 'Due to the commonalities of both first and last names in this case, we will refer to the Parrish brothers and defendant’s brother by their first names and Joseph Ryan by his last name. We intend no disrespect to anyone involved.', '-2-', 'As the group walked on Thayer Street, in the vicinity of George Street, they passed by two individuals. The larger of the two, Dillon Ingham, a Brown University football player, somehow insulted Ryan. Joseph intervened, and a fight erupted. Ingham punched Joseph and knocked him out. Either Ingham or his cohort rendered Ryan unconscious as well. Indeed, Ryan suffered a concussion and broken orbital bone, nose, and tooth. 2 Andrew and Derek then jumped into the fray to battle with Ingham.', 'Meanwhile, defendant had engaged in fisticuffs with the other individual who had been standing with Ingham. The defendant, Ryan, and Derek all identified that second individual as Sharkey, a Brown University basketball player who would ultimately become the complaining witness at trial. 3 Soon enough, the melee petered out. Andrew pulled Derek away from Ingham, who raised his hands and began to back away. At that point, the police arrived, and the crowd scattered.', 'The defendant was later seen on surveillance video pulling his shirt off and walking back in the direction of the initial confrontation as the first police cruiser arrived at the scene. By the time the camera panned in that direction, an individual—later identified as Sharkey—could be seen lying motionless on the ground, his body half in the street and half on the sidewalk. Sharkey had been badly injured and he had apparently collapsed and hit his head on the concrete. 2', 'At trial, Ryan was unable to say definitively which of the two had hit him. However, it was Ingham who was charged with felony assault of Ryan and misdemeanor simple assault of Joseph. Ingham’s felony-assault charge was later reduced to a simple assault in exchange for his pleading nolo contendere to both misdemeanor counts. He received one year of probation. 3', 'As a result of the injuries that he suffered, Sharkey could not remember what transpired that night. He did, however, testify that he and Ingham were “acquaintances” who were in the same fraternity. Sharkey explained that, because “Brown doesn’t recognize Greek life,” “[i]t’s not really a fraternity, just a house where everybody lives.” Theirs was a dorm that housed football and basketball players, but, according to Sharkey, he and Ingham were not all that close and did not hang out socially. In fact, Sharkey did not know Ingham’s actual first name, but only his nickname, until after the unfortunate events that precipitated this trial.', '-3- To save his life, it was necessary to remove a portion of his skull to stop his brain from swelling. 4 In fact, Sharkey’s injuries were so severe that Providence police initially treated the case as a homicide investigation.', 'Numerous witnesses testified to what had transpired in the seconds between the time that defendant was seen heading back toward the scene of the initial confrontation and the time that Sharkey was grievously injured. Katherine Mahoney said that she had been out with Sharkey that night; they were merely friends at the time, although the relationship did ripen into romance at a later time. Mahoney explained that she and Sharkey had just left an on-campus bar and that they were walking on Thayer Street when they saw a commotion. According to Mahoney, Sharkey then walked over to the “late night brawl” while she remained on the sidewalk. She testified that she was watching him the whole time and that she did not see him throw any punches or touch anyone whatsoever. Sharkey was in the middle of the fighting for ten seconds at most, Mahoney said, before she called for him to get out of there and, whether her entreaty was the reason or not, he did so. Mahoney said that, less than a minute later, she and Sharkey were talking on the sidewalk approximately thirty feet away from where the fighting had taken place. Mahoney testified that Sharkey had his back turned to the fight and that defendant ran toward them from that direction. It was then that Mahoney saw defendant punch Sharkey in the side of his face from behind, and she watched as Sharkey “fell and smashed his head on the concrete.” The defendant ran away, leaving Mahoney with the unresponsive and bleeding Sharkey. The police arrived within seconds.', 'Wooyoung Moon, a student at Brown University, also testified to what he witnessed. Moon said that he had been out with some friends that night and that he was sober. He related 4', 'Sharkey testified that, ever since his injury, he has been prone to seizures.', '-4- that he was walking on Thayer Street when he heard a commotion. Moon testified that he looked up and saw a brawl going on, although it appeared to him to be “a gang of people ganging up on this one guy and punching him.” Moon said that he watched the fight for ten to twenty seconds and that he was about fifteen to twenty yards away from it. He then looked down at his phone, struggling to find the phone number for the Brown University police, and by the time he looked back up, the fight had settled down. He said that there was still some jawing going on, but no punches were being thrown. Moon then watched as defendant walked along Thayer Street, and Moon presumed he was going to his car. Moon also saw “this guy and this girl standing * * * on the sidewalk north of this clump of people.” Moon testified that he thought defendant would simply walk past the couple, but instead defendant suddenly punched the man. As the man fell to the ground, Moon heard defendant yelling expletives at the man while the woman screamed for defendant to stop. The defendant then continued walking on Thayer Street, but when the police arrived just seconds later, Moon testified that defendant ran right past him and ducked down a side street.', 'When defendant testified, he painted quite a different picture. The defendant said that Sharkey was with Ingham, that it was they who had initiated the scuffle, and that he saw Sharkey kicking Ryan. At that time, defendant testified, he jumped into the ruckus and he and Sharkey actually exchanged blows for about twenty seconds.', 'After Sharkey landed a punch to defendant’s face, defendant said that he put Sharkey in a headlock until a woman came along and pulled Sharkey out of the brawl by his belt. Meanwhile, Derek was still engaged with Ingham farther down Thayer Street, so defendant ran to his brother’s aid. He said that that was when the surveillance video captured Ingham backing away from the group of Marines with his hands raised, seemingly in a gesture of surrender. The defendant testified that he then saw Sharkey', '-5- walking in his direction and “[f]ully looking” at him, and defendant “felt like it was him or me that was going to be hit * * *.” And, defendant said, if it was not him who Sharkey was going to assault, it would have been one of his fellow Marines or his brother. The defendant said that he punched Sharkey but once. The defendant testified that it was simply a “reaction[,]” that he “felt like it was fight or flight * * *.”', 'The trial justice did not see it that way. The trial justice found Moon to be the most credible witness because he was the only person testifying who was completely disinterested and because he had not been drinking that night. The trial justice also held that the testimony of Moon and Mahoney and the events depicted in the surveillance video were corroborative of each other. The trial justice did not find any credible evidence that supported defendant’s story, and he determined that the initial confrontation had concluded before defendant punched Sharkey. Based on those findings, the trial justice said that he was “constrained to conclude that this was not a case of self-defense or defense of others, rather it was an act of retribution to even the score for what happened earlier to [defendant’s] friends at the hands of the other Brown University student, Dillon Ingham.” Therefore, the trial justice found defendant guilty of felony assault. 5 5', 'At the time the criminal information was filed in this case, G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 defined felony assault as follows:', '“(a) Every person who shall make an assault or battery, or both,', 'with a dangerous weapon, or with acid or other dangerous', 'substance, or by fire, or an assault or battery which results in', 'serious bodily injury, shall be punished by imprisonment for not', 'more than twenty (20) years.', '“* * *', '“(c) ‘Serious bodily injury’ means physical injury that:', '“(1) Creates a substantial risk of death;', '“(2) Causes protracted loss or impairment of the function of any', 'bodily part, member or organ; or', '-6- The trial justice sentenced defendant to seven years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, all suspended with probation; 1,000 hours of community service; weekly counseling for two years for treatment for his anger issues, PTSD-related symptoms, and alcohol abuse; and weekly random substance abuse screenings.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“In a jury-waived criminal proceeding, this Court gives deference to a trial justice’s finding[s] of fact[]” and determinations of credibility.

The defendant contends that, because the trial justice did not recite or summarize Andrew’s testimony when delivering his bench decision, he must have overlooked it, and, according to defendant, consideration of that testimony would have swung the weight of the evidence back in his direction. In our opinion, that argument misses the mark.', 'It is significant that, as he rendered his decision, the trial justice explained:', '“I have reviewed all of the witnesses who testified in this case, but', 'the most relevant and most significant testimony which I have just', 'placed on the record is from those witnesses that I’ve just recited', 'testimony from.

See Forand, 958 A.2d at 138. The trial justice had ample evidence before him to support both the state’s theory of the case as well as defendant’s. The trial justice discussed and analyzed both theories, and he made factual findings and credibility assessments that led him to side with the state in concluding that defendant had not assaulted Sharkey in an effort to defend himself, his friends, or his brother. Moreover, even if we were to disagree with that outcome, we are not in the business of replacing the trial justice’s view of the evidence with our own. See Van Dongen, 132 A.3d at 1079.', 'It seems to us that the defendant’s twofold argument—that the evidence of self-defense negated a guilty finding, and that the trial justice overlooked evidence in finding defendant guilty—is nothing more than a manifestation of the defendant’s disagreement with the findings of fact and determinations of credibility that the trial justice did place on the record. That, certainly, “is a most difficult hurdle to overcome in a jury-waived trial.” Van Dongen, 132 A.3d at 1079. It was the defendant’s considered decision to waive his right to a trial by jury and put his fate in the hands of a seasoned justice of the Superior Court, who, it turned out, did not see things the way the defendant would have wished.

In that complaint, plaintiffs alleged that they were residents of Rhode Island who had “had controversies which [had] been adjudicated before the R.I. Traffic Tribunal since 1999, [and had] been forced to pay fines and costs imposed by the putative Defendants and their predecessors.” The complaint also alleged that defendants “lack[ed] judicial power to levy fines” because their appointments to the Traffic Tribunal “ha[d] not been approved by the R.I.

On that same day, Trinque prepared and presented an interoffice memorandum to defendant Pare, the public safety commissioner, detailing the incident. Commissioner Pare ordered plaintiff’s transfer from the department of communications to the division of training for four weeks, effective March 29, 2015.

The plaintiff filed an objection to the motion, to which he attached documents that were not part of the complaint. He asked the hearing justice to convert the city’s motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment because he had submitted documents outside the four corners of the complaint. A hearing was held on the city’s motion to dismiss on February 16, 2017, and the hearing justice treated the motion as one for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. At this hearing, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed his loss-of-consortium claims, but he maintained that the city’s conduct was extreme and outrageous and that his invasion-of-privacy claim was viable because the city portrayed him as being unfit for duty.

Generally, the case is one in which the', 'recitation of the facts to an average member of the community', 'would arouse his resentment against the actor, and lead him to', 'exclaim, ‘Outrageous!’” (Emphasis added); see also Swerdlick,', '721 A.2d at 862; Champlin, 478 A.2d at 988.', 'In the case at bar, plaintiff has failed to allege any conduct suggestive of extreme or outrageous behavior by any defendant.', 'In his amended complaint, plaintiff alleges that', '-5- defendant Trinque “criticized and berated said plaintiff for his performance in plaintiff’s capacity as a lieutenant due to said co-defendant’s ill perceived determination and conclusion that said plaintiff failed to ‘do his duty.’” Although Trinque may have berated plaintiff, there is nothing in the record that suggests that any conduct by any defendant was so extreme or outrageous such that it was “beyond all possible bounds of decency”; “utterly intolerable in a civilized community”; or would lead someone to exclaim “Outrageous!” Restatement (Second) Torts § 46 cmt. d; Swerdlick, 721 A.2d at 863. Simply put, the incident at the crux of plaintiff’s claims was a workplace dispute. Although we need not delve into the remaining elements of a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress—having concluded that defendants’ conduct was neither outrageous nor extreme—we note that plaintiff has not provided any evidence of “a causal connection between the wrongful conduct and the emotional distress[.]” Swerdlick, 721 A.2d at 862 (quoting Champlin, 478 A.2d at 989). Accordingly, we conclude that the hearing justice properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiff’s claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.', 'Likewise, plaintiff’s claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress is without merit. It is well settled that “[o]nly two classes of persons may bring claims for negligent infliction of emotional distress: those within the ‘zone-of-danger’ who are physically endangered by the acts of a negligent defendant, and bystanders related to a victim whom they witness being injured.” Jalowy v. Friendly Home, Inc., 818 A.2d 698, 710 (R.I. 2003). In order to establish a prima facie claim under the “zone-of-danger” theory, a plaintiff must be in close proximity to the accident to create the potential of physical harm. See Marchetti v. Parsons, 638 A.2d 1047, 1049 (R.I. 1994). In order to succeed under the “bystander” theory, a plaintiff must actually witness the accident that caused his or her emotional distress and “(1) be a close relative of the victim, (2) be', '-6- present at the scene of the accident and be aware that the victim is being injured, and (3) as a result of experiencing the accident, suffer serious emotional injury that is accompanied by physical symptomatology.” Marchetti, 638 A.2d at 1052.', 'The plaintiff in this case does not fall within the zone-of-danger theory or the bystander theory in order to impose liability on defendants for negligent infliction of emotional distress. The plaintiff was not in close proximity to a traumatic event of any kind, nor did he witness such an event in which a close relative was injured. See Marchetti, 638 A.2d at 1049-50. Moreover, plaintiff’s claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress is fundamentally flawed due to the fact that plaintiff’s allegations are predicated on the intentional acts of defendants. There is no suggestion of negligence in the record before this Court, and plaintiff has not alleged any negligence on the part of defendants as the basis for his claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress. Accordingly, the hearing justice appropriately granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiff’s claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress.', 'Lastly, the plaintiff included a claim for invasion of privacy and cited to G.L. § 9-1-28.1(a)(4), the right-to-privacy statute. Section 9-1-28.1(a)(4) provides for “[t]he right to be secure from publicity that reasonably places another in a false light before the public[.]” That section provides further that:', '“(i) In order to recover for violation of this right, it must be', 'established that:', '“(A) There has been some publication of a false or', 'fictitious fact which implies an association which does not', 'exist;', '“(B) The association which has been published or implied', 'would be objectionable to the ordinary reasonable man', 'under the circumstances;', '-7-', '“(ii) The fact which was disclosed need not be of any benefit to the', 'discloser.” Section 9-1-28.1(a)(4). Similarly, the plaintiff’s arguments regarding this claim are of no moment. The plaintiff alleges a violation of § 9-1-28.1(a)(4), yet he fails to set forth the publication of any false or fictitious fact by any defendant. The plaintiff’s transfer and demotion were a matter of public knowledge; however, the plaintiff can only point to interoffice memoranda between defendants Trinque and Pare in support of his claim. More importantly, the plaintiff himself acknowledged that the events upon which his § 9-1-28.1(a)(4) claim is premised actually occurred; therefore we cannot logically conclude that any publication regarding the dispute at issue was false or fictitious. The plaintiff’s invasion-of-privacy claim therefore must fail as a matter of law.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all counts of the plaintiff’s complaint.

20,"Prospect CharterCARE, LLC : v. : Michael E. Conklin, Jr. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The plaintiff, Prospect CharterCARE, LLC (PCC), appeals from an order of the Providence County Superior Court issued on February 10, 2017, denying PCC’s motion to vacate an arbitration award and confirming the award in favor of the defendant, Michael E. Conklin, Jr. On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded both the law and the provisions of the employment agreement at issue when he awarded the defendant extended severance payments based on his finding that the defendant had been the subject of a “de facto termination”—a critical term in the employment agreement.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel1', 'In May of 2010, Mr. Conklin was hired by CharterCARE Health Partners (CHP) as that company’s Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. In view of his duties as Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Conklin was a member of the Senior Leadership Team of CHP. That entity owned and operated two hospitals: Roger Williams Medical Center and Our Lady of Fatima Hospital (Fatima Hospital).2 In October of 2010, John Fogarty, the then-President and Chief Executive Officer of St. Joseph Health Services of Rhode Island (St. Joseph Health Services) resigned. As a result of that resignation, defendant was directed by CHP leadership to assume responsibility as the “‘head of operations’ for St. Joseph Health Services * * * and * * * Fatima Hospital” in addition to continuing to perform his duties as CHP’s Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. In light of his assuming responsibility for the operational duties, Mr. Conklin’s annual salary was increased by $19,000; and he received the additional title of “Senior Vice President” as well as an updated job description, which stated that “[t]he position of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer also serves in the capacity of head of operations for St. Joseph Health Services * * *.”', 'In January of 2012, Mr. Conklin entered into a new employment agreement3 with CHP, which added to the then-existing severance provision a “De Facto Termination” provision. That provision gave executive employees, such as Mr. Conklin, the right to receive an extended, 1', 'Except where we indicate otherwise, the facts pertinent to this appeal are undisputed. We have, for the most part, based our chronological narrative on the arbitrator’s exposition. 2', 'The record sometimes refers to Our Lady of Fatima Hospital as “St. Joseph’s” or “St. Joe’s.” However, as the hearing justice observed: “They are one in the same. * * * Fatima is a hospital under the umbrella of St. Joseph Health Services of Rhode Island.” 3', 'In accordance with the usage of the arbitrator and the hearing justice, we shall hereinafter refer to the January 2012 agreement as the “Employment Agreement.” Certain relevant provisions thereof are set forth in the Appendix to this opinion.', '-2- eighteen-month severance payment in the event that they experienced a “material reduction” in their “material duties” as a result of a “[c]hange in [c]ontrol” of the entity. As the arbitrator observed, this provision was added in anticipation of a future joint venture with a capital partner and was “intended to create a strong safety net for those employees who had faithfully served their organization.”', 'In March of 2013, CHP signed a letter of intent to enter into a joint venture with Prospect Medical Holdings; that transaction closed in June of 2014, thereby creating PCC as the successor entity, which is the plaintiff in the instant case. Subsequently, PCC hired one Tom Hughes to serve as President and Chief Executive Officer of Fatima Hospital. After Mr. Hughes took office in July of 2014, Mr. Conklin’s operational responsibilities at Fatima Hospital ceased, although he continued to receive his full salary and retained his title as Vice President and Chief Financial Officer within PCC.', 'On July 10, 2014, Mr. Conklin delivered to his supervisor, Ken Belcher, a letter invoking the “De Facto Termination” provision of the Employment Agreement, contending that he had suffered “a material reduction in [his] duties and authorities as a result of change in effective control.” Mr. Belcher relayed Mr. Conklin’s request to Thomas Reardon, an executive at PCC, who replied that PCC would not provide Mr. Conklin with extended severance payments. In response to this initial denial of Mr. Conklin’s request, Mr. Belcher sent an email to Edwin Santos, the chairman of PCC’s Board of Trustees. In that email, Mr. Belcher set out the applicable provisions of the Employment Agreement as well as his interpretation of those provisions; and he then stated:', '“The reason [Mr. Reardon] provided [for denying Mr. Conklin’s', 'extended severance payments] was that there has been no material', 'change in [his] duties. As you know, this is incorrect and action', 'must be taken to overturn this misguided decision.” Mr. Belcher’s email to Mr. Santos concluded as follows:', '-3-', '“There clearly has been a material reduction in [Mr. Conklin’s]', 'duties. With the hiring of a new President of [Fatima Hospital],', '[Mr. Conklin] is no longer the ‘head of operations’ * * * and his', 'responsibilities will diminish accordingly.', '“[Mr. Conklin] has been as hard working and as loyal to our system', 'as we could ever hope for. His job has changed. The [CHP]', 'Executive Committee thought this might happen and took action to', 'protect the executives. Let’s fix this and allow [Mr. Conklin] to', 'move on having been properly treated while here at [PCC]. He', 'deserves nothing less.” Mr. Belcher’s exhortation was unsuccessful; and, on July 22, 2014, Mr. Reardon sent a letter to Mr. Conklin formally denying his request for extended severance. Mr. Reardon’s denial was predicated on his assessment that Mr. Conklin had suffered no “material reduction in duties incident to the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of [PCC].”', 'On November 5, 2014, Mr. Conklin filed a demand for arbitration,4 in which he sought to be awarded extended severance benefits pursuant to the “De Facto Termination” provision of the Employment Agreement. In April of 2016, the arbitrator conducted a three-day hearing, and the parties stipulated that the following were the only two issues to be resolved by the arbitrator:', '“(a) Whether [PCC] breached the terms and conditions of the', 'Employment Agreement entered into by and between * * * PCC', 'and Michael E. Conklin, Jr. * * * on January 2, 2012;', '“(b) Whether [Mr.] Conklin sustained damages as a result of', 'PCC’s potentially unlawful conduct.”', 'At the hearing, PCC contended that Mr. Conklin’s responsibilities as “head of operations” at Fatima Hospital were not “material” duties, but rather were more accurately characterized as “time to time” duties. In support of this argument, PCC pointed to clause two of the Employment Agreement, which states that an executive “shall have all of the duties, responsibilities, authorities 4', 'We note that clause thirteen of the Employment Agreement provides as follows: “Should any dispute arise hereunder, it shall be resolved by binding arbitration * * *.” See Appendix.', '-4- and powers normally incident to such position,” while further providing that the executive shall also perform “such functions and duties of an executive nature as may from time to time be assigned to him * * *.” It was PCC’s contention that Mr. Conklin’s responsibilities as “head of operations” at Fatima Hospital fell into the category of duties that “may from time to time be assigned to him.” PCC further argued that Mr. Conklin had not suffered any “material reduction” in his duties because, after PCC came into existence, he had retained the “same title, same salary, same office space, supervisory authority, and comparable duties requiring similar skills * * *.”', 'After reviewing the relevant provisions of the contract, summarizing the evidence and the testimony adduced at the hearing, and considering the arguments of the parties, the arbitrator rejected PCC’s assertion that Mr. Conklin’s duties as “head of operations” at Fatima Hospital were merely “time to time” responsibilities, finding it “implausible that [CHP] would increase his salary by $19,000 because he was simply doing ‘time to time’ work.” The arbitrator observed that both parties had cited to language in the case of Roberton v. Citizens Utilities Co., 122 F. Supp. 2d 279 (D. Conn. 2000), as support for the proposition that a material reduction occurs when an employee’s job is “effectively reduced by well more than half.” Roberton, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 285. The arbitrator also stated that “[Mr.] Conklin’s responsibilities as ‘head of operations’ of St. Joseph Health Services * * * occupied 60% of his work * * *.” However, the arbitrator thereafter stated that “[t]he most compelling argument for material reduction in [Mr.] Conklin’s duties as both Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer is Belcher’s emails and testimony that it was just that – a material reduction.” The arbitrator found that, “[o]nce these [‘head of operations’] responsibilities were cut, [Mr. Conklin] was no longer performing the material duties that were normally incident to his Senior Vice Presiden[t] position.” Accordingly, on August 1, 2016, the arbitrator issued a written decision, concluding that Mr. Conklin’s “right to terminate the contract under the January 2012 Employment Agreement’s de facto termination clause [was]', '-5- abridged” and that Mr. Conklin was “entitled to the eighteen-month severance proscribed [sic] therein.” 5', 'On August 19, 2016, PCC filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award in Superior Court; Mr. Conklin filed a counter-petition to confirm the award on September 9, 2016. On September 14, 2016, PCC filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award as well as an objection to Mr. Conklin’s cross-petition to confirm the award. PCC cited three grounds as the bases for its motion to vacate. First, PCC argued that Mr. Conklin had failed to prove that PCC had either assumed or been assigned the employment contracts entered into by CHP prior to the creation of PCC and that, therefore, it was not responsible for payment of the extended severance to Mr. Conklin. Second, PCC argued that the award should be vacated because it was “based upon a concededly erroneous fact” and that, therefore, the arbitrator had committed what “amount[ed] to a manifest disregard of the applicable law” when he relied upon that erroneous fact in his analysis. Specifically, PCC claimed that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law when he based his decision on the “material reduction” definition in Roberton, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 285, while at the same time erroneously stating that Mr. Conklin’s “head of operations duties comprised 60% of his work duties.” PCC contended that the arbitrator’s just-quoted factual statement was “concededly erroneous” because, PCC notes, “[Mr.] Conklin, himself, clearly testified that his duties were divided approximately ‘60 percent [Chief Financial Officer] and 40 percent operating duties.’” PCC argued that, but for the arbitrator’s misunderstanding about the percentage of time Mr. Conklin spent carrying out his operational duties as compared with his financial duties, “the Award would have been different.” Third, PCC alleged that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the contract because, in its view, the award analyzed only Mr. Conklin’s duties as Senior Vice 5', 'In a supplemental award issued on August 2, 2016, the arbitrator also awarded Mr. Conklin prejudgment interest on the eighteen months of severance payments. No appellate argument has been made concerning that award.', '-6- President and did not adequately analyze the “other material duties” associated with Mr. Conklin’s position as Chief Financial Officer. In due course, Mr. Conklin objected to the motion to vacate and simultaneously moved to confirm the arbitration award.', 'A justice of the Superior Court conducted a hearing on the cross-motions; and, on January 19, 2017, he issued a written decision denying PCC’s motion to vacate and granting Mr. Conklin’s motion to confirm the arbitration award. The hearing justice rejected PCC’s contention that the award was “mistakenly based upon a crucial factual assumption that [Mr.] Conklin’s head of operations duties comprised 60% of his work duties which was concededly erroneous” and its further contention that the arbitrator had manifestly disregarded the law when he “correctly” cited the Roberton case as “a guiding precedent,” but then incorrectly applied it to the facts in the instant case. The hearing justice stated that, because “Roberton is not controlling law in this jurisdiction,” the arbitrator’s use or misuse of that case was irrelevant to determining whether the arbitrator manifestly disregarded Rhode Island law in his decision. He also found that the arbitrator did not manifestly disregard the law when he “utilized an inaccurate fact in his analysis” because, in his view, the “underpinning” of the arbitrator’s finding that Mr. Conklin had suffered a material reduction in his material duties was “the assertion by Belcher that there had been such a substantial diminishment [in Mr. Conklin’s duties]” rather than the “allocation of percentages between the amount of time [Mr.] Conklin spent doing his head of operations duties versus his [Chief Financial Officer] duties.”', 'The hearing justice further determined that the arbitrator had not manifestly disregarded the contract because “the [a]rbitrator unmistakably attempted to ground his analysis in the language of § 7(b) of the Employment Agreement” and because the award “sufficiently [drew] its essence therefrom * * *.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)', '-7-', 'Lastly, the hearing justice found that PCC had waived its argument that it had not assumed the liability for Mr. Conklin’s contract with CHP by failing to raise that issue before the arbitrator.', 'Having considered PCC’s arguments, the hearing justice issued an order confirming the award in Mr. Conklin’s favor on February 10, 2017, and PCC timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In the very recent opinion in the case of ABC Building Corp. v. Ropolo Family, LLC, 179 A.3d 701 (R.I. 2018), this Court reiterated its adherence to Rhode Island’s “strong public policy in favor of the finality of arbitration awards.” ABC Building Corp., 179 A.3d at 705 (quoting Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC v. Bilray Demolition Co., Inc., 91 A.3d 830, 834 (R.I. 2014)). The Court then proceeded to reference G.L. 1956 § 10-3-12, noting that said section “sets forth the narrow conditions pursuant to which an arbitration award must be vacated[.]” Id. at 705-06. In its opinion in the ABC Building Corp. case, the Court went on to state that “[a]n arbitrator may exceed his or her authority by giving an interpretation that fails to draw its essence from the parties’ agreement, is not passably plausible, reaches an irrational result, or manifestly disregards a provision of the agreement.” Id. at 706 (internal quotation marks omitted). Next, the Court in ABC Building Corp. noted that “[a]n arbitration award may also be vacated when the arbitrator has manifestly disregarded the law.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, the Court once again clarified that “[a] manifest disregard of the law requires something beyond and different from a mere error in the law or failure on the part of the arbitrator[] to understand or apply the law. * * * Rather, it occurs when an arbitrator understands and correctly articulates the law, but then proceeds to disregard it.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'We are mindful of the limited role of the judiciary in reviewing arbitration awards because “parties who have contractually agreed to accept arbitration as binding are not allowed to', '-8- circumvent an award by coming to the courts and arguing that the arbitrators misconstrued the contract or misapplied the law.” Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Co. v. Flynn, 687 A.2d 440, 441 (R.I. 1996). Indeed, the proper role of the courts in reviewing an award is merely “to determine whether the arbitrator has resolved the grievance by considering the proper sources [of] the contract * * * but not to determine whether the arbitrator has resolved the grievance correctly.” Jacinto v. Egan, 120 R.I. 907, 912, 391 A.2d 1173, 1176 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, “[o]nly in cases in which an award is so tainted by impropriety or irrationality that the integrity of the process is compromised should courts intervene.” Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 687 A.2d at 441. To this end, “[e]very reasonable presumption in favor of the award will be made,” and the party claiming that an arbitrator exceeded his authority “bears the burden of proving that contention.” Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC, 91 A.3d at 835 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also ABC Building Corp., 179 A.3d at 706 (“Because public policy favors the finality of arbitration awards, * * * such awards enjoy a presumption of validity.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); North Providence School Committee v. North Providence Federation of Teachers, Local 920, American Federation of Teachers, 945 A.2d 339, 344 (R.I. 2008).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'PCC has raised three arguments on appeal, which are essentially the same as those that it raised in the Superior Court. First, PCC contends that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law when he correctly articulated the applicable legal principle, but then relied upon a “concededly erroneous” fact in applying that principle in his analysis. Second, PCC argues that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the Employment Agreement by “only consider[ing] the responsibilities associated with the ‘head of operations’ role” while conducting “no analysis whatsoever” with', '-9- respect to Mr. Conklin’s financial duties. Third, PCC argues that “[j]udgment on the Award cannot be entered against [PCC]” because “[t]he Employment Agreement at issue is by and between Conklin and [CHP] * * * not between Conklin and [PCC]” and that, therefore, PCC is not liable to pay the extended severance benefits at issue. We shall address each argument in turn.', 'A', 'The Alleged Factual Error and Manifest Disregard of the Law', 'PCC first avers that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law when, after referring to Roberton v. Citizens Utilities Co., 122 F. Supp. 2d 279 (D. Conn. 2000), for the purpose of defining a “material reduction” of duties, he then relied upon “concededly erroneous” facts in applying that definition.6 Roberton, 122 F. Supp. 2d at 285. According to PCC, the arbitrator premised his reasoning on the language in Roberton, which states that the employee suffered a “material reduction” in duties when “[h]is job was effectively reduced by well more than half.” Id. (emphasis added). However, PCC notes that, after “correctly articulat[ing]” that language in Roberton, the arbitrator proceeded to state as follows:', '“The initial question is whether there was a reduction of', 'responsibilities. [PCC] points to Belcher’s testimony that [Mr.]', 'Conklin’s responsibilities as ‘head of operations’ of St. Joseph', 'Health Services * * * occupied 60% of his work, whether Belcher', 'was on sight [sic] or not. * * * They further argue that the moment', 'that Hughes was hired, [Mr.] Conklin was no longer the ‘head of', 'operations.’” (Emphasis added.)', 'PCC contends that the arbitrator thereby misstated the record evidence. PCC points to the fact that “[Mr.] Conklin, himself, testified that his financial duties occupied 60% of his overall duties, and his operational duties [at Fatima Hospital] occupied the remaining 40% of his duties.” (Emphasis added.) As such, PCC argues that the arbitrator mistakenly believed Mr. Conklin’s 6', 'We pause to note that Roberton v. Citizens Utilities Co., 122 F. Supp. 2d 279 (D. Conn. 2000), a decision of a federal trial court, is not binding on this Court. We mention said case only because it was referenced by the arbitrator and by the hearing justice.', '- 10 - operational responsibilities at Fatima Hospital “occupied 60% of his overall duties” when, in fact, those responsibilities comprised only 40 percent of his duties. On that basis, PCC argues that the only reason the arbitrator found in favor of Mr. Conklin was that he erroneously believed that Mr. Conklin had lost 60 percent (i.e., “well more than half”) of his overall duties when he lost his operational responsibilities at Fatima Hospital. PCC further argues that this mistake of fact was sufficiently egregious to warrant vacating the award because, in its view, “if the accurate testimony [had been] cited, then a different decision would have been reached.”', 'In our view, PCC’s contention that the arbitrator based his decision on a “concededly erroneous” fact and thereby manifestly disregarded the law is unavailing for several reasons. First, the contention that the arbitrator “based” his decision on the finding that Mr. Conklin spent 60 percent of his time executing his operational duties overlooks the arbitrator’s express finding that the “most compelling” evidence that Mr. Conklin had experienced a “material reduction” in his material duties was the email sent by his supervisor to the chairman of PCC’s Board of Trustees. As both the arbitrator and the hearing justice noted, that email expressly stated that Mr. Conklin suffered a material reduction in his duties when he lost his responsibilities as head of operations at Fatima Hospital. We remain mindful that, when reviewing an arbitration award, we make “[e]very reasonable presumption in favor of the award.” Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC, 91 A.3d at 835 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also North Providence School Committee, 945 A.2d at 344 (“Due to the public policy favoring the finality of arbitration awards, such awards enjoy a presumption of validity.”). Bearing that presumption in mind, we are of the view that the arbitrator based the essence of his award on evidence other than the calculation on a percentage basis of Mr. Conklin’s work duties—namely, Mr. Belcher’s email. Accordingly, we are unpersuaded by PCC’s emphasis on the arbitrator’s misstatement of fact regarding the', '- 11 - percentage of time Mr. Conklin spent executing his operational duties as compared with his financial duties.', 'Moreover, even if the arbitrator had based his decision in part on a factual error, such a mistake would not be a proper basis upon which to vacate the arbitration award. Neither the narrow conditions delineated in § 10-3-12 nor our case law interpreting those conditions permits a court to vacate an arbitration award merely because it rests upon legal or factual misstatements. We have previously stated that “[t]he statutory directive is clear: a reviewing justice must confirm the award unless statutory grounds exist to warrant some other action” or this Court determines that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law or reached an irrational result. Wheeler v. Compass Insurance Co., 66 A.3d 477, 481 (R.I. 2013) (emphasis added). Additionally, this Court has consistently stated that, when reviewing arbitration awards, courts “may not reconsider the merits of an award despite allegations that it rests upon errors of fact * * *.” Rhode Island Council 94, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v. State, 714 A.2d 584, 588 (R.I. 1998); see also North Providence School Committee, 945 A.2d at 344-45 n.9 (stating that “[j]udicial deference to arbitral awards” requires that said awards “will not be opened for errors of law or fact on the part of the arbitrator”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'B', 'Manifest Disregard of the Employment Agreement', 'Next, PCC contends that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the Employment Agreement when he “only considered the responsibilities associated with [Mr. Conklin’s] ‘head of operations’ role,” while not addressing his other duties. According to PCC, “pursuant to the terms of the Employment Agreement, a de facto termination may only occur where the material duties, not', '- 12 - certain material duties, are removed from the position of SVP and CFO.”7 (Emphasis in original.) PCC contends that the arbitrator analyzed only “certain” material duties in contravention of this contractual requirement because he conducted “no analysis whatsoever with regard to the fact that [Mr.] Conklin continued to perform the duties relative to his responsibility for a daily financial operation of the entire Prospect CharterCARE system, the fact that [Mr. Conklin] remained on Prospect CharterCARE’s Senior Leadership Team, or the fact that [Mr.] Conklin remained the third highest ranking executive in the Prospect CharterCARE system with the exact same compensation and the same supervisory authority.” As such, in PCC’s view, the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the contractual provisions relative to the triggering of the “De Facto Termination” clause.', 'It is well established that “review of an arbitration award does not permit judicial re- examination of the relevant contractual language” unless the arbitrator’s award fails to draw its essence from the contract or is otherwise irrational. Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC, 91 A.3d at 837 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the instant case, the record reflects that the arbitrator reviewed and analyzed the pertinent portions of the Employment Agreement. His award clearly “draw[s] its essence” from that contract, and the extensive reasoning articulated in the award demonstrates that he did not manifestly disregard the contractual provisions or reach an irrational result such as would warrant the vacation of that award. Id. at 835.', 'As such, it is our view that the arbitrator’s opting not to engage in an extended narrative concerning Mr. Conklin’s non-operational duties should not serve as the basis for vacating the arbitration award.

21,v. : Ashner Alexis. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. A senseless compulsion for revenge resulted in the tragic and unintended death of George Holland, Jr. and the conviction of four conspirators. In the case under review, Ashner Alexis (Alexis or defendant) appeals from a judgment of conviction for murder (count 1); conspiracy to commit murder (count 2); and discharging a weapon while committing a crime of violence (count 3). He was sentenced to two consecutive life terms of imprisonment on counts 1 and 3, and ten years to serve on count 2, also to be served consecutively. He seeks to have his convictions reversed and the case remanded for a new trial, on the grounds that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying Alexis’s motions to pass and in overruling Alexis’s objections to photographic evidence, and because the trial justice erred in denying Alexis’s motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.1', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In January 2014, Seydina Limamou Ndoye contacted Alain Bedame about purchasing a weapon for self-protection. Bedame arranged a meeting with Johnathan and James Gomez so 1', 'This matter was heard at Lincoln High School.', '-1- that Ndoye could purchase a gun from them. At the meeting, Ndoye gave Johnathan and James $240 for the purchase of a Glock handgun, which the Gomez brothers represented they would procure from their uncle. Bedame also allowed Johnathan to borrow his cell phone so Johnathan could contact his uncle. The Gomez brothers then left, cell phone and $240 in hand, never to return. After fifteen-to-twenty minutes passed, Ndoye and Bedame picked up some friends and drove to the Gomez residence on Colfax Street in Providence. Ebony Gomez, Johnathan and James’s sister, told the group that her brothers were not at home. Ndoye told Ebony that he “wanted his stuff back.” Ndoye and Bedame eventually located and confronted Johnathan, whom Bedame described as “shaking” and appearing as though he “was about to cry.” Johnathan told Ndoye and Bedame that his uncle had robbed him of the cash and cell phone at gunpoint, but Johnathan promised that he would reimburse Ndoye and replace Bedame’s cell phone.', 'Later, Ndoye showed Bedame a photograph posted on James Gomez’s Facebook page, which, Ndoye believed, depicted James holding Bedame’s cell phone.', 'This initiated an exchange of hostile Facebook messages between Bedame and James Gomez. Thereafter, Alexis, having heard that Ndoye had been robbed by the Gomez brothers, contacted Ndoye on Facebook and told Ndoye that the Gomez brothers had also stolen scrap metal from Alexis’s yard. Ndoye asked Alexis for a firearm; and, on February 4, 2014, Bedame, Alexis, and Ndoye drove to Woonsocket to “get the gun” from Alexis’s friend.', 'When they arrived at the home of Alexis’s friend, Anthony Moore,2 they encountered twenty to twenty-five people having a party. Ndoye observed as Alexis informed Moore that he 2', 'Anthony Moore was also charged and convicted of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and using a firearm while committing a crime of violence for his involvement in the death of George Holland, Jr. See State v. Moore, 154 A.3d 472 (R.I. 2017).', '-2- wanted the gun because he had been robbed. Alexis told Moore that he would return the gun. Moore then directed Robert Winston to fetch a weapon. Winston and Bedame left the house to obtain the gun. Shortly thereafter, they returned and Winston placed a shotgun wrapped in a Cape Verdean flag and bullets with small pellets inside on the kitchen table. According to Ndoye, Moore picked up the weapon and handed it to Alexis, who tucked it into his waistband, causing him to walk with a pronounced limp. According to Ndoye, Alexis said that he would shoot “whoever comes to the door” at the Gomezes’ home.', 'Winston, Ndoye, Bedame, and Alexis left Moore’s house and headed to Providence. According to Ndoye, they first stopped at the house of Alexis’s girlfriend so that Alexis could change into dark clothes. Bedame then drove to the Gomezes’ home and parked a short distance away. Alexis took a pair of work gloves and wore one glove himself, giving the other to Winston. Alexis then put on a mask, removed the gun from the trunk of Bedame’s car, “stuff[ed] the gun inside his waistband,” and approached the Gomez house with Winston. Alexis instructed Winston to knock on the Gomezes’ window. When Winston complied, a shadow appeared behind the closed blinds, and Alexis fired the shotgun, shattering the window. Bedame and Ndoye heard the gunshot blast and then Alexis and Winston ran back to the car. According to Ndoye, once Alexis and Winston were inside the vehicle, Alexis was laughing “hysterically” and exclaimed excitedly, “I got him” and “I pulled the trigger.” Bedame recalled Alexis stating that he “fe[lt] like shooting somebody else.”', 'At this point, they left Bedame’s vehicle in Providence, picked up Ndoye’s car, and proceeded to Woonsocket to return the gun to Moore. En route, Bedame received a Facebook message from James Gomez that stated, “They’re coming for you, bro.” Hours later, Winston received a phone call from Moore, informing him that the wrong person had been shot.', '-3-', 'In fact, the shadowy figure behind the blinds at the Gomezes’s home was Ebony’s boyfriend, seventeen-year-old George Holland, Jr. Miguel Gomez, the father of Johnathan, James, and Ebony, was watching television in a bedroom with his girlfriend on the evening of February 4, 2014, when he heard a loud bang, followed by a flash of light and the sound of his children screaming that Holland had been shot. Mr. Gomez ran into the living room and saw Holland, lying on the floor amid shell casings and glass, as Ebony held a sweater to his abdomen. Holland was transported to Rhode Island Hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after ten o’clock that evening as a result of nine individual shotgun pellet strikes to his right abdominal area.', 'During the police investigation, James Gomez showed Providence Police Detective Kenneth Court the Facebook postings made by Bedame. Detective Court then spoke with Bedame, which conversation led him to contact Ndoye.', 'Both Bedame and Ndoye made statements implicating themselves, as well as Moore, Winston, and Alexis.', 'On March 28, 2014, Alexis was indicted along with Moore, Bedame, and Ndoye.3 Alexis was charged with the murder of Holland (count 1); conspiracy to commit murder (count 2); and discharging a weapon while committing a crime of violence (count 3). A jury trial commenced on November 6, 2014. On November 17, 2014, Alexis was found guilty on all three counts. On January 8, 2015, the trial justice denied Alexis’s motion for a new trial, and on February 12, 2015, he sentenced Alexis to two life sentences and ten years to serve, with each term to be served consecutively. 3', 'Winston entered into a cooperation agreement with the state in exchange for his promise to testify truthfully at Alexis’s trial. Bedame and Ndoye likewise entered into agreements with the state.', '-4-', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Alexis argues that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying his motions to pass the case because an emotional outburst by a witness and Ndoye’s reference during his testimony to a “mug shot” photograph of Alexis were extraordinarily prejudicial and because the instructions given were not sufficient to cure the prejudice. Alexis further contends that the trial justice abused his discretion in overruling his objection to the admission of a “gang” photograph. Alexis also argues that the cumulative effect doctrine should apply in this case. Lastly, Alexis argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial, arguing that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Alexis requests that his conviction be reversed, and that the case be remanded for a new trial.', 'A', 'Motions to Pass and Motions for Mistrial4', '1', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled that ‘a trial justice’s decision on a motion to pass the case is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not disturb the ruling on such a motion absent an abuse of discretion.’” State v. Rosado, 139 A.3d 419, 423 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Tully, 110 A.3d 1181, 1190-91 (R.I. 2015)). “We give great deference to the trial justice in this regard because he or she has a front-row seat at the trial and is in the best position to determine whether a defendant has been unfairly prejudiced.” Id. (quoting Tully, 110 A.3d at 4', '“A motion to pass a case is viewed for all intents and purposes as identical to a motion for a mistrial.” State v.

Moreira, 126 A.3d 447, 449 (R.I. 2015)).', 'a', 'Miguel Gomez’s Emotional Outburst', 'Alexis first argues that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying his motion for a mistrial because Mr. Gomez’s emotional outburst on the witness stand prejudiced the jury against him. Moreover, he contends that the cautionary instruction given by the trial justice was insufficient to cure the prejudicial effect.', 'i', 'Discussion', 'Mr. Gomez was the first witness for the state. While on the witness stand, the prosecutor showed him a photograph of Holland and asked him if he knew the identity of the young man in the photograph. Mr. Gomez started crying and stated, “Yeah. It’s George. He was like a son. He came all the time to the house.” Defense counsel made a motion for a mistrial and the trial justice immediately called a recess. In the absence of the jury, defense counsel argued that Mr. Gomez’s testimony did not provide any information that pertained to an essential element of any of the offenses and was not necessary to the state’s case. Defense counsel further argued that the extremely emotional nature of the testimony prejudiced the jury against Alexis and that the testimony “irreparably tainted [the] jury and prejudiced the jury against” Alexis.', '-6-', 'Although the trial justice acknowledged the emotional nature of Mr. Gomez’s response, he denied the motion for a mistrial. The trial justice explained that “[s]urrounding his crying his responses were rather conversational, not fraught with emotion.” The trial justice continued, “I’m not at all of a mind to believe that the witness’s very short, although clear degree of upsetness, is something that is going to interfere with this jury’s assigned work.” He stated, “although the gentleman became upset, his degree of upset will not inflame the passions of jurors so as to prevent their calm and dispassionate examination of the evidence.”', 'At the request of defense counsel, the trial justice gave a cautionary instruction when the jury returned to the courtroom. In giving the cautionary instruction, the trial justice stated:', '“All right. Folks, thank you for giving us a few minutes to', 'take up some matters outside your presence.', '“Mr. Gomez, obviously, as you know, became upset when', 'he was speaking about the death of George Holland. Cases such as', 'these, obviously, will engender some emotion. Sometimes even', 'spectators—it [h]asn’t happened yet, but sometimes even', 'spectators in the courtroom become unglued, if I can use the', 'vernacular. In those instances, we take a recess and let things calm', 'down.', '“And I simply want to remind you, as I said before the trial', 'started, that there would be instances, for example, during the', 'medical examiner’s testimony or during photographic evidence,', 'that would not be particularly pleasant, and I didn’t want you to be', 'distracted from your assigned responsibility simply because of', 'things that you heard on the stand or pictures that you saw.', '“I also reminded you at the beginning that—if I didn’t, I', 'certainly will emphasize it now, and probably later, and I think the', 'lawyers referred to it during their comments to you—sympathy', 'plays no part in the course of your deliberations. Obviously, Mr.', 'Gomez was upset to the extent that he may have engendered some', 'sympathy from you. Understand that notwithstanding his sad', 'feelings over the loss of the young man, that cannot be permitted to', 'affect your judgment as you go forward in this case and as you', 'deliberate.', '“In other words, you must not permit these kinds of events,', 'be they photographic pieces of evidence of an autopsy, or', 'testimony from someone who is near and dear to the deceased, or', 'things like that, you can’t permit those things to inflame your', '-7-', 'passions so as to prevent your calm and dispassionate examination', 'of the evidence and acceptance of the law that I will provide to you', 'at the end of the case.', '“Can all of you do that?”', 'The trial justice then questioned the jury, “Are there any of you at all who have been so affected by Mr. Gomez’s short interlude of sadness and crying on the stand that they cannot go forward? Anybody feel that way? Everybody okay?”', 'Alexis argues that the cautionary instruction was insufficient to cure the prejudice because the trial justice “did not direct the jurors to disregard the prejudicial emotional outburst, and he did not emphasize that this behavior did not relate to the guilt or innocence of Mr. Alexis.” Alexis further argues that the trial justice “failed to direct the jurors to not consider this emotional outburst, or to put the outburst out of their minds.”', 'We afford the trial justice a great deal of discretion in determining whether or not a witness’s emotional reaction inordinately inflamed the passions of the jury. See Rosado, 139 A.3d at 424. The trial justice is in the best position to determine whether or not the emotional outburst would distract the jury from its function. Id. at 423-24. Here, the trial justice considered the potential impact of the witness’s emotional display and determined that, despite the outburst, the jurors would be able to continue in their duties calmly and dispassionately.', '“[T]here is no ‘precise formula’ to determine whether any prejudicial taint may have been cured by a cautionary instruction.” State v. Hie, 93 A.3d 963, 973 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Oliviera, 882 A.2d 1097, 1127 (R.I. 2005)). Instead, “[e]ach case must be decided on an ad hoc basis and each challenged remark must be viewed in the context in which it appeared and in light of the attendant circumstances.” Id. (quoting State v. Hoyle, 122 R.I. 45, 48, 404 A.2d 69, 70-71 (1979)). Where “the trial justice decide[s] to ‘utilize a cautionary instruction[,]’ * * * ‘the question before us is whether [the trial justice’s] instruction can be fairly said to have removed', '-8- from [the jurors’ minds], when weighing the evidence properly before them, the taint represented’ * * *.” Id. (quoting State v. Brown, 528 A.2d 1098, 1103 (R.I. 1987)).', 'We are well satisfied that Mr. Gomez’s relatively short display of emotion on the witness stand did not warrant a mistrial and that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in denying Alexis’s motion. Moreover, we are of the opinion that the cautionary instruction given by the trial justice was sufficient to remove any possible taint caused by Mr. Gomez’s outburst from the minds of the jury. The defendant points to State v. Massey, 119 R.I. 666, 382 A.2d 801 (1978), for the proposition that a trial justice must inform the jury that they are not to consider the improper statement or outburst. The circumstances of this case, however, are distinguishable from Massey, where evidence of a prospective juror’s opinion that a defendant had committed the crime was heard by the entire prospective jury panel. Massey, 119 R.I. at 669-70, 382 A.2d at 803. Here, Mr. Gomez’s emotional response did not implicate Alexis in the crime. Further, while the trial justice did not specifically tell the jury to disregard the emotional display, he explained to the jury that “sympathy plays no part in the course of [their] deliberations” and that they were not to become “distracted from [their] assigned responsibility” or let the outburst “affect [their] judgment.” Finally, he twice asked the jurors whether they could put Mr. Gomez’s sadness and crying aside during their deliberations, to which the jurors collectively responded in the affirmative.', 'In our judgment, after a review of the record, considering the context in which Mr. Gomez’s emotional response was elicited, and the trial justice’s curative instruction, there is no reason to believe that the jury in the instant case was not able to make an objective evaluation of the evidence against Alexis. The trial justice, therefore, did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial.', '-9-', 'b', 'Ndoye’s Reference to Mug Shot Photograph', 'Alexis next argues that the trial justice abused his discretion in failing to pass the case because Ndoye’s characterization of a photo of Alexis as a mug shot by Ndoye was extraordinarily prejudicial and the cautionary instruction was insufficient to cure the prejudice.', 'i', 'Discussion', 'At trial, upon being asked if he recognized a photograph, Ndoye stated, “It’s a mugshot of Ashner Alexis.” Defense counsel objected, the objection was sustained, and then defense counsel moved to strike the testimony.', 'The trial justice ruled, “It is stricken, of course.” Defense counsel then moved at sidebar to pass the case and requested, in the alternative, a cautionary instruction. Though the trial justice agreed that the photograph was not necessary to the state’s case, he denied the motion to pass. The trial justice noted that the photograph was “clearly a photograph of the processing of [] defendant,” but indicated that “[t]he [s]tate is very fortunate in this instance that [] defendant is in custody * * * [and] that the jury knows he’s in custody” because “all people who are detained in custody have a photograph taken.”', 'The trial justice gave a cautionary instruction, which stated:', '“Ladies and gentlemen, you’ve heard me sustain [defense', 'counsel’s] objection to this witness’s gratuitous, editorial comment', 'that the photograph that he was shown was somehow or another a', 'mugshot.', '“It is not a mugshot. Simply because the police department', 'has a photograph of the defendant doesn’t mean that he committed', 'this or any other crime. The police collect pictures of many people', 'from many sources and for many different purposes.', '“How many of you have a driver’s license? Every single', 'one of you. The DMV has a picture of every single one of you.', 'And for a dollar and fifty cents, whatever the going rate is these', '- 10 -', 'days, you can get a copy. If the police wanted a picture of you,', 'they have it at their fingertips.', '“The photograph shall not be admitted into evidence. The', 'witness’s gratuitous comment as to how he describes it is', 'erroneous. It’s not what he [said] it is, and let’s move on.”', 'Alexis argues that the instruction was inadequate to cure the prejudice because the trial justice “did not direct the jurors to disregard the mugshot characterization, and he did not emphasize that this gratuitous comment did not relate to the guilt or innocence of Mr. Alexis.” Alexis further argues that the trial justice “failed to direct the jurors to not consider this comment, or to put the comment out of their minds. Instead, [the trial justice] said that the photograph was not a mugshot.”', 'Here, the trial justice instructed the jurors that the term “mug shot” was inaccurate and was not indicative of any criminal activity on the part of defendant. This Court has expressed that “the introduction of mug-shot photographs clearly has the potential of unfairly tipping the scales of justice in favor of one party or the other[,]” Thomas v. Proctor, 63 A.3d 881, 887 (R.I. 2013), because “they generally indicate past criminal behavior and are likely to create in the minds of jurors an inference of criminal behavior.” State v. Dinagen, 639 A.2d 1353, 1356 (R.I. 1994). However, a cautionary instruction can be curative of prejudice. See State v. Werner, 831 A.2d 183, 207 (R.I. 2003) (determining that a cautionary instruction that expresses that the term “mug shot” does not “connote anything with regard to [the] defendant’s guilt or his participation in the crime or any other crime” was sufficient). We conclude that, although the photograph at issue was described as a mug shot in front of the jury, the witness’s statement was stricken, the photograph was not placed into evidence, and the jury was told that the photograph was not a mug shot and that the photograph was not indicative of defendant’s guilt in this or any other', '- 11 - crime. We are satisfied that this instruction was sufficient to cure any prejudice and that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion.', 'B', 'Admissibility of Photograph', 'Alexis next argues that the trial justice abused his discretion in admitting a photograph depicting Moore, Alexis, Winston, and others at Moore’s house party on February 4, 2014, because “[t]he probative value of the photograph was substantially outweighed by the prejudicial effect * * *.”', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides that, even if evidence is considered relevant, it “may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” “It is well settled that this Court will not disturb a trial justice’s ruling on an evidentiary issue unless that ruling constitutes an abuse of the justice’s discretion that prejudices the complaining party.” State v. Tetreault, 31 A.3d 777, 782 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Dellay, 687 A.2d 435, 439 (R.I. 1996)). This Court has indicated “that a trial justice’s discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be used sparingly[,]” and “[i]t is only when evidence is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that a trial justice must exclude it.” State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008).', '- 12 -', '2', 'Discussion', 'Winston testified that the photograph at issue was taken at Moore’s house and explained that the photograph depicted himself, Alexis, Moore, and other individuals at the party; but the photograph did not display Ndoye or Bedame. Later at trial, defense counsel objected to the admission of the photograph as a full exhibit, arguing that the photograph was unduly prejudicial because the individuals were making hand gestures or signs that appeared to be gang-related. Defense counsel also argued that the photograph was irrelevant because it was uncontested that Alexis was at Moore’s party. The state argued that the photograph was relevant as it bore directly on the credibility of the witnesses, and that it was not unduly prejudicial because the word “gang” had not been used throughout the trial. The trial justice overruled the objection, finding the photograph to be “relevant for purposes of showing the concert of action, concert of activity, corroboration of testimony[,]” and “credibility * * * of witnesses who have testified.” The trial justice also found that the evidence was not unduly prejudicial because there was no evidentiary basis to support an inference of gang activity. The trial justice also gave a cautionary instruction to the jury, which provided:', '“That picture that portrays some young men, ladies and', 'gentlemen, you’ve heard some testimony about them, a group of', 'some sort, and I simply want to caution you that simply because a', 'person may be a member of or affiliated with a group is in no way', 'to be considered as evidence that the person is somehow', 'necessarily disposed to commit a crime or crimes.”', 'Alexis argues before this Court that the photograph was “enormously prejudicial to Mr. Alexis because all of the young men in that photograph looked like a bunch of thugs who should be locked up forever * * *.” Alexis asserts that “[n]obody was contesting that Mr. Alexis, Mr. Winston or Mr. Moore were at that party and this was not an issue at trial.” Alexis also argues', '- 13 - that the trial justice’s cautionary instruction was insufficient to cure the prejudice of the photograph because “the photographs [were] obviously gang pictures and extremely prejudicial to Mr. Alexis.”', 'Based on the record, this photograph appears highly probative of defendant’s guilt because it was taken the evening of Holland’s death; shows Alexis with two individuals who, according to the state’s theory of the case, were involved in the murder of Holland; and was taken at the location where the murder weapon was said to have been procured. See DeJesus, 947 A.2d at 883 (“It is only when evidence is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that a trial justice must exclude it.”).', 'We agree with the trial justice here that there is no evidentiary basis to support an inference of gang activity based on the photograph alone. See Delarosa, 59 A.3d at 1188 (stating that it is within the sound discretion of the trial justice to admit or exclude photographic evidence). However, even if this photograph may have raised a question in the minds of the jurors regarding Alexis’s affiliation with a gang, the trial justice’s cautionary instruction sufficiently directed the jury not to infer criminal activity on the part of Alexis based on his affiliation with the individuals in the photograph. Therefore, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the photograph.', 'C', 'Cumulative Effect Doctrine', 'Alexis also argues that “the cumulative effect of all of the errors and abuses of discretion in this case resulted in the denial * * * of a fundamentally fair trial.” Because we have concluded that none of the rulings complained of constituted an abuse of discretion, this claim is', '- 14 - without merit. See State v.

Alexis asserts that the evidence against him was based entirely on the credibility of the state’s witnesses and avers that these witnesses were not credible because they had been “bought and paid for” by the state, had time to confer with one another, “gave self-serving testimony, lied, contradicted each other and themselves, and tried to deflect responsibility from themselves to [Alexis] * * *.” Specifically, Alexis argues that Ndoye’s testimony was incredible because he “deleted all of his Facebook conversations before he went to talk with the Providence Police * * *.” Alexis also maintains that Bedame’s testimony was not credible because he lied “about not being mad at the Gomez brothers” when “his Facebook records indicated he was furious and wanted the Gomez brothers dead.” Finally, Alexis avers that Winston’s testimony was incredible because he “lied to the police about nearly everything * * *.” Moreover, Alexis argues that he had no motive to become involved in a confrontation that was strictly between the Gomez brothers, Ndoye, and Bedame.

A grand jury indicted Andre Marizan (Marizan or defendant) on February 14, 2014 on two counts of first-degree sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-2(1) and 11-37-3.1 After a jury trial in Providence County Superior Court, the defendant was convicted on January 23, 2015.', 'On appeal, the defendant argues that the prosecutor’s closing argument improperly commented on the defendant’s failure to testify, thereby violating his Fifth Amendment constitutional rights.', 'Additionally, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in admitting the defendant’s photograph into evidence and also by denying his motion for new trial. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The state eventually amended count 1 to cover both theories of liability—that the victim was mentally incapacitated and physically helpless. See G.L. 1956 § 11-37-2(1).', '1', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The complaining witness, Alicia,2 testified at trial. She recalled that, on August 18, 2012, after a night of drinking with friends, she woke up next to one of her sister’s friends, Marizan. The previous day, Alicia and her sister, Lauren, had gone to a South County beach for a few hours. While there, they consumed Hennessy liquor;3 and, when the beach closed, they went to Lauren’s ex-boyfriend’s house in Providence and continued drinking there with a group of Lauren’s friends.', 'Around 8:00 p.m., Alicia, Lauren, defendant, and another friend drove to a clothing store in the Olneyville section of Providence. After shopping, the group went to a liquor store and also picked up some food before returning to the house to join the others. The group of six friends continued drinking well into the night, and Alicia testified that she had planned to sleep at the house.', 'The party eventually moved from the living room to a bedroom. At some point after 11:00 p.m. but before 3:00 a.m., the group purchased alcohol from a bootlegger.4 After smoking marijuana and continuing to drink alcohol, Alicia testified that she vomited and later “passed out” on the bed in the bedroom.', 'When Alicia woke up around 7:00 a.m., she testified that she was not wearing pants or underwear, and she recalled that she also felt a wet substance on her leg. 5 She saw defendant at 2', 'We use pseudonyms when referencing the complaining witness and her sister. 3', 'Hennessy has an alcohol content between eighty and one hundred proof. 4', 'A “bootlegger” is a person “who sells alcohol illegally after hours.” State v. Offley, 131 A.3d 663, 665 n.2 (R.I. 2016). 5', 'She also testified that she had a gritty, powdery material on her face. Later, her sister informed her that it was baking soda—the result of a prank perpetrated by the others on Alicia and defendant, while they were sleeping. A video of the prank was recorded on Lauren’s phone, and it was shown to the jury at trial.', '2 the corner of the bed and subsequently began “flipping out” on him. Alicia stated that defendant told her she was “bugging” and nothing happened between them—he said that the substance on her leg was urine. Alicia said that defendant told her she had removed her clothing after urinating on herself.', 'Alicia went to the living room, where her sister and a couple of friends were sitting. Lauren assisted in finding Alicia’s clothes. Alicia—who had been a professional boxer— testified that, before she put her clothes back on, she attempted to attack defendant, but was stopped by the friend who lived there. Alicia remembered leaving the house with her sister, who drove her to Women & Infants Hospital in Providence, where a sexual-assault examination was conducted.', 'At trial, Lauren also testified. She recalled that, a little after 3:00 a.m., she and a few of the friends present that evening had played the prank on Alicia and defendant while they were sleeping, and one person had recorded it on Lauren’s cell phone. In the video, three individuals are visible: Lauren, Alicia—who appeared to be passed out—and a third person, whom Lauren identified as defendant. Lauren recalled that, after the video was taken, defendant got out of bed and went to the bathroom to wash his face.', 'Lauren testified that, when defendant returned to the bedroom, she and two of her friends went back to the living room. Lauren recalled that, after about ten to fifteen minutes, one of her friends attempted to open the bedroom door, but it was locked. When the friend finally found the key to the room, Lauren remembered, she went into the bedroom and found Alicia without her pants on and still asleep. Lauren testified that she observed defendant wearing only boxer shorts, although he had “regular” shorts on earlier in the night.', '3', 'Lauren stated that, even though she was concerned at that point, she left the room and stayed in the living room until around 6:00 a.m., when she left the house to go to a restaurant with her friends for something to eat. After about thirty minutes to an hour at the restaurant, she returned to the apartment and woke Alicia.', 'At this point, Lauren testified, Alicia started attacking Marizan, and Lauren heard Marizan tell Alicia that she had urinated in a cup and that “nothing happened.” Soon after, Marizan left, and Lauren and Alicia went to the hospital.', 'Amy Corrado was the nurse in the emergency room at Women & Infants Hospital in Providence that day. Corrado testified that she performed a sexual-assault exam on Alicia. She recalled that Alicia had told her that she had showered but was wearing the same clothes she had been wearing the night before. Corrado used swabs to take samples from Alicia’s body. She did not find any injuries on her body. Corrado notified the police on Alicia’s behalf.', 'At trial, Detective Joseph Villella testified that he responded to a house in Providence to investigate a suspected sexual assault. Detective Villella collected the bedding from the scene for testing at the Rhode Island Department of Health. Detective William Corrigan also testified regarding his involvement in the case and recalled taking formal statements from both Alicia and Lauren on August 21, 2012. When she gave her statement at the police station, Alicia also identified defendant from a “mug shot”6 shown to her. A few months later, on October 12, 2012, Det. Corrigan received Marizan’s consent to take a buccal swab of his mouth.', 'However, Det. Corrigan did not obtain an arrest warrant until January 2013, and Marizan was not arrested until August 2013. Moreover, Det. Corrigan testified that he had not taken witness statements from three men who were at the house during the evening of the alleged 6', 'The “mug shot,” as characterized by defendant, portrayed two pictures of defendant next to each other—one of defendant facing the camera and the other a side profile. The admissibility of the “mug shot” is at issue in this appeal.', '4 assault because Alicia warned him that the men were defendant’s friends and would not cooperate.', 'At trial, Cara Lupino, the supervisor of the Rhode Island Department of Health Forensic DNA Laboratory, also testified for the state. She explained that the only swab from the sexual- assault examination performed on Alicia at the hospital that tested positive for seminal fluid was the vaginal swab. However, Lupino noted that the seminal fluid did not contain any sperm cells. She also testified that the department received the bedding from the Providence police, and the laboratory tested what was determined to be a bloodstain on a bed sheet for DNA; she concluded that the blood came from a male donor.', 'In addition, Lupino testified that the laboratory used reference samples from the buccal swab of Marizan and from Alicia’s sexual-assault examination.', 'Lupino explained that, in December 2012, the DNA test done on the vaginal swab did not reveal whether the small amount of seminal fluid on the swab was consistent with defendant’s DNA profile. Subsequently, however, the laboratory acquired the capability to perform Y-STR testing, which Lupino considered an effective method for this case due to the lack of sperm in the seminal fluid sample and the overwhelming amount of female cells on the vaginal swab. After the testing was conducted, Lupino testified, the results showed that the Y-STR DNA profile from the vaginal swab was consistent with Marizan’s Y-STR DNA profile.7', 'During closing arguments, defendant moved for a mistrial, arguing that one of the prosecutor’s comments violated his Fifth Amendment right to not testify. The trial justice 7', '“Y-STR’s are found only on the Y chromosome; thus, they only appear in males. Because the Y-STR testing ignores the female DNA that often overwhelms the male DNA, it is a helpful method when the sample contains a mixture of both male and female DNA.” People v. Stevey, 148 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1, 5 (Cal. Ct. App. 2012). However, with Y-STR testing, “it is not possible to identify a particular individual because a male inherits the DNA type from his father and shares the same type with male siblings, uncles, and cousins.” Id.', '5 reserved decision on the motion for a mistrial. After the trial justice gave general instructions,8 the jury deliberated, returning with a guilty verdict. Immediately following the verdict, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a mistrial.', 'The defendant then moved for a new trial. The trial justice denied the motion and sentenced defendant to forty years, with twenty-five years to serve and fifteen years suspended with probation. He was also required to register as a sex offender and obtain counseling. The defendant timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Given the various issues raised on appeal, we outline the standard of review for each issue in turn.', 'First, when this Court reviews a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for a mistrial, we afford the decision “great weight” and reverse only “if it was clearly wrong.” State v. Fry, 130 A.3d 812, 828 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Tucker, 111 A.3d 376, 388 (R.I. 2015)). We acknowledge that a trial justice “has a ‘front row seat,’ allowing him or her to ‘best determine the effect of the improvident remarks upon the jury.’” State v. McRae, 31 A.3d 785, 789 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198, 1207 (R.I. 1995)). As such, when a trial justice rules on a motion for a mistrial, he or she “must determine whether the evidence would cause the jurors to be so inflamed as to make them unable to decide the case on the basis of the evidence presented.” State v. Enos, 21 A.3d 326, 332 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Luciano, 739 A.2d 222, 228 (R.I. 1999)). However, “with respect to questions of law and mixed questions of law and 8', 'There was some confusion during oral argument regarding when the general instructions were given to the jury, but the record is clear that the instructions were given immediately following the prosecutor’s closing argument.', '6 fact involving constitutional issues,” we employ a de novo review. State v. Snell, 892 A.2d 108, 115 (R.I. 2006).', 'Evidentiary rulings, on the other hand, are reviewed for abuse of discretion. State v. Whitfield, 93 A.3d 1011, 1016 (R.I. 2014). Moreover, we “will not disturb the trial justice’s ruling unless the abuse of discretion resulted in prejudicial error.” State v. Moore, 154 A.3d 472, 481 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Williams, 137 A.3d 682, 686 (R.I. 2016)).', 'With respect to the motion for new trial, this Court “give[s] ‘great weight’ to a trial justice’s ruling when [he or] she ‘articulate[s] sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.’” State v. Withers, 172 A.3d 765, 768 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Kizekai, 19 A.3d 583, 589 (R.I. 2011)). “A party may base a motion for a new trial ‘on the grounds that the weight of the evidence was not adequate to convict a defendant.’” Moore, 154 A.3d at 480 (quoting State v. Lopez, 129 A.3d 77, 83 (R.I. 2016)). “If the trial justice has articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion, his or her decision is entitled to great weight and will not be overturned by this Court unless he or she has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” State v. Florez, 138 A.3d 789, 793 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 233 (R.I. 2012)). The trial justice acts as a “‘superjuror’ who independently weighs the evidence and assesses the credibility of the witnesses.” State v. Breton, 138 A.3d 800, 803 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Battle v. State, 125 A.3d 130, 132 (R.I. 2015)).', '7', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Constitutional Right to Remain Silent at Trial', 'In the instant case, defendant contends that the trial justice should have granted his motion for a mistrial after the prosecutor started her closing argument with the following comment:', '“Let’s clear up one thing. There’s not a shred of evidence in this', 'case, not a shred before you, to suggest that this was consensual', 'sex. Not from [Alicia]. Certainly not from [Lauren]. And not', 'from him.” The United States Supreme Court has held that “the Fifth Amendment * * * forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused’s silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.” Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 615 (1965); see also Enos, 21 A.3d at 332 (recognizing that the United States Supreme Court has “restricted prosecutors, judges, and witnesses from commenting on, or even mentioning, a defendant’s decision to remain silent after that defendant was informed of his or her Miranda rights”).', 'To determine if a comment is violative of a defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights, our inquiry centers on whether “the language used in the [prosecutor’s] comment was manifestly intended or was of such a character that a jury would naturally and necessarily construe it to amount to a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.” State v. Fontaine, 113 R.I. 557, 563, 323 A.2d 571, 574 (1974). Furthermore, the “assessment of the propriety of prosecutorial argument to a jury requires review of the questioned statement in context and in light of attendant circumstances, rather than in isolation,” and we engage in interpretation “of its meaning not in how we read it from the printed page, but in how a jury composed of ordinarily', '8 intelligent lay persons would understand it as they listened to the prosecutor’s closing argument.” State v. Andrews, 120 R.I. 771, 775-76, 390 A.2d 926, 929 (1978).', 'In the event that such a comment violates this standard, curing the error requires that “a cautionary instruction be given immediately in order that the seed planted by the remark will not be given time to germinate.” State v. Oliveira, 774 A.2d 893, 912 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Sherman, 113 R.I. 77, 81-82, 317 A.2d 445, 448 (1974)). Moreover, in such an event, “[t]he cautionary instruction must be such that the jury is informed in language understandable by the ordinary, reasonable man that the defendant has a constitutional right to be free from compulsion of any kind, physical or mental, to testify in his own defense.” Id. (quoting Sherman, 113 R.I. at 82, 317 A.2d at 448) (holding that the trial justice’s two separate cautionary instructions that “defendants need not testify, and that no adverse inference was to be drawn from a defendant’s election not to testify” were sufficient to correct any damage from the attorney’s comments that no defendant had testified as to a certain issue).', 'In past cases, we have acknowledged our willingness to “revers[e] convictions for prejudicial misstatements by the prosecution” in certain situations. State v. Simpson, 606 A.2d 677, 679 (R.I. 1992). For instance, we have held that, in a trial with three defendants where one defendant elected not to testify, the trial justice’s failure to instruct the jury at the close of the evidence as to the defendant’s right not to testify was prejudicial error. State v. Simpson, 595 A.2d 803, 805-06 (R.I. 1991).', 'On the other hand, in Enos, we considered whether a defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights were violated when a police officer testified that the defendant had not given the officer any information after being instructed on his Miranda rights, and we concluded that the trial justice was not clearly wrong in denying the motion for a mistrial. Enos, 21 A.3d at 332-33, 334. In', '9 that case, after denying the defendant’s motion for a mistrial, the trial justice instructed the jury as follows: “After Mr. Enos was administered Miranda rights, if you find that to be the case, you should know he had the right to remain silent if he chose to remain silent. That cannot be used against him.” Id. at 333. We opined that, even though the comment did “implicate[] the defendant’s right to remain silent,” the trial justice’s curative instruction to the jury sufficed to extinguish “any prejudice that may have arisen * * *.” Id. at 334. Furthermore, we noted that the remark was not of the nature that would tend to “inflame” the jury so that the jury “could not reach an unimpassioned decision by looking solely at the evidence that was properly before them.” Id.', 'In the case at bar, after the prosecutor’s allegedly prejudicial comment, defense counsel objected and explained the basis for his motion for a mistrial in the absence of the jury. The prosecutor argued that she had not been alluding to defendant’s right to remain silent, but rather was only commenting on defendant’s statement that was in evidence—namely, that he had told Alicia she had urinated on herself. The trial justice reserved decision and brought the jury back into the courtroom. At that point, the prosecutor repeated to the jury what she had said to the trial justice—that, when confronted by Alicia, defendant told her nothing had happened and that she had urinated on herself.', 'When the closing arguments were complete, the trial justice delivered his general jury instructions, during which he explained that defendant enjoyed a presumption of innocence, and also possessed the right to not testify.9 The trial justice also told the jury that what is said in 9', 'The general instructions included the following:', '“Now, as I told you at the outset, this defendant, like every', 'defendant in a criminal case, enjoys the presumption of innocence.', 'Now, what that means is that this defendant, as he appears here', '10 closing arguments by the attorneys is not evidence. After deliberation, the jury returned with a guilty verdict. Thereafter, the trial justice addressed and denied the motion for a mistrial.', 'The state argues before this Court that the prosecutor was not commenting on defendant’s choice not to testify, but rather that she was responding to defendant’s contention in his closing argument that the sex was consensual.10 While defendant does not disagree that a prosecutor is permitted to rebut a consent argument, he argues that the statement—“And not from him”— crossed the line.', 'When considering whether the prosecutor’s statements violated defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights, those comments must be read in their entirety. See State v. Boillard, 789 A.2d 881, 885 (R.I. 2002) (“The probable effect of the prosecutorial statements on the outcome of the case must be evaluated by examining the remarks in the context in which they were made.”). We also note that the trial justice is in a much better position to make factual findings and credibility determinations than we are because he “actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and * * * had an opportunity to * * * take into account * * * [those] realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.” State v. Gonzalez, 986', 'today sitting at counsel table, is presumed to be innocent because', 'the [s]tate, which brings the charge, must prove each and every', 'element of that charge beyond a reasonable doubt. The defendant', 'need not prove anything. The defendant does not have to prove his', 'innocence. It is up to the [s]tate to prove him guilty beyond a', 'reasonable doubt. If the defendant—and in this case the defendant', 'chose to exercise his right not to present evidence or to testify in', '[sic] his own behalf, and you cannot draw any adverse inference or', 'bad conclusion or hold it against him because he chose to exercise', 'that right. And again, that presumption of innocence which he', 'enjoys stays with him throughout the course of the trial and', 'remains with him right into the jury room and only disappears if', 'you decide collectively and unanimously that the [s]tate has met its', 'burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to the charge of', 'first[-]degree sexual assault.” 10', 'The defendant asked for and received a consent instruction.', '11 A.2d 235, 242 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In the Matter of the Dissolution of Anderson, Zangari & Bossian, 888 A.2d 973, 975 (R.I. 2006)).', 'This is not a case where the prosecutor directly commented on a defendant’s failure to take the stand and testify at trial. Rather, the prosecutor stated that there was no evidence before the jury that the sex was consensual, including none from defendant. In fact, after the trial justice heard defendant’s motion for a mistrial and the jury returned to the courtroom, the prosecutor continued her closing argument as follows:', '“When confronted by [Alicia] the next morning and overheard by', '[Lauren] the next morning, what was this defendant’s response?', 'What was the first thing he said that morning? You’re bugging.', 'Nothing happened. You pissed yourself. That was his response.', 'Now, ask yourself, does that sound like a response of someone', 'who woke up and had a drunken night of consensual sex? No, it’s', 'not. You know that. You know that’s not what happened here.', 'What is it? What does that sound like? It sounds like someone', 'who took advantage of a woman that he could never get if she was', 'awake.” As such, the prosecutor suggested that she was merely continuing to speak about the issue of consent, which indeed had been raised by defense counsel in his closing argument.', '“A prosecutor is given considerable latitude in closing argument, as long as the statements pertain only to the evidence presented and represent reasonable inferences from the record.” State v. Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d 268, 278 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885). Because we read that statement in context, we are satisfied that the prosecutor’s comment indicates that she was referring to defendant’s denial of any sexual relations with the complaining witness.', 'In fact, when the trial justice denied the motion for a mistrial, he found that the prosecutor’s comment did not implicate Marizan’s right to remain silent at all, and thus, he said that he would not have given a cautionary instruction in any event. He explained:', '12', '“[I]n response to [defense counsel’s argument] that [the', 'prosecutor] got up and said, ‘First let me address this issue of', 'consent’, and said, you didn’t hear, and she named [Lauren] or', '[Alicia], saying that there had been consent, nor did you hear from', 'your client, and at that point [defense counsel] made [his] motion,', 'and we heard [him] at the sidebar, and [he] said that that was [an]', 'unfair comment on [defendant’s] Fifth Amendment right * * * and', '[the prosecutor] explained that she was talking about what he said', 'to [Alicia], and quite frankly, when she said that, it certainly made', 'sense to me, and I believe it was fair comment because that was the', 'testimony in the case.” We agree with the trial justice that the prosecutor’s statement, taken in context, did not violate defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights.', 'We are further comforted by the fact that the trial justice gave the general instructions immediately after the prosecutor completed her closing argument, and we presume such instructions are followed by the jury. See Whitfield, 93 A.3d at 1022; see also State v. Hunt, 137 A.3d 689, 694 (R.I. 2016). In this case, the portion of the general instructions pertaining to defendant’s right not to testify adequately expressed that he had every right to remain silent, and also admonished that such a choice could not be held against him.11', 'We caution that, in some cases, such comments by prosecutors “may approach the line of improper prosecutorial conduct.” Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d at 279. Here, however, given the broader context of the comment, we conclude that the prosecutor’s statement was not “of such a character that a jury would naturally and necessarily construe it to amount to a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.” Fontaine, 113 R.I. at 563, 323 A.2d at 574. Thus, we hold that the trial justice did not clearly err in denying the motion for a mistrial. 11', 'The trial justice also gave preliminary instructions at the start of the trial as to defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights.', '13', 'B', 'Admissibility of Defendant’s “Mug Shot”', 'We now turn to defendant’s second contention, that his “mug shot” was improperly admitted into evidence.', 'In accordance with the test we first outlined in State v. Lemon, 456 A.2d 261 (R.I. 1983), in order to introduce “mug shots” at trial, “(1) the prosecution must have a demonstrable need to introduce the photographs; (2) the photographs * * * must not imply that the defendant had a prior criminal record; and (3) the manner of introduction at trial must be such that it does not draw particular attention to the source or implications of the photographs.” State v. Long, 488 A.2d 427, 431 (R.I. 1985) (citing Lemon, 456 A.2d at 265).', 'In Long, in reviewing the first prong of the Lemon test, we determined that the trial justice had abused his discretion when he ruled that the state had shown a “demonstrable need” to introduce the photographs. Long, 488 A.2d at 432. We held that the purported reason to introduce the photographs there—a five-month delay between the crime and the first identification of the defendant—was not sufficient to satisfy the requirement. Id.', 'Long also identified a number of reasons why the introduction of a “mug shot” at trial may be necessary to prove the prosecution’s case. Long, 488 A.2d at 432-33. For example, such pictures may be used to strengthen a witness’s identification of a defendant in court if there is hesitation or doubt with the in-court identification. Id. at 432 (citing United States v. Fosher, 568 F.2d 207, 213 (1st Cir. 1978)). Such photographs may also be used in situations where a defendant appears physically different at trial than he did at the time of the arrest. Id. at 433. However, we determined that no such need was present in Long and, therefore, we concluded that the trial justice abused his discretion in permitting the state to introduce the pictures based on demonstrable need. Id.', '14', 'With respect to the second prong of the Lemon test, in State v. Dinagen, 639 A.2d 1353 (R.I. 1994), we held that the state failed to satisfy this prong because the photographs suggested a prior criminal record. Dinagen, 639 A.2d at 1357. In that case, the prosecution had altered the pictures by cutting out the middle of the photograph that had contained the identification plaque held by the defendant, but left two stamps of the police department visible on the back of the photograph. Id.; but see State v. Delarosa, 59 A.3d 1185, 1189 (R.I. 2013) (deeming the Lemon test unnecessary where the photographs at issue, although taken while the defendant was incarcerated, contained no suggestion that he was in prison at the time).', 'We have previously noted “double-shot pictures, with front and profile shots alongside each other, could reasonably lead one to believe that the person in the photographs has had trouble with the police.” State v. Maxie, 554 A.2d 1028, 1032 (R.I. 1989). As such, we have held that, at the very least, in order to properly sanitize a double-shot photograph, the prosecution should be required to separate the photographs, given this inference and the slight effort required to do so. Id.', 'In the case at bar, the photograph most certainly fails the first two prongs of the Lemon test. With respect to the first prong, the trial justice did not address whether the state had a need for the pictures. However, the prosecutor acknowledged that defendant’s identity was not at issue at trial because Alicia “obviously” knew him, and the photograph had been used solely for the police to get an identification of defendant from Alicia. For those reasons, we find that the state failed to show a “demonstrable need” for the picture before introducing it. See Long, 488 A.2d at 431. At trial, the trial justice focused his analysis on the second prong, ruling that his cautionary instruction was sufficient without the need to cut the double-shot photograph in half.', '15 Yet, because the separation of such photographs would be a simple process, we conclude that the state failed to satisfy the second prong of the Lemon test as well. See Maxie, 554 A.2d at 1032.', 'Nonetheless, even if the state fails to meet the Lemon test, we still must inquire as to whether the admission of the photographs was reversible error. Dinagen, 639 A.2d at 1357. In trials where the state provides “competent evidence from which the jury could convict the defendant” aside from the improperly admitted photograph, the introduction of such a picture “is not prejudicial[.]” Id. Moreover, “[t]he inclusion of objectionable evidence may be harmless if ‘it is not reasonably possible that such evidence would influence an average jury on the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.’” Id. (quoting State v. Bowden, 439 A.2d 263, 269 (R.I. 1982)).', 'In Long, we determined that the admission of the photograph was not reversible error because of the existence of other evidence that supported a finding that the defendant was guilty. Long, 488 A.2d at 433. This evidence included pretrial identifications that were witnessed by two other people and an in-court identification of the defendant.', 'Id.', 'Moreover, we acknowledged that the photographs were adequately sanitized to remove any suggestion of a criminal record and not referred to as “mug shots” at trial. Id.', 'Likewise, in Dinagen, we held that the admission of the defendant’s picture was not prejudicial because the jury heard evidence of the defendant’s prior criminal record. Dinagen, 639 A.2d at 1357-58. That evidence, coupled with the fact that there was “other evidence of the defendant’s prior contacts with law enforcement” and also “strong evidence of the defendant’s guilt,” was sufficient for us to conclude that there was no reversible error. Id. at 1358.', 'Here, the trial justice gave the following cautionary instruction immediately prior to the prosecutor’s publication of defendant’s picture to the jury:', '“[T]he relevance of this exhibit is simply that this was the', 'photograph shown to [Alicia] on August 21, 2012 which she', '16', 'identified as the defendant, Mr. Marizan, and it has no other', 'purpose, and you cannot infer or draw any conclusion other than', 'the fact that this—or her testimony that she’s identified this. These', 'photographs are obtained from a variety of sources. As you know', 'on the Internet now there are many places where you can find', 'photos of individuals; LinkedIn, Facebook, et cetera. So you can’t', 'draw any inference other than the fact that this was the photograph', 'shown to the witness at the police station on August 21.” Furthermore, the DNA evidence at trial demonstrated the presence of defendant’s seminal fluid in the vaginal swab samples taken from Alicia at the hospital, and two witnesses for the state— including Alicia—corroborated each other’s testimony, all of which was buttressed by the video that showed Alicia seemingly unconscious. See Long, 488 A.2d at 433 (relying on “strong evidence” of the defendants’ guilt with respect to the pretrial identification of the defendants as sufficient to overcome improper introduction of the photographs). We are satisfied that, because of this other evidence of guilt and the trial justice’s timely and thorough cautionary instruction with respect to defendant’s photograph, the admission was not reversible error. See Dinagen, 639 A.2d at 1358.', 'C', 'Motion for New Trial', 'Finally, defendant appeals the denial of his motion for new trial. The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in making the two following findings in denying the motion for new trial: (1) finding Alicia and Lauren credible as witnesses regarding nonconsensual sexual intercourse; and (2) interpreting Lupino’s testimony regarding the Y-STR DNA results of Alicia’s sexual-assault examination as equal to standard DNA results.', 'In ruling on a motion for new trial, we emphasize that a trial justice should deny such a motion if he or she “concludes that reasonable minds could differ as to the result or if the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury did * * *.” Kizekai, 19 A.3d at 590 (quoting State', '17 v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 641 (R.I. 2011)). The defendant challenged the trial justice’s acceptance of Alicia’s testimony because of her purported motive to lie. At trial, Alicia testified that she had broken up with her boyfriend before the night in question. Based on that testimony, defendant contended that Alicia may have fabricated her testimony to appease her boyfriend.', 'The trial justice, in finding Alicia credible, adequately acknowledged the entirety of her statements, including her purported motive to lie. He also made note of her extensive alcohol and drug use that evening. See State v. Lopez, 149 A.3d 459, 465 (R.I. 2016) (declining to entertain the defendant’s argument that the trial justice should not have believed the state’s witnesses because they had motives to fabricate their testimony). Still, in finding Alicia to be a credible witness, the trial justice relied on the fact that her testimony was corroborated by Lauren’s statements, the video of the prank that showed Alicia to be unconscious, and the DNA evidence. See State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 367 (R.I. 2011) (upholding a denial of a motion for new trial where the trial justice “appropriately reviewed ‘the entire record’ and sufficiently outlined her reasons for denying” the motion). Consequently, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err when he found Alicia credible.', 'In ruling on the motion for new trial, the trial justice also found Lauren’s testimony credible, noting that her testimony was corroborated by both Alicia’s testimony and by the DNA evidence. The trial justice also pointed out that Lauren’s testimony regarding the baking soda prank and the timeline of finding the door locked while her sister and defendant were in the room was echoed by the video of the prank that evidenced Alicia’s apparent unconsciousness while still fully clothed.', 'The trial justice found “the most damaging” evidence to be Lauren’s testimony that she later found her sister unconscious without pants or underwear and the defendant wearing only boxer shorts.', '18', 'The defendant appears to quarrel most with Lauren’s testimony that she found her sister partially dressed in the bedroom shortly after the baking soda prank, but did nothing about it until nearly three hours later, after she came back from breakfast. While defendant’s view of Lauren’s testimony may have merit, his disagreement with the trial justice’s “credibility determinations is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for a new trial.” State v. Cipriano, 21 A.3d 408, 430 (R.I. 2011). The trial justice took note of the fact that Lauren was candid about her alcohol use that night, which was brought out on cross-examination. Moreover, he acknowledged that the police investigation “was less than desirable or less than comprehensive” with respect to the witnesses who were interviewed. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s finding that Lauren’s testimony was credible was not a clear error.', 'Finally, the defendant maintains that the trial justice misconstrued the DNA evidence— which was the only evidence of sexual penetration12—as a “match” to defendant, while defendant contends that the DNA testing that was conducted indicated that the DNA could have belonged to other individuals in defendant’s paternal line. This, defendant argues, means that the trial justice overlooked the fact that the seminal fluid could have been from another sexual partner of Alicia.', 'While we admire the zealous advocacy efforts demonstrated in defendant’s brief regarding the issue, we find no need to delve into the specifics of the science behind the DNA testing conducted in the present case. The defendant refers us to a number of out-of-state jurisdictions to demonstrate the inconclusiveness of the Y-STR testing, but this appeal is from a denial of a motion for new trial, not a motion to admit evidence at trial, see United States v. Kootswatewa, 99 Fed. R. Evid. Serv. 1095, 1095-96, 2016 WL 808663, at *1 (D. Ariz. 2016); 12', 'In accordance with § 11-37-2(1), a finding of guilt for the crime of first-degree sexual assault requires sexual penetration with another person.', '19 nor is it a direct challenge to the trial justice’s evidentiary ruling on the admissibility of the evidence. See People v. Stevey, 148 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1, 11 (Cal. Ct. App. 2012).', 'Instead, we are concerned only with whether the trial justice, after assessing the witnesses’ credibility and the weight of the evidence, either agrees with the verdict or finds that “the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom are so nearly balanced that reasonable individuals could differ.” Withers, 172 A.3d at 769 (quoting Moore, 154 A.3d at 481). In his bench decision on the motion for new trial, the trial justice discussed Lupino’s testimony regarding the Y-STR DNA testing, commenting that “[o]ne might say the most damning evidence of all” was her testimony that defendant’s DNA sample matched the swab taken from Alicia at the hospital. The trial justice did not clearly err in accepting the expert testimony that the DNA obtained from the sexual-assault examination belonged to defendant. The fact that he referred to the DNA evidence as a “match” rather than “consistent” with Marizan’s DNA might be imprecise, but such a paraphrasing of witness testimony does not rise to the level of “overlooking or misconceiving evidence.” State v. Watkins, 92 A.3d 172, 192 (R.I. 2014).', 'After a review of the record and the trial justice’s articulated reasoning in denying the motion for new trial, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not “overlook[] or misconceive[] relevant and material evidence” and that he sufficiently evaluated the credibility of the witnesses at trial.

The papers in the case are remanded to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Robinson, dissenting. Although I acknowledge that this is a reasonably close case, I nevertheless feel obliged to respectfully dissent.', 'First, I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that “the prosecutor’s statement, taken in context, did not violate defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights.” In my view, the prosecutor’s “[a]nd not from him” comment during her closing argument certainly could have been construed by one or more jurors as a comment on the defendant’s Fifth Amendment right not to testify because that comment was of such a character that it could “clearly call[] to the jury’s mind the fact that [defendant] failed to testify.” State v. Andrews, 120 R.I. 771, 775, 390 A.2d 926, 929 (1978) (quoting United States v. Flannery, 451 F.2d 880, 881-82 (1st Cir. 1971)).', 'The very first words of the prosecutor’s closing argument were as follows:', '“Let’s clear up one thing. There’s not a shred of evidence in this', 'case, not a shred before you, to suggest that this was consensual', 'sex. Not from [Alicia]. Certainly not from [Lauren]. And not from', 'him.” (Emphasis added.) It is my considered opinion that this comment about the state of the evidence could have prompted one or more jurors reasonably to conclude that defendant’s decision not to testify should be held against him. It should be recalled that both Alicia and Lauren had testified at length during the trial, whereas defendant did not testify at all. Given this context, the inference that a reasonable juror could draw from the prosecutor’s comment (“[a]nd not from him”) was that defendant had defaulted on some duty to prove his innocence by testifying. Such an', '21 inference (which, I repeat, would have been a reasonable one) would have clashed with defendant’s constitutionally guaranteed right not to testify. Viewed in this perspective, a jury composed of ordinarily intelligent lay persons could reasonably understand the prosecutor’s comment to be “a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.” State v. Fontaine, 113 R.I. 557, 563, 323 A.2d 571, 574 (1974).', 'It is further unsettling to me that only the trial justice, and not the jury, ever heard the prosecutor’s explanation for the above-quoted comment about the evidence. After defense counsel objected to the prosecutor’s comment and the jury exited the courtroom, the prosecutor explained to the trial justice that her remark had not been meant to allude to the fact of defendant’s having chosen not to testify, but rather was just a comment on the shifting nature of the defense’s theory of the case—viz., the evolution from a denial that defendant and Alicia had had any sexual encounter to a later acknowledgment that there had been an encounter but an assertion that it was consensual. The prosecutor further explained to the trial justice that the comment at issue was intended by her to be a reference to what (according to Alicia) defendant had said to Alicia on the morning of August 18, 2012, when she accused him of having sexually assaulted her. In his response to that accusation, defendant (again according to Alicia) never said that there had been consensual sex between them, but rather he simply told Alicia that she was “bugging” and that “[n]othing happened.” The prosecutor represented that her comment was not directed at defendant’s choice not to testify. Notably, however, the jury never heard the explanation of the prosecutor concerning her ambiguous1 but potentially constitutionally improper comment. Rather, after the trial justice heard counsel’s explanation and reserved his 1', 'It should go without saying that the fact that the prosecutor had to rebut one reading of her comment and represent that a different meaning was intended indicates that the comment was ambiguous and necessitated, at the very least, an immediate curative instruction.', '22 decision on defendant’s motion for a mistrial, the jurors re-entered the courtroom, and the prosecutor simply continued her closing argument. No curative instruction was given by the trial justice before that argument resumed.', 'Accordingly, because I believe that the quoted phrases from the prosecutor’s closing argument could rationally be understood by a jury to constitute an impermissible comment on defendant’s decision not to testify, it is my opinion that it was incumbent upon the trial justice to provide an immediate and adequate curative instruction. See State v. Sherman, 113 R.I. 77, 81- 82, 317 A.2d 445, 448 (1974).', 'While I acknowledge that the trial justice made a laudable effort to mitigate the potential prejudice inherent in the prosecutor’s comment when he gave his general instructions, it is my view that, because no curative instruction immediately followed the prosecutor’s comment, the trial justice’s later instruction as to defendant’s right not to testify was insufficient to cure that potential prejudice. It is my understanding that our case law requires that the problematic nature of such comment can be cured only by the issuance of an immediate curative instruction. See id. (“If such error is to be cured, it is essential that a cautionary instruction be given immediately in order that the seed planted by the remark will not be given time to germinate.”).2 2', 'I consider the following lapidary sentences from Chief Judge Aldrich’s opinion in the case of Desmond v.

Thus, while it is difficult to determine from the record precisely how much time elapsed between the making of the comment at issue and the trial justice’s instruction about defendant’s right not to testify, it is clear that a substantial amount of time did elapse for there to be thirty- two transcript pages between the prosecutor’s comment and the relevant jury instruction. This significant time gap leads me to conclude that the relevant portion of the general jury instructions was not sufficiently “immediate” to cure the constitutional violation in this case. See Sherman, 113 R.I. at 81-82, 317 A.2d at 448. The prosecutor’s comment could very well have been understood by the jurors as a reference to defendant’s decision not to testify, and I believe that the trial justice, by waiting until after the prosecutor finished her closing argument to give an instruction, may very well have allowed a constitutionally erroneous seed about defendant’s decision not to testify to germinate in the minds of one or more jurors. The admonitory language in Sherman bears repeating: “If such error is to be cured, it is essential that a cautionary instruction be given immediately in order that the seed planted by the remark will not be given time to germinate.” Sherman, 113 R.I. at 81-82, 317 A.2d at 448 (emphasis added).', 'I do not question the good faith of the prosecutor, and her explanation as to what she intended when making the comment at issue is certainly plausible.

The defendant, Kevin Gaugler (Kevin), appeals from a Providence County Family Court judgment granting the request of the plaintiff, Angela Luis (Angela), for a divorce.1 Angela alleged that she and Kevin, although not formally wed, were married at common law based on their intentions and conduct over the course of their twenty- three-year relationship. This matter came before the Supreme Court on April 4, 2018, sitting at Lincoln High School, for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons set forth, we vacate the judgment of the Family Court and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion. 1', 'Throughout this opinion, we refer to the parties and the witnesses by their first names in the interest of clarity, intending no disrespect in doing so.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This appeal stems from the demise of Angela and Kevin’s relationship, which culminated on July 9, 2013 when Angela filed for divorce. Having never had a wedding ceremony or obtained a marriage certificate, Angela and Kevin were never formally married. Angela claims, however, that their marriage had been one at common law.', 'Angela and Kevin lived together from May 1990 until June 2013, along with Angela’s now-adult son, Zach. Although Zach is not Kevin’s biological son, Kevin raised Zach from infancy as though he were his own son. Still, Kevin and Angela’s relationship imploded in May 2013, when Angela saw Kevin kiss another woman. On the heels of this indiscretion, Angela ordered Kevin to vacate their shared abode. Angela filed a complaint for divorce in July. In that complaint, she asserted that she and Kevin had been married at common law since September 6, 1995, pinpointing that date as the one when she and Kevin decided to represent that they were husband and wife because Zach was beginning kindergarten.', 'On August 16, 2013, Kevin filed a motion to dismiss Angela’s complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Family Court Rules of Procedure for Domestic Relations, asserting that he and Angela were never married.2 However, the trial justice reserved her ruling on that motion.3 The trial began on January 29, 2014, and continued until 2', 'He also later filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 37 of the Family Court Rules of Procedure for Domestic Relations. 3', 'The record also reveals that on May 6, 2014, Kevin moved for a “directed verdict” on all issues related to common-law marriage.

Nevertheless, the motion was denied.', '-2- March 31, 2015.4 In all, the trial spanned eleven days, during which numerous witnesses testified, including both Kevin and Angela.5 On March 22, 2016, the trial justice issued a decision wherein she denied Kevin’s motion to dismiss, granted Angela’s request for a divorce, and divided the relevant property largely equally between the parties.6 In the decision, the trial justice made 142 findings of fact, the majority of which supported her determination that there was clear and convincing evidence that Angela and Kevin were married at common law.', 'A', 'Angela’s Testimony', 'At trial, Angela testified on her own behalf. She recalled that, beginning in May 1990, she and Kevin lived together as boyfriend and girlfriend until Kevin proposed to her in December 1991. In September 1995, Zach began kindergarten, and, according to Angela, she and Kevin agreed to “commit[] as husband and wife out in public * * *.” Angela explained that Zach has since referred to Kevin as “Dad.” She testified that she also began introducing Kevin as her husband at Zach’s school in September 1995, including filling out forms listing Kevin as Zach’s father and as her husband. 4', 'The fragmented nature of the trial was due in part to the parties’ unsuccessful attempt at mediation, as well as Angela’s attorney’s sudden withdrawal from the case. 5', 'The trial justice indicated that the trial would be bifurcated: the first part would center on whether a common-law marriage existed, and, if necessary, the second part would be a divorce proceeding. 6', 'Specifically, the trial justice ordered the parties to divide equally the proceeds from the sale of the “marital domicile” on Hobson Avenue; the personal household property in that home; “any and all retirement account(s)”; the cost of drafting a Qualified Domestic Relations Order; the value of Kevin’s life insurance policy, which listed Angela as the primary beneficiary; and any property in their safe-deposit box. The trial justice also adjudged that each party would be awarded all rights, title, and interest in their respective vehicles and any individually-held checking or savings accounts, and held each solely responsible for their own uninsured or underinsured medical costs, individually-incurred debt, and attorneys’ fees. Moreover, both parties were denied alimony, and Kevin was ordered to maintain Angela on his current health insurance.', '-3-', 'Angela continued that, in September 1998, she and Kevin decided to purchase their shared home, but she chose not to be on the deed or the mortgage to preserve her credit rating. Kevin paid the mortgage, taxes, insurance, and utilities, while she paid for the groceries and Zach’s expenses. She also testified that, prior to September 1995, Kevin began wearing a wedding ring on his left hand. She said that Kevin’s family referred to her as “sister-in-law” or “daughter-in-law,” Kevin’s parents sent her a birthday card calling her their “favorite daughter- in-law,” and Kevin introduced her as his wife at youth football. Angela also said that, in June 1998, Kevin began providing health insurance for Angela and Zach, dubbing Angela his “common law spouse.” Moreover, in 2001, Kevin named her as the sole beneficiary and heir in his will and, in 2003, the sole beneficiary on his life insurance plan. However, Kevin’s will did not name her as his wife. Kevin also designated Angela as the primary beneficiary of his 401(k) plan in December 2000 and again in February 2001, listing her as his “fiancée” each time.', 'Angela explained that, from 1990 until 2013, with the exception of 2008 and 2009, Kevin helped her prepare and file her tax returns. She stated that she always filed her taxes as “single” or “head of household,” and that she and Kevin never filed joint tax returns. Kevin also never claimed Zach on his taxes. Angela further testified that, in 2008, she filled out a FAFSA7 form seeking financial aid for Zach’s college tuition, listing herself as “single”; she stated that she characterized herself as such because she and Kevin agreed that it would maximize Zach’s potential financial aid.', 'Angela continued that she and Kevin had a joint bank account from 1995 until 1998, to which Kevin made contributions, but that since 1998 they had not shared a bank account.

In 2000, he listed Angela as the sole beneficiary of his 401(k) plan, characterizing her as his fiancée.

There, the plaintiff argued that the couple’s jointly- filed tax returns, on which they identified themselves as “married,” and a property deed referring to them as “husband and wife as tenants by the entirety” sufficiently satisfied the clear and convincing evidence benchmark. Id. at 1291, 1292. Yet, we upheld the trial justice’s decision, because he believed the defendant’s testimony that the couple filed their tax returns as “married” in the interest of economy alone. Id. at 1292. The trial justice in Zharkova also relied on the fact that the parties “neither held joint bank accounts nor discussed with each other the purchase of', '- 12 - large items[.]” Id.

The trial justice recognized that Kevin did not name Angela as his wife in his will; and, even though he designated her as the primary beneficiary on his 401(k) plan, he labeled her as his “fiancée.” Further, she found that Angela repeatedly declared herself to be “single” or “head of household” under penalty of perjury, on her tax return forms, and that Angela and Kevin never filed joint tax returns. See id. (holding that the trial justice correctly concluded that the parties’ declaring themselves as single on legal documents and forms, including tax returns, “strongly weighed against any serious intent to be husband and wife”). Moreover, the trial justice also concluded that, in addition to labeling herself as “single” on her tax return forms, Angela also characterized herself as such on Zach’s FAFSA paperwork. See DeMelo v. Zompa, 844 A.2d 174, 178 (R.I. 2004) (holding that there was a lack of clear and convincing evidence where “[t]here were many documents introduced in evidence, such as tax returns, a mortgage application, and insurance', '- 13 - applications in which she listed herself as single[,]” “[the] defendant was not designated as a beneficiary on her pension or 401(k)[,]” and “their condominium was owned as tenants in common, not as tenants by the entirety, or even joint tenants[,]” nor did the parties jointly hold bank accounts).

It is our opinion that the trial justice in the present case, in spite of the parties’ declarations, miscalculated that the evidence was clear and convincing.', 'Our review of the trial justice’s findings reveals that the parties in this case labeled themselves as married when it benefited them, such as on Kevin’s health insurance paperwork, and refrained from doing so when it did not, such as on Zach’s FAFSA paperwork. Further, the trial justice determined that Kevin and Angela had not shared a joint bank account since 1998 and did not pool their finances to make large purchases together, as evidenced by Kevin’s purchasing the home that they lived in together with only his money and only in his name. See Zharkova, 45 A.3d at 1292. The evidence of a common-law marriage can only be described as inconsistent in this case, and thus is insufficient to meet the heightened standard of proof. See Smith, 966 A.2d at 115.', 'The trial justice’s findings do not reflect that Angela and Kevin had a serious, mutual intent to be husband and wife. Kevin points out that the trial justice did not comment on', '- 14 - Angela’s testimony referring to Zach’s first day of school when she told his teachers that Kevin was his father and that she and Kevin were married.

That’s what any child wants.” The fact that the trial justice overlooked this testimony illuminates her error in holding that Kevin and Angela had a mutual and present intent to be married at common law in that Kevin was unaware that Angela planned to represent herself as such. 10 See Smith, 966 A.2d at 114 (“The consent which is the foundation and essence of the contract must be mutual and given at the same time * * *.”) (quoting Odd Fellows’ Beneficial Association of Rhode Island v.

On any given form or document their choice of a marital or non-marital designation hinged solely upon what they agreed would be most financially advantageous.” Basing her decision, at least in part, on the principle that common-law marriage is rooted in equity, the trial justice determined that to “find that [Kevin] and Angela were not married by common law would not only defy the economic reasons which underlie the basic foundation of forming a common law marriage, but more importantly it would fly in the face of equity.” 10', 'In fact, Kevin has maintained that he only learned as a result of these proceedings that Angela considered them married at common law as of that September 1995 date.', '- 15 -', 'An examination of the record indicates that the trial justice was correct in her observation that Angela and Kevin “cherry picked” how they would portray their relationship based on how it would immediately benefit them.

25,"Richard Goodrow : v. : Bank of America, N.A., Successor by : Merger to BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, f/k/a Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP, et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The plaintiff, Richard Goodrow (Goodrow), appeals from a Newport County Superior Court order granting the motions to dismiss of the defendants, Bank of America, N.A. (BOA), and EverBank Mortgage1 (EverBank) (collectively defendants). This matter came before the Supreme Court on April 5, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. For the reasons outlined below, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This appeal centers on a purported procedural flaw, and our rendition of the facts focuses accordingly. On March 5, 2003, Goodrow executed a mortgage on his Newport property in 1', 'The order dismissing plaintiff’s action recognizes that EverBank is incorrectly identified as EverHome Mortgage in the complaint. Accordingly, we will refer to this defendant by its proper name, EverBank.', '-1- favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS), as nominee for the lender, E*Trade Mortgage Corporation (E*Trade), and the lender’s successors and assigns; the mortgage was later assigned to BOA. Goodrow averred that, from 2003 until 2011, he “made monthly payments faithfully via automatic bank payments” in the amount of $1,890.47.', 'However, in November 2010, BOA “adjusted [his] monthly mortgage payment from $1,890.47 to $1,970.49” without notifying him. Goodrow explained that BOA “wrongfully sent a notice of default and intent to accelerate” to him in January 2011. Goodrow responded by sending, by certified mail, correspondence disputing that his account was in arrears and “requesting reconciliation with [BOA’s] accounting.”', 'Goodrow stated that BOA never responded to his request for account information. According to Goodrow, since January 2011, he had made numerous attempts to contact BOA to “rectify the discrepancy” between his records and BOA’s records, all to no avail.', 'Goodrow further alleged that he continued to make timely mortgage payments, until June 2011, at which time “[BOA] refused to accept” Goodrow’s payment and informed him that his mortgage was in foreclosure.', 'Further, Goodrow claimed that in May 2011, BOA “began publishing false negative credit information” about him and that BOA “continues to publish false negative information to Goodrow’s detriment.”', 'In August 2013, Goodrow filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, naming as defendants EverBank, MERS, E*Trade, and BOA. The complaint alleged, inter alia, that (1) the assignment of the mortgage from MERS to BOA was void; (2) BOA, MERS, and EverBank “had no standing to foreclose” on his property; (3) “[t]he mortgage is void due to fraud”; (4) BOA never notified him that his monthly payment amount had increased; (5) BOA “maliciously reported negative credit reports” about him; and (6) the', '-2- failure to hold both the promissory note and the mortgage prohibited MERS from exercising the statutory power of sale. In three separate counts, Goodrow requested the following relief: (1) that the court issue a declaratory judgment stating that he owns the property outright; (2) that the court enter an order quieting title to the property and specifying that he owns a fee simple interest in it; and (3) that the court award him $10 million in punitive damages because of defendants’ “criminal” actions.', 'The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On April 23, 2015, the federal court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss based on the following determinations: (1) Goodrow lacked standing to challenge the assignment of the mortgage; (2) MERS had the power to foreclose as mortgagee; and (3) BOA, as the assignee of the mortgage, also had the power to foreclose as mortgagee. With respect to Goodrow’s claims about BOA’s alleged breach of its contractual duties of good faith and fair dealing, the federal court held that Goodrow “did not make any of these legal claims in his [c]omplaint” and, as such, found that Goodrow was barred from “assert[ing] them in the face of [d]efendants’ motions [to dismiss].”', 'In January 2016, Goodrow filed a three-count complaint in Newport County Superior Court. That complaint sought monetary damages for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, as well as a preliminary injunction to stop a foreclosure. Thereafter, EverBank removed the case to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, but the case was ultimately remanded to Newport County Superior Court due to a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction in the federal district court.', 'In May 2016, EverBank and BOA each filed motions to dismiss Goodrow’s complaint on res judicata grounds. At an October 5, 2016 hearing on those motions, defendants first argued that the breach-of-contract claim “was dealt with or should have been dealt with in a federal', '-3- court action which was dismissed * * * in April 2015.” The defendants asserted that, in his decision, the federal district court judge did not exclude the breach-of-contract issues, but rather explained that he was “not going to address those issues that are being brought for the first time by the plaintiff in response to our motion to dismiss.” Second, defendants contended that, “in the four corners of the complaint [Goodrow] has failed to demonstrate that EverBank breached the terms of the mortgage agreement, and as a consequence the complaint should be dismissed.”', 'The Superior Court hearing justice rendered a bench decision wherein he found that res judicata warranted the granting of defendants’ motions to dismiss.', 'That decision was memorialized in an October 24, 2016 order granting the motions and dismissing Goodrow’s complaint, with prejudice. On November 4, 2016, Goodrow timely appealed that order to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“In reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss[,] * * * this Court applies the same standard as the hearing justice.” Warfel v.

Poulin, 127 A.3d 908, 911 (R.I. 2015)). “Such a motion ‘is properly granted when it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief from the defendant under any set of facts that could be proven in support of the plaintiff’s claim.’” Id.

(quoting Audette, 127 A.3d at 911).', '-4-', 'III', 'Analysis', 'Goodrow raises three arguments on appeal. First, he contends that res judicata is not applicable because the federal court action and the instant action “did not stem from the same transaction or series of transactions.” Goodrow argues that the federal court dismissal was not a final judgment for res judicata purposes. Moreover, he submits that the federal court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate his claims once it determined that he did not have standing.', 'Second, Goodrow argues that his breach-of-contract claims were not appropriate for dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure because he “allege[d] numerous instances of [d]efendants’ failure to perform the obligations of servicing his mortgage.”', 'Finally, Goodrow asserts that the hearing justice erred by effectively converting defendants’ motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment by relying on documents outside of the complaint.', 'A', 'Conversion to a Motion for Summary Judgment', 'Because it is determinative of the standard of review that applies in this case, we first address Goodrow’s argument that the hearing justice erred by converting the motions to dismiss into motions for summary judgment by relying on the federal court’s dismissal order.', '“Ordinarily, when ruling on a motion to dismiss brought under Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 12(c), ‘a court may not consider any documents that are outside of the complaint, or not expressly incorporated therein, unless the motion is converted into one for summary judgment.’”', '-5- Chase v.

(quoting Alternative Energy, Inc., 267 F.3d at 33).', 'While we have never defined “official public record” for purposes of this exception, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, recognizing that the term “public records” is overly broad, has equated that term with documents susceptible to judicial notice. Freeman v. Town of Hudson, 714 F.3d 29, 36-37 (1st Cir. 2013). In Rhode Island, “a court may take judicial notice of court records” and, while “[n]ot every document that may have been placed in a court file * * * may properly be regarded as part of the record[,]” we have demarcated examples of those that would be considered as such.

Moitie, 452 U.S. 394, 398 (1981) (emphasis added).', 'Goodrow’s 2016 complaint references facts stemming from the same transaction as his 2013 complaint—that is, as the hearing justice aptly summarized those facts, “the execution and service of plaintiff’s mortgage”—and what was not alleged in the 2013 complaint certainly could have been alleged.2 See Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144, 152 (R.I. 2008) (“[T]he doctrine of res judicata extinguishes a party’s claims even if that party is ‘prepared in a second action to present evidence or grounds or theories of the case not presented * * * in the first action, or to seek remedies or forms of relief not demanded in that action.’”) (quoting ElGabri, 681 A.2d at 276). 2', 'While Goodrow argues that “[t]he order granting dismissal of the 2013 [c]ase by the federal court is ambiguous regarding whether the [b]reach of [c]ontract claims could have and should have been brought in that action[,]” we disagree and discern no such ambiguity.', '-8-', 'Goodrow also argues that he did not have the opportunity to litigate his breach-of- contract claims because the federal court “explicitly declined to consider” them. The federal district court judge determined that, as to Goodrow’s claims of breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, “[b]ecause [Goodrow] did not make any of these legal claims in his [c]omplaint, * * * he cannot now assert them in the face of [d]efendants’ motions.” The judge further elaborated that “[t]he [c]ourt rules on the [m]otion to [d]ismiss based on the content of the [c]omplaint, not on new assertions made for the first time in response to the motion.” This only reinforces our opinion that, while Goodrow did not raise these claims in the first action, he should have, and he should have done so in accordance with the procedural guidelines provided by the relevant rules.3', 'Therefore, we hold that the trial justice correctly determined that an identity of issues existed.4', '2', 'Final Judgment on the Merits', '“Finally, the application of res judicata requires that there be ‘finality of judgment in the earlier action.’” Reynolds v.

Still, Goodrow alludes to the following notion to support his position that the federal court dismissal was not an adjudication on the merits:', '“If the first suit was dismissed for defect of pleadings, or parties, or', 'a misconception of the form of proceeding, or the want of', 'jurisdiction, or was disposed of on any ground which did not go to', 'the merits of the action, the judgment rendered will prove no bar to', 'another suit.” Costello v.

The lack of standing was but one of many reasons that the federal district court judge granted defendants’ motions to dismiss. The judge, after determining that Goodrow lacked standing to pursue his claims, also ruled that Goodrow’s allegations “fail in the face of” the relevant “exemplar cases” from that court, the First Circuit Court of Appeals, and this Court.', 'Goodrow is correct that he was “prohibited from undertaking the procedures usually employed in litigating a case,” such as “conducting discovery, preparing pre-trial documents, participating in trial, objecting to and offering evidence and exhibits, [and] conducting examinations and cross examinations of witnesses.”', 'However, because “[d]ismissal with prejudice * * * constitutes a full adjudication of the merits as if the order had been entered subsequent to trial[,]” we hold that this element is also satisfied.5 School Committee of Town of 5', 'Goodrow also claims that “[t]he [federal] dismissal order was silent as to whether dismissal was granted with or without prejudice.” However, “Rule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governs the effect of involuntary dismissals” and that rule notes that “[u]nless the dismissal order states otherwise, a dismissal under this subdivision (b) and any dismissal not under this rule—except one for lack of jurisdiction, improper venue, or failure to join a party under Rule 19—operates as an adjudication on the merits.” Huntley v.

The pro se plaintiff, Vincent R. Coccoli, Sr. (plaintiff or Coccoli),1 appeals from the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants (the town or defendants).2 On appeal, the plaintiff argues that issues of material fact remain which preclude summary judgment and that he is entitled to a trial on the merits of his claims. After hearing the arguments of the parties, examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, and reviewing the record, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that 1', 'Despite the complex nature of this litigation, the plaintiff chose to proceed pro se, against the better recommendation of the trial justice:', '“This [c]ourt has on more occasions than I can remember, what I', 'will call countless occasions, admonished Mr. Coccoli that while', 'he has a right to represent himself that the matters at bar in this', 'case are receivership matters, were extremely sophisticated; and as', 'a result, he could and should obtain qualified counsel.” 2', 'The plaintiff named the Town of Scituate Town Council and the following individual defendants in his complaint: (1) Charles Collins, Jr.; (2) John F.

Provonsil.', '-1- this case should be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate in part and affirm in part the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The genesis of this case is plaintiff’s persistent yet failed attempts to develop the Hope Mill Property located in Scituate, Rhode Island (the property). The plaintiff was a member of Hope Mill Village Associates, LLC (HMVA). In December 2006, the Scituate Zoning Board of Review granted HMVA conditional approval for dimensional relief and special-use permits to allow for the redevelopment of the property. One of the conditions required HMVA to obtain approval from the Scituate Town Council, the West Warwick Sewer Authority, and the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) for a municipal sewer connection from the property to the West Warwick Regional Sewer System. At a regular meeting of the town council held on April 12, 2007, the town council voted to approve the sewer connection, pending receipt of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) from HMVA. The minutes of that meeting reflect the vote as follows:', '“After lengthy discussion between the Council, Mr. Robinson and', 'Mr. Geremia, and members of the audience * * * motion was made', 'by Councilman Salisbury, seconded by Councilman Collins, and', 'voted by consent agreement to grant approval of the 40,000 gallon', 'capacity per day, contingent upon receiving a document in writing', 'from Hope Mill Village Associates within 10 days, outlining the', 'specifics previously discussed:', '“Extend the sewer connections to Hope Sanitary Associates, Hope', 'Elementary School, Hope Jackson Fire Dept., the Police Station,', 'and to upfront the cost of the Town’s portion of the interceptor.', '“Any representation made by the Developer regarding the Town of', 'Scituate, should be accurate and reflect what was discussed at this', 'meeting.', '“Motion made by Councilman Salisbury, seconded by Councilman', 'Collins and voted by consent agreement to confer with Coventry', '-2-', 'and West Warwick to ascertain what their intentions are regarding', 'this upgrade, and to pursue an agreement that would share the', 'costs. The contact should be done by David Provonsil and Legal', 'Counsel.” In July 2007, an MOU was executed between plaintiff and the town. The MOU was signed by the town council president, contained an official town seal, and was recorded in the land evidence records. Under the MOU, plaintiff agreed to “design, procure approvals for, and cause to construct a new sewer line * * *.”', 'By 2010, the property became part of a bankruptcy proceeding; and, in January 2010, the bankruptcy trustee sold the property to New England Development R.I., LLC, which filed receivership proceedings in August 2010. The plaintiff and two other individuals executed a purchase and sale agreement with the receiver with respect to the property, but they defaulted and the receiver terminated the agreement.', 'Subsequently, plaintiff individually executed a purchase and sale agreement for the property, but he defaulted again and the agreement was terminated. In 2014, plaintiff individually executed a third purchase and sale agreement for the property; that agreement was also terminated. In January 2016, the Superior Court approved the receiver’s petition to sell the property to BMP, LLC.', 'On August 13, 2015, plaintiff filed a pro se complaint against defendants, alleging promissory estoppel and breach of oral contract, breach of confidentiality pertaining to proprietary information, tortious interference with a contract, and fraudulent misrepresentation. The defendants moved for summary judgment on April 20, 2016, arguing that (1) defendants did not breach the MOU because the town never approved the MOU and, further, that there was no evidence that plaintiff suffered financial harm; (2) plaintiff’s claim under § 552a(b) of the Privacy Act of 1974 had no merit because federal law was not applicable to defendants and there was no evidence that defendants disclosed plaintiff’s personal information; (3) there was no', '-3- evidence that the town council had intentionally interfered with the purchase and sale agreement plaintiff had executed; and (4) plaintiff’s fraudulent misrepresentation claim was improper because it was based on the conduct of a nonmunicipal fire chief, who was not a town employee. The plaintiff objected to defendants’ motion, and for the first time raised the argument that defendants violated the Rhode Island Uniform Trade Secrets Act,3 G.L. 1956 chapter 41 of title 6. The defendants’ motion for summary judgment was heard on July 11, 2016. At the outset, the trial justice noted what he characterized as plaintiff’s “checkered” history:', '“All of the claims evolve out of the plaintiff’s efforts over many', 'years to develop, redevelop, the so-called Hope Mill. The history,', 'recent history of the Hope Mill, insofar as judicial proceedings are', 'concerned, is checkered. It has been the subject of receivership', 'proceedings,', 'bankruptcy proceedings,', 'and receivership', 'proceedings again.', '“A somewhat common factor running through it has been the pro', 'se plaintiff here. In other circumstances, this [c]ourt has suggested', 'or held that Mr. Coccoli’s life is intertwined, to a very great extent,', 'with his desire and his efforts to rehab the mill for multifamily', 'residential purposes primarily, a somewhat monumental task at this', 'point.” The trial justice granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on all four counts of plaintiff’s complaint.', 'He first addressed the MOU and found that it was not a binding agreement:', '“The [c]ourt cannot find that that agreement is binding on the', 'defendants. It was not specifically approved by the council, it 3', 'The trial justice correctly stated that plaintiff erroneously raised the Rhode Island Uniform Trade Secrets Act through his objection to defendants’ motion for summary judgment and that the proper avenue for plaintiff to assert a new claim would have been through amending his complaint:', '“In an effort to attempt to rehabilitate his position, Mr. Coccoli', 'seeks to invoke certain state statutes, but he did that not through', 'the means of seeking to amend his complaint, he just makes a bald', 'statement in his memorandum and that does not suffice.”', '-4-', 'contained no terms; and as a matter of fact, to this day things', 'contemplated there have not occurred.” The trial justice next addressed plaintiff’s breach of confidentiality claim:', '“Mr. Coccoli seeks to invoke certain state statutes, but he did that', 'not through the means of seeking to amend his complaint, he just', 'makes a bald statement in his memorandum and that does not', 'suffice. The complaint speaks to specific legislation, specific', 'federal laws that do not touch the Town of Scituate.” With respect to plaintiff’s contractual interference claim, the trial justice stated:', '“Although the complaint was that the council was rude to Mr.', 'Coccoli and his partner because some members of the council left', 'the meeting apparently at a time when Mr. Coccoli or his partner', 'were late. But whether late or not, whether they left the meeting or', 'not, that’s not grounds for interference with a contractual relation', 'and the failure to enter into a tax stabilization agreement. The', 'town has no obligation to enter into such agreements. That’s a', 'matter of legislative determination.” Finally, the trial justice addressed plaintiff’s fraudulent misrepresentation claim, stating:', '“The [c]ourt searched the record and fails to find who * * * made', 'representation. Discovery seemed to indicate that the claims', 'predicated on the fact that a non-municipal in the sense of non', 'Scituate fire chief signed a document for the department of', 'environmental management which had printed on the face of it that', 'it was not binding upon the Town and did not constitute notice to', 'the Town. The fire chief was a fire district chief, not a town', 'official.” On July 20, 2016, plaintiff moved to vacate the entry of summary judgment, arguing that he never received a copy of defendants’ June 13, 2016 reply memorandum prior to the summary- judgment hearing. A hearing on plaintiff’s motion was held on July 22, 2016, and the trial justice denied the motion. Final judgment entered for defendants on that same date. The plaintiff timely appealed.', 'On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred by granting summary judgment because there exist numerous issues of material fact. He also contends that the trial justice', '-5- granted summary judgment in error in light of the fact that plaintiff did not receive defendants’ reply memorandum until the summary-judgment hearing. Finally, plaintiff reasserts that he and the town have an enforceable contract.', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Sullo v. Greenberg, 68 A.3d 404, 406 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Sacco v. Cranston School Department, 53 A.3d 147, 149-50 (R.I. 2012)). Further, “[s]ummary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the court determines that there are no issues of material fact in dispute, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Key v.

Palumbo, 163 A.3d 526, 541 (R.I. 2017). It is well settled that “the determination of whether a contract exists is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo.” Nonnenmacher v. City of Warwick, 722 A.2d 1199, 1202 (R.I. 1999). “The long-recognized essential elements of a contract are ‘competent parties, subject matter, a legal consideration,', '-6- mutuality of agreement, and mutuality of obligation.’” Rhode Island Five v. Medical Associates of Bristol County, Inc., 668 A.2d 1250, 1253 (R.I. 1996) (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 322 (6th ed. 1990)).', 'The trial justice rendered a bench decision in which he found that the MOU was not enforceable:', '“[T]he minutes of that meeting, which appears as an exhibit to Mr.', 'Coccoli’s papers, make it abundantly clear to the [c]ourt that there', 'was no final agreement with respect to that. And in fact, the so-', 'called memorandum of understanding upon which he bases much', 'of his argument against the grant of summary judgment with', 'respect to Count I had not been prepared, had not been exhibited to', 'the council, and the council consistent with the affidavit from the', 'town clerk did not pass approval of the memorandum of', 'understanding.

It was not specifically approved by the council, it', 'contained no terms; and as a matter of fact, to this day things', 'contemplated there have not occurred.” The defendants argued, and the trial justice agreed, that because there was not a second vote of the council to reaffirm the MOU, the contract is void. We disagree. It is clear that the council voted to approve the sewer connection contingent upon receipt of an MOU from HMVA, and that contingency was met. As set out above, the minutes of the April 12, 2007 town council meeting reflect this vote:', '“[M]otion was made by Councilman Salisbury, seconded by', 'Councilman Collins, and voted by consent agreement to grant', 'approval of the 40,000 gallon capacity per day, contingent upon', 'receiving a document in writing from Hope Mill Village', 'Associates within 10 days, outlining the specifics previously', 'discussed:', '-7-', '“Extend the sewer connections to Hope Sanitary Associates, Hope', 'Elementary School, Hope Jackson Fire Dept., the Police Station,', 'and to upfront the cost of the Town’s portion of the interceptor.', '“Any representations made by the Developer regarding the Town', 'of Scituate, should be accurate and reflect what was discussed at', 'this meeting.', '“Motion made by Councilman Salisbury, seconded by Councilman', 'Collins and voted by consent agreement to confer with Coventry', 'and West Warwick to ascertain what their intentions are regarding', 'this upgrade, and to pursue an agreement that would share the', 'costs. The contact should be done by David Provonsil and Legal', 'Counsel.” (Emphasis added.) Thereafter, the town and legal counsel for HMVA prepared a detailed MOU that was drafted on the letterhead of the town’s solicitor, signed by town council president Robert Budway and plaintiff, notarized, adorned with the official town seal, and recorded in the land evidence records.', 'After the MOU was executed, plaintiff spent approximately $2 million to begin infrastructure and engineering on the project, in furtherance of the MOU. The agreement as set forth in the vote of the council and the MOU is binding upon the town.', 'The facts in the record before us establish that the council voted to approve by consent agreement the sewer connection, contingent upon receiving an MOU—which was in fact later executed and recorded in the land evidence records—and that there was subsequent part performance under the MOU. See Richard v. Richard, 900 A.2d 1170, 1175 (R.I. 2006) (holding that “any partial performance must unequivocally indicate the existence of the purported oral agreement”). We are of the opinion that the facts presented establish that a contract was formed—which is a question of law. In the case at bar, there is no contention that either party was not competent to enter into an agreement. See Rhode Island Five, 668 A.2d at 1253. The MOU addressed the subject matter of the contract in depth, and evinced a legal consideration and mutuality of obligation between the parties: in exchange for authorizing the use of 40,000', '-8- gallons per day of the town’s reserve sewer capacity, plaintiff was obligated to design, procure approvals for, and cause to be constructed a new sewer line. See id. Finally, by signing the MOU and notarizing the document, the parties mutually agreed on the terms.', 'See id. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on Count I of plaintiff’s complaint.', 'We now briefly address plaintiff’s second claim, that defendants violated the Privacy Act of 1974 by “releas[ing] confidential proprietary information, including appraisals, architectural, engineering and survey work without permission.” The trial justice correctly identified this claim as misplaced:', '“The second cause of action involves the so-called privacy act.', 'That act is a federal statute. And much case law has been cited by', 'defendants making it abundantly clear that it applies to federal', 'agencies and not to state agencies or individuals.” It is well settled that “the Privacy Act is specifically limited to actions against agencies of the United States government.” Burch v. Pioneer Credit Recovery, Inc., 551 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir. 2008). Moreover, “[t]he civil remedy provisions of the [Privacy Act] do not apply against private individuals, * * * state agencies, * * * private entities, * * * or state and local officials[.]” Unt v. Aerospace Corp., 765 F.2d 1440, 1447 (9th Cir. 1985). “[T]he [Privacy] Act [of 1974] imposes limitations only on agencies of the federal government.” Williams v. New York City Department of Education ex rel. City School District, No. 12 Civ. 8518, 2013 WL 5226564, at *15 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 17, 2013). In the case at bar, we are dealing with a local town council and town officials, not the federal government. Accordingly, the trial justice properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on Count II of plaintiff’s complaint.', 'In Count III of plaintiff’s complaint, Coccoli alleged that defendants engaged in tortious interference with a contractual relationship—specifically, his purchase and sale agreement with', '-9- the receiver.', 'The plaintiff avers before this Court that “but for the town’s interference, [p]laintiff’s expectations regarding his proposed development would have been realized.” This Court has held that:', '“In order to establish a claim for tortious interference with a', 'contractual relationship, plaintiffs must establish the following four', 'elements: (1) [T]he existence of a contract; (2) the alleged', 'wrongdoer’s knowledge of the contract; (3) his [or her] intentional', 'interference; and (4) damages resulting therefrom.” Fogarty, 163', 'A.3d at 538 (quoting Belliveau Building Corp. v. O’Coin, 763', 'A.2d 622, 627 (R.I. 2000)). The plaintiff alleged in his complaint that he had secured funding for the development of the property that had since gone into receivership and had submitted a deposit to the receiver in June 2014. The crux of plaintiff’s claim is that the town council took actions that made the property “unappealing to any potential investor or buyer” and held closed-session meetings with plaintiff and investors that were “frustrating and disappointing” and allegedly resulted in the loss of funds for the project. Finally, plaintiff contends before this Court that the town solicitor “demonstrated an obvious intent to interfere with plaintiff[’s] legitimate expectancy of developing the * * * property.” The plaintiff’s allegations are based in part on his assertions that the town council kept him waiting at a meeting, members of the council left the meeting when plaintiff and his business partner were late, and one town council member made comments about the property that plaintiff interpreted as rude. The plaintiff also alleged that the town council interfered with his purchase and sale agreement by failing to enter into a tax stabilization agreement.', 'Our careful review of the record reveals that plaintiff did not submit a copy of the purchase and sale agreement to defendants. There is nothing in the record to suggest that defendants were even aware of the alleged contract plaintiff executed with the receiver to purchase the property. See Fogarty, 163 A.3d at 538. There is also an absence of any evidence', '- 10 - suggesting that defendants intended to interfere with the contract, or that plaintiff suffered damages as a result of defendants’ interference. See id. Moreover, the trial justice correctly found that the town was not obligated to enter into a tax stabilization agreement with plaintiff because that is a matter of legislative discretion. Based on the evidence presented, we cannot conclude that defendants intentionally interfered with plaintiff’s alleged contract to purchase the property from the receiver.', 'We conclude that the trial justice properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendants on plaintiff’s claim for tortious interference with a contractual relationship.', 'Finally, plaintiff’s claim in Count IV of his complaint sounds in fraudulent misrepresentation. To establish a claim for fraudulent misrepresentation, a plaintiff must prove “not only that the defendant had an intention to deceive, but the complainant also must present sufficient proof that the party detrimentally relied upon the fraudulent representation.” Asermely v. Allstate Insurance Co., 728 A.2d 461, 464 (R.I. 1999). The plaintiff alleges that he entered into an agreement with the town on November 1, 2011, for the environmental cleanup of an underground storage tank leak, and that this cleanup cost plaintiff approximately $141,000. The plaintiff contends that a closure application for the cleanup was submitted to DEM’s Division of Waste Management and contained the signature of the receiver and Donald Campbell, the Hope Jackson fire chief. Again, at the summary-judgment hearing, the trial justice stated:', '“The [c]ourt searched the record and fails to find who supposedly', 'made a representation other than—well, the [c]ourt failed to find', 'who made a representation. Discovery seemed to indicate that the', 'claims predicated on the fact that a non-municipal in the sense of', 'non Scituate fire chief signed a document for the department of', 'environmental management which had printed on the face of it that', 'it was not binding upon the Town and did not constitute notice to', 'the Town. The fire chief was a fire district chief, not a town', 'official.”', '- 11 -', 'Notwithstanding the fact that the Hope Jackson fire chief is the chief of a nonmunicipal, volunteer fire department, and not a town official, the plaintiff has failed to present a scintilla of evidence of any representation from the town, or of the plaintiff’s detrimental reliance upon such a representation.', 'Moreover, the following disclaimer is contained in the DEM closure application:', '“This signature, however, does not serve as notice to the city/town,', 'does not guarantee city/town approval, and does not relieve you of', 'your obligations to other applicable city/town officials. Any', 'violation, deficiency or requirement which may have been', 'overlooked is also subject to correction under the provision of any', 'applicable code.” (Emphasis added.) The record before us simply is devoid of any representations from the town that would induce the plaintiff to engage in environmental cleanup on the property. The only evidence the plaintiff proffered was a signature of a nonmunicipal fire chief, who is not a town official. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice properly granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Count IV of the plaintiff’s complaint.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate that portion of the judgment of the Superior Court granting summary judgment on Count I of the plaintiff’s complaint. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court dismissing Counts II, III, and IV of the plaintiff’s complaint.

The petitioner, Leonard Jefferson, appeals1 from the June 2, 2015 denial of his application for postconviction relief in Providence County Superior Court. He contends before this Court that the hearing justice erred in denying his application for postconviction relief because, in petitioner’s view, the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution was violated when his parole was revoked and he was denied the possibility of parole in the future pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 13-8-14(b).

In setting forth said facts, we rely primarily on Mr. Jefferson’s application for postconviction relief and the attachments thereto.', 'On June 2, 1976, after Mr. Jefferson’s 1974 murder conviction, the General Assembly amended the parole statutes to include the following language, which remains in the current version of the statute:', '“[I]n the case of a prisoner sentenced to imprisonment for life who', 'is released on parole and who is subsequently convicted of a crime', 'of violence as defined in section 11-47-2,[2] said conviction shall 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-47-2 provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“‘Crime of violence’ means and includes any of the following', 'crimes or an attempt to commit any of them: murder,', 'manslaughter, rape, first or second degree sexual assault, first or', 'second degree child molestation, kidnapping, first and second', 'degree arson, mayhem, robbery, burglary, breaking and entering,', 'any felony violation involving the illegal manufacture, sale, or', 'delivery of a controlled substance, or possession with intent to', 'manufacture, sell, or deliver a controlled substance classified in', 'schedule I or schedule II of § 21-28-2.08, any violation of § 21-28-', '4.01.1 or 21-28-4.01.2 or conspiracy to commit any violation of', 'these statutes, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault or battery', 'involving grave bodily injury, and/or assault with intent to commit', 'any offense punishable as a felony; upon any conviction of an', 'offense punishable as a felony offense under § 12-29-5.”', '-2-', 'constitute an automatic revocation of parole and the prisoner shall', 'not be eligible for parole thereafter.” P.L. 1976 ch. 223 § 2; see', 'also § 13-8-14(b). Subsequently, in January of 1986, Mr. Jefferson was granted parole. He was thereafter arrested in Pennsylvania and, on May 18, 1994, was convicted in that commonwealth of one count of aggravated assault, for which he served a twenty-year prison term.', 'On December 13 and December 29, 1993, after Mr. Jefferson’s Pennsylvania arrest, but before his conviction, a preliminary parole revocation hearing was held in Pennsylvania with respect to determining whether or not, as a result of his Pennsylvania arrest, there was probable cause that he had violated his parole related to his Rhode Island sentence. Thereafter, on November 10, 1994, after Mr. Jefferson’s Pennsylvania conviction and while he was serving his sentence in Pennsylvania, the Rhode Island Parole Board held a final parole revocation hearing and voted to revoke his parole and indicated, in the minutes from that hearing, that he would “no longer be eligible for parole * * *.” In November of 2013, upon completion of his prison term in Pennsylvania, petitioner was transported to the Adult Correctional Institutions in Rhode Island. On April 14, 2014, Mr. Jefferson appeared before the Parole Board for what appears to have been a second final parole revocation hearing; there is no indication in the record that he was represented by counsel at that time. The Parole Board voted to affirm the above-referenced revocation of Mr. Jefferson’s parole and, according to his application for postconviction relief presently at issue, informed him that he “is and forever will remain ineligible for parole- consideration.” Mr. Jefferson represents, in his application for postconviction relief, and the state does not contest, that the basis of the Parole Board’s decision that he will remain ineligible for parole was the mandate contained in § 13-8-14(b).', '-3-', 'Mr. Jefferson filed the instant pro se application for postconviction relief on July 1, 2014. He alleged therein that the Parole Board’s reliance on § 13-8-14(b) was “improper and unconstitutional * * *.” Specifically, he contended that he had not been convicted of any offense listed under G.L. 1956 § 11-47-2. He further contended that his due process rights under Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), were violated during the revocation proceedings.', 'On April 1, 2015, Mr. Jefferson’s court-appointed counsel (having entered his appearance on October 1, 2014) filed both a motion to withdraw as counsel3 and a memorandum in support of that motion pursuant to this Court’s opinion in Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000);4 the grounds for the motion to withdraw were that the issues raised in petitioner’s application for postconviction relief were “wholly frivolous, and not supported by existing law, or by a good faith basis for the reversal, extension, or modification of existing law * * *.” On April 14, 2015, a hearing was held on court-appointed counsel’s motion to withdraw, in the course of which hearing the hearing justice granted the motion. Subsequently, on April 29, 2015, Mr. Jefferson filed an “Objection to Defense Counsel’s Shatney Memorandum.” On June 2, 2015, a second hearing was conducted, at which Mr. Jefferson appeared pro se; at the close of that hearing, Mr. Jefferson’s application for postconviction relief was denied. He filed a notice of appeal on June 19, 2015. 3', 'The docket sheet reflects the fact that a motion to withdraw was filed on April 1, 2015, but only a copy of the memorandum in support of the motion is contained in the record. 4', 'We take this opportunity to note our continuing concern with respect to the way our decision in Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000), has been implemented. In our judgment, too often court-appointed counsel are overly ready to simply file a motion to withdraw and are not providing applicants for postconviction relief the kind of inquiry into the record, research of potential grounds for the grant of postconviction relief, and zealous representation to which they are entitled. While we hold the issue in abeyance at this time, we have grave doubts as to the continuation of the procedure provided for in Shatney. We tend to think that, as it has been administered, it has become untenable.', '-4-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When passing on a hearing justice’s denial of an application for postconviction relief, “this Court accords great deference to the hearing justice’s findings of fact.” Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d 603, 605 (R.I. 2011). As such, “[t]his Court will uphold the decision absent clear error or a determination that the hearing justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence.”', 'Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). That being said, we will review “de novo any questions of law or fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights.” Id.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'We need not address each of Mr. Jefferson’s contentions before this Court due to the fact that, in our judgment, it was error to deny him representation of counsel and his “opportunity to be heard in person” when the Parole Board voted to revoke his parole on November 10, 1994. Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 489. Moreover, in our opinion, his right to counsel under the specific circumstances of this case was also not provided to him at the April 14, 2014 hearing before the Parole Board, at which the Parole Board affirmed the denial of his parole.5 5', 'We note, initially, that there is no issue as to waiver with respect to Mr. Jefferson’s contention that his due process rights were violated. He clearly raised the violation of his due process rights in his application for postconviction relief, and he specifically cited Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), in that same application.', 'We deem it prudent to add that, in our judgment, Mr. Jefferson’s contention in his pro se application for postconviction relief that his constitutional rights were violated, and his mention of due process specifically, are sufficient, on the specific facts of the instant case, to preserve his contention that the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution was violated when his parole was revoked and he was denied the possibility of parole in the future. We take no position on the merits of that contention at this time.', '-5-', 'The United States Supreme Court in Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 489, set forth what is minimally necessary to comply with the requirements of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution in the context of parole revocation.', 'For the purposes of this opinion, we will focus only on the requirements set forth therein with respect to the final revocation hearing, as those are the pertinent requirements for this case.6 It appears from the facts of this case that, after Mr. Jefferson’s preliminary parole revocation hearing, which took place on December 13 and December 29, 1993, he was in essence given two final parole revocation hearings on November 10, 1994 and April 14, 2014. The United States Supreme Court in Morrissey stated that, for a final parole revocation hearing, the minimum requirements of due process are as follows:', '“(a) written notice of the claimed violations of parole;', '(b) disclosure to the parolee of evidence against him;', '(c) opportunity to be heard in person and to present witnesses and', 'documentary evidence; (d) the right to confront and cross-examine', 'adverse witnesses (unless the hearing officer specifically finds', 'good cause for not allowing confrontation); (e) a ‘neutral and', 'detached’ hearing body such as a traditional parole board,', 'members of which need not be judicial officers or lawyers; and', '(f) a written statement by the factfinders as to the evidence relied', 'on and reasons for revoking parole.” Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 489. It necessarily follows that Mr. Jefferson was entitled to each of the just-quoted requirements at his final parole revocation hearings. 6', 'The United States Supreme Court in Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 485-87, also set forth the requirement of a preliminary hearing and specific details as to the requirements of due process at such a hearing. We acknowledge that, in his pro se application for postconviction relief, Mr. Jefferson referenced what he contended were errors at his preliminary hearing, which took place on December 13 and December 29, 1993 in Pennsylvania. However, before this Court he restricts his argument to the final parole revocation hearings, and we will likewise restrict our review to those hearings. See Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 16 n.10 (R.I. 2012) (“We note that this Court will deem as waived issues that the appellant fails to brief * * *.”).', '-6-', 'However, in Morrissey, the Supreme Court specifically opted not to pass on “the question whether the parolee is entitled to the assistance of retained counsel or to appointed counsel if he is indigent.” Id. The United States Supreme Court has never held that a parolee is entitled in every case to representation by an attorney at a final parole revocation hearing; rather, that Court has held that “the decision as to the need for counsel must be made on a case-by-case basis in the exercise of a sound discretion by the state authority charged with responsibility for administering the probation and parole system.” Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 790 (1973).7 The Supreme Court went on to explain that “[a]lthough the presence and participation of counsel will probably be both undesirable and constitutionally unnecessary in most revocation hearings, there will remain certain cases in which fundamental fairness—the touchstone of due process—will require that the State provide at its expense counsel for indigent probationers or parolees.” Id. The Supreme Court further stated, in Gagnon, that:', '“Presumptively, it may be said that counsel should be provided in', 'cases where, after being informed of his right to request counsel,', 'the probationer or parolee makes such a request, based on a timely', 'and colorable claim * * * that, even if the violation is a matter of', 'public record or is uncontested, there are substantial reasons which', 'justified or mitigated the violation and make revocation', 'inappropriate, and that the reasons are complex or otherwise', 'difficult to develop or present.” Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 790; see also 7', 'Subsequent to the Supreme Court’s opinion in Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973), Congress passed the United States Parole Commission and Reorganization Act, Pub. L. No. 94- 233, 90 Stat. 228 (1976), which requires representation by an attorney at a parole revocation hearing if the parolee so desires. See Jones v. State, 560 A.2d 1056, 1057 n.1 (Del. 1989). Despite the passage of said act, Gagnon remains good law with respect to whether or not the United States Constitution requires the opportunity to be represented by counsel at a final parole revocation hearing. It is further noteworthy that the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the holding in Gagnon in more recent cases. See Turner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 443 (2011) (“[T]he Court has held that a criminal offender facing revocation of probation and imprisonment does not ordinarily have a right to counsel at a probation revocation hearing.”) (emphasis in original) (citing Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 790); Black v. Romano, 471 U.S. 606, 612 (1985) (“[T]he probationer has a right to the assistance of counsel in some circumstances.”) (citing Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 790).', '-7-', 'United States v. Dodson, 25 F.3d 385, 388-89 (6th Cir. 1994);', 'Gibbs v. State, 760 A.2d 541, 543 (Del. 2000); Walker v. Forbes,', '790 S.E.2d 240, 244 (Va. 2016).', 'We consider to be noteworthy the United States Supreme Court’s explicit acknowledgment in Gagnon that there will arise some cases whose complexity calls for providing counsel to a parolee at a parole revocation hearing. In our judgment, the instant case is on its face one of particular factual and legal complexity, and it is our view that in this case petitioner should be represented by counsel before the Parole Board if he so chooses. See Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 789 (“The need for counsel at revocation hearings derives, not from the invariable attributes of those hearings, but rather from the peculiarities of particular cases.”) (emphasis added). We expressly refrain from formulating any broader rule in these premises; we restrict ourselves to the case at hand. In support of our conclusion, we note that, according to the several letters Mr. Jefferson attached to his “Objection to Defense Counsel’s Shatney Memorandum,” he specifically requested counsel, in writing and on more than one occasion, prior to the April 14, 2014 hearing before the Parole Board. In support of his request for an attorney, Mr. Jefferson cited the fact that he was contending that he had been “wrongly convicted of [the] ‘trigger’ offense;” he further cited the “complex issues involved” in the case, and he made specific mention of the applicability of § 13-8-14(b).', 'It is clear from the record that, when the Parole Board first revoked Mr. Jefferson’s parole on November 10, 1994, at his first final parole revocation hearing, he was not “heard in person” because he was incarcerated in Pennsylvania at the time, nor was he represented by counsel in connection with his parole revocation. Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 489. Consequently, it does not appear that Mr. Jefferson’s due process rights, detailed in Morrissey, and his right to an attorney, recognized in Gagnon, were complied with at the time of the initial revocation of his', '-8- parole by the Rhode Island Parole Board in 1994. Moreover, after Mr. Jefferson completed his sentence in Pennsylvania and was transported back to Rhode Island, he appeared before the Parole Board for what appears to have been a second final parole revocation hearing, at which appearance the Parole Board affirmed the revocation of his parole. There is no indication that he was represented by counsel at that hearing despite his numerous requests for counsel. It was error for the Parole Board to deny Mr. Jefferson counsel at the April 14, 2014 hearing.', 'Without addressing the constitutionality of § 13-8-14(b) as applied to Mr. Jefferson, we note that the applicability of § 13-8-14(b) to Mr. Jefferson turns in part on whether the offense for which he was convicted in Pennsylvania (aggravated assault) constitutes “a crime of violence as defined in § 11-47-2.” The consequences of this determination are obviously severe—viz., whether Mr. Jefferson will ever be eligible for parole or whether he must serve his life sentence without the possibility of parole.', 'Under these circumstances, we are of the opinion that fundamental fairness and due process require that counsel be provided to him. We deem it error, therefore, for the Parole Board to have denied him counsel at the November 10, 1994 hearing and the April 14, 2014 hearing.', 'Accordingly, we remand this case to the Superior Court with instructions that it remand the case to the Parole Board to conduct a new parole revocation hearing.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein and due to the especially complex nature of this case, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court; and we remand the record to that tribunal with instructions that it remand the case to the Parole Board to conduct a new parole revocation', '-9- hearing which complies with the requirements of due process and the right to be represented by counsel if Mr. Jefferson so chooses.', 'Chief Justice Suttell, concurring in part and dissenting in part. Although I concur with the majority’s holding to vacate the judgment of the Superior Court, I respectfully dissent from its mandate to remand the case to the Superior Court with instructions that it in turn remand the case to the Parole Board to conduct a new parole-revocation hearing. In my view, the decision to hold a new parole hearing is, at best, premature at this juncture. Significantly, this Court has not been provided with a record of the proceedings before the Parole Board.', 'Moreover, the Board’s discretion was severely constricted under the circumstances of this case. Mr. Jefferson’s conviction of aggravated assault in Pennsylvania conclusively establishes the fact that he indeed violated the conditions of his parole. Under the provisions of G.L. 1956 § 13-8-14(b), the conviction automatically triggers his parole revocation and precludes his eligibility for future parole. The only statutory question that must be resolved is whether the Pennsylvania conviction constitutes “a crime of violence as defined in § 11-47-2[.]” Section 13- 8-14(b). The ultimate resolution of that issue is a question of law properly cognizable in the Superior Court in the context of a petition for postconviction relief.', 'So too must any constitutional question be resolved by the courts, not by the Parole Board.', 'I join my dissenting colleague, however, in her assessment that Jefferson was ignominiously “Shatneyed.” In the interest of justice, therefore, I would vacate the judgment denying Jefferson’s application for postconviction relief and remand the case to the Superior Court for a new hearing with appointed counsel. I further endorse my dissenting colleague’s elegy for the procedures this Court adopted in Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000).', '- 10 -', 'Justice Goldberg, dissenting. The majority has erred in this case; it has reached issues of constitutional dimension that were not raised by the parties and are not properly before the Supreme Court or even necessary to our decision, and it has decided them wrongly. The majority’s decision amounts to a judicial amendment of the general laws relative to parole revocation, and will adversely affect the orderly procedures of the Parole Board. I am therefore compelled to write separately in an effort, at the very least, to illuminate where the majority opinion has gone off the rails.', 'Parole Revocation is Governed by Statute in Rhode Island', 'The majority opinion references the minimum due-process requirements for parole- revocation proceedings set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), and declares that Jefferson was entitled to each of those requirements at his final parole hearing and also holds that “it was error to deny [Jefferson] representation of counsel and his ‘opportunity to be heard in person’ when the Parole Board voted to revoke his parole on November 10, 1994.” (Quoting Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 489.) The majority opinion ignores the holding in Morrissey that procedural guarantees in the parole-revocation context, as mandated by the Due Process Clause, fall upon the states and that at the time Morrissey was promulgated, most states already had procedural protections in place. Id. at 484. “What is needed is an informal hearing structured to assure that the finding of a parole violation will be based on verified facts and that the exercise of discretion will be informed by an accurate knowledge of the parolee’s behavior.” Id. The concerns in Morrissey centered on the potential for arbitrary revocation decisions based on putative violations of the conditions of one’s parole.', 'The “discretionary aspect of the revocation decision need not be reached unless there is first an', '- 11 - appropriate determination that the individual has in fact breached the conditions of parole.” Id. at 483-84 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court also recognized the public’s interest “in not having parole revoked because of erroneous information or because of an erroneous evaluation of the need to revoke parole, given the breach of parole conditions.”', 'Id. at 484 (emphasis added). None of these salutary considerations concern the commission of a new felony crime by the parolee and the statutory consequences of that crime; which is the case before us on appeal.', 'The appellants in Morrissey were returned to prison by the Iowa Board of Parole as parole violators—without a hearing or opportunity to be heard—not for the commission of new criminal offenses, but for alleged violations of the conditions of parole set forth in their parole officers’ reports, including, inter alia, the unauthorized purchase of a motor vehicle, use of an assumed name to obtain credit and a driver’s license, and leaving the territorial limits of the county without consent. Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 474. The Supreme Court declared that the liberty interest in remaining on parole was sufficient to require minimum due-process protections. Id. at 483-84. The Court was confronted with prisoners who were accused of violating the conditions of their parole, not individuals convicted of violent felony crimes. Notwithstanding this distinction, the overriding emphasis of the Supreme Court as set forth repeatedly in Morrissey was the declaration that “there is no thought to equate this second stage of parole revocation to a criminal prosecution in any sense. It is a narrow inquiry * * *. * * * We have no thought to create an inflexible structure for parole revocation procedures.” Id. at 489, 490. The majority opinion misconstrues the seminal holding in Morrissey.', 'This Court has long recognized “that revocation proceedings must accord the parolee a minimum degree of due-process protection.” Gaze v. State, 521 A.2d 125, 127 (R.I. 1987). The issues in this case, however, are wholly unrelated to the minimum due-process requirements for', '- 12 - revocation hearings. The majority overlooks the fact that Jefferson’s parole and its revocation were governed by the law of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the then-existing Rhode Island “Uniform Act for Out of State Parolee Supervision,” under which Jefferson was afforded an evidentiary hearing with the benefit of counsel before he was declared in violation of his parole. Jefferson was then convicted in Pennsylvania of the underlying offense that gave rise to the violation, and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment. This conviction and sentence, of course, obviated any due-process requirement for a prompt resolution of the parole revocation issue. See Moody v. Daggett, 429 U.S. 78, 85 n.7 (1976) (criminal conviction serves to eliminate the need for a preliminary parole-revocation hearing as required by Morrissey because the conviction supplies the parole authority with the requisite probable cause to believe parolee committed acts that would constitute a violation of the conditions of his or her parole).', 'In 1994, when the Parole Board voted to revoke Jefferson’s parole, Jefferson had been found guilty in Pennsylvania, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the offense of aggravated assault, an offense classified as a violent felony crime. Despite the finality of this criminal conviction, the majority decrees, sua sponte, that in 1994, while incarcerated in Pennsylvania, in accordance with the Uniform Act, the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution mandated that Jefferson was entitled to be provided with, inter alia, written notice of the claimed violation and the evidence against him, as well as an opportunity to be heard in person, present witnesses and documentary evidence, and confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him. The majority has declared, without any analysis, that the Due Process Clause mandates that Jefferson be afforded the opportunity to relitigate the merits of the Pennsylvania conviction. The majority is incorrect. This holding misconstrues the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence and this Court’s holdings in the area of parole revocation.', '- 13 -', 'Furthermore, the majority goes on to declare that in 2014—after he served the entire sentence in Pennsylvania—minimum due process required that Jefferson be afforded counsel, notice of the evidence, an opportunity to be heard in person, and the right to confront and cross- examine adverse witnesses, as well as the right to relitigate the merits of that offense. The majority opinion ignores the requirements of G.L. 1956 § 13-8-14(b), the statute under review in this case, and imposes requirements that will drastically alter the manner in which the Parole Board conducts parole-revocation proceedings. The opinion amounts to a judicial amendment of the parole statute.', 'Parole revocation has long been recognized as a “nonadversarial, administrative process[] established by the States” that is “predictive and discretionary,” designed “to promote the best interests of both parolees and society * * *.” Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole v. Scott, 524 U.S. 357, 366, 367 (1998) (quoting Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 787-88 (1973)).', 'Indeed, the Supreme Court has refused “to intrude into the States’ correctional schemes[,]” recognizing that “States have wide latitude under the Constitution to structure parole revocation proceedings.” Id. at 365, 367.', 'In this state, the parole system is a creature of the Legislature. One who is imprisoned as a result of a criminal conviction is “turned over to an administrative agency for the execution of the sentence.” State v. Fazzano, 96 R.I. 472, 478, 194 A.2d 680, 684 (1963). Parole is a legislatively-created system, governed by chapter 8 of title 13 of the general laws, whereby the prisoner is granted conditional release to serve the remainder of the sentence outside the confines of the prison, but under the supervision and upon conditions of the Parole Board, an administrative body created by the Legislature. “Courts have no power to determine the penological system; this is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the [L]egislature.” Fazzano, 96', '- 14 - R.I. at 478, 194 A.2d at 684. This Court has adopted a “hands-off” policy when dealing with Parole Board proceedings, and has consistently expressed our reluctance to interfere with this orderly, legislatively-created structure. State v. Ouimette, 117 R.I. 361, 363, 367 A.2d 704, 706 (1976). “This [C]ourt has previously acknowledged a historically hands-off policy with respect to board proceedings ‘and the overall reluctance to interfere with what must necessarily be highly discretionary decisions.’” Pine v. Clark, 636 A.2d 1319, 1324 (R.I. 1994) (quoting Ouimette, 117 R.I. at 363, 367 A.2d at 706). At no time in the thirty-plus years since our holding in Gaze, in which we acknowledged that basic due-process requirements were required in parole- revocation proceedings, has this Court had occasion to interfere with the proceedings of the Parole Board. See Gaze, 521 A.2d at 127. We certainly have never ventured into this area in the absence of a justiciable issue, with no briefing by the parties. In this appeal, without any analysis, the majority has judicially altered the procedures of the Parole Board and, with no record before us, concluded that the Parole Board violated Jefferson’s constitutional rights.', 'Parole-revocation hearings are administrative in nature and governed by statute. Section 13-8-18 provides that a majority of the members of the Parole Board may, in accordance with the provisions of § 13-8-18.1, revoke any permit issued to any prisoner under its jurisdiction. Section 13-8-18.1 sets forth in detail the process under which the Parole Board may exercise its broad discretion.

This Court should refrain from entering these waters. First, clearly, the parolee’s due-process rights to notice and an opportunity to be heard and to confront one’s accusers, as set forth in § 13-8-18.1(a) and (b), mirrors the Supreme Court’s pronouncement in Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 489. Second, the parolee’s right to counsel and right “under certain circumstances to the', '- 18 - appointment of counsel” also are provided by statute. See § 13-8-18.1(b)(4). Critically, for purposes of this case, § 13-8-18.1(e) provides that “[i]f the alleged violator is found to have been entitled to counsel and no such counsel has been appointed, the parole violation charges must be dismissed with prejudice.” (Emphasis added.) Alarmingly, with no record of the Parole Board proceeding, the majority has concluded that Jefferson was entitled to counsel, and that no such counsel was appointed.', 'Jefferson’s Parole Violation', 'To begin with, we have no record in this case and, with the exception of the documents attached to Jefferson’s pro se application for postconviction relief, we have no idea what occurred before the Parole Board in 1994, and again in 2014, twenty years after the conviction that gave rise to Jefferson’s parole revocation. What is clear in these paltry materials is that Jefferson sought to relitigate the merits of his Pennsylvania criminal conviction before the Parole Board and again in Superior Court on postconviction relief, where he alleged actual innocence to those charges. The majority has declared that it was error for the Parole Board to deny Jefferson counsel and an opportunity to be heard in person when the Parole Board voted to revoke his parole on November 10, 1994, and again at the 2014 hearing. The majority also concludes that Jefferson was entitled to disclosure of the evidence against him, the right to confront and cross- examine adverse witnesses, and a written statement of the evidence relied upon in revoking his parole. The majority is mistaken. The Pennsylvania conviction is conclusive on the question of whether Jefferson committed a parole violation. See § 13-8-18.1(f). In the usual course of events, when confronted with a finding of probable cause to conclude that the parolee has violated a condition of his or her parole, the Parole Board, in a final hearing, would determine', '- 19 - whether Jefferson’s parole permit should be revoked. In the case of a criminal conviction, the parolee is not entitled to relitigate the merits of the conviction.', 'However, because Jefferson was serving a sentence of life imprisonment when he was granted parole, the Parole Board’s discretion was limited. The only question before the Parole Board was whether Jefferson’s felony conviction in Pennsylvania for aggravated assault falls within the provisions of § 13-8-14(b). This is a question of law. The majority opinion ignores the provisions of this statute that are triggered upon conviction of a violent crime while on parole, by one serving a sentence of life imprisonment, and “shall constitute an automatic revocation of parole and the prisoner shall not be eligible for parole thereafter.” (Emphasis added.) This is the controlling statutory provision before this Court.', 'Section 13-8-14(b) provides, in its entirety:', '“In the case of a prisoner sentenced to imprisonment for life who is', 'released on parole and who is subsequently convicted of a crime of', 'violence as defined in § 11-47-2, the conviction shall constitute an', 'automatic revocation of parole and the prisoner shall not be', 'eligible for parole thereafter.”', 'After his term of incarceration in Pennsylvania, Jefferson was returned to Rhode Island and appeared before the Parole Board on April 14, 2014; he was subsequently informed that the Parole Board voted to affirm his 1994 parole revocation. It is fair to say that, in the face of a final criminal conviction for a violent felony, the board had no discretion but to inform Jefferson that the provisions of § 13-8-14(b) applied to him.', 'The operative language in § 13-8-14(b) is that “the conviction shall constitute an automatic revocation of parole[.]” (Emphasis added.) A conviction for a crime of violence, as enumerated in § 11-47-2, is conclusive. Because the Pennsylvania conviction is accorded full faith and credit, no court or administrative body would look behind the judgment to determine', '- 20 - whether there is probable cause to conclude that the parolee violated parole. The majority’s suggestion that Morrissey mandates or even permits the Parole Board to look beyond the conviction and permit Jefferson to confront his accusers twenty years after the conviction simply is wrong. See Lee v. Gough, 86 R.I. 23, 32, 133 A.2d 779, 783 (1957) (considering parole to be void as of the date of subsequent criminal conviction); see also State v. Seamans, 935 A.2d 618, 622 (R.I. 2007) (admission of guilt to the underlying offense is tantamount to admission of fault with respect to probation violation). Furthermore, the Legislature has addressed the effects of a criminal conviction in the parole violation context: Section 13-8-18.1(f) provides, in relevant part, that “[p]roof of conviction of a crime committed subsequent to release on parole shall constitute probable cause for the purposes of the preliminary hearing.” Thus, the issue of whether Jefferson violated his parole in Pennsylvania was conclusive; it is not however, the controlling issue in this case.', 'It is only when a parolee serving a life sentence has been convicted of an enumerated violent crime that § 13-8-14(b) becomes operative and “shall constitute an automatic revocation of parole[.]” By employing the term “automatic,” the Legislature has divested the Parole Board of any discretion in its application. Parole is revoked by operation of law, and the second part of that section comes into play: “the prisoner shall not be eligible for parole thereafter.” In the case at bar, it was only after Jefferson was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to and served twenty years in prison in Pennsylvania that the Parole Board entered its final revocation decision. See Moody v. Daggett, 429 U.S. 78, 87 (1976) (final parole revocation hearing not constitutionally required until the prisoner is taken into custody as a parole violator).', 'Once Jefferson returned to Rhode Island in 2014 as a parole violator, it was incumbent upon the Parole Board to determine whether the crime of aggravated assault, for which he had', '- 21 - been convicted, fell within the enumerated offenses set forth in § 11-47-2. I am confident that the Parole Board did not employ the provisions of § 13-8-14(b) in a vacuum and that the presumption of administrative regularity that generally attaches to the decisions of administrative bodies obtains in this case. See Ouimette, 117 R.I. at 372, 367 A.2d at 710 (the Court has every confidence that the Parole Board, charged with significant responsibility, carries out its duties faithfully according to statutory directions); see generally Gardner v. Cumberland Town Council, 826 A.2d 972, 978 (R.I. 2003) (broad latitude given to legislative bodies). Furthermore, and most critically, whether Jefferson’s Pennsylvania conviction fell within the provisions of § 11-47-2 is a question of law that is reviewed de novo. The mandate set forth in the majority opinion requires the Parole Board “to conduct a new parole revocation hearing which complies with the requirements of due process and the right to be represented by counsel * * *.” The majority should explicate just what is expected of the Parole Board at this juncture, and how it should be accomplished.', 'Unfortunately, this analysis is not the terminus of my alarm at the degree and breadth of error in the majority’s opinion.', 'Waiver', 'In a footnote, the majority opinion reaches and then decides the question of whether, in his pro se application for postconviction relief, Jefferson waived the constitutional claims raised by his appellate counsel on appeal. Indeed, the majority not only concludes that, by citing Morrissey, Jefferson “clearly raised the violation of his due process rights”—which is irrelevant—but with no analysis, discussion, or citation to authority, the majority takes an unacceptable leap and declares that, by merely mentioning “due process” in his pro se application for postconviction relief, Jefferson preserved “his contention that the ex post facto', '- 22 - clause of the United States Constitution was violated when his parole was revoked and he was denied the possibility of parole in the future.” This remarkable holding, set forth in a footnote, is legally incorrect and overlooks the entire argument by the state, which was based on waiver. Because the question of waiver forms the basis for the state’s argument in favor of affirming the judgment of the Superior Court, its resolution belongs in the body of the opinion with appropriate jurisprudential support and analysis.', 'There is no question that, in the ordinary case, the raise-or-waive rule would be a significant hurdle for Jefferson to overcome. Even Jefferson does not suggest that the mere mention of the phrase “due process” suffices to overcome the raise-or-waive rule. In his reply brief to this Court, Jefferson argues against the application of the raise-or-waive rule, not because the issues were preserved as the majority concludes, but in light of the grave injustices wrought upon him by the application of Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000), to his pro se application for postconviction relief, such that the question of waiver ought not apply. I agree. The applicant was denied his statutory right to counsel, and he has every right to have his claims fully and fairly litigated in the Superior Court.', 'Shatney Should be Laid to Rest', 'I also write separately to express my firm belief that this Court should abrogate the holding in Shatney, 755 A.2d at 136, in its entirety. This Court’s attempt in Shatney to short- circuit duplicitous applications for postconviction relief has too often resulted in the denial of an applicant’s right to collateral review of his or her conviction. Simply put, the ad hoc nature of Shatney and the questionable procedure in which counsel is appointed to undertake an initial review of the merits of a case is a procedural and substantive hodgepodge. See Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 456 (R.I. 2012) (the Superior Court erroneously interpreted Shatney as', '- 23 - requiring an attorney to report back to the court rather than represent the applicant). It is my opinion that the salutary goal we aimed to accomplish in Shatney has been misconstrued by the trial bench, is inconsistently applied, and produces disparate and unjust results. Furthermore, the Shatney practice overlooks the statutory right of a postconviction-relief applicant in this state to have the assistance of counsel, and ignores the statutory mandate that the Public Defender shall be appointed to represent indigent applicants in postconviction-relief cases.', 'In the case at bar, in accordance with § 13-8-14(b), as a result of his Pennsylvania conviction, Jefferson has been denied any further opportunity for release on parole. He filed a pro se application for postconviction relief, and private counsel was appointed. The record contains no explanation as to why the Public Defender was not appointed. See G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-5. The first order of business was to comply with Shatney’s distasteful gatekeeping function as a condition precedent to litigating one’s claim. Private counsel was appointed to determine whether there were any viable issues that would warrant counsel remaining in the case. Notably, the no-merit review performed by private counsel was based solely on the pro se application, with no consideration by counsel that other viable grounds for collateral review may exist such that an amended application was in order.', 'Although the Public Defender in practice refuses to take on Shatney cases, notwithstanding the command of the Legislature that the applicant shall be represented by the Public Defender, on appeal, after the case has been dismissed, the Public Defender enters the case, comes before this Court and proceeds to condemn both the trial justice and the Shatney', '- 24 - attorney.1 As a result, in this case and in many others, applicants seeking postconviction relief are deprived of their right to collateral review of their convictions.', 'Additionally, § 10-9.1-6(b) specifically allows for summary dismissal of applications for postconviction relief on the pleadings where there is no basis for relief. It provides:', '“When a court is satisfied, on the basis of the application, the', 'answer or motion, and the record, that the applicant is not entitled', 'to post conviction relief and no purpose would be served by any', 'further proceedings, it may indicate to the parties its intention to', 'dismiss the application and its reasons for so doing. The applicant', 'shall be given an opportunity to reply to the proposed dismissal. In', 'light of the reply, or on default thereof, the court may order the', 'application dismissed or grant leave to file an amended application', 'or direct that the proceedings otherwise continue. Disposition on', 'the pleadings and record is not proper if there exists a genuine', 'issue of material fact.” Section 10-9.1-6(b).', 'The distinguishing factor between Shatney and § 10-9.1-6(b) is that the applicant has the benefit of counsel, and the trial justice, the ultimate factfinder, is not called upon to initiate summary disposition measures as a condition precedent to collateral review. Accordingly, it is my opinion that although Shatney was a worthwhile and well-intended effort by this Court, it is time for Shatney to be assigned to the graveyard of noble causes.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, I respectfully dissent in this case. I would vacate the judgment and remand this case to the Superior Court with directions to appoint counsel for the applicant and proceed, ab initio, in accordance with the provisions of the Post Conviction Remedy statute, chapter 9.1 of title 10. 1', 'In her reply brief to this Court, counsel for Jefferson declared that “Mr. Jefferson’s court- appointed post-conviction attorney conducted absolutely no investigation into the case and determined that the issues raised in his client’s pro se pleadings lacked merit. Likewise, a Superior Court judge promptly endorsed this erroneous no-merit finding despite the existence of glaring constitutional issues that appear after reading R.I.G.L. § 13-8-14(b), the statute implicated in this case.”', '- 25 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'Leonard Jefferson v.

(Rite Aid), in a slip-and-fall action. Additionally, in these consolidated appeals, the plaintiff appeals from a denial of his motion for a new trial regarding defendants Riverside Plaza Associates, LP (Riverside), which owned the shopping center where the Rite Aid was located, and Venditelli & Sons, Inc. (Venditelli).1 This case came before the Supreme Court on May 9, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in these appeals should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and reviewing their memoranda, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide these appeals at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the order and judgment of the Superior Court in these appeals. 1', 'Two different judges presided over these matters. As such, we refer to the judge that presided over the summary-judgment hearing as the hearing justice and the judge that presided over the trial as the trial justice.', '1', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On February 5, 2014, the plaintiff drove his truck to a Rite Aid store in East Providence while it was snowing. After parking his truck in the lot, he walked into the store to buy cigars. Then, returning to his truck, he located a prescription, and he went back to the store. 2 It was during this second venture back to the store that he tripped and fell over a cement parking stop located in front of his truck in the parking lot. As a result, Kemp injured his right knee, requiring hospitalization, nursing home care, and physical therapy.', 'At his deposition, Kemp recalled tripping in the parking lot:', '“I pulled [my truck] in head first * * * and there was a big pile of', 'snow on the left so that, you know, there’s kind of a walk space', 'between the cars, and because of that big pile of snow, I had to', 'move a little more to the right when I parked the car because the', 'space was narrowed down. * * * [T]hey have those concrete things', '* * * I had to move over that way, and part of it was sticking out,', 'and I was squeezing * * * this little path like that. * * * I went in', 'the store and I must have just missed the thing because it was just', 'hanging out maybe that much on the side, * * * which if I had been', 'able to park the car where I should, it would be more over to the', 'left.” At trial, Kemp testified that the pile of snow was “[p]robably five [feet] high” and about fifteen feet wide.', 'Keith Reed, an employee of Riverside, explained in his deposition that, in 2013 and 2014, he was responsible for “snowblow[ing] with the snowblower all the sidewalks [at the shopping center], and then * * * put[ting] salt down and clear[ing] the entrances to all the stores.” Moreover, Reed stated that he put salt down on sidewalks and any paths that he shoveled, including the pathways in between the parking stops in front of Rite Aid. Additionally, for the 2', 'At his deposition, Kemp explained that he did not know why he had chosen to make two separate trips: “I don’t know why I did it in a couple stages. * * * I have no idea.”', '2 2013-2014 winter season, Riverside had hired Venditelli to perform snow removal at the shopping center, which included the Rite Aid store. At trial, the owner of Venditelli, Andrew Venditelli, testified that the snow pile Kemp had described as about five feet tall was actually only “[m]aybe two to three feet” high.', 'On May 21, 2015, Kemp filed a complaint against defendants Rite Aid, Riverside, and Venditelli, alleging negligence. On October 2, 2015, Rite Aid moved for summary judgment, contending that it owed no duty of care to plaintiff.', 'As the basis for its argument, Rite Aid pointed to a section in its lease agreement with Riverside—the owner of the property where the store was located—which provided as follows:', '“Landlord shall, at its sole cost and expense (subject to the', 'following paragraph), keep and maintain the Common Areas in', 'good condition and repair, including but not limited to, restriping', '(when necessary); repairing and replacing paving and the sub-', 'strata thereof (Landlord hereby agreeing that it will repave the', 'Common Areas at least once every ten (10) years); keeping the', 'Common Areas properly policed, drained, free of snow, ice, water,', 'rubbish and obstructions, and in a neat, clean, orderly and', 'sanitary condition; * * * and maintaining any plantings and', 'landscaped areas.

However, no final judgment entered pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure; and, on September 6, 2016, the eve of trial, Rite Aid filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of', '3 Civil Procedure, relying on the same grounds that were presented at the summary-judgment hearing. At the close of all the trial evidence, the trial justice granted this motion.3', 'At the trial, plaintiff pursued his remaining claims against Riverside and Venditelli. There, plaintiff attempted to introduce three photographs that depicted snow in the parking lot. One of the pictures was taken four weeks after plaintiff’s fall, and two were taken approximately a year later. The trial justice granted defendants’ motion in limine to preclude the photographs, explaining that “one of the photographs was taken after a 24-inch snowstorm, [while] another photograph shows substantially less snow * * *.” He stated that “for the purpose of the plaintiff’s burden of proof in this case, [he did not] feel that the probative value of the[] photos, taken long after the incident in question, outweigh[ed] the prejudicial effect [they] could have on the jury.”', 'At the end of the trial, the jury returned with a verdict in favor of defendants. The plaintiff then moved for a new trial, which was denied. The plaintiff appealed the grant of the motion for summary judgment in favor of Rite Aid, as well as evidentiary rulings made by the trial justice, and the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial.4 3', 'We note that counsel for Rite Aid was present at trial, presumably for the purpose of arguing Rite Aid’s motion for judgment as a matter of law.

Rule 3(c) provides that “[t]he notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties taking the appeal and shall designate the judgment, order or decree or part thereof appealed from.” However, at oral argument plaintiff explained that the inaccuracy amounted to no more than a scrivener’s error, and Rite Aid’s counsel did not rebut this characterization. Consequently, we treat the error as such and, as a result, see no need to deny plaintiff his appeal on this basis.', '5', '“To establish a negligence claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate ‘a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.’” Flynn v.

The lease also specified that Riverside could “deposit accumulated ice and snow on portions of the non- exclusive parking areas and other parts of the Common Areas to the extent necessary under the circumstances * * *”; it provided, however, that “in no event shall any such deposit materially interfere with or otherwise materially disrupt [Rite Aid’s] use of the Premises, the visibility of the premises from [the street], and/or the operation of [Rite Aid’s] business.” Moreover, the lease granted Rite Aid “a non-exclusive license” to utilize “the Common Areas in common with * * * other tenants of the Shopping Center, and their respective employees, customers, invitees, licensees, and visitors * * *.” (Emphasis added.) It is abundantly clear from the lease agreement that Riverside retained the role of clearing snow from the parking lot where Rite Aid is located, and that Rite Aid also shared its use of the parking lot with other tenants of Riverside. 7 See MacFarlane v.

One of the photographs at issue was taken of the parking lot after a heavy snowfall a number of weeks after the incident, and the others were taken a year or so after plaintiff’s accident. The trial justice outlined his reasons for determining that the photographs were irrelevant and stated that, even assuming some relevance, he did not “feel that the probative value of these photos, taken long after the incident in question, outweigh[ed] the prejudicial effect [they] could have on the jury.” See Cappuccilli, 174 A.3d at 733 (“In weighing that minimal probative value against the significant prejudice that the trial justice recognized, we cannot agree that the trial justice abused his considerable discretion in excluding the evidence.”). Not only are we satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in ruling that the pictures are irrelevant to Kemp’s claims, we also conclude that he did not abuse his discretion in determining that any scintilla of relevance would be outweighed by the prejudicial effect of the photographs before the jury.

Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in granting defendants’ motion in limine.', '2', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'With respect to his appeal from the order denying his motion for a new trial, plaintiff maintains that the motion should have been granted because, based on the facts at trial, only one', '9 conclusion could have been reached—that Riverside was negligent, and, thus, the jury did not correctly apply the law regarding negligence. In addition, plaintiff submits that the existence of unusual circumstances precluded application of the Connecticut Rule regarding snow removal. See Terry v.

We agree that plaintiff failed to put forth any evidence of unusual circumstances regarding the snowy conditions in the parking lot on the day of the incident. See id. at 1292, 1293. Consequently, we hold that the trial justice was not clearly wrong in denying plaintiff’s motion for a new trial based on the application of the Connecticut Rule. See id.', 'With respect to the pile of snow that was in the parking lot that day, plaintiff argues that the trial justice should have found that Riverside failed to remove snow and inspect the walkways, including the snow pile left from a previous storm.

Furney, 808 A.2d 615, 617 (R.I. 2002). In the case before us, we are tasked with reviewing the trial justice’s ruling on the motion for a new trial. We will only overturn that ruling if the trial justice “overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence[,]” and we are satisfied that neither happened here. Berman, 101 A.3d at 1260 (quoting Botelho, 970 A.2d at 546).', 'In denying plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice highlighted that Kemp explained that he had tripped on the concrete parking stop, not on the large pile of snow. Nonetheless, Kemp had testified that it was snowing when he arrived at Rite Aid and also that the pile of snow forced him to park his truck “farther to the right.” Even taking this testimony into account and finding Kemp credible, the trial justice simultaneously found defendants’ witnesses credible, and he ultimately agreed with the jury’s verdict. Specifically, he expressed that “the evidence in this case does not strongly preponderate against the jury verdict, nor is it sharply conflicting and it is such that reasonable minds could reach different conclusions[.]” We cannot say that the trial justice “either overlooked or misconceived evidence or that he was clearly wrong,” and, thus, we must uphold his denial of the motion for a new trial. Cappuccilli, 174 A.3d at 732.', 'Turning to plaintiff’s contention that the trial justice erred by finding Monaghan credible, we emphasize that whether or not an individual witness is credible is squarely a determination for the trial justice.

As a result, and based on the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in finding Monaghan credible.

This matter came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the Superior Court judgment.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'A', 'Nugent’s Termination and Subsequent Arbitration Proceeding', 'Nugent had been an employee of the Public Defender’s Office for nineteen years. In July 2013, Nugent learned that her nephew had been murdered. During his arraignment, the Public', '-2- Defender’s Office represented the individual accused of murdering her nephew.', 'Nugent attended the arraignment and later asked an employee at the Public Defender’s Office to see the paperwork for the case. After Nugent was denied access to the paperwork, the same employee observed Nugent speaking on her cell phone and allegedly informing an unknown third party that she should be able to gain access to the case documents the following day. By a letter dated August 29, 2013, the Public Defender’s Office terminated Nugent’s employment.', 'In response to Nugent’s termination, the Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council, on behalf of Local Union 808, LIUNA (union), filed a grievance claiming that Nugent was terminated without just cause. The grievance was not resolved and the matter proceeded to arbitration.', 'After hearing testimony from Nugent and several employees of the Public Defender’s Office, the arbitrator determined that “given the egregiousness of [Nugent’s] misconduct * * * and considering as well her prior record of discipline,” the Public Defender’s Office “acted with just cause when it terminated [Nugent’s] employment.”', 'B', 'Nugent I', 'On June 27, 2014, Nugent filed a complaint in Superior Court to “appeal” the arbitration decision (Nugent I). She alleged that “the [a]rbitrator[] was arbitrary and capricious, based on facts, constituting clear error of law, against a greater weight of evidence presented, and the intent of the mandates and guidelines, protecting the confidentiality of Public Defender records, and conflicts of interest.” Nugent sought reversal of the arbitration decision and reinstatement to her previous employment at the Public Defender’s Office. In its answer, the Public Defender’s Office argued, relying on DiGuilio v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 819 A.2d 1271 (R.I. 2003), that Nugent lacked standing to bring the action in her individual capacity', '-3- without first making a showing that her union violated its duty of fair representation. See DiGuilio, 819 A.2d at 1273. The Public Defender’s Office also moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and argued, in part, that Nugent lacked standing to seek judicial review of the arbitration award. Specifically, the Public Defender’s Office argued that, under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, only the union or the Public Defender’s Office—the parties to that agreement—could bring the grievance to arbitration and subsequently seek judicial review of the arbitration award under G.L. 1956 § 28-9-18. The Public Defender’s Office, citing again to DiGuilio, argued that Nugent lacked standing because she did not put forth any evidence that the union breached its duty of fair representation and, consequently, she was barred from challenging the arbitration award on her own and without representation by the union. DiGuilio, 819 A.2d at 1273.', 'After a December 9, 2014 hearing on defendant’s Rule 12(c) motion, the hearing justice issued a bench decision granting the motion. We note that no transcript was ordered for this hearing.

On December 2, 2014, the Commission issued her a right-to-sue letter. Thereafter, on March 2, 2015, Nugent filed a second complaint in Superior Court seeking declaratory, injunctive, and equitable relief, in addition to reinstatement to her former position and back pay (Nugent II). She also sought compensatory damages for alleged unlawful employment discrimination based on race and disability, and retaliation based', '-4- on her prior complaints of race discrimination, disability discrimination, religious discrimination, and sexual harassment.', 'On March 3, 2016, the Public Defender’s Office moved for judgment on the pleadings and argued that res judicata and collateral estoppel barred Nugent’s discrimination claims. On May 31, 2016, the same hearing justice who decided Nugent I issued a bench decision wherein he found that res judicata barred Nugent’s second action because the parties to both actions were the same; the issues all related to Nugent’s employment with, and termination from, the Public Defender’s Office; and “there was final judgment” that “resolved all claims between the parties.” On June 17, 2016, an order entered granting the Public Defender’s Office’s motion for judgment on the pleadings; on that same date, final judgment entered in favor of the Public Defender’s Office on all claims.

Accordingly, she argues that the hearing justice’s decision should be reversed and she should be allowed to litigate Nugent II. The Public Defender’s Office counters that principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel bar Nugent’s discrimination claims in Nugent II.', 'The doctrine of res judicata operates to “render[] a prior judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action between the same parties conclusive as to any issues actually litigated in the prior action, or that could have been presented and litigated therein.” DiBattista v.

For purposes of res judicata, we must examine both Nugent I and Nugent II to determine whether the parties and the issues are the same in both actions and whether finality of judgment exists in the earlier action. See id. We will focus our analysis on the dispositive issue—whether the hearing justice’s grant of judgment on the pleadings in Nugent I operates as a final judgment on the merits.', 'It is clear that the hearing justice granted judgment on the pleadings in Nugent I in favor of the Public Defender’s Office on the basis of standing. We determined in DiGuilio that, when an employee unsuccessfully petitioned her union to bring her grievance to arbitration, “without a showing that the union breached its duty of fair representation, the employee [does] not have any standing to contest the merits of his [or her] contract claim against the employer in court” under the collective bargaining agreement. DiGuilio, 819 A.2d at 1273 (citing Early v. Eastern Transfer, 699 F.2d 552, 555 (1st Cir. 1983)). A plaintiff’s showing that his or her union violated its duty of fair representation acts as a narrow exception to the finality of a grievance decision, as governed by the collective bargaining agreement, and gives the plaintiff the right to contest his or her termination in court. Early, 699 F.2d at 555.', 'When determining whether or not an adjudication was on the merits for purposes of res judicata, we look to whether the party has “had an opportunity to be heard.” Huntley v. State, 63 A.3d 526, 532 (R.I. 2013) (concluding that the Superior Court’s dismissal for failure to state a claim was deemed a judgment on the merits because the plaintiff had an opportunity to be heard that was sufficient to satisfy due-process concerns when she received notice of the defendants’ motion to dismiss and failed to oppose it).', '-7-', 'In Nugent I, Nugent’s standing to challenge her termination in Superior Court was a threshold issue that was properly addressed prior to consideration of the merits of her case. See Mruk v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 82 A.3d 527, 534-35 (R.I. 2013) (noting that standing is a threshold issue and that third parties to a contract generally lack standing to challenge its validity). Nugent failed to show that the union had “breached its duty of fair representation[,]” and the hearing justice correctly determined that Nugent lacked standing to challenge the arbitration decision in court. DiGuilio, 819 A.2d at 1273. We conclude that the hearing justice’s consideration of Nugent’s standing did not reach the merits of Nugent I, and that she has yet to have an opportunity to be heard. Accordingly, we conclude that Nugent I was not a final judgment for purposes of res judicata and thus, Nugent is not barred from seeking redress for her discrimination claims raised in Nugent II.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court in Nugent II granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of the Public Defender’s Office.

It is my view that, having previously availed herself of the Superior Court’s jurisdiction with respect to the alleged wrongfulness of her termination, plaintiff should not be permitted to litigate that matter once again in an entirely new civil action.', 'While my respect for my colleagues is real, I am profoundly convinced that the majority’s opinion (especially its application of the doctrine of res judicata) is inconsistent with certain basic and venerable assumptions that underlie the body of Anglo-American jurisprudence. It is my definite conviction that Nugent II should not be allowed to go forward. The plaintiff had her opportunity to bring the issue of the allegedly wrongful termination of her employment before the Superior Court; she did so; she did not prevail; and that should be the end of it. See, e.g., Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144, 155 (R.I. 2008) (“There is nothing more to be said; this case is over.”); Arena v. City of Providence, 919 A.2d 379, 396 (R.I. 2007) (“It is time for this litigation to end.”); Gunn v. Union Railroad Co., 27 R.I. 320, 337, 62 A. 118, 125 (1905) (quoting with approval an ancient Latin maxim: “Interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium”1).', 'In my judgment, the principles underlying the doctrine of res judicata should have resulted in the dismissal of Nugent II. As this Court has often stated, the doctrine of res judicata bars the relitigation of all issues that “were tried or might have been tried in an earlier action.” Huntley v. State, 63 A.3d 526, 531 (R.I. 2013) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Bossian v. Anderson, 991 A.2d 1025, 1027 (R.I. 2010) (same); Carrozza v.

State, 785 A.2d 1132, 1138 (R.I. 2001) (“Res judicata bars the relitigation of any issue that could have been litigated in a prior proceeding, even if the particular issue was not raised.”). 1', 'The quoted Latin maxim can be translated as follows: “It is in the interest of the republic that there be an end to litigation.”', '-9-', 'It is clear from the record that plaintiff was displeased over the fact that her employment with the Public Defender’s Office was terminated. And she certainly was entitled to seek redress with respect to that termination. The plaintiff began the process of seeking redress by invoking the grievance and arbitration procedures that she was contractually entitled to invoke. Once those remedies did not produce a favorable result for her, plaintiff opted to seek judicial review. Accordingly, while represented by counsel, plaintiff filed a document entitled “Complaint” in the Superior Court (i.e., Nugent I). In the body of said Complaint, plaintiff sought to have the adverse decision of the arbitrator vacated. That challenge to the arbitral award was the only count set forth in her Complaint (although it was not labeled specifically as a “count”). It is crucially important to bear in mind that, at that juncture, nothing prevented plaintiff and her attorney from including additional statute-based counts in her Complaint for the purpose of challenging what she deemed to have been a wrongful and discriminatory termination.', 'Significantly, on the very day that plaintiff filed her Complaint in Nugent I in the Superior Court, she filed a charge of discrimination with the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights.2 However, for whatever reason, plaintiff and her attorney3 chose not to include in her Complaint in Nugent I one or more separate and distinct counts pursuant to the anti- discrimination statutes, whereby she could have brought to the court’s attention what she perceived to be the discriminatory motivation for her termination. No rule or other pertinent 2', 'I consider it to be of great importance to bear in mind that, at the relevant time (viz., when she commenced the Nugent I action), plaintiff clearly was of the belief that she was the victim of employment discrimination. As Part I.C of the majority opinion correctly states: “On the same day that she filed her complaint in Nugent I seeking judicial review of the arbitration award, June 27, 2014, Nugent also filed a charge with the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights alleging employment discrimination.” 3', 'I consider it noteworthy that the Complaint in Nugent I was signed by plaintiff’s personal attorney. This was not a situation where an attorney for the union for an aggrieved employee was seeking vacation of an adverse arbitral award.', '- 10 - prohibition prevented plaintiff from including one or more such separate counts alleging discrimination. At the very least, plaintiff at all relevant times had immediately available to her a cause of action under the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act of 1990, as to which no type of administrative exhaustion is a prerequisite. See G.L. 1956 chapter 112 of title 42.4', 'As the majority opinion correctly indicates, the defendant (the Public Defender’s Office) reacted to plaintiff’s Complaint in Nugent I by filing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In due course, after a hearing in open court, that motion was granted and a “Final Judgment” was issued.', 'The basis for the defendant’s Rule 12(c) motion and the Superior Court’s favorable reaction thereto was the fact that plaintiff lacked “standing” to seek vacation of the arbitrator’s award.5 It is very important to emphasize, however, that there would have been no similar impediment to plaintiff’s including one or more additional counts in her Complaint alleging 4', 'I am aware that, at the time that she filed the Complaint in Nugent I, plaintiff was not yet in possession of a Right to Sue Letter from the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights— the issuance of such a letter being a condition precedent to the commencement of a civil action under the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 5 of title 28. However, in addition to the fact that, at the time that she filed her Complaint in Nugent I, she was entirely free to immediately include a discrimination count under the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act, plaintiff could have thereafter sought leave to amend her Complaint in Nugent I so as to add a count under the Fair Employment Practices Act once a Right to Sue Letter was issued (as indeed it eventually was). In that regard, it should be noted that this Court has indicated that, “although leave to amend a pleading lies within the sound discretion of a trial justice,” Rule 15(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure “liberally permits amendment absent a showing of extreme prejudice.” Weybosset Hill Investments, LLC v. Rossi, 857 A.2d 231, 236 (R.I. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Medeiros v. Cornwall, 911 A.2d 251, 253 (R.I. 2006) (“[T]his court has consistently held that trial justices should liberally allow amendments to the pleadings.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). 5', 'The defendant’s Rule 12(c) motion contended that plaintiff lacked standing to seek judicial review of the arbitration award—in view of the fact that, since there was no evidence that the union had breached its duty of fair representation, only the union and not plaintiff was entitled to seek judicial review of the award.', '- 11 - discrimination in violation of one or more statutes. (There would have been no necessity for union involvement in the preparation and filing of such a claim. And, I repeat, plaintiff was represented at that time by her own personal attorney.)', 'It should go without saying that the Superior Court, a court of general jurisdiction, would have had subject matter jurisdiction over such discrimination counts. The fact that the only count then before the court was properly dismissed because of plaintiff’s failure to satisfy the threshold criterion of standing certainly does not mean that one or more additional counts alleging discrimination would have been dismissed on that basis; plaintiff certainly would have had standing to allege discrimination in her own name. But the fact is that plaintiff and her lawyer chose not to include any such count in the Complaint. And such choices should have consequences.', 'I believe that Nugent II merited dismissal on the basis of what I consider to be the fundamental jurisprudential principles that underlie the res judicata doctrine. It is true that the usual formulations of the doctrine of res judicata include a requirement that there have been a final judgment on the merits in the first case. See, e.g., In re Sherman, 565 A.2d 870, 872 (R.I. 1989) (“Res judicata serves as an absolute bar to a second cause of action where there exists identity of parties, identity of issues, and finality of judgment in an earlier action.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Glassie v. Doucette, 159 A.3d 88, 95 (R.I. 2017); Bossian, 991 A.2d at 1027. However, I am convinced that the “one bite of the apple” principle is necessarily part and parcel of the res judicata doctrine. See generally United States v. California & Oregon Land Co., 192 U.S. 355, 358 (1904) (Holmes, J.) (“[T]he whole tendency of our decisions is to require a plaintiff to try his whole cause of action and his whole case at one time.”). Accordingly, it is my view that, by choosing not to include in Nugent I such separate', '- 12 - counts as to which there could in due course have been a final judgment on the merits, plaintiff should not now be permitted to rely on the absence of such a final judgment so as to have another day in court.', 'Sound reasons of policy counsel against the same set of operative facts being the subject of repeated litigation in our courts. The following observation made by the late Justice Thomas Kelleher several decades ago remains as pertinent today as it was then:', '“Today, a trial judge is confronted with crowded dockets', 'and numerous litigants who wish to have their controversies', 'resolved. ‘Judge time’ now rates as a precious commodity. Res', 'judicata does not permit one the luxury of trying his case on the', 'installment plan.” Perez v. Pawtucket Redevelopment Agency, 111', 'R.I. 327, 336, 302 A.2d 785, 791 (1973).6', 'I also note that, although the trial justice dismissed Nugent II on the basis of the doctrine of res judicata, his application of that doctrine to this case was conceptually quite different from the res judicata reasoning that I think should govern this particular case. My simple but emphatic point in this dissent is that plaintiff had every chance to allege discrimination when she availed herself of the jurisdiction of the Superior Court by filing her Complaint in Nugent I. She and her attorney chose not to do so, and such choices should be outcome-determinative. I firmly believe that Nugent II merited dismissal on res judicata grounds due to plaintiff’s complete failure to have alleged employment discrimination in her Complaint in Nugent I, regardless of the fact that there was no final judgment on the merits in Nugent I. See Bossian, 991 A.2d at 1027 (“This Court has unequivocally held as follows: ‘Res judicata, or claim preclusion, prohibits the 6', 'See also Northern Trust Co. v.

30,"Christopher G. Rein : v. : ESS Group, Inc., et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court.', 'The plaintiff, Christopher G. Rein (Rein or plaintiff), appeals from a Superior Court order granting a motion to dismiss brought by the defendants, ESS Group, Inc. (ESS), Charles J. Natale, Jr. (Natale), and the Charles J. Natale, Jr. 2003 Trust u/d/t January 23, 2003, as amended (the Natale trust) (collectively defendants). This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and reverse in part the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Rein began working at ESS in 2007 as a senior consultant and senior project manager. Previously, he had worked at ESS’s predecessor, Environmental Science Services, Inc., for approximately thirteen years. On December 20, 2007, Rein, ESS, and Natale, the president and', '-1- chief executive officer of ESS, entered into a stockholder agreement that resulted in Rein owning 5,000 shares of ESS stock and the Natale trust owning 80,300 shares of ESS stock.', 'In his complaint, Rein alleged that in 2013 he became concerned about Natale’s use of ESS’s assets and funds. In December 2013, Natale informed Rein that ESS would not be giving employees payments pursuant to its incentive compensation plan because ESS had not met its annual revenue goal. Natale allegedly told Rein that certain employees would nevertheless receive an annual bonus outside of the incentive compensation plan. Rein asked to review the list of employees who would be receiving an annual bonus and the amount of said bonuses, but Natale refused to provide Rein with that information. In February 2014, Natale and Rein met and discussed the incentive compensation plan and bonuses. Rein alleged that, at this meeting, Natale accused Rein of not trusting him and told Rein that he could not review ESS’s financial documents because he was a minority shareholder. Subsequently, in mid-2014, Rein received a negative performance review from Natale, which Rein claimed was the first negative performance review of his career.', 'On December 11, 2014, Natale and Rein met to discuss matters related to ESS’s year- end. Thereafter, Natale gave Rein the minutes of the December 11, 2014 meeting, which Natale characterized as an ESS shareholder meeting. Rein alleged, however, that his December 11, 2014 meeting with Natale was not a shareholder meeting because it was not conducted pursuant to ESS’s corporate bylaws or the provision of the Rhode Island Business Corporation Act (BCA) pertaining to shareholder meetings, G.L. 1956 § 7-1.2-701.', 'Rein further claimed that the minutes falsely represented that certain topics were discussed and voted on at the purported shareholder meeting.', '-2-', 'At the end of December 2014, Rein sent a letter to ESS’s counsel requesting certain financial information pertaining to ESS, but counsel informed him that he could not legally provide Rein with the requested information because his request did not comply with state law. Rein alleged that he also asked defendants for permission to review ESS’s books and records, but was refused access to do so. Rein obtained counsel and filed a formal request to review ESS’s books and records, but he was again informed by ESS’s counsel that his request did not comply with the law.', 'On May 27, 2015, Rein was terminated from his position as senior vice president. Rein alleged, in his lawsuit, that he was terminated due to his complaints to his supervisors, including Natale, that defendants had violated state and municipal laws, and due to his refusal to violate the law or assist defendants in doing so.', 'After his termination, Rein initiated a shareholder derivative action against defendants in Delaware, where ESS is incorporated; however, the action was dismissed on July 27, 2015.', 'On October 23, 2015, Rein filed a two-count complaint in Superior Court in Rhode Island, wherein he alleged that: defendants had violated the Rhode Island Whistleblowers’ Protection Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 50 of title 28 (WPA), by discriminating against Rein “because he refused to violate or assist in violating state or local law and/or because [Rein] reported to his supervisors a violation of state or local law” (the WPA count or claim); and defendants violated the BCA by refusing to allow Rein to examine ESS’s books and records of accounts, minutes, and/or records of shareholders of ESS (the BCA count or claim). In response, defendants moved to dismiss the action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In support of their motion, defendants maintained that the WPA count should be dismissed because Rein did not identify a law that defendants had allegedly violated, as is necessary under', '-3- the WPA.', 'The defendants also argued for dismissal of the BCA count because ESS is incorporated in Delaware and, therefore, its internal affairs are governed by Delaware law, not Rhode Island law.', 'Rein objected to defendants’ motion to dismiss. He rejected defendants’ argument that he failed to set forth a law that defendants allegedly violated; Rein maintained that the complaint alleged that defendants’ conduct violated the BCA. Rein argued that, even if ESS was not subject to the BCA because the company is incorporated in Delaware, the WPA claim is nevertheless viable because the complaint also alleged that defendants made false representations in the minutes of the December 11, 2014 meeting, which Rein maintained amounted to a violation of the common law. With respect to the BCA count, Rein asserted that ESS is subject to the BCA because, pursuant to § 7-1.2-1402, a foreign corporation “is subject to the same duties, restrictions, penalties, and liabilities now or subsequently imposed upon a domestic corporation of like character.”', 'A hearing was held on April 5, 2016, before a justice of the Superior Court. After hearing the parties’ arguments, the hearing justice rendered his decision. He first discussed the BCA count and referenced § 7-1.2-1401, which provides, in part, that:', '“A foreign corporation may not be denied a certificate of authority', 'because the laws of the state or country under which the', 'corporation is organized governing its organization and internal', 'affairs differ from the laws of this state, and nothing contained in', 'this chapter authorizes this state to regulate the organization or', 'the internal affairs of the corporation.” Section 7-1.2-1401(a)', '(emphasis added). The hearing justice equated this language to the so-called “internal affairs doctrine,” although he noted that Rhode Island has not adopted the doctrine.', 'He cited to VantagePoint Venture Partners 1996 v. Examen, Inc., 871 A.2d 1108 (Del. 2005), in which the Supreme Court of', '-4- Delaware described the internal affairs doctrine as providing that “only one state should have the authority to regulate a corporation’s internal affairs—the state of incorporation.” VantagePoint Venture Partners 1996, 871 A.2d at 1112. Further, the hearing justice noted that the BCA provisions that Rein alleged defendants violated all use the term “corporation,” not “foreign corporation,” and that the BCA defines the term “corporation” to exclude foreign corporations. See § 7-1.2-106(3). The hearing justice concluded that “since the definitions exclude foreign corporations, it’s clear that the Internal Corporate Affairs Doctrine applies and the allegations, the breach of the [BCA], even taken as true, cannot be violations of the act as a matter of law * * *.” Accordingly, he dismissed the BCA count.', 'The hearing justice then discussed the WPA count and found that Rein’s complaint did not “artfully articulate” which statute defendants had allegedly violated. He deemed Rein’s argument that Natale’s misrepresentation that there had been a shareholder meeting constituted fraud that violated the common law to be an erroneous interpretation of the WPA. The hearing justice stated, “[W]e don’t even know if it’s a violation, but the alleged violation, if it was a violation, would violate the Delaware Business Corporations Act because Rhode Island doesn’t regulate the internal affairs of the corporation * * *.”', 'Accordingly, the hearing justice determined that Rein’s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, and he dismissed the action. An order granting defendants’ motion to dismiss and dismissing Rein’s complaint was entered on April 22, 2016. On May 11, 2016, Rein appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“In reviewing the grant of a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), this Court applies the same standard as the hearing justice.” Goddard v. APG Security-RI, LLC, 134 A.3d', '-5- 173, 175 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Ho-Rath v. Rhode Island Hospital, 115 A.3d 938, 942 (R.I. 2015)). In conducting our review, we “assume[] the allegations contained in the complaint to be true and view[] the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.” Id. (quoting Ho-Rath, 115 A.3d at 942). The granting of a motion to dismiss is proper “when it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief from the defendant under any set of facts that could be proven in support of the plaintiff’s claim.” Id. (quoting Ho-Rath, 115 A.3d at 942).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Rein maintains that the hearing justice erred in granting defendants’ motion to dismiss after finding that Rein’s complaint failed to state a claim under the WPA and that ESS is not subject to the BCA because it is incorporated in Delaware. Because the WPA count relies, in part, on defendants’ alleged violations of the BCA, we will first address the BCA count.', 'A', 'The BCA Count', 'Rein asserts that defendants violated two provisions of the BCA: Section 7-1.2-701, by improperly conducting the shareholder meeting, and § 7-1.2-1502, by not allowing Rein to examine ESS’s financial records. The hearing justice dismissed the BCA count after finding that defendants’ conduct did not violate the BCA because Rhode Island has no authority to regulate the internal affairs of a foreign corporation, such as ESS, and the provisions that defendants allegedly violated, §§ 7-1.2-701 and 7-1.2-1502, do not apply to defendants because the provisions use the term “corporation,” not “foreign corporation.” Although it is uncontested that ESS is a foreign corporation, Rein argues that ESS is nevertheless subject to the BCA because § 7-1.2-1402 provides that “[a] foreign corporation which has received a certificate of authority', '-6- under this chapter * * * except as otherwise provided in this chapter, is subject to the same duties, restrictions, penalties, and liabilities now or subsequently imposed upon a domestic corporation of like character.”', 'Notably, § 7-1.2-1401(a), which governs the admission of foreign corporations to transact business in Rhode Island, provides that “nothing contained in this chapter authorizes this state to regulate the organization or the internal affairs of the corporation.” Therefore, we note, as the hearing justice did, that although § 7-1.2-1402 states that a foreign corporation is subject to the same duties as domestic corporations “except as otherwise provided[,]” § 7-1.2-1401(a) expressly provides that Rhode Island is not authorized to regulate the internal affairs of a foreign corporation. The hearing justice likened the language of § 7-1.2-1401(a) that restricts Rhode Island from regulating the internal affairs of a foreign corporation to the internal affairs doctrine, although he noted that Rhode Island has not formally adopted the doctrine.', 'It is therefore necessary to determine whether defendants’ challenged conduct constitutes “internal affairs” as used in § 7-1.2-1401(a). Because neither the BCA nor Rhode Island caselaw have defined “internal affairs” or discussed the internal affairs doctrine, it is instructive to refer to Delaware’s jurisprudence. See Bove v. Community Hotel Corp. of Newport, Rhode Island, 105 R.I. 36, 41-42, 249 A.2d 89, 93 (1969) (referring to Delaware’s body of corporate law where Rhode Island law had not addressed the issue because Delaware “is important as a state of incorporation, and the decisions of its courts on the precise problem * * * are generally considered to be the leading ones in the field”). As noted above, the Supreme Court of Delaware has described the internal affairs doctrine as “a long-standing choice of law principle which recognizes that only one state should have the authority to regulate a corporation’s internal', '-7- affairs—the state of incorporation.”1 VantagePoint Venture Partners 1996, 871 A.2d at 1112. Under Delaware law, “[t]he term ‘internal affairs’ encompasses ‘those matters that pertain to the relationships among or between the corporation and its officers, directors, and shareholders.’” Sagarra Inversiones, S.L. v. Cementos Portland Valderrivas, S.A., 34 A.3d 1074, 1082 (Del. 2011) (quoting VantagePoint Venture Partners 1996, 871 A.2d at 1113).', 'Guided by the above-mentioned definition of “internal affairs,” we are convinced, as was the hearing justice, that defendants’ alleged violations of the BCA qualify as “internal affairs,” which Rhode Island is unauthorized to regulate. Specifically, the BCA provisions that Rein alleged defendants violated are § 7-1.2-701,2 which governs how shareholder meetings are to be 1', 'The United States Supreme Court recognized the internal affairs doctrine in CTS Corporation v. Dynamics Corporation of America, 481 U.S. 69 (1987), stating:', '“This beneficial free market system depends at its core upon the', 'fact that a corporation—except in the rarest situations—is', 'organized under, and governed by, the law of a single jurisdiction,', 'traditionally the corporate law of the State of its incorporation.', '“***', '“It thus is an accepted part of the business landscape in this', 'country for States to create corporations, to prescribe their powers,', 'and to define the rights that are acquired by purchasing their', 'shares.” CTS Corporation, 481 U.S. at 90, 91. 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 7-1.2-701 provides, in relevant part:', '“(b) Special meetings of the shareholders may be called by the', 'board of directors, or by a person or persons that may be', 'authorized by the articles of incorporation or by the bylaws.', '“(c) Notice of any meeting of shareholders must be delivered not', 'less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of', 'the meeting to each shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting in', 'the manner prescribed by § 7-1.2-702.”', '-8- conducted, and § 7-1.2-1502,3 which regulates a corporation’s maintenance of its books and records and provides shareholders and others with a right to examine said records. This Court is of the opinion that the manner in which a corporation conducts its shareholders meetings, § 7- 1.2-701, and the processes by which shareholders and others exercise their right to review a corporation’s books and records, § 7-1.2-1502, qualify as “matters that pertain to the relationships among or between the corporation and its officers, directors, and shareholders.” Sagarra Inversiones, S.L., 34 A.3d at 1082. Therefore, we conclude that ESS’s alleged BCA violations are “internal affairs” that Rhode Island has no authority to regulate.', 'This Court is further convinced that ESS’s alleged violations of §§ 7-1.2-701 and 7-1.2- 1502 are internal affairs when we look to the language of the two provisions. In particular, both provisions use the term “corporation”—not “foreign corporation.”', 'The BCA defines a “corporation” or “domestic corporation” as “a corporation for profit subject to the provisions of this chapter, except a foreign corporation.” Section 7-1.2-106(3) (emphasis added). The BCA defines “foreign corporation” as “a corporation for profit organized under laws other than the 3', 'Section 7-1.2-1502 provides, in pertinent part:', '“(b) Any director, shareholder or holder of voting trust certificates', 'for shares of a corporation, upon written demand stating the', 'purpose for the demand, has the right to examine, in person, or by', 'agent or attorney, at any reasonable time or times, for any proper', 'purpose, its relevant books and records of account, minutes, and', 'record of shareholders and to make extracts from those books and', 'records of account, minutes, and record of shareholders.', '“***', '“***', '“(e) Upon the written request of any director, shareholder or holder', 'of voting trust certificates for shares of a corporation, the', 'corporation shall mail to the director, shareholder or holder of', 'voting trust certificates its most recent financial statements', 'showing in reasonable detail its assets and liabilities and the results', 'of its operations.”', '-9- laws of this state for a purpose or purposes for which a corporation may be organized under this chapter.” Section 7-1.2-106(8).', '“[W]hen the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, we give the words their plain and ordinary meaning.” Western Reserve Life Assurance Co. of Ohio v. ADM Associates, LLC, 116 A.3d 794, 798 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Hough v. McKiernan, 108 A.3d 1030, 1035 (R.I. 2015)). We conclude that the provisions’ use of the term “corporation”—not “foreign corporation”— reveals that it would be inapposite for §§ 7-1.2-701 and 7-1.2-1502 to apply to foreign corporations, because these provisions relate to internal affairs that Rhode Island does not have the authority to regulate. See § 7-1.2-1401(a). Accordingly, Rein is not entitled to relief under the BCA count, and we affirm the hearing justice’s order granting defendants’ motion to dismiss this count.', 'B', 'The WPA Count', 'We next turn to Rein’s WPA count. On appeal, Rein maintains that the hearing justice erred in finding that Rein failed to assert a WPA claim premised on defendants’ alleged BCA violations because ESS is not subject to the BCA. Specifically, Rein asserts that even if ESS is not subject to the BCA, the WPA count is nevertheless viable because the complaint alleged that defendants violated the common law by making false representations in the minutes of the December 11, 2014 meeting.4 He also maintains that, under the WPA, he is not required to establish an actual violation of a law, only that he reasonably believed that a violation occurred; he maintains that the complaint demonstrates that he reasonably believed that defendants were subject to the BCA and violated it. 4', 'Rein maintains that this conduct constitutes “fraud, intentional or negligent misrepresentation, deceit[.]”', '- 10 -', 'The WPA, in pertinent part, prohibits an employer from discharging, threatening, or otherwise discriminating against an employee:', '“(3) Because an employee refuses to violate or assist in', 'violating federal, state or local law, rule or regulation, or', '“(4) Because the employee reports verbally or in writing to', 'the employer or to the employee’s supervisor a violation,', 'which the employee knows or reasonably believes has', 'occurred or is about to occur, of a law or regulation or rule', 'promulgated under the laws of this state, a political', 'subdivision of this state, or the United States * * *.”', 'Section 28-50-3. We share the opinion of the hearing justice that the complaint did not “artfully articulate” which law Rein alleged defendants had violated in support of his WPA claim. However, artistry aside, a motion to dismiss should be granted only “when it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief from the defendant under any set of facts that could be proven in support of the plaintiff’s claim.” Goddard, 134 A.3d at 175 (quoting Ho-Rath, 115 A.3d at 942). Here, viewing the allegations pled in the complaint as true, this Court cannot conclude that Rein would not be entitled to relief under the WPA count. From our review of the four corners of the complaint, Rein sufficiently alleged that defendants violated the BCA by refusing to allow him to review ESS’s records and by failing to conduct the shareholders meeting in accordance with the BCA. The complaint also adequately alleged that Rein “complain[ed] to his supervisors, including, but not limited to, [d]efendant Natale, of violations of state and/or municipal laws and/or regulations by the [d]efendants,” and, as a result, “was terminated from his position on May 27, 2015.”', 'Although we hold that defendants are not subject to the BCA, Rein maintains that for there to be a viable claim under the WPA, he need not prove that an actual violation of a law, such as the BCA, occurred, only that he reasonably believed that a violation occurred. See § 28-', '- 11 - 50-3 (providing whistleblowers’ protection to an employee who reports a violation, “which the employee knows or reasonably believes has occurred or is about to occur”) (emphasis added). Assuming the facts contained in Rein’s complaint to be true and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Rein, Goddard, 134 A.3d at 175, his belief that defendants were subject to the BCA may be found by a factfinder to have been reasonable because ESS was authorized to conduct business in Rhode Island, ESS maintained its principal place of business in Rhode Island, and Natale and Rein worked in Rhode Island. Such a determination, however, is more appropriately assigned to a jury.', 'The defendants urge this Court to look to the complaint Rein had previously filed in Delaware as evidence of “Rein’s knowledge that Delaware corporate law governed his relationship as a shareholder with ESS and that he had no reasonable belief concerning a violation of Rhode Island or federal law.” The fact that, after consulting with counsel, Rein filed suit in Delaware does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that he did not reasonably believe that the defendants had violated Rhode Island law. Consequently, we conclude that Rein’s complaint sufficiently pleads a WPA claim: Rein reasonably believed that the defendants violated the BCA, Rein complained to his supervisors of the alleged violations, and he was subsequently terminated, which Rein alleged was causally related to his whistleblowing conduct. For the above reasons, we reverse the decision of the hearing justice to dismiss the WPA count set forth in Rein’s complaint.', '- 12 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order in so far as it dismissed the BCA count of Rein’s complaint, and we reverse the order in so far as it dismissed the WPA count.

31,George T. Hawes : v. : Daniel P. Reilly. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The plaintiff, George T. Hawes, appeals from a May 4, 2015 final judgment entered in the Newport County Superior Court. That judgment was entered to reflect an April 27, 2015 written decision in which the hearing justice quashed an execution previously issued by the Rhode Island Superior Court on a State of Utah District Court judgment and dismissed the plaintiff’s petition to enforce the Utah judgment, on the grounds that Utah did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant, Daniel P. Reilly.1 On appeal, the plaintiff contends that the hearing justice erred in refusing to grant full faith and credit to the order of the Utah District Court with respect to personal jurisdiction. He further avers that the hearing justice erred in determining that Utah did not have personal jurisdiction over Daniel. Lastly, he posits that Daniel “forfeited the defense of lack of personal jurisdiction.”', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Due to the fact that Daniel P. Reilly, his sister Shannon Reilly, and their father William Reilly, are all involved in this case in varying ways, we refer to them by their first names for clarity. In so doing, we intend no disrespect.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of the case before this Court are somewhat complicated but are not materially in dispute. In relating those facts in this opinion, we rely primarily on the March 16, 2010 complaint filed in state court in Utah, the April 27, 2015 decision of the Rhode Island Superior Court in the instant case, and other documents in the record.', 'A company named InnerLight Holdings, Inc. (InnerLight), with its principal place of business in Utah, hired William Reilly (Daniel’s father) to act as their corporate counsel for the purpose of obtaining authorization from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to publicly trade InnerLight stock. Ultimately, however, InnerLight did not receive final authorization from the SEC to trade its shares publicly.', 'In its March 16, 2010 First Amended Complaint filed in the State of Utah District Court, InnerLight represented that it had agreed to pay William with 650,000 shares of InnerLight stock and had agreed to let him hold an additional 600,000 shares, to be transferred after InnerLight became a public company. InnerLight further alleged that William, in the process of acting as InnerLight’s corporate counsel, transferred 700,000 shares without permission through several corporate entities—Ashworth Development, LLC (Ashworth); Doylestown Partners, Inc. (Doylestown); Shamrock Equities, Inc. (Shamrock); and Beachview Associates, Inc. (Beachview) (collectively, the corporate entities). Of significance is the fact that, according to his affidavit filed in Rhode Island Superior Court, Daniel was a minority shareholder in Doylestown, Shamrock, and Beachview, as well as being the secretary of Doylestown and', '-2- Beachview and the Vice President of Shamrock.2 Mr. Hawes ultimately purchased shares of InnerLight stock that had purportedly been transferred by William to the corporate entities. Mr. Hawes also purchased warrants.3 InnerLight then rescinded the stock offerings, but Mr. Hawes did not receive a refund for the shares he had purchased.', 'On March 16, 2010, InnerLight filed its previously mentioned First Amended Complaint in state court in Utah against William, Daniel, Shannon, the corporate entities, Mr. Hawes, and other investors who had purchased shares of InnerLight stock.4 Thereafter, Mr. Hawes answered the complaint. Included in his answer was a cross-claim against William, Daniel, Shannon, and the corporate entities, as well as other parties.5 On June 29, 2010, Daniel, Shannon, and the corporate entities filed a motion to dismiss InnerLight’s First Amended Complaint in state court in Utah on the ground that Utah did not have personal jurisdiction over them;6 in addition, both sides filed memoranda of law with respect to that motion. Daniel’s Utah counsel subsequently withdrew, and neither Daniel nor counsel representing him were present at the hearing on the motion to dismiss. The Utah District Court then denied the motion to dismiss in a brief order 2', 'Daniel’s sister, Shannon Reilly, was also involved in the corporate entities, but her relation to those entities is not relevant to the case before this Court. 3', 'A warrant in this context is defined as “[a]n option to buy stock at a specified price from an issuing company.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1953 (5th ed. 2011). 4', 'For the purposes of this case, we are focused on the events which unfolded in state court in Utah as they pertain to Daniel and Mr. Hawes. 5', 'The cross-claim contained multiple counts. 6', 'A notice of removal to federal District Court had been filed in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, Central Division, by William, Daniel, Shannon, and the corporate entities on April 19, 2010.

Daniel filed his motion to dismiss in federal court initially and then in state court on June 29, 2010, after the case was remanded to state court. In the end, only the Utah state court ruled on the motion to dismiss.', '-3- which stated that “Innerlight made a prima facie showing by pleading sufficient facts to establish that this Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over each of the non-resident Defendants.” They then continued not to appear in the state court, and they did not engage new counsel. Accordingly, on May 11, 2012, an amended default judgment on Mr. Hawes’s cross-claim was entered against Daniel, William, Shannon, and the corporate entities in the amount of $775,000, plus “reasonable expenses, including attorney’s fees * * *.”', 'On April 21, 2014, Mr. Hawes filed a “Petition to Enforce a Foreign Judgment” in the Rhode Island Superior Court, seeking enforcement in this jurisdiction of the default judgment from Utah against Daniel.', 'On June 20, 2014, an execution was issued in the amount of $971,351.78. On October 30, 2014, Daniel filed a motion to quash the execution and dismiss the petition for lack of personal jurisdiction in the foreign action.', 'The hearing justice, after considering the briefings of the parties and after hearing argument, issued a written decision on April 27, 2015. In his written decision, the hearing justice first addressed whether or not he needed to give full faith and credit to the order of the state court in Utah that denied Daniel’s motion to dismiss. After a thorough and commendable discussion of the facts and applicable precedent, the hearing justice determined that he would not be obligated to give full faith and credit to the denial of the motion to dismiss because that order was “vague” and did not include any “underlying reasoning.” He added that “[i]n this case, it does not seem that a final determination of personal jurisdiction had [been] reached;” and he expressly noted that “[t]he order only states a prima facie showing of personal jurisdiction ha[d] been made.” The hearing justice then reviewed Daniel’s contacts with Utah and the applicable Utah law and came to the conclusion that Utah did not have personal jurisdiction over Daniel.', '-4- For that reason, he quashed the execution and dismissed Mr. Hawes’s petition.

In our opinion, those reasons are not sufficient to establish a forfeiture of Daniel’s right to contest personal jurisdiction.

Although his skills as a firefighter are much less reported, it is known that during the Korean War his plane burst into flames during a thirty-five-plane raid, led by future astronaut and United States Senator John Glenn, in North Korea on February 16, 1953.

For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On June 29, 2010, Bradford Dyeing Association transferred the property, which is also known as the Bradford Industrial Park, to BPF by quitclaim deed. Historically, fire protection services to the village of Bradford have been provided by the Bradford Fire District. Since 2013, however, the Bradford Fire District has contracted with Dunn’s Corners to assume its firefighting responsibilities. Also named as a defendant in this case is Westerly Ambulance Corps (Westerly Ambulance), which provides a dispatching service to a number of fire districts in Washington County, including Dunn’s Corners.2', 'Westerly Ambulance and Dunn’s Corners are parties to a contract that requires Westerly Ambulance to render dispatching services for Dunn’s Corners. Their agreement provides that Westerly Ambulance will dispatch Dunn’s Corners to sites and locations situated within the Bradford Fire District.', 'Apparently in response to a number of false fire alarms emanating from the property, Dunn’s Corners advised BPF that the property was not technically located within the geographical confines of either Dunn’s Corners or the Bradford Fire District. According to BPF, 2', 'We pause to note that fire districts are a cherished, if not problematic, vestige of Rhode Island history. Tracing their origins largely to thriving mill villages, there were 42 fire districts in the state, ranging in size from 0.1 to 58 square miles as of 2004 and servicing populations from approximately 180 to 30,000 people. Of the 42 districts, only 33 actually fight fires. See Department of Revenue, Division of Municipal Finance, Report on the Rhode Island Fire Districts Based on Annual Fire District Survey 2013 (released March 2014).', '-2- Dunn’s Corners also submitted invoices for past services rendered and deactivated the local alarm systems on the property.', 'Notwithstanding Dunn’s Corners’ protestations, however, Westerly Ambulance continued to dispatch Dunn’s Corners in response to fire alarms at the property. Of further note, by correspondence dated May 21, 2014, BPF asked to join the Bradford Fire District; however, its request was denied by the fire district at a meeting on June 19, 2014.', 'In December 2015, Dunn’s Corners filed a complaint against Westerly Ambulance, BPF, and Bradford Industrial Park. Count 1 sought to enjoin Westerly Ambulance from dispatching Dunn’s Corners in response to calls at the property. Count 2 asked for a declaratory judgment with respect to the obligations of the parties to the contract between Westerly Ambulance and Dunn’s Corners. Count 3 sought a declaration that Dunn’s Corners is not obligated to provide services to the property. Counts 4, 5, and 6 each sought the payment of $20,000 from BPF and the Bradford Industrial Park, premised on various equitable and legal theories. On February 17, 2017, Dunn’s Corners filed a motion for summary judgment as to count 3, arguing that the property was not located within either Dunn’s Corners or the Bradford Fire District and that it had no obligation to provide the property with fire protection services.', 'A hearing on Dunn’s Corners’ motion for summary judgment was held on April 17, 2017. The thrust of BPF’s objections to the motion was that declaratory relief was inappropriate because the Bradford Fire District had not been made a party to the case and that BPF was not sure whether the property was in the Bradford Fire District because “the Bradford Fire District has been putting out fires there for 70 years * * *.” The hearing justice, however, granted the motion for summary judgment, relying primarily on: (1) an affidavit of the moderator of the Bradford Fire District stating that the property “is not now, nor has it ever been, contained within', '-3- the boundaries or jurisdiction of The Bradford Fire District”; and (2) a special legislative enactment by the General Assembly amending the charter of the Bradford Fire District, entitled “An Act to Adjust and Designate the Jurisdictional Boundaries of Westerly Fire District, Dunns Corners Fire District, and Bradford Fire District[,]” which specifically excepted from a metes and bounds description of the Bradford Fire District “all those parcels of land designated and described as presently belonging to the Bradford Dyeing Association, Inc.” Rhode Island Acts and Resolves 57-66, 65 (1980). Shortly thereafter, an order entered granting Dunn’s Corners’ motion for summary judgment on count 3 of its complaint, declaring that Dunn’s Corners “shall have no obligation to render any services, fire fighting, rescue or otherwise to [the property] based on the fact that the subject property lies outside of the Bradford Fire District.” A judgment entered, and BPF appealed to this Court.', 'On appeal, BPF raises two arguments in its prebriefing statement submitted pursuant to Article I, Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, without further elucidation: (1) “[w]hether the Superior Court had subject matter jurisdiction over [count 3], where the declaratory judgment neither terminated all controversies nor bound all entities having an interest in the dispute”; and (2) “[w]hether there is a genuine issue of material fact that the BPF property is in the Bradford Fire District.”', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“A challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction questions the very power of the court to hear the case.” In re New England Gas Co., 842 A.2d 545, 553 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Pine v.

(quoting Daniels, 64 A.3d at 304). Furthermore, “the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.” Id.

(quoting Lavoie v. North East Knitting, Inc., 918 A.2d 225, 228 (R.I. 2007)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'At the outset, we note that it is clear beyond peradventure that the Superior Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over actions seeking declaratory relief. “The Superior Court of Rhode Island is a trial court of general jurisdiction. It is granted subject-matter jurisdiction over all cases unless that jurisdiction has been conferred by statute upon another tribunal.” Chase v. Bouchard, 671 A.2d 794, 796 (R.I. 1996). Specifically, the Superior Court has been granted, “except as otherwise provided by law, * * * exclusive original jurisdiction of suits and', '-5- proceedings of an equitable character * * *.” General Laws 1956 § 8-2-13.3 The appropriate question, therefore, is whether it was error for the court to assert its jurisdiction in the absence of an indispensable party. Section 9-30-11 of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act provides, in part: “When declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.” We have held “that this provision is mandatory and that failure to join all persons who have an interest that would be affected by the declaration ordinarily is fatal to an action.” Thompson v. Town Council of Westerly, 487 A.2d 498, 499 (R.I. 1985).', 'At the summary-judgment hearing in Superior Court, BPF argued that a declaratory judgment should not be issued because the Bradford Fire District was not a party to the action. At oral argument before this Court, however, BPF maintained that the Town of Westerly was the indispensable party. As this latter contention was not presented to the hearing justice, it has been waived. See State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 646 (R.I. 2006). With respect to BPF’s argument concerning Dunn’s Corners’ failure to join the Bradford Fire District in this case, we are of the opinion that it lacks merit. Dunn’s Corners has a contractual obligation to assume all of the Bradford Fire District’s responsibilities to provide fire protection services. Certainly, Dunn’s 3', '“The word ‘jurisdiction’ (jus dicere) is a term of large and comprehensive import,', 'and embraces every kind of judicial action upon the subject-matter * * *.

The very', 'word in its origin imports as much. It is derived from juris and dico—I speak by', 'the law—and that sentence ought to be inscribed in living light on every tribunal', 'of criminal power. It is the right of administering justice through the laws by the', 'means which the law has provided for that purpose.” Sardonis v.

In its statement of the case filed pursuant to Rule 12A, BPF simply states that the “declaratory judgment neither terminated all controversies nor bound all entities having an interest in the dispute.” We have consistently held that “[s]imply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.” Giddings v. Arpin, 160 A.3d 314, 316 (R.I. 2017) (mem.) (quoting Giammarco v. Giammarco, 151 A.3d 1220, 1222 (R.I. 2017)).', 'With respect to BPF’s second argument on appeal—that there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the property is located within the Bradford Fire District—it appears as though it conceded at oral argument that the property is not currently situated within any fire district. Even if BPF were not willing to make such a concession, it is difficult to conceive of a more difficult obstacle to overcome than a special legislative act by the General Assembly stating that the property is specifically excluded from the Bradford Fire District. See R.I. Acts and Resolves 65 (1980). Moreover, the hearing justice had before him an unrebutted affidavit of the moderator of the Bradford Fire District avowing not only that the property had never been a part of the fire district, but also that BPF had affirmatively requested to become a part of the fire district and had been rejected. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the hearing justice did not err and that summary judgment was sagaciously granted.', 'Any relief to BPF would more appropriately be achieved through legislation or negotiation.', '-7-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Some other specific objections were offered by certain groups of objectors. Specifically, a number of retirees contended that the settlement’s reduction of their COLA would drastically affect their financial situations. In addition, Woonsocket police retirees in particular argued that the settlement was unfair because active police members were continuing to pursue their claims, and, if they were successful, the retirement fund would be diminished, making it less likely that the retirees would receive their promised COLA.

On cross-examination, Walsh acknowledged that, under the terms of the settlement agreement, retiree members would not receive “the future earnings of COLA[]s.”', 'Roger P. Boudreau also testified as a class representative of the retiree subclass and the then-president of RIPERC and AFT/R. Boudreau explained that RIPERC filed its own lawsuit', '10 and had sustained more than $400,000 in legal fees at the time of the hearing. He also described the efforts the organization made to notify its more than 5,000 members that the lawsuit was being filed, including publishing newspaper advertisements. With respect to the 2015 settlement discussions, Boudreau testified that his organization had concerns about succeeding at a jury trial with such a high burden of proof, which affected RIPERC’s choice to join in the settlement agreement of March 2015.', 'Boudreau highlighted what he perceived as the benefits of the 2015 settlement, which he said were greater than the first proposed settlement. He also testified that the vote, which recommended presenting the settlement to their members by the leadership groups of the RIPERC organizations, was “virtually unanimous.” According to Boudreau, RIPERC held a meeting to conduct an in-person vote on the settlement, which passed with about a seventy-five percent approval by the approximately 2,500 members who attended. On cross-examination, Boudreau testified that the 2,500 members who voted were out of a group of 27,000 retirees who would be affected by the settlement.', 'Mark A. Dingley also testified in his capacity as special counsel for the Governor.7 He testified regarding the history of the legislative amendments to the pension system, describing the “underfunded” pension plans in 2011, when the state’s “contribution levels were practically doubling.” Dingley also explained that, while prior to RIRSA’s enactment the state’s “unfunded liability was $7.3 billion[,]” after its enactment, the liability was reduced to $4.286 billion. He also agreed that the 2015 settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate. Dingley was also extensively cross-examined by counsel and by class members over three hearing days. 7', 'Prior to his role as special counsel for Governor Gina Raimondo, Dingley served as the chief of staff and general counsel for Treasurer Frank Caprio, and then he was the general counsel and deputy treasurer for Raimondo when she was treasurer.', '11', 'Next, Stephen Alfred, the town manager for South Kingstown and a class representative for the municipal defendants, testified. He stated that he was in favor of the settlement because, if the Union plaintiffs were to succeed at trial, “cities and towns would not be able to deal with the type of pension payments that would be required * * *.” He also testified that, as of the date of the hearing, no municipality had objected to the settlement.', 'Patrick Marr, the deputy treasurer and chief operating officer from the Office of the General Treasurer, also testified. He explained that he assisted in coordinating the notification of the settlement to class members through mail, newspaper advertisements, and postings to the retirement website. He pointed out that the notices outlined the method by which class members could object to the settlement.', 'After the witnesses testified, the trial justice heard from class members who had timely requested to address the court.

Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.S. 156, 177 (1974). The Clifford plaintiffs contend that they should not have been forced into a plaintiff subclass because, as retirees, they are differently situated than many of the other Union plaintiffs. In response, the state defendants counter that the Clifford plaintiffs’ classification as retirees was accounted for by the subclass of retirees.9 Further, the state defendants emphasize that the fact that class members do not agree with the settlement is insufficient to exclude them from the class, and does not automatically mean they will not be adequately represented.', 'In a slightly more nuanced argument, the Retiree plaintiffs aver that the trial justice should not have included them in a class for settlement purposes because they were not involved in the underlying litigation.

First, the trial justice found that the numerosity factor was satisfied because the proposed class contained more than 60,000 people and defendants included “113 municipal entities which participate in MERS[.]”', 'Next, the trial justice considered whether there were questions of law or fact common to the class. She determined that all Union plaintiffs made constitutional challenges to the 2009 and 2010 Acts and to RIRSA, including allegations that the legislation violated the Contract, Takings, and Due Process Clauses of the Rhode Island Constitution. The trial justice found that all Union plaintiffs were either active or retired employees of municipalities or the state, and that all their claims were based upon the contention that RIRSA impaired their contractual rights to retirement benefits. Additionally, the trial justice concluded that all the state and municipal defendants also shared common questions of law and fact, and that they shared the same defenses to plaintiffs’ claims.', 'With respect to the third requirement of Rule 23(a)—typicality—the trial justice found that the claims of the class representatives were typical of the claims of the whole class because the proposed representatives were “either current or former state employees, public school', '17 teachers, or municipal employees” who were either members of the state or municipal retirement systems or already receiving pension benefits from those systems.', 'Moreover, the trial justice found that the legal theories and evidence used by the representatives would be the same for the other class members. She also found that the defenses of the defendants’ representatives were typical of those of the whole. Finally, the trial justice determined that there was adequate representation, based on her findings that the attorneys were qualified and experienced and that no conflicts existed between the class representatives and the other class members.', 'Having found that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) were met, the trial justice next analyzed whether the class could be certified under any of the three methods provided for in Rule 23(b). The trial justice concluded that both the plaintiff class and the defendant class qualified to be certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2). With respect to the Union plaintiffs’ claims, the trial justice found that they all challenged the state defendants’ enactment of RIRSA, which affected all Union plaintiffs’ entitlement to retirement benefits. Moreover, the trial justice highlighted that the claims of the Union plaintiffs were equitable in nature—they sought “the restoration of their retirement benefits prior to the passage of the 2009 and 2010 Acts and the RIRSA.” She also found that all defendants would be affected because all of the municipalities involved participated in MERS, indicating that the outcome of the settlement would affect the funding requirements for all defendant class members.', 'In her June 9, 2015 decision, the trial justice revisited the certification issue, and she reaffirmed the certification of the settlement classes. In doing so, the trial justice scrutinized a number of factors in determining whether there was “adequate protection for absent class members[.]” She recognized the need to generally apply a higher scrutiny to class-action', '18 settlements. Still, she highlighted that this case did not present any danger of collusion between opposing counsel, there had been extensive discovery in the case, and the settlement had been overseen by a special master chosen by the court. The trial justice also analyzed whether the Union plaintiffs’ attorneys were qualified and whether there were any conflicts of interest between the class representatives and the class members, concluding that the attorneys were well qualified and that no conflicts existed.', 'Finally, the trial justice found that the class members received adequate notice in accordance with Rule 23(e). She determined that the notice informed the class members of the action, summarized the essential terms of the settlement agreement, and described how members could object to the settlement terms by appearing at the fairness hearing. Moreover, she noted that the bulk of the objections to the settlement agreement had to do with its fairness, rather than lack of notice.', 'At the outset, we recognize that the review of class actions for settlement purposes requires heightened review. See Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, 620 (1997) (“[U]ndiluted, even heightened, attention in the settlement context * * * is of vital importance, for a court asked to certify a settlement class will lack the opportunity, present when a case is litigated, to adjust the class, informed by the proceedings as they unfold.”). We keep this in mind as we review the trial justice’s decision regarding the class certification.', 'a', 'Rule 23(a)', 'With respect to the Rule 23(a) analysis, neither group of plaintiffs before us appears to quarrel with the numerosity requirement. As such, we proceed to determine whether the trial justice abused her discretion in finding that the remaining prerequisites were met. The Clifford', '19 plaintiffs’ claims were the same as the Union plaintiffs: that RIRSA’s elimination of the COLAs amounted to a breach of contract, was in violation of the Contract, Takings, and Due Process Clauses, and constituted conversion and unjust enrichment. The second prerequisite of Rule 23(a) has been described to require that the commonality “be of such a nature that it is capable of classwide resolution—which means that determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an issue that is central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011). Nevertheless, in order to comply with Rule 23(a)(2), “even a single common question will do.” Id. at 359 (internal quotations and alterations omitted).', 'Here, all Union plaintiffs certainly have a single question in common—whether the enactment of RIRSA amounted to a violation of the rights afforded by the Rhode Island Constitution. In consideration of the Clifford plaintiffs’ claims for different damages, “[t]he need for individual damages calculations * * * does not diminish the appropriateness of class action certification where common questions as to liability predominate.” DeCesare, 852 A.2d at 488 (quoting Seidman v. American Mobile Systems, Inc., 157 F.R.D. 354, 366 (E.D. Pa. 1994)). Similarly, the Retiree plaintiffs’ contention that outside litigation might affect the ability of their respective municipalities to afford their pension benefits in the future is not the proper inquiry for purposes of class certification. Indeed, whether the damages to individual plaintiffs differed among categories of active employees and retirees does not affect a determination under Rule 23(a)(2). See id. Consequently, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in ruling that there were factual and legal questions common to the entire class.', 'Turning to the third requirement, we are also satisfied that the claims of the class representatives are typical of the claims of the entire class. “When it is alleged that the same unlawful conduct was directed at or affected both the named plaintiff and the class sought to be', '20 represented, the typicality requirement is usually met irrespective of minor variations in the fact patterns underlying individual claims.” Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 936-37 (2d Cir. 1993). The trial justice appointed class representatives specifically for each of the subclasses, including the retiree subclass, assuring that all Union plaintiffs were represented by individuals who had alleged the same constitutional challenges to RIRSA as they had alleged. See id.', 'In addition, we conclude that the trial justice did not err in finding that the fourth requirement was met. “Adequate representation depends on two factors: (1) the plaintiff[s’] attorney[s] must be qualified, experienced, and generally able to conduct the proposed litigation; and (2) the plaintiff[s] must not have interests antagonistic to those of the class.” Pennsylvania Dental Association v. Medical Service Association of Pennsylvania, 745 F.2d 248, 262-63 (3d Cir. 1984). Here, the trial justice engaged in a lengthy inquiry into the attorneys’ qualifications, experience with labor law, and ability to represent the retiree subclasses. The state defendants note that the testimony at the fairness hearing demonstrated that the Clifford plaintiffs and the Retiree plaintiffs were adequately represented because the settlement addressed the concerns of retirees who were older than seventy years of age.11 The Clifford plaintiffs’ dissatisfaction with the settlement and the way the attorneys for their subclass handled the claims is not a sufficient basis to establish that the trial justice erred when she found the Union plaintiffs were adequately represented before her. See DeBoer v. Mellon Mortgage Co., 64 F.3d 1171, 1175 (8th Cir. 1995) (acknowledging that the fact that the plaintiffs did not approve of the settlement did “not of itself, demonstrate that * * * class counsel provided inadequate representation” because “[t]o 11', 'The state defendants cite to the fairness hearing testimony by Boudreau that the settlement would be beneficial to retirees because it provided a one-time two percent COLA on the first $25,000 of a retiree’s pension benefits, which was favorable given the number of retirees who were at the “upper end of the age spectrum[.]” The brief also cited the testimony of Walsh and Dingley to a similar effect.', '21 hold as much would require decertification any time an objection is raised to a class,” which is “certainly not the standard envisioned by Rule 23”).', 'Furthermore, the trial justice found that there were no conflicts of interest between the class representatives and class members, and we agree with the state defendants that she did not err in this determination. All class members shared a similar goal with the various class representatives: to preserve their pension benefits that existed prior to the 2009 and 2010 amendments and the enactment of RIRSA. See Professional Firefighters Association of Omaha, Local 385 v. Zalewski, 678 F.3d 640, 645, 647, 648 (8th Cir. 2012) (upholding the district court’s certification of a class action challenging the enactment of a city ordinance that changed the plaintiff-employees’ health-care plans and finding that the plaintiffs had adequate representation even where both active employees and retirees were appointed the same class counsel because their “driving interest [was] to enjoin the city’s enforcement of the ordinance”). Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not err in her findings regarding this requirement of Rule 23(a).', 'Additionally, the Retiree plaintiffs contend that their lack of participation in the underlying litigation should have kept them from being made part of the class for settlement purposes only; but that argument misconstrues the entire purpose of a class action. Class actions, by definition, inherently contemplate missing plaintiffs. See Zarrella v. Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Co., 824 A.2d 1249, 1262 (R.I. 2003) (“The class action provides an exception to the traditional confrontation between a plaintiff and a defendant by allowing the named-class plaintiff or named-class defendant to represent interests of others with similar claims who are absent from the court.” (quoting Cabana v. Littler, 612 A.2d 678, 684 (R.I. 1992))). Rule 23 does not require that each class member has participated in the underlying litigation, but requires only that the trial justice certify the class in accordance with its provisions. See id. In addition,', '22 the safeguards for such are in the form of heightened review when a class action is filed for settlement purposes only. See Amchem Products, Inc., 521 U.S. at 620. Therefore, the trial justice’s inclusion of the Retiree plaintiffs in the retiree subclass was proper, pursuant to the prerequisites of Rule 23(a).', 'b', 'Rule 23(b)(2)', 'Having concluded that the trial justice did not err in finding that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) were met, we now turn to whether her decision to certify the class pursuant to Rule 23(b)(2) was appropriate. Rule 23(b)(2) is properly applied “only when a single injunction or declaratory judgment would provide relief to each member of the class.” Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 360. It will not apply to cases where “each class member would be entitled to an individualized award of monetary damages.” Id. at 360-61. Moreover, there is no requirement with Rule 23(b)(2) that “class members be given notice and opt-out rights[.]” Id. at 363.', 'The trial justice found that all of the Union plaintiffs’ claims sought equitable relief— “the restoration of their retirement benefits prior to the passage of the 2009 and 2010 Acts and the RIRSA.” “If the Rule 23(a) prerequisites have been met and injunctive or declaratory relief has been requested, the action usually should be allowed to proceed under subdivision (b)(2).” DeBoer, 64 F.3d at 1175 (quoting 7A Charles A. Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1775, at 470 (1986)). Significantly, “[t]he fact that [damages were] sought incidentally to the prayer for injunctive relief does not affect this result.” Id. (quoting Paxton v. Union National Bank, 688 F.2d 552, 563 (8th Cir. 1982)). In the case at bar, the award paid to all plaintiffs in the settlement is not relevant to a Rule 23(b)(2) analysis. Rather, we look to the relief sought in the', '23 class-action complaint, which is mainly declaratory and equitable relief.12 As such, we conclude that the relief sought fits squarely within those claims contemplated by Rule 23(b)(2), and, thus, because any money damages would be incidental to the declaratory and equitable relief sought, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in certifying the class pursuant to that subsection. See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 564 U.S. at 360; see also DeBoer, 64 F.3d at 1175.', 'c', 'Rule 23(c)(4)(B)', 'The Clifford plaintiffs’ arguments on appeal focus mainly on their discontent at being made part of the class action—they argue that their identity as retirees distinguishes them from 12', 'Specifically, the class-action complaint prayed that the Superior Court:', '“a.

Federal courts have recognized the legitimacy of this approach. See, e.g., Monarch Asphalt Sales Co., Inc. v. Wilshire Oil Company of Texas, 511 F.2d 1073, 1077 (10th Cir. 1975) (“[r]epresentatives of one group may not adequately represent members of another group[,]” and “[t]hese factors justify the discretionary creation of * * * appropriate subclasses”).

We briefly note that our', '25 inquiry is confined to whether the trial justice abused her discretion in approving the settlement, which included addressing the merits of the claim as just one of the many factors affecting whether the settlement was fair.

She also concluded that the settlement was “the result of well-informed and arm’s-length negotiations by competent and dedicated counsel who provided loyal and effective representation to all parties.” Additionally, the trial justice highlighted that the settlement was the result of earlier settlement attempts by the parties and, as such, was not entered into immediately prior to trial; in other words, the settlement had been under consideration for quite some time, and it was no “eve of trial” settlement.', 'Moreover, after her initial decision on April 16, 2015, finding that the settlement appeared fair and reasonable, the trial justice required the parties to notify class members by mail, newspaper publication, and through the ERSRI website. The trial justice also held five days of testimony at a fairness hearing, wherein the parties and objectors could be heard on the fairness of the settlement terms; those who testified included thirty-five of the sixty-nine class members who had originally requested to be heard. All class members received notification of', '27 the fairness hearing, and all were given ample opportunity to object in writing or to testify at the hearing. Thus, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in finding that the settlement was procedurally fair.', 'We now address the substantive fairness of the settlement terms. In her decision, the trial justice thoroughly analyzed the Grinnell factors, ultimately concluding that the settlement was “fair, adequate, and reasonable.” With respect to the first factor, the trial justice stated that “the complexity of the underlying pension cases” could not be “overstate[d.]” We agree that the complexity of the pension cases and the duration of the controversy certainly weigh in favor of settlement. See In re Tyco, 535 F.Supp.2d at 259. The settlement involved nine consolidated cases, and the majority of the lawsuits had been pending for three years at the time of settlement. The Union plaintiffs were expending substantial costs, and there was testimony at the fairness hearing that they had already invested approximately $1 million in legal costs and could be expected to spend up to $100,000 per week leading up to the trial. We agree with the trial justice that these factors and the complex nature of the constitutional claims alleged weighed in favor of the proposed settlement.', 'The trial justice next scrutinized the reaction of the class, noting that more than 60,000 notices were sent to class members regarding the settlement, but she received only 400 written objections. But see TBK Partners, Ltd. v. Western Union Corp., 675 F.2d 456, 462 (2d Cir. 1982) (“[M]ajority opposition to a settlement cannot serve as an automatic bar to a settlement that a district judge, after weighing all the strengths and weaknesses of a case and the risks of litigation, determines to be manifestly reasonable.”). Nevertheless, the trial justice considered many of the objectors’ concerns. For example, she contemplated the argument that the objectors had a constitutional right to a three percent COLA, and determined that the caselaw was unclear', '28 regarding whether the objectors would succeed on that argument, citing Arena v. City of Providence, 919 A.2d 379, 393 (R.I. 2007), but that these specific concerns were voiced by two class representatives of the retiree subclass during negotiations.', 'The trial justice finally concluded that, although the objectors’ concerns had some merit, they still were in a very small minority of the group and, in fact, the settlement could be—as Walsh testified at the fairness hearing—“heartbreaking” but fair at the same time. We cannot say that the trial justice abused her discretion in considering this factor and determining that it weighed in favor of a fair settlement.', 'The third factor involves the stage of the litigation and the discovery conducted by the parties. See In re Tyco, 535 F.Supp.2d at 259. In concluding that this factor weighed in favor of a finding of a fair, reasonable, and adequate settlement, the trial justice commented on the extensive discovery in the cases and the multiple dispositive motions that had been filed. We agree that the discovery in these consolidated cases was more than adequate—it included production of more than 700 gigabytes of electronic documents and over four million pages of documents. As such, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in ruling as she did with respect to this factor.', 'Regarding the fourth and fifth Grinnell factors, the trial justice found that the risk of failure to establish liability and prove damages was high, relying on the testimony to that effect by both parties at the fairness hearing. She referenced nine pending dispositive motions, which the Union plaintiffs would first need to overcome to reach trial, ultimately determining that these factors weighed in favor of the settlement being fair, reasonable, and adequate. In addition, she noted that the Union plaintiffs recognized the risks of a jury trial, which would have required them to surmount a high burden of proof. See Sullivan v. DB Investments, Inc., 667 F.3d 273,', '29 322 (3d Cir. 2011) (“[T]his inquiry attempts to measure the expected value of litigating the action rather than settling it at the current time.” (quoting In re Cendant Corp. Litigation, 264 F.3d 201, 238 (3d Cir. 2001))). Consequently, we cannot say that the trial justice abused her discretion when she weighed these factors in favor of approving the settlement.', 'The trial justice gave little weight to the sixth and seventh factors—the risks of maintaining the class action through trial and the ability of the defendants to withstand a greater judgment. The trial justice found the latter factor to be neutral because the relief sought was equitable, not monetary. That scrutiny involves “whether the defendants could withstand a judgment for an amount significantly greater than the settlement.” Sullivan, 667 F.3d at 323 (quoting In re Warfarin Sodium Antitrust Litigation, 391 F.3d 516, 537-38 (3d Cir. 2004)). There was testimony at the fairness hearing that the state and municipal defendants might not be able to bear the cost of the restoration of the pension benefits. We are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in affording less weight to these factors because, we agree, in the event that the Union plaintiffs succeeded on their claims at trial, the judgment against defendants would remain principally equitable in nature—namely, a requirement that RIRSA be repealed and pension benefits restored. While we recognize that such an outcome would require the state to pay more money to the Union plaintiffs, such an order would not amount to relief in the form of compensatory damages, such as damages for injuries sought in asbestos litigation. See Amchem Products, Inc., 521 U.S. at 614.', 'Finally, the trial justice turned to the last Grinnell factors, contemplating the “range of reasonableness” of the settlement. She addressed the merits of the constitutional claims in light of pension cases in other jurisdictions, ultimately determining that the combination of the low likelihood of success and the length of time the cases had been pending weighed in favor of a', '30 finding that the settlement is reasonable. These two factors inquire as to “whether the settlement is reasonable in light of the best possible recovery and the risks the parties would face if the case went to trial.” In re Prudential Insurance Co. of America Sales Practices Ligation, 148 F.3d 283, 322 (3d Cir. 1998). Both factors “evaluate whether the settlement represents a good value for a weak case or a poor value for a strong case.” In re Warfarin, 391 F.3d at 538. In making such a determination, “we must be careful to judge the fairness factors ‘against the realistic, rather than theoretical, potential for recovery after trial.’” Sullivan, 667 F.3d at 323 (quoting In re Global Crossing Securities and ERISA Litigation, 225 F.R.D. 436, 461 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)).', 'At trial, the Union plaintiffs would have had to meet a higher burden—they needed to “prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act[s] violate a specific provision of the [Rhode Island] [C]onstitution * * *.” Oden v. Schwartz, 71 A.3d 438, 456 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Mackie v. State, 936 A.2d 588, 595 (R.I. 2007)). Moreover, the challenged legislative enactments would be determined to be constitutional if defendants demonstrated they were “reasonable and necessary to carry out a legitimate public purpose.” Brennan v. Kirby, 529 A.2d 633, 638 (R.I. 1987). There was testimony at the fairness hearing indicating that the financial crisis in Rhode Island certainly necessitated the challenged pension reform.', 'The trial justice also outlined decisions in other jurisdictions relating to the constitutionality of various pension reforms, finding that the majority of jurisdictions had found that no constitutional right existed to a specific COLA formula. See, e.g., Maine Association of Retirees v. Board of Trustees of Maine Public Employees Retirement System, 954 F.Supp.2d 38, 54 (D. Me. 2013); see also Justus v. State, 336 P.3d 202, 212-13 (Colo. 2014). Those cases in which there was determined to be a constitutional right are distinguishable on other grounds. See Moro v. State, 351 P.3d 1, 39, 41- 42 (Or. 2015) (finding that retirees had a constitutional right to their COLA formula where the', '31 legislative assembly failed to demonstrate that the state’s financial problems “could not be remedied through funding from other sources”).', 'While such cases are instructive, these decisions are certainly not binding in Rhode Island.14 Consequently, it is clear that the likely outcome of the Union plaintiffs’ claims at trial is uncertain, and there are also immediate and substantial looming costs of continuing forward with this action. Indeed, we agree with the trial justice that the Union plaintiffs received “concrete and immediate benefits” from the settlement, including a more favorable COLA formula, two $500 stipends paid to retirees, and a calculation that would reduce the minimum retirement age for employees. While we need not rule on the ultimate merits of the case in considering these two factors, on balance, we acknowledge that these factors would weigh in favor of a determination that the settlement is fair, reasonable, and adequate.', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice did not overlook any of the concerns raised by the various objectors to the settlement; conducted an exhaustive review of the factors necessary to determine whether the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate; and properly balanced the benefits and drawbacks of the settlement. See Bezdek, 809 F.3d at 82. We conclude that she did not abuse her discretion in concluding that the settlement was fair, reasonable, and adequate. See National Association of Chain Drug Stores, 582 F.3d at 45 (“[T]he [trial] court enjoys considerable range in approving or disapproving a class action settlement, given the generality of the standard and the need to balance benefits and costs.”). 14', 'The Clifford plaintiffs argue that the trial justice erred by not addressing the merits of the Takings Clause claim. However, because she concluded that the Contract Clause claim was unlikely to succeed at trial, it necessarily follows that she did not need to address the Takings Clause claim. See Cranston Firefighters, 880 F.3d at 51 (“The lack of any allegation that the current benefits provided by the [s]tate fall below the present value of the contributions made by the Union pensioners, coupled with the absence of the alleged contract, also eliminates the basis for a claim under the Takings Clause.”).', '32', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the Clifford plaintiffs’ and the Retiree plaintiffs’ appeals are denied and dismissed, and the judgments appealed from are affirmed.

34,"Karen Dent : v. : PRRC, Inc., d/b/a Price Rite. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on December 5, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The plaintiff, Karen Dent (plaintiff or Dent), appeals from a final judgment granting the motion of the defendant, PRRC, Inc. d/b/a Price Rite (defendant or Price Rite), for summary judgment on count one of the plaintiff’s complaint, and also granting the defendant’s motion to dismiss the remaining four counts. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided without further briefing or argument. We affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On August 22, 2012, plaintiff was shopping with her husband at the Price Rite store located at 325 Valley Street in Providence. The plaintiff’s husband placed two bottles of a', '-1- beverage identified as Sunny Delight1 into their shopping cart. The product was displayed in aisle six of the store, and plaintiff then separated from her husband to locate a restroom. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff returned to aisle six in search of her husband, but she slipped on a “brownish oily substance” and was immobilized. Meanwhile, a porter2 was mopping up liquid in an adjacent aisle.3 Coincidentally, plaintiff’s husband noted that one of the bottles of Sunny Delight in his shopping cart had been leaking, and that some of the contents of the bottle had spilled out as he continued to shop.', 'David Walmsley (Walmsley), a store manager at Price Rite, testified at a deposition that the Sunny Delight bottles arrive at the store in boxes and are then transported on pallets to the area of the store where they will be displayed. Also, Jeffrey Sparfven (Sparfven), a former Price Rite manager, testified at his deposition that the boxes arrive from the warehouse shrink-wrapped in cellophane and are unwrapped and inspected by a manager to verify that the quantity and quality of the items are correct.4 According to Sparfven, the receiving manager then shrink- wraps the boxes and places them in storage until they are needed, at which point a store employee once again removes the shrink-wrap with a box cutter. Walmsley also testified that, typically, fifty boxes of Sunny Delight, with eight bottles in each box, are stacked on top of each other on the wooden pallet. According to Walmsley, none of the Price Rite employees are asked 1', 'Sunny Delight, also referred to as “SunnyD,” is an orange-colored soft drink marketed as an orange juice-based product and offered in a variety of flavors. 2', 'A porter is an employee of Price Rite whose duty it is to maintain the floors and the restrooms of the store. 3', 'A video, taken on Price Rite’s security camera, captures the porter mopping the aisle adjacent to aisle six and plaintiff’s slip-and-fall accident. However, the video is not time-stamped and is not continuously streaming, because the camera records only if it is triggered by movement in the aisle. 4', 'According to Sparfven, the cellophane is cut open using a box cutter.', '-2- to inspect products for defects before they are sold in the store. Finally, Walmsley explained that the store’s protocol for spills is: “If [an employee] see[s] something on the floor, the protocol is for them to stand at that spot until they can get [the] attention of a porter, and they stay there until the porter arrives.”', 'On November 20, 2013, plaintiff filed a three-count complaint against defendant; she subsequently amended that complaint in February 2016. The amended complaint consisted of five counts: negligence; breach of contract; “mode of operation”; failure to warn; and breach of the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for use, and fitness for a particular purpose. Prior to the filing of plaintiff’s amended complaint, defendant had moved for summary judgment on the negligence claim, arguing that Price Rite could only be liable under a theory of negligence if it knew or should have known that the dangerous condition existed for a sufficient period of time within which to remedy the dangerous condition, and that not enough time had elapsed such that defendant could be liable under the theory of constructive notice. The plaintiff objected to the motion for summary judgment, arguing that defendant had to have known of the dangerous condition because a porter was cleaning up the spill, and that there was no question that the bottle was defective. After a hearing, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion with respect to the negligence count, stating:', '“[A] plaintiff who has fallen must present evidence to prevail', 'against the owner of the premises showing that he or she fell', 'because of an unsafe condition on the premises of which the', 'defendant was or should have been aware and that the condition', 'existed for a long enough period of time so the owner or occupier', 'of the premises should have taken steps to correct the condition', '* * *.', '“Dent has failed to show that there was any notice given to the', 'defendant. * * * [O]bviously it wasn’t so obvious that it would call', 'attention to somebody.” (Emphasis added.)', '-3-', 'After plaintiff was granted leave to file an amended complaint, defendant moved to dismiss the remaining counts under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In its motion, defendant argued that: (1) because the parties were not in a contractual relationship, the breach-of-contract claim should be dismissed; (2) mode of operation is not a cause of action, but merely a means of proving notice with respect to negligence, a count which had already been dismissed; (3) the duty-to-warn claim should fail because the court had already decided that Price Rite did not have notice of the leaking bottle; and (4) the breach-of-warranty claims should be dismissed because no sale had occurred. In response to defendant’s motion, plaintiff filed a motion for reconsideration of the order granting summary judgment,5 and also moved for summary judgment under a theory of strict product liability. A hearing was held in March 2016 on defendant’s motion to dismiss the remaining counts, plaintiff’s Rule 60 motion, and plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment.6 The trial justice granted defendant’s motion to dismiss counts 2 through 5 of plaintiff’s complaint, and accordingly denied both of plaintiff’s motions. The plaintiff timely appealed.', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that the question of whether defendant knew or should have known of the dangerous condition from the broken bottle is a disputed issue of material fact, and therefore summary judgment should not have been granted. As to her breach-of-contract claim, plaintiff argues that defendant has a responsibility to maintain the property in a safe manner for its intended business invitee guests. Turning to the mode-of-operation count, plaintiff argues that this Court should adopt mode of operation as a distinct cause of action. As to her failure-to- 5', 'While there is no procedural vehicle for a motion for “reconsideration,” this Court considers such motions under Rule 60 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, entitled “Relief from Judgment or Order.” 6', 'An original transcript of this hearing was not transmitted to this Court on appeal.', '-4- warn claim, plaintiff argues that a retailer has a duty to warn consumers of dangerous or defective conditions that it knows of, or reasonably should have known of, and therefore the trial justice erred in dismissing this claim. Finally, plaintiff contends that her breach-of-warranty claims were properly pled; she therefore asks this Court to reverse the trial justice and enter summary judgment in her favor on this count.

Greenberg, 68 A.3d 404, 406 (R.I. 2013)). The plaintiff put forth a video taken by defendant’s security camera that depicts plaintiff slipping and falling in an aisle of defendant’s store. Significantly, the camera records only when it is triggered by movement in the aisle and does not record continuously, thus creating the existence of a question of fact with respect to how long the dangerous condition existed before plaintiff slipped and fell. Additionally, plaintiff presented deposition testimony', '-8- from defendant’s employees that, at the very least, raises an issue of material fact with respect to defendant’s safety procedures or lack thereof.', 'Moreover, we are of the opinion that the trial justice committed reversible error when he weighed the evidence in his decision granting summary judgment.

Here, the trial justice unequivocally undertook a factual determination when he stated:', '“I have trouble accepting that if that’s the case then it would have', 'been leaking when the person picked it up, when your client picked', 'it up or your client’s husband picked it up, and it would have been', 'less—unless he picked it up within an instant after that package', 'was put there and there is no evidence of that.” Additionally, the trial justice found:', '“Although Dent has argued that a porter had noticed the drops,', 'whatever the substance was, and began cleaning them on a', 'different aisle before Dent fell, this is not established in the record.', 'I interrupted argument to allow us to look at the video and cannot', 'show—it’s clear that he was mopping another aisle[ ], but there is', 'no indication that that mopping occurred prior to the mopping in', 'Aisle 6.

They don’t appear', 'to stop. They don’t appear to look at anything. They don’t appear', 'to call attention to anything. That doesn’t necessarily mean that', 'the substance wasn’t there. It just means that obviously it wasn’t', 'so obvious that it would call attention to somebody. It appears', 'that once she fell, obviously the porter came and started mopping.”', '(Emphasis added.) We are of the opinion that the trial justice’s statements reflect opinion-based credibility and factual evaluations of the evidence presented in this case, an impermissible function at the summary-judgment stage.', '-9-', 'We pause to address defendant’s argument that plaintiff failed to prove an essential element of her claim—notice—because she failed to produce evidence with respect to the length of time the liquid substance was on defendant’s floor. The defendant cites to Barone and Massart, both cited supra, to support its position that plaintiff was required to present evidence showing that she fell because of an unsafe condition on the premises, of which defendant was aware or should have been aware, and that the condition existed for a long enough period of time that defendant should have corrected it. See Barone, 767 A.2d at 68; Massart, 708 A.2d at 188. The defendant’s reliance on Barone and Massart is misplaced and is of no moment to the case at bar, because those cases were decided at trial, in the context of motions for judgment as a matter of law. There is no requirement at the summary-judgment stage for a plaintiff to produce direct evidence of how long a spill has existed on a floor, because this fact is capable of circumstantial proof. We have never required a plaintiff to produce direct evidence, and we do not require that now. The temporal aspect of a slip-and-fall case can be proven by circumstantial evidence, which is presented to the factfinder. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment granting summary judgment for defendant.', 'Breach of Contract, Failure to Warn, and Breach of Implied Warranty', 'We now turn to plaintiff’s claims for breach of contract, failure to warn, and breach of warranty. On appeal, plaintiff alleges that she entered defendant’s store as a business invitee, in anticipation of paying adequate consideration for its products, and that defendant breached this contract by failing to maintain the property in a safe manner.', 'It appears that plaintiff is attempting to shoehorn a straightforward premises-liability claim into a breach-of-contract claim. The basis of plaintiff’s breach-of-contract claim is that defendant failed to maintain its property in a safe condition. As previously noted, common law premises liability imposes a duty on', '- 10 - landowners to “exercise reasonable care for the safety of persons reasonably expected to be on the premises * * *.” Cooley, 160 A.3d at 304 (quoting Kurczy, 820 A.2d at 935). Having already addressed plaintiff’s negligence claim, we need not delve any further into the mischaracterized breach-of-contract claim; a dismissal was proper. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the judgment dismissing plaintiff’s breach-of-contract claim.', 'Similarly, plaintiff’s failure-to-warn claim is simply another inaccurately articulated negligence claim.', 'A duty to warn arises when a defendant has notice of the dangerous propensities of a product.', 'See Thomas v. Amway Corp., 488 A.2d 716, 721 (R.I. 1985); Scittarelli v. Providence Gas Co., 415 A.2d 1040, 1043 (R.I. 1980). Having already determined that genuine issues of material fact remain with respect to whether defendant had notice of the spill, we need not address this duplicitous claim. Therefore, we affirm the dismissal of plaintiff’s failure-to-warn claim.', 'Lastly, plaintiff’s breach-of-warranty claims are without merit because there was not a sale under the facts before us. A claim for breach of implied warranty of merchantability requires a plaintiff to “prove that the product is defective, that it was in a defective condition at the time it left the hands of the seller, and that said defect is the proximate cause of the injury.” Lariviere v. Dayton Safety Ladder Co., 525 A.2d 892, 896 (R.I. 1987) (quoting Plouffe v. The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 118 R.I. 288, 294, 373 A.2d 492, 495 (1977)). Moreover, G.L. 1956 § 6A-2-314 provides that “a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.” (Emphasis added.) It is inconceivable that plaintiff could succeed on a claim of breach of implied warranty of merchantability when a contract for sale was never realized.', '- 11 -', 'Likewise, a breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose “arises when the seller has reason to know the buyer’s particular purpose and that the buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment to furnish appropriate goods and the buyer relies on the seller’s skill or judgment.” Lariviere, 525 A.2d at 897. A claim of breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose is meritorious only if a sale has actually occurred. Our applicable statute states:', '“Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any', 'particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the', 'buyer is relying on the seller’s skill or judgment to select or furnish', 'suitable goods, there is, unless excluded or modified under the next', 'section, an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such', 'purpose.” Section 6A-2-315 (emphasis added). The plaintiff’s claim of breach of implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose must also be dismissed in light of the fact that plaintiff and defendant never entered into a contract for the sale of the Sunny Delight; therefore, plaintiff is not entitled to relief beyond a reasonable doubt. See Laurence v. Sollitto, 788 A.2d 455, 456 (R.I. 2002).', 'Mode of Operation', 'Lastly, in her amended complaint, plaintiff asserted a claim under the theory of “mode of operation” that is separate and distinct from her negligence claim. The plaintiff contends that mode of operation is not a form of negligence, but rather modifies how the notice requirement of premises liability is met; she cites to Massachusetts common law in support of her position. See Sheehan v. Roche Brothers Supermarkets, Inc., 863 N.E.2d 1276, 1283 (Mass. 2007). However, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court declared in Sheehan that “the adoption of the mode of operation approach will not modify the general rule governing premises liability requiring a plaintiff to prove that an owner had either actual or constructive notice of an unsafe condition on the premises.” Id. at 1286. Mode of operation does not constitute a distinct cause of action, but', '- 12 - rather is a theory that alters the burden of proving actual or constructive notice in premises liability cases. See id. at 1286 n.9 (“Adoption of the mode of operation approach is not an adoption of a wholly new law, but merely a refinement of the elements of proof in premises liability cases.”).', 'We are satisfied that the issue of mode of operation does not give rise to a distinct claim in a negligence action. Recently, this Court had occasion to consider the viability of mode of operation in the slip-and-fall context. In Bates-Bridgmon v. Heong’s Market, Inc., 152 A.3d 1137 (R.I. 2017), the plaintiff assigned error to the refusal of the trial justice to instruct the jury on the theory of mode of operation. Bates-Bridgmon, 152 A.3d at 1145. We determined that the plaintiff failed to request an instruction on mode of operation, and we declined to adopt the theory under our supervisory powers in the face of a record that was devoid of any argument or analysis at the trial level. See id. We decline to do so at this juncture. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the plaintiff’s mode of operation count.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the plaintiff’s negligence claim, and we affirm the dismissal of the remaining counts of the plaintiff’s complaint. The papers may be remanded to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Robinson, dissenting. I must respectfully but most vigorously record my dissent from the majority’s opinion in this case. It is my position that Karen Dent failed to point to any evidence, direct and/or circumstantial, on the basis of which one could infer that PRRC, Inc. d/b/a Price Rite (Price Rite), had actual or constructive knowledge of the spill which purportedly', '- 13 - caused her to fall and sustain an injury. For that reason, I am definitely of the opinion that summary judgment was appropriately granted in this case.', 'I am well aware of the following normative consideration relative to motions under Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure in negligence cases: “In Rhode Island the general rule is that negligence is a question for the jury unless the facts warrant only one conclusion.”1 DeNardo v. Fairmount Foundries Cranston, Inc., 121 R.I. 440, 448, 399 A.2d 1229, 1234 (1979); see also Gliottone v. Ethier, 870 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2005). However, as one reflects upon that fundamental principle, it is important not to gloss over the adjective “general” as well as the explicit “unless” clause in the just-quoted sentence. Stated differently, the law is clear that there can be cases (exceptional perhaps, but real nonetheless) where summary judgment is appropriate even in the context of a case of alleged negligence. See generally Haynes v. Alfred A. Knopf Inc., 8 F.3d 1222, 1234 (7th Cir. 1993) (Posner, C.J.) (“[S]ummary judgment is properly granted to a defendant when on the basis of the evidence obtained in pretrial discovery no reasonable jury could render a verdict for the plaintiff.”); see also Wray v. Green, 126 A.3d 476, 479-80 (R.I. 2015). In my judgment, this is one of those cases.', 'We have been repeatedly explicit with respect to a plaintiff’s burden when a defendant moves for summary judgment: the plaintiff has the burden of “produc[ing] competent evidence t[o] prove[] the existence of a disputed issue of material fact[.]” Moura v. Mortgage Electronic 1', 'Over the years, I have repeatedly articulated my conviction that disposition of civil cases by summary judgment is a procedural tool that should be engaged in with particular caution and circumspection. See, e.g., DeMaio v. Ciccone, 59 A.3d 125, 129 (R.I. 2013) (“Summary judgment is a drastic remedy, and a motion for summary judgment should be dealt with cautiously.”); Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 390 (R.I. 2008). I have also joined in opinions of this Court to the effect that only rarely should negligence cases be disposed of by that mechanism. See, e.g., Limoges v. Nalco Co., 157 A.3d 567, 571 (R.I. 2017); Gliottone v. Ethier, 870 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2005). However, rarely does not mean never.', '- 14 - Registration Systems, Inc., 90 A.3d 852, 856 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Wyso v. Full Moon Tide, LLC, 78 A.3d 747, 750 (R.I. 2013); DeMarco v. Travelers Insurance Co., 26 A.3d 585, 605 (R.I. 2011); Cullen v. Lincoln Town Council, 960 A.2d 246, 248 (R.I. 2008). While a plaintiff confronted with a summary judgment motion need not “disclose * * * all [his or her] evidence, [said plaintiff] must demonstrate that he [or she] has evidence of a substantial nature, as distinguished from legal conclusions, to dispute the moving party on material issues of fact.” Mruk v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 82 A.3d 527, 532 (R.I. 2013). Put another way, the plaintiff “cannot rest on allegations or denials in the pleadings or on conclusions or legal opinions.” Cooley v. Kelly, 160 A.3d 300, 304 (R.I. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Habershaw v. Michaels Stores, Inc., 42 A.3d 1273, 1275 (R.I. 2012); Empire Acquisition Group, LLC v. Atlantic Mortgage Co., Inc., 35 A.3d 878, 882 (R.I. 2012). Failure to abide by the above-cited principles as to the non-movant’s responsibility in the Rule 56 context can be fatal to the non-movant. See Rohena v. City of Providence, 154 A.3d 935, 938 (R.I. 2017) (“Because the plaintiff failed to produce evidence showing that the city possessed the requisite knowledge to have ‘willfully or maliciously’ failed to guard or warn of a known danger, this argument does not carry the day.”).', 'In this premises liability case, one of the essential elements that plaintiff was required to prove in order to prevail is that Price Rite had actual or constructive notice of the unsafe condition that purportedly caused her to fall. See Cooley, 160 A.3d at 304-05. Accordingly, when confronted with a summary judgment motion filed by defendant, she was required to produce competent evidence of either actual or constructive notice. Moura, 90 A.3d at 856. After my thorough perusal of the record in this case and viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, I am unable to conclude that she produced any such evidence, either', '- 15 - direct or circumstantial. The majority relies on the following evidence as predicates for its conclusion that plaintiff satisfied her burden of production as the non-moving party under Rule 56: a “video taken by defendant’s security camera * * * depict[ing] plaintiff slipping and falling in an aisle of defendant’s store” and “deposition testimony from defendant’s employees * * *.” The video in question shows what happened at the moment that plaintiff slipped.2 The majority 2', 'I consider it important to clarify certain statements made in the Facts and Travel portion of the majority opinion with respect to the videotape evidence at issue. The following are the statements in that opinion to which I am referring:', '“[P]laintiff returned to aisle six in search of her husband, but she', 'slipped on a ‘brownish oily substance’ and was immobilized.', 'Meanwhile, a porter[] was mopping up liquid in an adjacent', 'aisle.3” Footnote 3 that relates to the just-quoted sentences reads as follows:', '“A video, taken on Price Rite’s security camera, captures the porter', 'mopping the aisle adjacent to aisle six and plaintiff’s slip-and-fall', 'accident. However, the video is not time-stamped and is not', 'continuously streaming, because the camera records only if it is', 'triggered by movement in the aisle.” In my judgment, neither of those statements is wholly accurate. When one reviews the video footage in this case, it is clear that, of the many videos contained in the record, no single video shows both plaintiff’s slip and fall as well as a porter mopping in an adjacent aisle. In actuality, there is a video of aisle six, which shows plaintiff’s slip and fall, and another video of an adjacent aisle, which shows a porter mopping. However, as the majority candidly notes, these videos are not time-stamped, nor are they continuous streaming videos. As such, we have no way of knowing that plaintiff slipped and fell while (the majority says “[m]eanwhile”) a porter was mopping in an adjacent aisle. We know only that those two events happened, but there is no evidence in the record that they happened contemporaneously. Indeed, plaintiff’s counsel conceded as much to the hearing justice, stating that “[t]here is no absolute way to absolutely determine that because of timestamps.” (It is clear from the record that, in referencing time stamps, plaintiff’s counsel was referring to the lack of time stamps on the surveillance videos.) Additionally, in the bench decision that he rendered just after viewing the videos which plaintiff asserted were relevant to her case, the hearing justice made the following statement with respect to the evidence of the porter mopping in an adjacent aisle: “Although Dent has argued that a porter had noticed the drops, whatever the substance was, and began cleaning them on a different aisle before Dent fell, this is not established in the record.”', '- 16 - opinion correctly states that the video did not record continuously and was triggered by movement. That fact alone, however, does not create, as the majority seems to contend, an issue of material fact. I agree with the majority that it is unclear from the video how long the liquid on which plaintiff slipped had been present on the floor. However, it was not plaintiff’s burden to point to evidence only to show that it was not clear how long the spill was present on the floor; rather, she was required to point to competent evidence based on which one could infer that the spill existed, at the location in question, for such a duration as to amount to constructive notice. The video in question does not in any way support an inference that the spill existed for a long enough time to amount to constructive notice; and, for that matter, it does not establish a genuine issue of material fact. Pimentel v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co., 174 A.3d 740, 744 (R.I. 2017) (“[A] demonstration of mere factual disputes will not defeat summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact.”) (emphases in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiff based her objection to defendant’s summary judgment motion on nothing more than conjecture and speculation and facts of a non-probative nature; so scantily supported an objection is insufficient to permit the non-movant to survive a motion for summary judgment. See, e.g., Habershaw, 42 A.3d at 1274-75, 1277 (deposition testimony by the plaintiff that the floor where she slipped and fell was “shiny” was not “competent evidence of defendant’s negligence and plaintiff’s allegation [was] nothing more than conjecture or speculation”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'The majority also relies upon what it characterizes as the “deposition testimony from defendant’s employees.” The majority, however, does not provide any explanation with respect', 'I would add as well that, even if I were to accept the facts exactly as set forth by the majority, it would not alter my belief that Ms. Dent failed to produce competent evidence to survive summary judgment.', '- 17 - to what specific statements of the employees it is relying upon. Contained in the record are the depositions of Jeffrey O. Sparfven, a former Price Rite store manager; David Walmsley, a current (at the time of deposition) store manager; and Brian Betances, a former assistant manager.', 'However, after my thorough review of the deposition testimony of all three individuals, I remain entrenched in the belief that Ms. Dent has presented no competent evidence on the basis of which one could infer that there was actual or constructive notice in this case.', 'We have repeatedly stated that “summary judgment should enter against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case * * *.”', 'Holley v. Argonaut Holdings, Inc., 968 A.2d 271, 274 (R.I. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Genao v. Litton Loan Servicing, L.P., 108 A.3d 1017, 1021 (R.I. 2015); see also Lavoie v.

Ms. Dent has failed to make such a showing in this case. Accordingly, in my judgment, summary judgment was appropriately entered against her. See Cooley, 160 A.3d at 305 (stating that “our review of the testimony presented by * * * plaintiff[] has disclosed no evidence of knowledge, actual or constructive, of a dangerous condition on * * * defendant’s part. * * * And [w]hen no evidence of * * * defendant’s negligence exists, the granting of [summary judgment] by the trial justice is legally required”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'For the foregoing reasons, I must record my vigorous dissent from the majority’s opinion in this summary judgment case.', '- 18 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'Karen Dent v.

The defendant received two concurrent forty-year sentences, with twenty-five years to serve and the remainder suspended with probation.', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by: (1) admitting the testimony of Natalie Kissoon, M.D., which he contends amounted to improper bolstering that was admitted without proper foundation; (2) refusing to grant defendant’s motion to pass the case; and (3) denying defendant’s motion for a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant and his ex-wife, Michele Rathbun (Michele), were living together at the time the couple’s first child, Megan,1 was born on May 21, 1999. The couple married in 2002, 1', 'We will utilize a pseudonym in referring to the complaining witness, who, at the time of these proceedings, was a minor.', '-1- had a second child on November 11, 2003, and divorced in November 2004. After their second child was born, Michele was employed at a bank and worked longer hours than defendant, which necessitated defendant picking up the children at preschool, bathing them, feeding them, and putting them to bed. After the couple divorced in 2004, Michele began a relationship with Gary Benevides (Gary), who became a father figure to her children and lived in the home with Michele and the children. Similarly, defendant began dating and eventually married Desiree Tasca; he resided at his father’s house, which was a short distance from Michele’s home.', 'In 2006, when Megan was approximately six or seven years old, defendant and Desiree moved to Utah.', 'The defendant and Desiree subsequently had two children together; and, according to Michele, upon learning of this, Megan reacted “[w]ith excitement” and she “liked the fact [that] she had” younger siblings. Although Megan never traveled to Utah to visit defendant, they remained in contact over the telephone and occasionally over video chat.', 'In 2012, Desiree and her two children visited Michele and her family. During this visit, Desiree and Michele had a discussion in which Desiree stated that her oldest daughter was very similar to Megan in the sense that she was “extremely quiet and introverted[.]” Around the same time, in 2012, Michele began noticing a change in Megan that was concerning. She observed cuts on Megan’s legs that she described as “just cuts * * * just slices, scratches, cuts * * * they were just lines.” Megan’s behavior worsened after Desiree’s visit; and according to her mother, she became “[v]ery introverted, quiet, depressed * * * unhappy[,]” and her cuts “became more obvious.” When Michele confronted Megan with bloodied tissues, scissors, razor blades, and tacks that she had found in Megan’s room, Megan initially denied that she was cutting herself but eventually disclosed that she was harming herself because, according to Michele, “she did not like herself, that she thought she was ugly and disgusting, that she hated herself.” Michele', '-2- took Megan to her pediatrician, Russell Stokes, M.D., who referred Megan to a therapist, Clare Sartori.', 'Shortly thereafter, Michele found a notebook in Megan’s room with the words “I’m broken” written repeatedly on every page. Michele confronted her daughter and asked her, “Why are you so broken?” At this point, according to Michele, Megan stated that “her father had hurt her” and that “[m]y father touched me.” Megan further revealed to her mother that her father sodomized her and performed oral sex on her. In light of these allegations, Michele visited Megan’s therapist, contacted the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF), and sat for an interview with the Rhode Island State Police. Megan underwent a physical exam at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, performed by Dr. Kissoon, a fellow in child-abuse pediatrics. Megan also underwent interviews by DCYF, the State Police, and a forensic psychologist.', 'On March 22, 2013, defendant was indicted by a grand jury on two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1.2 At trial, the state presented Michele, Gary, Dr. Kissoon, and Megan as witnesses. Michele testified in depth about Megan’s revelations. She testified that Megan told her “[t]hat her father had * * * put his penis in her butt and that her father had put his mouth on her private part * * * and had touched her.” Megan also testified at trial. She testified that, when she was younger and lived with defendant, he showered with her “almost every time.” On one occasion in particular, when she was approximately four years old, Megan recalled defendant telling her to put her hands on the wall of the shower and subsequently sodomizing her. Megan testified with respect to another incident 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.1 provides:', '“A person is guilty of first degree child molestation sexual assault', 'if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a person fourteen', '(14) years of age or under.”', '-3- that occurred after defendant and Michele had divorced and defendant had moved out of the family home. When Megan was seven years old, she visited defendant at her grandfather’s home, where defendant was residing at the time. Megan awoke to the sound of defendant and Desiree fighting, and recalled Desiree telling her, “[Y]our dad and I were arguing. I’m going to put you in his bed.” Sometime thereafter, defendant joined Megan in his bed and she was awakened again by “something very uncomfortable down * * * near [her] private parts.” Megan attempted to stop the oral copulation by kicking defendant, to no avail.', 'Also at trial, Dr. Kissoon testified as an expert in child-abuse pediatrics. She testified that Megan was brought to the Child Protection Center at Hasbro Children’s Hospital by her mother “due to concerns for sexual abuse.”', 'Pursuant to standard procedure, Dr. Kissoon performed a physical exam on Megan and did not discover anything abnormal with respect to Megan’s physical condition. Doctor Kissoon testified that, “even when we know that there’s been penetration, 90 to 95 percent of those children had a completely normal physical exam, including a normal genital exam.” Finally, Dr. Kissoon stated that her final assessment in Megan’s case was “[t]hat her disclosure was consistent with sexual abuse.” At this point, defendant moved to strike Dr. Kissoon’s statement pursuant to Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.3 Defense counsel later, during Megan’s testimony, further argued that the doctor’s statement should be stricken because she had not reviewed Megan’s school records or her pediatric medical records and had based her conclusion solely on what Michele had disclosed to her. The court allowed the statement in question to stand; however, on the following day, the court sustained the objection, striking Dr. Kissoon’s statement “[t]hat her 3', 'The defendant based his objection on the fact that his Rule 16 request for discovery and inspection had not been complied with because Dr. Kissoon’s opinion was not included in the report defendant received.', '-4- disclosure was consistent with sexual abuse.” Defense counsel then pressed his objection that Dr. Kissoon’s testimony should be stricken in its entirety; the court refused to do so.', 'The defendant then moved for a mistrial, arguing that “the only corroboration of the victim’s testimony in this case comes from the now stricken answer of the * * * [d]octor.” The trial justice denied the motion for a mistrial because corroboration was not required:', '“[A]s we know, the statute for this type of offense specifically', 'addresses the fact * * * that the testimony standing alone of the', 'victim, if it constitutes proof beyond a reasonable doubt, is', 'sufficient to support conviction without any corroborative or', 'confirmatory evidence.', '“So for that reason and the other reasons stated earlier in the ruling', 'on Dr. Kissoon’s testimony, the [c]ourt will deny the Motion for', 'Mistrial.” At the conclusion of the state’s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure; the motion was denied.', 'As trial proceeded, defendant testified on his own behalf. He acknowledged that he often helped Megan with her shower and that he would “get the water running for her and * * * she’d get in and * * * do her little play thing in the shower, and then [he would] reach in from the outside and shampoo her head.” When asked if he ever got into the shower with Megan without his clothes on or if he had sodomized her, defendant replied, “Absolutely not.” The defendant further stated that he was not aware of Megan’s abuse allegations until he received a phone call from her in August 2012.', 'On June 24, 2015, defendant was found guilty of two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. Thereafter, defendant moved for a new trial based upon the newly discovered evidence that, after the trial, Michele filed a complaint seeking protection from', '-5- domestic abuse by Gary and obtained a restraining order against him.4 It was defendant’s argument that this newly discovered evidence would refute the state’s contention at trial that, because Megan’s home life had been stable, the only possible explanation for her self-harm was abuse by her father when she was a young child. The court denied defendant’s motion for a new trial, and defendant timely appealed.', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant argues that: (1) the trial justice abused her discretion by refusing to strike the entire testimony of Dr. Kissoon for lack of foundation; (2) the trial justice abused her discretion by refusing to pass the case after Dr. Kissoon testified that Megan’s disclosures were consistent with sexual abuse; and (3) the trial justice abused her discretion by refusing to grant defendant’s second motion for a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence.', 'The Motion to Strike', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that “[t]he admissibility of evidence is a question addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice and will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of that discretion.” State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1031 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Momplaisir, 815 A.2d 65, 72 (R.I. 2003)). Moreover, “[t]rial justices have wide discretion in connection with the admission of expert testimony.” State v. Griffin, 691 A.2d 556, 558 (R.I. 1997). This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s evidentiary ruling unless that ruling was clearly erroneous. See id.', 'Discussion', 'The defendant argues that Dr. Kissoon’s testimony should have been stricken in its entirety because it was riddled with improper bolstering. The defendant further contends that 4', 'The defendant had previously unsuccessfully moved for a new trial on the basis of the sufficiency of the evidence.', '-6- Dr. Kissoon’s testimony served no purpose other than to bolster Megan’s allegations. We are of the opinion that the trial justice considered Dr. Kissoon’s testimony carefully and instructed the jury not to consider the doctor’s statement “[t]hat [Megan’s] disclosure was consistent with sexual abuse[,]” in light of this Court’s holding in State v. Watkins, 92 A.3d 172 (R.I. 2014), in which we recognized our prior holding that repeated references to “sexual abuse recovery” and offering an opinion on a victim’s truth or credibility constituted improper bolstering.', 'See Watkins, 92 A.3d at 190 (quoting State v. Haslam, 663 A.2d 902, 906 (R.I. 1995)). This Court has held that a witness’s “‘opinion regarding the truthfulness or accuracy of another witness’[s] testimony’ is considered to be impermissible ‘bolstering’ or ‘vouching.’” State v. Huffman, 68 A.3d 558, 570 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Arroyo, 844 A.2d 163, 169 (R.I. 2004)). Similar to the instant case, the expert witness in Huffman testified that the complainant’s diagnosis was “consistent with ‘acute penetrating vaginal trauma.’” Id. In Huffman, this Court was tasked with determining whether the expert witness’s statement “ha[d] the same substantive import as bolstering[,]” id. (quoting State v. Richardson, 47 A.3d 305, 315 (R.I. 2012)); we determined that the testimony at issue “did not improperly vouch for or bolster” the testimony of the complainant because “it did not address—either directly or indirectly—the credibility or truthfulness of other fact witnesses.” Id.; see also Arroyo, 844 A.2d at 169-70.', 'As we previously have articulated, trial justices have “wide discretion” to admit or exclude expert testimony. See Griffin, 691 A.2d at 558. It is incumbent upon a trial justice to determine the relevancy of expert testimony; “a trial justice must consider whether the testimony sought is relevant, within the witness’s expertise, and based on an adequate factual foundation.” State v. Botelho, 753 A.2d 343, 347 (R.I. 2000) (quoting State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1112 (R.I. 1999)). Once a trial justice is satisfied that the testimony in question is relevant,', '-7- within the witness’s expertise, and is founded in fact, “the evidence generally ought to be admitted.” Id.', 'In the case at bar, the trial justice was satisfied that the remainder of Dr. Kissoon’s testimony—in which she merely recounted what she learned during Megan’s evaluation—did not rise to the level of impermissible bolstering. See Watkins, 92 A.3d at 189-90; Huffman, 68 A.3d at 570. At the outset, the trial justice struck the potentially prejudicial portion of Dr. Kissoon’s testimony from the record prior to ruling that the remainder of her testimony did not constitute improper bolstering. After scouring the record, we cannot point to a single instance in which Dr. Kissoon commented on “the truthfulness or credibility of [Megan].” Huffman, 68 A.3d at 570.', 'Before this Court, both parties address the effect of the stricken statement in light of the remainder of Dr. Kissoon’s testimony. However, in addition to striking the prejudicial statement from the record, the trial justice also gave the jury a cautionary instruction:', '“I need to inform you that the [c]ourt has granted a motion', 'to strike a very small portion of testimony furnished yesterday by', 'Dr. Natalie Kissoon.', '“Members of the Jury, you must recognize that when a', '[c]ourt does strike evidence or testimony from the record, it’s your', 'solemn obligation, in accordance with your oath, not to utilize that', 'evidence in any way or to refer to it or to speculate as to why it has', 'vanished and been removed from the record.

Okay. So the last two questions on direct examination', 'that were posed to Dr. Natalie Kissoon are being stricken from the', 'record. The questions are as follows: Question by the prosecutor,', '‘Were you able to make an assessment in [Megan’s] case?’ The', 'answer of Dr. Kissoon was, ‘Yes.’ And the next and last question,', '‘What was your assessment?’ Answer, ‘That her disclosure was', 'consistent with sexual abuse.’ Those two questions, those two', 'answers in their entirety are off the record. They are gone.

Dubois, 36 A.3d 191, 197 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d 984, 1007 (R.I. 2008)). The trial justice’s cautionary instruction was more than sufficient, as she repeatedly iterated that the jury was forbidden to consider the stricken statements. Moreover, when considered in connection with Dr. Kissoon’s remaining testimony that “[Megan’s] physical exam was normal with the exception of an abrasion that she had on her chest, which she said occurred [when] she was removing * * * a temporary tattoo,” and “[Megan] does not have any findings on physical exam indicating that she’s been sexually abused[,]” we are satisfied that the potential for prejudice was eliminated. Further, the stricken testimony was not accusatory and did not implicate defendant.', 'We see nothing in the record to suggest that the trial justice abused her discretion in refusing to strike Dr. Kissoon’s testimony. We note that defendant first alleged a Rule 16 discovery violation as the basis for the exclusion of the evidence; he later renewed his motion to strike the testimony. The trial justice carefully assessed Dr. Kissoon’s testimony and the relevant caselaw, and instructed the jury not to consider that part of the testimony that the trial justice believed might be prejudicial to defendant. The trial justice found that Dr. Kissoon’s testimony did not violate the standard set forth in Watkins, and stated that Dr. Kissoon’s stricken statement did “not render [infirm] in any way * * * the rest of Dr. Kissoon’s testimony * * * which [the trial justice] believe[d] ha[d] been proper[.]” See Watkins, 92 A.3d at 190.

This Court consistently has held that “the trial justice has a front row seat during the trial so that [he or she] can best evaluate the effects of any prejudice on the jury.” Id. (quoting Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 1007). Moreover, “a trial justice’s decision on a motion to pass the case is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not disturb the ruling on such a motion absent an abuse of discretion.” State v.

Ordway, 619 A.2d 819, 826 (R.I. 1992) (quoting State v. Collazo, 446 A.2d 1006, 1010 (R.I. 1982)).', 'In the case at bar, after the trial justice granted defendant the relief he requested and struck the potentially prejudicial testimony of Dr. Kissoon, defendant then moved for a mistrial on other grounds. The motion to pass the case was based on the remainder of Dr. Kissoon’s testimony because, defendant argued, he did not “see the probative value, if any, * * * of the', '- 10 - other things she had to say[,]” and he claimed that “the only corroboration of the victim’s testimony in this case comes from the now stricken answer of the * * * [d]octor.” The trial justice correctly relied on G.L. 1956 § 11-37-115 and stated that “the testimony standing alone of the victim, if it constitutes proof beyond a reasonable doubt, is sufficient to support conviction without any corroborative or confirmatory evidence.” This Court has explicitly eliminated any requirement of independent corroboration for sex-offense cases because the corroboration requirement “arbitrarily singles out victims of sex offenses as a class whose credibility is immediately suspect. By its adoption of [§] 11-37-11, the General Assembly has rejected this concept as a discredited anachronism * * *.” State v.

Whether or not expert testimony possesses probative value is a question for the jury, and “the jury is free to accept or to reject it, or to accord to the expert’s testimony any probative value it deems appropriate.” State v. Benton, 413 A.2d 104, 112 (R.I. 1980). In the instant case, the trial justice properly admitted the remainder of Dr. Kissoon’s testimony, determining that it was both relevant and not prejudicial to defendant. The amount of probative value to accord to Dr. Kissoon’s testimony was within the exclusive purview of the jury, and thus defendant’s argument that the trial justice erred in refusing to pass the case because her testimony did not have probative value is of no moment. 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-11, entitled “Corroboration of victim’s testimony unnecessary[,]” provides: “The testimony of the victim need not be corroborated in prosecutions under this chapter.”', '- 11 -', 'Based on our careful review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice appropriately denied defendant’s motion to pass the case.

DiPetrillo, 922 A.2d 124, 138 (R.I. 2007); see State v. Firth, 708 A.2d 526, 532 (R.I. 1998). The first prong of the two-part test involves a “four-part inquiry that requires that the evidence be (1) newly discovered since trial, (2) not discoverable prior to trial with the exercise of due diligence, (3) not merely cumulative or impeaching but rather material to the issue upon which it is admissible, (4) of the type which would probably change the verdict at trial.” Id. (quoting Firth, 708 A.2d at 532). “Once this first prong is satisfied, the second prong calls for the hearing justice to determine if the evidence presented is credible enough to warrant a new trial.” Id. at 138-39 (quoting Firth, 708 A.2d at 532).', 'Discussion', 'The defendant argues that a new trial was warranted based on what he submits was newly discovered evidence that, after the trial had concluded, Michele filed a police report against Gary in which she stated that Gary was “extremely violent towards [her] when [they] were together including breaking [her] jaw a few years ago.” The defendant avers that this discord in Michele and Gary’s relationship could serve to explain Megan’s concerning behavior and self-harm, as opposed to sexual abuse by defendant.', '- 12 -', 'Turning to the first prong set forth by this Court in Firth, the police report was not discoverable during or prior to trial because it did not exist—defendant was found guilty on June 24, 2015, and the police report was not filed until October 7, 2015. See Firth, 708 A.2d at 532. Nonetheless, we are not convinced that evidence of violence in Gary and Michele’s relationship was not discoverable prior to trial with the exercise of due diligence. Both Michele and Gary testified in this case and disclosed that the relationship had broken down by the time of trial; defendant could have explored this further through the exercise of due diligence.', 'A thorough cross-examination of both witnesses could have elicited testimony consistent with physical violence as alleged in the police report.', 'Furthermore, the trial justice determined, and we agree, that evidence of a tumultuous relationship between Gary and Michele, if admitted, would be “merely impeaching” of the testimony by Michele and Gary, and that it would not have impacted the verdict. Specifically, if admitted, this new evidence could impeach the testimony that Megan had a pleasant home life. However, the connection between the newly discovered evidence of the police report and whether or not the defendant sexually abused Megan as a young child is so far attenuated to the issues before the jury as to have no impact on the verdict in this case. We conclude that the defendant has failed to satisfy the four-part inquiry set forth in the first prong under Firth; therefore, we need not address the second prong, which asks “if the evidence presented is credible enough to warrant a new trial.” DiPetrillo, 922 A.2d at 139 (quoting Firth, 708 A.2d at 532).

36,Community College of Rhode Island et al. : v. : CCRI Educational Support Professional : Association/NEARI.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, CCRI Educational Support Professional Association/NEARI (the union), appeals to this Court after a justice of the Superior Court vacated an arbitration award that reinstated the grievant, Michael Crenshaw, to his position as a Campus Police Officer for the plaintiff, the Community College of Rhode Island. Significantly, Crenshaw was allowed to continue in his employment for nearly a year without completing the statutorily required police training academy or receiving a waiver from having to do so. When his application for a waiver eventually was not approved, the college terminated his employment, precipitating a grievance by the union, which ultimately prevailed at arbitration; the college was ordered to reinstate Crenshaw to his position and compensate him for lost time. The college petitioned the Superior Court to vacate the award, and it did.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided.', '-1- After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'The Hiring and Firing', 'In July 2013, Michael Crenshaw applied for a position as a Campus Police Officer at CCRI, a position that falls within the Merit System, G.L. 1956 chapter 4 of title 36. 1 Before that, after graduating from the Massachusetts Police Academy, Crenshaw had been a police officer in the Southborough Police Department. He was terminated from that position and applied to CCRI a year and a half later.', 'On November 8, 2013, CCRI extended an offer of employment to Crenshaw, conditioned on his successful completion of the Rhode Island Municipal Police Training Academy. The collective bargaining agreement (CBA) then in effect between the college and the union provided for a mandatory 130-day probationary period for new hires, which entailed supervisor evaluations every two months. During the probationary period, an employee would serve at the pleasure of the college and he could be terminated for any reason. However, the agreement provides that if a probationary employee is not notified in writing before the expiration of the 130-day period that his services are no longer desired, the employee “shall be continued in their 1', 'The papers in this case refer to the position as “Campus Police Officer” and “College Police Officer” interchangeably. We will use the former title, as the trial justice did.', '-2- employment.” Significantly, at that point in time, the CBA provides that employees can be disciplined only for just cause.', 'When Crenshaw began working on November 17, 2013, the condition of his continued employment was that he complete the academy; there was no mention in the conditional offer of the possibility of a waiver from that requirement.', 'Indeed, the education and experience qualifications that were outlined in the job description itself called for him to “satisfactorily complete the * * * Academy curriculum * * *.” However, according to Crenshaw, when he interviewed for the position, he was informed that the college preferred applicants who had already completed a training curriculum elsewhere, because that enabled the employees to obtain a waiver from having to complete the twenty-two-week academy.', 'The procedure for obtaining such a waiver was set forth in the Rhode Island Department of Public Safety’s General Order 2.100, entitled “Basic Recruit Officers Program Waiver,” which bore an effective date of July 15, 2013. 2', 'The General Order provided that, “upon receiving a conditional offer of employment and the sponsorship from a Rhode Island Law Enforcement agency[,]” an out-of-state police officer “shall seek a Basic Recruit Officers Program Waiver from the [Rhode Island Police Officers Commission on Standards and Training] prior to permanent employment as a police officer.” The order then goes on to state that the sponsoring agency—in Crenshaw’s case, the CCRI campus police department—shall submit the 2', 'This Court is perplexed and troubled that an incorrect version of the General Order was submitted to the arbitrator and later to the trial justice. It is clear that both were presented with an inaccurate or outdated version of the order. That version contained an additional clause (clause E), not present in the correct version, which would have had a significant—perhaps even determinative—impact on Crenshaw’s qualification for a waiver. This development is concerning, to say the least. For purposes of our recitation of the facts and travel pertinent to the present appeal, we will employ what is apparently the correct version of General Order 2.100, which was effective July 15, 2013. To be abundantly clear, we will not be considering the disputed “clause E” in our de novo review of arbitrability in this case.', '-3- waiver request in writing to the Executive Director of the academy, along with the prospective waiver candidate’s previous training certification and other relevant training documentation. The Executive Director then notifies the Chairman of the commission of the waiver request. The candidate himself must complete an application for the waiver, and he must have completed all entry standards required of academy candidates.', 'Finally, the Executive Director appoints academy staff to review the submitted training materials and ensure compliance with all requirements; if there is a shortcoming, a notification is sent to the sponsoring agency.', 'Crenshaw was presented with and signed a request for a waiver from the academy on May 14, 2014.', 'A mere three days later, May 17, 2014, his 130-day probationary period concluded. It is noteworthy that, during his probation, Crenshaw received high scores on three evaluations by his supervisor, Captain Timothy Poulin.', 'Captain Poulin also completed a background investigation on Crenshaw, which he summarized in a May 30, 2014 report. That investigation uncovered that Crenshaw had had his firearms license revoked in 2012 as a consequence of his self-reported addiction to a controlled substance; that Crenshaw had been deemed unfit for duty following a psychological evaluation in 2012 while employed by the Southborough Police Department; and that he had been arrested in 1993 and received a traffic violation in 2005, both of which had been dismissed. Nevertheless, apparently satisfied by his discussions with Crenshaw, Capt. Poulin, on August 18, 2014—well after the expiration of Crenshaw’s probationary period—submitted the waiver request that Crenshaw had signed months earlier.', 'The Executive Director of the academy, Lieutenant Scott Raynes, appointed the Department of Public Safety’s General Counsel, Lisa Holley, to review Crenshaw’s application. On October 21, 2014, Holley wrote to Lt. Raynes, stating that “I would not recommend that you', '-4- approve this Waiver * * *. Nothing, however, shall preclude Officer Crenshaw from reapplying once these issues are resolved to the satisfaction of the Commission.” The issues specified by Holley largely mirrored those uncovered as a result of Capt. Poulin’s investigation. Holley delineated a number of concerns as bases for her adverse recommendation: (1) there was insufficient information in the application to determine if Crenshaw’s termination from the Southborough Police Department in 2012 would result in his placement in the National Decertification Index, 3 which would make him ineligible for a waiver; (2) Crenshaw failed to list his arrest and traffic violation on the waiver application, and he also did not disclose the latter infraction to the psychologist who interviewed him as part of the waiver process; (3) Crenshaw’s self-reported substance abuse and psychological issues caused his license to carry a firearm to be revoked in 2012, and he did not provide the waiver-process psychologist with updated medical records; and (4) Crenshaw received a below-average psychological rating, which would not, in the absence of a specific request from the chief of the sponsoring department, be acceptable for admission to the academy. Lieutenant Raynes delivered the letter from Holley to Capt. Poulin. The college then notified Crenshaw that his application for a waiver had been denied, and he had therefore failed to satisfy the conditions of employment. Thus, CCRI scheduled a pretermination hearing.', 'At that hearing, which took place on November 5, 2014, CCRI allowed Crenshaw and his union representative to have access to the Holley letter. However, the college refused to show Crenshaw the waiver application that it had submitted to the academy on his behalf. Undeterred, Crenshaw availed himself of the opportunity to respond to each issue raised by Holley as 3', 'The National Decertification Index is a web-based registry in which participating agencies can record certificate or license revocations stemming from police misconduct. Its purpose is to enable police departments to investigate the qualifications of prospective employees who were initially certified in other jurisdictions.', '-5- follows: (1) his termination from the Southborough Police Department was, in his view, wrongful and would be the subject of litigation; (2) he was not eligible for placement in the NDI; (3) he did not understand that he had been arrested in 1993 because he had merely received a summons for charges that were dismissed, and the traffic violation in 2005 was actually issued to his girlfriend and also was dismissed; (4) he became dependent on prescription opioids after an injury that he had suffered while at the Massachusetts Police Academy, and he received treatment for his addiction until 2011, after which he passed drug tests; (5) the examining psychologist told him that his psychological rating was within the qualifying parameters; and (6) he had given CCRI a waiver to obtain his medical records because he had been unaware that he was supposed to supply them.', 'Notwithstanding Crenshaw’s attempts to mitigate the concerns raised in Holley’s recommendation, the college undertook no further investigation into his explanations and did not communicate those responses to the academy. Rather, CCRI focused simply on Crenshaw’s failure to obtain a waiver in lieu of attending and completing the required police training. Consequently, on November 21, 2014, CCRI terminated Crenshaw effective December 5, 2014, because he had not successfully completed all phases of the recruit selection process— specifically, because his waiver application had not been approved. The union filed a grievance on Crenshaw’s behalf, alleging that CCRI had denied Crenshaw—now, by the terms of the CBA, a nonprobationary employee—due process by refusing to show him the waiver application that Capt. Poulin had submitted to the academy. The college denied the grievance, and arbitration eventually ensued.', '-6-', 'B', 'The Arbitration', 'Before the arbitrator, the college first argued that the dispute was not subject to arbitration. This was so, the college maintained, because the requirement of academy training or waiver therefrom was set forth in the job description and thus was not subject to arbitration, as that requirement had been imposed by state law, which cannot be contravened by contrary CBA provisions or arbitration awards. The college also argued that, in the event the dispute was deemed to be arbitrable, Crenshaw’s failure to obtain a waiver constituted just cause for his termination. Moreover, the college asserted that it had afforded Crenshaw due process by providing him with a hearing, allowing him to respond to the college’s concerns, and sharing the Holley letter with him.', 'To the contrary, the union argued that the grievance was arbitrable because the arbitrator was not being asked to contravene the statutory academy requirement. Rather, the union argued that it was seeking to enforce the just cause and due process protections to which Crenshaw was entitled under the CBA. Those protections, the union contended, required the college to share with Crenshaw any evidence that could impact the termination decision, including the waiver application that CCRI submitted to the academy on Crenshaw’s behalf. Furthermore, the union claimed that due process concerns required that the college take reasonable steps to investigate or communicate to the academy the responses to Holley’s concerns that Crenshaw had raised at the pretermination hearing.', 'The arbitrator first addressed the question of arbitrability. He began by noting that “[i]t is undisputed that the job description is not subject to amendment by an arbitrator nor by [CCRI]. The Academy requirement is contained in the job description which in turn flows from state', '-7- statute and regulations which set forth the procedure to change it.” Nonetheless, the arbitrator did not interpret the grievance as seeking to ignore or bypass the academy requirement set forth in the job description. Rather, in his view, the union was alleging that the college violated the CBA by failing to afford Crenshaw due process when it terminated him for his failure to complete that requirement. The arbitrator concluded that “[t]he Union’s grievance alleging violation of specific provisions of the Agreement is substantively arbitrable because it does not seek to amend the job description but, rather, seeks to enforce specific Contract language.”', 'Proceeding to review the disputed termination on its merits, the arbitrator first settled the question of Crenshaw’s employment status.', 'Because the CBA forbade the college from negotiating directly with an employee, and because the union did not negotiate the conditional offer of employment, the arbitrator ruled that it was not enforceable.', 'Yet, the arbitrator nonetheless acknowledged that Crenshaw’s employment “was unusual because he passed probation without fully qualifying for the position by meeting the Academy requirement in the job description. Since the Academy requirement must be met, effectively it is a condition of [Crenshaw’s] employment.” Reasoning further, the arbitrator determined that, on day 131 of his employment, after receiving “three excellent evaluations” during his probationary period, Crenshaw “became a regular employee eligible for the Contractual protections, including due process and just cause.”', 'The arbitrator then decided that Crenshaw had not been afforded the benefits of those contractual protections. Citing Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985), the arbitrator wrote that “[d]ue process requires notice and an opportunity to respond before firing an employee and depriving him of his property interest in his job.” As the arbitrator saw it, the college’s refusal to show Crenshaw the waiver application “unfairly hobbled his', '-8- ability to respond to the questions in the Holl[e]y letter.” This was so because Crenshaw claimed to have identified a “litany of errors” in Capt. Poulin’s background investigation that had been submitted with the application.', 'And, because the arbitrator interpreted the “discipline” contemplated by the CBA to include termination, he concluded that Crenshaw could be fired only for just cause. Because he believed that the CBA required fair treatment, the arbitrator concluded that the college did not have just cause to terminate Crenshaw. Crenshaw was entirely dependent on CCRI to sponsor his waiver from or admission to the training academy, so the arbitrator reasoned that the college had an obligation to investigate Crenshaw’s responses to the concerns raised in the Holley letter and, if true, to share the same with the academy. The arbitrator determined that, when the college did neither, it violated Crenshaw’s contractual right to be disciplined only for just cause. After all, the arbitrator noted, the Holley letter had left open the possibility for Crenshaw to reapply for a waiver from the academy or apply for training there. As a remedy, in accordance with the CBA, the arbitrator ordered that Crenshaw be reinstated to his position and compensated for lost time.', 'C', 'The Superior Court Review', 'The college filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award in the Superior Court. The union objected to that motion and moved to confirm the award. As a threshold matter, CCRI again argued that the dispute was nonarbitrable. The college claimed that it had no authority under the Merit System to change the job requirements and that, in Crenshaw’s case, receiving a waiver from the academy requirement was a prerequisite imposed by state law, which the arbitrator had no authority to circumvent. Thus, Crenshaw’s lack of a statutorily imposed qualification was not subject to arbitration. The college also argued that the award was irrational', '-9- because it reinstated an employee who could not meet the minimum qualifications for the position.', 'On the other hand, the union maintained that Crenshaw was not unqualified because the Holley letter could not be read as an outright denial of the waiver application. Indeed, it left him with the option to reapply. Moreover, the union maintained that the dispute was arbitrable in light of the “enhanced status” that Crenshaw attained when he successfully completed his probationary period and became, under the specific terms of the CBA, a permanent employee.', 'In a written decision dated May 10, 2016, the trial justice agreed with the college that the dispute was not arbitrable. She determined that Crenshaw was unqualified by statute because he had neither completed the academy nor obtained a waiver.', 'The trial justice viewed the arbitrator’s interpretation of the CBA as negating the statutory prerequisite for out-of-state police officers to receive a waiver from the academy before becoming eligible for permanent employment in Rhode Island. She wrote that, by the arbitrator’s reasoning, “CCRI could ignore the Academy requirement indefinitely by allowing its police officers to remain on the job after the expiration of the probationary period with the contractual protections of employees.” In other words, because the grievance arose from Crenshaw’s failure to meet the minimum statutory qualifications of the job, and not from the provisions of the CBA, it was not subject to arbitration. The trial justice also concluded that the arbitration award restoring Crenshaw to the position of Campus Police Officer was irrational and manifestly disregarded a statutory requirement. Accordingly, the trial justice granted the college’s motion to vacate the arbitration award, and she denied the union’s motion to confirm the same.', 'Following the issuance of the trial justice’s decision, the union filed a motion for reconsideration. It did so because it had discovered that the General Order cited to, and quoted', '- 10 - from, in the trial justice’s decision was actually an incorrect version of the order. The order referred to by the trial justice, which had apparently been part of the record at the arbitration, contained a clause no longer present in the General Order that was in effect during the time of Crenshaw’s employment. That former section provided: “All waiver candidates shall be a non- probationary officer in good standing with their current police department/employer.” In fact, Crenshaw had been terminated by the Southborough Police Department well before his employment by CCRI, so the trial justice remarked that he obviously did not meet that condition precedent for a waiver and hence was not qualified for permanent employment under state law.', 'Upon learning that that requirement had been erroneously imposed, the union asked the trial justice to vacate her decision. In a bench decision, the trial justice assured the union that the incorrect General Order had not served as the basis for her decision, but rather, she had simply laid out its requirements in comprehensively reciting the facts and travel of the case. She also observed that Holley had undoubtedly relied on the correct General Order when she rendered her recommendation to the academy. Although the trial justice was “troubled by receiving an inaccurate record[,]” she concluded that “the discrepancy was not material to [her] decision that the dispute was not arbitrable,” and she therefore denied the union’s motion for reconsideration. The union timely appealed to this Court.', 'D', 'The Appeal', 'In our opinion, the arbitrability of the dispute between CCRI and Crenshaw is the nub of this appeal. The union maintains that the grievance was substantively arbitrable because there is no conflict between state law and the CBA, and thus the trial justice erred by determining otherwise. As the union sees it, the requirement that Crenshaw complete the academy or receive', '- 11 - a waiver therefrom did not excuse the college from its duty to give Crenshaw the pretermination due process to which he was entitled as a nonprobationary employee. The union further argues that, if this Court were to determine that the matter was indeed arbitrable, we should uphold the arbitration award on the merits. As a secondary, related issue, the union argues that the trial justice erred when she denied its motion for reconsideration. The union claims that the trial justice clearly relied on an incorrect General Order in finding the grievance to be nonarbitrable, and, therefore, she should have vacated her decision and addressed whether the award should be confirmed on the merits.', 'The college asserts that the trial justice was correct in concluding that the dispute was not arbitrable. According to CCRI, state law prohibits Crenshaw from holding the position of Campus Police Officer because he does not meet the statutory requirements for the position. Therefore, the college argues that the pretermination due process sought by the union and the reinstatement awarded by the arbitrator are legal nullities.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Generally, “judicial authority to review the merits of an arbitration award is very limited[,]” and absent very limited circumstances, the award will be upheld. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers v. State Department of Corrections, 707 A.2d 1229, 1234 (R.I. 1998). “However, notwithstanding this circumscribed standard of review, an arbitration award will be vacated if * * * the issue determined was not arbitrable in the first place, * * * or if the arbitrator has otherwise exceeded his or her powers, G.L. 1956 § 28-9-18(a)(2)[.]” Id. “[A]n arbitrator may exceed his or her powers by interpreting a CBA in such a way that it contravenes state law or other public policies that are not subject to alteration by arbitration.” Id. And, of', '- 12 - course, “an arbitrator is powerless to arbitrate that which is not arbitrable in the first place.” Id. “In these instances we do not apply the more deferential standard accorded to an arbitrator’s interpretation of a CBA on its merits; instead, we decide the question of arbitrability de novo.” Id.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'We begin by noting that there can be no argument that CCRI complicated this case greatly by not requesting the waiver for Crenshaw in a timely fashion—indeed, not until well after he had successfully completed the contractually prescribed 130-day probationary period. Clearly, it is contemplated that a prospective police officer, having received a conditional offer of employment from a sponsoring agency, attend and complete the training academy or receive a waiver before the expiration of his probationary period. Although the college apparently wished that Crenshaw continue to work there as a Campus Police Officer—despite the reasons set forth in the academy’s denial of his waiver application—it certainly did him no favors in the manner in which it administered his hiring, waiver application submission, and ultimate termination.', 'Despite those missteps, however, we need look no further than the applicable provisions of state law to resolve this case. When it enacted G.L. 1956 § 42-28.2-2, the General Assembly established the Municipal Police Training Academy School under the authority of the Director of the Department of Public Safety. In § 42-28.2-1, titled “Legislative declaration of intent[,]” the General Assembly provided us with its reasons for its doing so:', '“The legislature hereby finds and declares that police work, a basic', 'adjunct of law enforcement, is professional in nature, requiring', 'proper educational and clinical training in a state as densely', 'populated as Rhode Island; that in our free society, better law', 'enforcement can be achieved through higher standards of', 'efficiency in police work than in retributive measures against those', '- 13 -', 'who commit crime; that the protection of the health, safety, and', 'welfare of our citizens, can best be met by the creation of an', 'educational training and recruitment program for persons who seek', 'careers as police officers in order that such persons while serving', 'in a probationary capacity prior to permanent appointment will', 'receive training at approved recruit and in-service training', 'facilities; and that, by qualifying and becoming proficient in the', 'field of law enforcement, those persons will individually and', 'collectively better insure the health, safety, and welfare of the', 'citizens of this state in their respective communities.” The Legislature clearly expressed its intent that “persons who seek careers as police officers” be trained at the newly created academy “while serving in a probationary capacity prior to permanent appointment * * *.” Section 42-28.2-1.', 'In furtherance of these goals, the General Assembly established the commission on standards and training in § 42-28.2-3, cloaking that agency with the responsibility of establishing mandatory training standards, pursuant to § 42-28.2-8.', 'One standard the commission was charged with developing was “[m]inimum basic training requirements which police officers appointed to probationary terms shall complete before being eligible for continued or permanent employment * * *.” Section 42-28.2-8(5). To achieve the stated ends, the Legislature granted to the commission the discretionary power to “[a]dopt such regulations as are necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter.” Section 42-28.2-10(4).', 'One such regulation promulgated by the commission was reflected in General Order 2.100, “Basic Recruit Officers Program Waiver,” effective July 15, 2013. The stated purpose for the order was: “The Rhode Island Police Officers Commission on Standards and Training (RIPOST) requires all persons who seek permanent appointment to a police officer position and who have been previously certified by a Police Officers Standards and Training Commission * * * in another state to achieve a RIPOST Basic Recruit Officers Program Waiver.” The order went on to provide: “Out of state police officers, upon receiving a conditional offer of', '- 14 - employment and the sponsorship from a Rhode Island Law Enforcement agency shall seek a Basic Recruit Officers Program Waiver from the RIPOST prior to permanent employment as a police officer.” Accordingly, if, after receiving a conditional offer of employment from a Rhode Island agency, a prospective police officer has previously met the training qualifications necessary to serve as a police officer in another state, it is anticipated that he or she will obtain a waiver during his or her probationary period as set forth in General Order 2.100, instead of actually attending and completing the academy prior to permanent appointment in accordance with § 42-28.2-1.', 'This Court has previously discussed the requirements imposed by chapter 28.2 of title 42. In so doing, we have interpreted attendance at the academy as mandatory. In State v. Partington, 847 A.2d 272 (R.I. 2004), we were faced with the question of whether a municipality could send one of its probationary police officers to the Providence police training academy, as opposed to the municipal academy established under the authority of the Department of Public Safety. See § 42-28.2-2 (exempting Providence from the municipalities that must send their prospective police officers to the municipal police training academy). We framed the issue before us in that case as “whether potential police officers in Rhode Island must pass the course of training at the municipal academy * * *.” Partington, 847 A.2d at 276.', 'We then laid out the General Assembly’s “manifest” intent and the powers it bestowed upon the commission to effectuate those purposes. Id. at 276-77. With that in mind, we concluded that “when viewed in its entirety, chapter 28.2 of title 42 evinces a clear legislative intent that, except for Providence, all persons who seek careers as police officers in the state attend, and graduate from, the municipal academy to ensure that they meet minimum proficiency standards.” Id. at 278. Consequently, we held squarely that “all municipal police departments other than Providence are required to', '- 15 - send their probationary police officers to the municipal academy before such candidates become eligible for permanent employment as police officers * * *.” Id. (emphasis added).', 'Turning, in that light, to the arbitrability of the instant dispute, it is well settled that “our cases in this area all boil down to a fundamental proposition: applicable state employment law trumps contrary contract provisions, contrary practices of the parties, and contrary arbitration awards.” State v. Rhode Island Alliance of Social Services Employees, Local 580, SEIU, 747 A.2d 465, 469 (R.I. 2000) (RIASSE). Here, under the relevant state employment law, Crenshaw was not eligible to become a permanent police officer because he had not completed the academy requirement (which, per General Order 2.100, he could have fulfilled by receiving a waiver) prior to the expiration of his probation. It is our considered opinion, therefore, that Crenshaw cannot find refuge in the just cause and due process provisions of the CBA. We are thus drawn to the inescapable conclusion that the arbitrator arbitrated a dispute that was not arbitrable ab initio. See id. at 468 (“One sure way for an arbitrator to exceed his or her powers is to arbitrate a dispute that is not arbitrable in the first place.”). In other words, the arbitrator lacked the authority to reinstate Crenshaw to the position of Campus Police Officer because Crenshaw could not legally hold the position. The receipt of a waiver from the academy was “a valid employment requirement prescribed by state law[,]” and, as such, it was “not a proper subject for arbitration.” State (Department of Administration) v. Rhode Island Council 94, A.F.S.C.M.E., AFL-CIO, Local 2409, 925 A.2d 939, 945 (R.I. 2007) (quoting Town of West Warwick v. Local 2045, Council 94, 714 A.2d 611, 612 (R.I. 1998) (mem.)). Indeed, statutory obligations “certainly cannot be negated by an arbitrator who purports to do so through the medium of ‘contract interpretation.’” RIASSE, 747 A.2d at 469. “[I]f a statute contains or provides for nondelegable and/or nonmodifiable * * * obligations”—such as the academy', '- 16 - requirement—“then neither contractual provisions * * * nor arbitration awards that would alter those mandates are enforceable.” Id. It is for that reason that “labor disputes and grievances that seek to modify applicable state law are not subject to arbitration because the arbitrator has no power to do so * * *.” Id.', 'Our de novo review of the issue of arbitrability in this case leads us to declare that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by arbitrating a dispute that was nonarbitrable from the start. Crenshaw’s conditional offer of employment was just that: conditional.', 'His becoming a permanent police officer—covered by the CBA—was contingent on his satisfaction of the statutorily mandated academy requirement, whether by attendance and graduation or by waiver. Because Crenshaw failed to satisfy that statutory condition of employment, the arbitrator had no authority to decide a grievance seeking Crenshaw’s reinstatement to that position. See Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 707 A.2d at 1234. 4', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be returned to that tribunal. 4', 'Because we hold that the dispute in this case was nonarbitrable, we need not reach the issue of whether the trial justice erred when she denied the union’s motion for reconsideration. Indeed, relying on the correct version of General Order 2.100, this Court has reached the same conclusion as the trial justice. Suffice it to say, however, that we remain troubled by this occurrence.

37,Kevin M. Millette : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. Claiming that his defense counsel, who was not licensed to practice law in Rhode Island, was engaging in unlawful conduct, Kevin Millette (Millette or applicant) argues that he was denied his constitutional right to counsel when he pled nolo contendere to two criminal offenses and admitted to violating his probationary sentence. Millette further maintains that his defense counsel’s associate, who was licensed in Rhode Island and who appeared in court with Millette, was merely a “straw man” and thus complicit in the scheme to practice law without a license. We issued a writ of certiorari to review the Superior Court’s denial of Millette’s application for postconviction relief in this case of first impression. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On July 29, 2009, Millette was charged with obtaining money from Jeffrey Jillson under false pretenses with the intent to cheat or defraud Jillson (count 1) and intentionally appropriating Jillson’s money (count 2) (the Jillson matter). Millette was also presented as an alleged violator of a probationary sentence he had received upon his prior conviction for the charge of obtaining money under false pretenses from Leo David. Millette failed to appear at', '-1- court, and a warrant was issued. He was subsequently arrested out of state and arraigned on January 25, 2012. On April 10, 2012, Millette was charged in another criminal action with obtaining property from James Singleton under false pretenses with the intent to cheat or defraud Singleton (count 1) and intentionally appropriating Singleton’s property (count 2) (the Singleton matter).', 'On July 31, 2012, Millette pled nolo contendere to count 2 of the Jillson matter and to count 2 of the Singleton matter, and admitted to violating the terms of his probationary sentence.1 Prior to accepting the pleas, the trial justice asked Millette if he had signed the plea affidavits, if he had read them and understood them, and if he had the opportunity to discuss them with his attorney before signing them—to all of which Millette responded in the affirmative. The trial justice further inquired whether Millette understood that he was giving up various rights by entering his pleas, and he again responded affirmatively. The trial justice was satisfied that Millette entered his nolo contendere pleas “knowingly and voluntarily with a full understanding of the nature and consequences of his plea and corresponding waiver of his constitutional rights[,]” and accordingly the trial justice accepted the pleas. With respect to the Jillson matter, Millette was sentenced to twenty years in prison, with twelve years to serve and eight years suspended with probation; and, for the Singleton matter, Millette received a twenty- year suspended sentence with probation, to run consecutive to the first sentence.', 'On December 16, 2013, Millette filed a pro se application for postconviction relief in the Superior Court. In support of his application, Millette maintained, in pertinent part, that he had 1', 'In consideration of Millette’s pleas, the state dismissed the remaining counts in both matters pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-2- received ineffective assistance of counsel because his lawyer, Samuel Lovett (Lovett), of the law firm Lovett & Lovett, was not licensed to practice law in Rhode Island.2', 'On August 3, 2015, the same justice who presided over the 2012 plea proceedings held a hearing on Millette’s application for postconviction relief. Millette stated that he first became a client of Lovett & Lovett in approximately 2002 or 2003, when he sought legal advice concerning a real estate transaction. He maintained that Lovett represented him in the real estate transaction. Millette testified that he again contacted Lovett & Lovett in 2004 because someone was going to press charges against him for obtaining money under false pretenses. When asked whether Lovett’s ability to represent him in Rhode Island came up in their conversations, Millette replied in the negative.', 'Millette then discussed the Jillson matter. Millette testified that a letter from an attorney who represented Jillson prompted him to contact Lovett, who assured him that he would resolve the matter and negotiate the dispute. Millette also testified about the involvement of John Sylvia (Sylvia), an attorney at Lovett & Lovett who was licensed to practice law in Rhode Island. With respect to the Jillson matter, Millette said that he met Sylvia at the Lovett & Lovett office, and that Sylvia told him that he would handle his arraignment because Lovett had to be in Massachusetts for another case. Millette testified that, following his arraignment, he spoke with Sylvia only once or twice, but that he had frequent contact with Lovett.', 'On cross-examination, the state elicited the fact that Millette’s 2012 pleas were not his first pleas in a criminal case. In 1999, Millette had entered pleas in three separate criminal cases 2', 'In his postconviction-relief application, Millette raised various other arguments in support of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, including that Lovett gave him bad advice and that Lovett & Lovett had a conflict of interest because it had a relationship with the Providence Bruins hockey team and Jillson had played for that team. However, Millette did not address these arguments at the postconviction-relief hearing or press them on appeal.', '-3- and was represented by different counsel. Millette had also previously entered a plea in federal court and was represented by counsel other than Lovett. Additionally, Millette had entered a plea in Kent County Superior Court in 2004 and was represented by Sylvia.', 'With respect to his 2012 pleas, Millette testified that he met with Lovett, Sylvia, and other attorneys the day before he entered his pleas, and Lovett advised him to take the plea deal. The state asked Millette whether Sylvia met with him in court and if Sylvia had informed him of the state’s plea offer, to which Millette gave an affirmative reply. Millette and Sylvia discussed the state’s offer and Sylvia made a counteroffer, according to Millette. He testified that, after continued negotiations, Sylvia and the state agreed upon a disposition that resolved the pending criminal matters. Millette testified that Sylvia then “went through” the plea form with him.', 'Sylvia testified next. When asked whether he was aware that Lovett was not licensed to practice law in Rhode Island, he replied in the affirmative. Sylvia testified that he told Millette that he would represent him in the matter, and he stated that Millette “knew [he] was the Rhode Island attorney from the office.”', 'Regarding Millette’s 2012 pleas, Sylvia testified that he discussed with Millette the rights that he was waiving by pleading nolo contendere, and said that he “put a checkmark next to each of the rights as [he] explained them * * *.” Additionally, on the plea form, which was entered as a full exhibit, Sylvia’s signature appears in the signature box entitled “WITNESS (Attorney for the Defendant)[.]”', 'The trial justice then rendered his decision on Millette’s application for postconviction relief. With respect to Millette’s 2012 pleas, he determined there was “nothing whatsoever irregular about the proceedings.” He found that Millette was aware of the charges against him and the consequences of his pleas when he pled nolo contendere. Further, the trial justice determined that Sylvia, not Lovett, represented Millette in regard to his 2012 pleas, and that there', '-4- was no evidence that Sylvia’s representation of Millette was ineffective.', 'The trial justice concluded that Millette’s 2012 pleas were not invalidated by the fact that Lovett was not licensed to practice law in Rhode Island.', 'The trial justice entered judgment in favor of the state on September 3, 2015. On October 23, 2015, Millette petitioned this Court for the issuance of a writ of certiorari, seeking review of the denial of his application for postconviction relief. This Court issued a writ of certiorari on June 14, 2016.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court has previously stated that we will not disturb a trial justice’s factual findings made on an application for post[]conviction relief absent clear error or a showing that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence in arriving at those findings.” Dominick v.

Additionally, Millette asserts that “Lovett had a conflict of interest for a myriad of reasons, not the least of which was his personal relationship and dealings with the parties.” He avers that Lovett and Sylvia had a conflict of interest because “[a] vigorous defense would have exposed Lovett’s scheme and Sylvia’s cover up” and that, therefore, “Sylvia also needed to dispose of these matters quickly and quietly in order to maintain the status quo and avoid any inquiry by the Court, the State, the Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee, the Disciplinary Board, and Mr. Millette.”', 'A', 'Per Se Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', '“It is well established that, in this jurisdiction, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims are assessed under the familiar two-pronged test announced by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).” Reyes v. State, 141 A.3d 644, 654 (R.I. 2016). Under the test set forth in Strickland, an applicant for postconviction relief must first establish that “counsel’s performance was constitutionally 3', 'The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, in pertinent part: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.” Article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution provides, in relevant part: “In all criminal prosecutions, accused persons shall enjoy the right * * * to have the assistance of counsel in their defense * * *.”', '-6- deficient” by demonstrating “that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed * * * by the Sixth Amendment.” Id. (quoting Bido v. State, 56 A.3d 104, 110-11 (R.I. 2012)). Second, the applicant must demonstrate that he or she was prejudiced by counsel’s performance by showing “that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. at 655 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).', 'Here, however, we need not analyze Millette’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the Strickland test because he has not raised any arguments before this Court that the performance by Sylvia or Lovett was constitutionally deficient. Rather, Millette has conceded that there is “no question of competency here.” Millette instead claims that he received per se ineffective assistance of counsel because Lovett was not licensed to practice law in Rhode Island due to his failure to pass the Rhode Island bar examination.', 'Although Lovett was not licensed to practice law in Rhode Island, the application of a rule of per se ineffective assistance of counsel would be misplaced here because the trial justice found that Millette was represented by Sylvia, who was licensed to practice law in Rhode Island, a finding that we will not disturb unless we conclude that it is clearly erroneous or that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence in reaching it. Dominick, 139 A.3d at 431. We perceive no such error. At the postconviction-relief hearing, the trial justice heard testimony from Millette and Sylvia that elicited the following pertinent facts regarding representation of Millette with respect to his 2012 pleas. Sylvia testified that Millette was aware that Sylvia was Lovett & Lovett’s “Rhode Island attorney,” and that he told Millette that he would represent him in the criminal matters against him. On September 8, 2009, Sylvia entered his appearance on Millette’s behalf. Sylvia met with Millette in court prior to Millette entering his 2012 pleas, and', '-7- Sylvia informed Millette of the state’s plea offer. Sylvia discussed the state’s offer with Millette, continued negotiations with the state, and ultimately reached a resolution that disposed of the pending criminal matters. Sylvia then “went through” the plea form with Millette and discussed with him the rights that he was giving up by pleading nolo contendere. Additionally, on the plea form, Sylvia’s signature appears in the signature box entitled “WITNESS (Attorney for the Defendant)[.]” Based on the evidence adduced at the postconviction-relief hearing, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in finding that Sylvia, not Lovett, represented Millette in the criminal matters that are the subject of Millette’s postconviction-relief application.', 'Nevertheless, even if Lovett did represent Millette, his argument of per se ineffective assistance of counsel lacks merit. Millette cites to Solina v. United States, 709 F.2d 160 (2d Cir. 1983), in which the Second Circuit Court of Appeals applied a rule of per se ineffective assistance of counsel where the defendant was represented by someone who was not admitted to practice law in any state. Solina, 709 F.2d at 161, 168. However, “[a]lthough the Second Circuit and several other circuits apply a per se rule in some cases, they do not apply it to lawyers who are properly credentialed in another court.” United States v. Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d 914, 917 (5th Cir. 1998). As the Second Circuit has explained, “[t]he per se ineffectiveness rule is limited to situations ‘where, unbeknown to the defendant, his representative was not authorized to practice law in any state * * *.’” Elfgeeh v. United States, 681 F.3d 89, 92 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting Solina, 709 F.2d at 167).', 'Other courts that have adopted the rule of per se ineffective assistance of counsel have similarly limited it to situations where the defendant’s attorney was not licensed to practice law in any state. See, e.g., United States v. Bergman, 599 F.3d 1142, 1148 (10th Cir. 2010) (“We agree with the reasoning of the Second Circuit and adopt a narrow per se rule of ineffectiveness', '-8- where a defendant is, unbeknownst to him, represented by someone who has not been admitted to any bar * * *.”); United States v.

Jorbin, 728 P.2d 1246, 1246, 1247 (Ariz. Ct.

Van Pelt, 311 N.E.2d 184, 186 (Ill. App. Ct. 1974) (holding that “a defendant is not denied effective assistance of counsel merely because his attorney was not licensed to practice in Illinois”).', 'A case from our neighboring state, Commonwealth v. Melo, 851 N.E.2d 1124 (Mass. App. Ct. 2006), bears a close resemblance to the instant matter. In Melo, the Massachusetts Appeals Court was tasked with determining whether the defendant received per se ineffective assistance of counsel because the attorney who represented him was licensed to practice law in Rhode Island, but not in Massachusetts. Melo, 851 N.E.2d at 1128. The court rejected the defendant’s argument that his representation was per se ineffective, and concluded that the attorney’s “representation of the * * * defendant [fell] well within the category of cases not requiring automatic vacating of the conviction.” Id. at 1129. The court went further, holding that “[w]hile [the attorney’s] appearance in a Massachusetts court may be fodder for those interested in the unauthorized practice of law, it was not of a character that by itself requires relieving the', '-9- defendant of an otherwise just conviction.” Id. Guided by the above-referenced jurisprudence, we decline to apply a rule of per se ineffective assistance of counsel in the case under review, because, although Lovett was not licensed to practice law in Rhode Island, he was duly licensed in Massachusetts.4', 'B', 'Conflict of Interest', 'Millette also contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel on the ground that Lovett and Sylvia had a conflict of interest in representing him. “[I]n order to demonstrate a violation of his [or her] Sixth Amendment rights, a defendant must establish that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his [or her] lawyer’s performance.” Rivera v. State, 58 A.3d 171, 180 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 636 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 350 (1980))). “Under Cuyler v. Sullivan, * * * the Court explained that the mere ‘possibility’ of a conflict of interest is not enough to impugn a criminal conviction under the Sixth Amendment and rejected the contention that a criminal defendant is entitled to a reversal of his or her conviction whenever he or she makes ‘some showing of a possible conflict of interest or prejudice, however remote * * *.’” Simpson v.

See Dominick, 139 A.3d at 433 n.9 (“It is well established that this Court generally ‘consider[s] an issue to be waived when a party [s]imply stat[es] an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues * * *.’”) (quoting Bucci v. Hurd Buick Pontiac GMC Truck, LLC, 85 A.3d 1160, 1170 (R.I. 2014)).', 'In any event, Millette’s conflict-of-interest argument lacks merit. We first note that Millette’s assertion of a conflict of interest premised on Lovett’s lack of licensure in Rhode Island is not a separate and discrete argument, but rather is embedded within his request for application of the rule of per se ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, concern of a conflict of interest is one of the rationales behind application of the rule of per se ineffective assistance of counsel in cases where a defendant is represented by someone not licensed to practice law, “because of what it tends to prevent the [‘]attorney[’] from doing.” Solina, 709 F.2d at 164 (quoting Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 489-90 (1978)); see Elfgeeh, 681 F.3d at 92 (summarizing the two rationales behind the per se ineffective assistance of counsel rule and noting that “[t]he second rationale is based on notions of conflict of interest, and applies in cases * * * where the lawyer is not duly licensed” because “the defense is necessarily compromised * * * ”); Maria-Martinez, 143 F.3d at 916-17 (noting that one of the considerations underlying the per se rule of ineffective assistance of counsel is that “an undisclosed lack of credentials may create a conflict of interest”).', 'However, although courts have recognized that “an undisclosed lack of credentials may create a conflict of interest” by “provid[ing] an incentive for lackluster representation,” Maria-', '- 11 - Martinez, 143 F.3d at 916, this concern is inapplicable where the defendant has a licensed attorney of record. See Elfgeeh, 681 F.3d at 93 (concluding that there is “no basis for applying a per se ineffectiveness rule where * * * the defendant has a licensed attorney of record who signs all relevant papers and makes all relevant court appearances”). Consequently, because Millette was represented by a licensed Rhode Island attorney, Sylvia, Lovett’s lack of a license to practice law in Rhode Island does not create a conflict of interest.', 'Additionally, having concluded that the trial justice properly found that Sylvia, not Lovett, represented Millette with respect to his 2012 pleas, Millette’s remaining conflict-of-interest arguments with respect to Lovett are flawed. Any purported relationship that Lovett had with Jillson is immaterial, because Lovett did not represent Millette.', 'With respect to Millette’s conjecture that Sylvia had a conflict of interest because “he was complicit in several of Lovett’s misdeeds,” Millette has not put forth any evidence demonstrating that Sylvia had an actual conflict of interest. “A defendant cannot prevail on an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel merely by showing that his attorney had a potential conflict of interest during the representation.” Rivera, 58 A.3d at 180. Here, in rendering his ruling on Millette’s application for postconviction relief, the trial justice stated that he “observed nothing whatsoever irregular about the proceedings[,]” and that there was no evidence before him that “would undermine the voluntary nature of the pleas that were entered in July of 2012.” He further found that “there’s absolutely zero evidence that Mr. Sylvia’s representation was ineffective or that his actions as Mr. Millette’s attorney in connection with the plea proceedings didn’t meet the standard of care for a criminal lawyer representing a client in connection with the handling of a criminal case.”', '- 12 -', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice’s findings and conclusions are well supported by the record. Whatever incentive Lovett may have had to hide from the courts his malfeasance in practicing law in Rhode Island without a license, Millette has utterly failed to present evidence that demonstrated that Sylvia was harried by similar concerns. Indeed, one would have to leap a rather large inferential chasm to conclude that Sylvia would be willing to jeopardize his own law license and reputation to protect Lovett’s unlawful activities. The paucity of evidence that Millette offered did not convince the trial justice, nor does it persuade us.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court denying Millette’s application for postconviction relief and quash the writ of certiorari that we had issued.

38,Town of Cumberland : v. : Cumberland Town Employees Union et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. Before the Court is an appeal from a Providence County Superior Court hearing justice’s decision granting a motion to vacate an arbitration award in favor of the defendants, the Cumberland Town Employees Union and Norman Tremblay (Tremblay) (collectively, the union), brought by the plaintiff, the Town of Cumberland (the town), and denying the union’s cross-petition to confirm the same.1 This matter came before the Supreme Court on March 8, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, the Superior Court judgment in favor of the town is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to confirm the arbitration award. 1', 'While the action below named both the union and Tremblay, the notice of appeal to this Court indicates that only the union—and not Tremblay—is appealing the hearing justice’s decision.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts2 and Travel', 'Tremblay was employed by the town’s highway department as a light equipment operator for nearly thirteen years. At all relevant times, a collective bargaining agreement (the CBA) entered into between the town and the union governed his employment. On August 5, 2014, Tremblay “rolled” his ankle at work, tearing tendons and ligaments. As a result, he could not work, and he required surgery to repair the damage before he could resume his position. After encountering numerous health insurance delays, on June 24, 2015, Tremblay underwent his long- awaited surgery, but did not return to work while he was recovering.', 'During his absence, Tremblay remained a town employee, continuing to pay his union dues and contributing toward his health insurance benefits. Throughout that time, he maintained regular contact with the union, as well as with the town by way of its human resources department. At no point did the town inform Tremblay that he should request a leave of absence, and thus he did not do so.', 'On November 10, 2015, Tremblay received a letter from the town’s human resources department notifying him that his right to seek reinstatement to his position was terminated pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 28-33-47(c)(1)(vi)3 of the Workers’ Compensation Act (the WCA). In 2', 'These facts are uncontested. 3', 'That statute reads, in relevant part: “Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section * * * [t]he right to reinstatement to the worker’s former position under this section terminates upon * * * [t]he expiration of thirty (30) days after the employee reaches maximum medical improvement or concludes or ceases to participate in an approved program of rehabilitation, or one year from the date of injury, whichever is sooner * * *.” General Laws 1956 § 28-33-47(c)(1)(vi) (emphasis added).', '-2- support of that notice of termination, the town relied on the fact that a period in excess of one year had elapsed since his injury.', 'Three days after Tremblay received the letter, the union filed a grievance on his behalf, arguing that he had been terminated without just cause, in violation of Article 13.1 of the CBA.4 His grievance was held in abeyance until the conclusion of a separate workers’ compensation suit. Once that suit resolved, Tremblay followed the procedure for filing a grievance dictated in Article 4 of the CBA;5 based on that article, he brought his grievance first to the town’s human resources department and then to the mayor. Each denied his grievance. Dissatisfied, the union 4', 'Article 13.1 recites, in relevant part: “Disciplinary action may be imposed upon an employee only for just cause.” 5', 'Article 4.2 reads, in relevant part: “Any employee(s) who have a grievance must submit the grievance in writing to the Union within seven (7) calendar days of the aggrieved’s knowledge of said violation, or it shall not be considered a grievance under the terms of this Agreement.”', 'Article 4.3 continues:', '“There shall be a grievance procedure as follows:', '“1. Any employee who is aggrieved has the right to discuss his/her', 'grievance with his/her immediate supervisor with or without', 'his/her Union Representative present. * * *.', '“2.

The town argued primarily that the grievance was not arbitrable because § 28-33-47(d) grants the Workers’ Compensation Court exclusive jurisdiction over reinstatement disputes. Further, the town maintained that, per the WCA, Tremblay had lost his right to reinstatement as a matter of law when his absence exceeded one year, thus he no longer had an arbitrable claim for reinstatement. It continued that because “the termination actually occurred by operation of law and not by action of the [t]own, * * * Tremblay’s quarrel is with the law, not the [t]own.” Based on that contention, the town asserted that, to dispute his termination, Tremblay must challenge § 28-33-47(c)(1)(vi) in Workers’ Compensation Court to restore his reinstatement right because, absent that right, there was no contract right upon which the town could infringe.', 'The union countered that the town violated the CBA by terminating Tremblay without just cause because Article 20.2 of the CBA7 contemplated a leave of absence of up to two years.8 The union avowed that the WCA “specifically preserves superior contractual rights, and leaves intact contractual claims to enforce those right[s].” Moreover, the union asserted that, while the 6', 'Article 4.4 reads, in relevant part: “If the grievance is not satisfactorily resolved with the Mayor, it may be submitted to the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its rules then obtaining unless the parties mutually agree to an alternative method of resolution.” 7', 'Article 20.2 provides, in pertinent part, that: “Seniority shall be retained and shall accumulate during all leaves without pay, provided however, that in no case shall a leave of absence be granted for a period of more than two (2) years.” 8', 'Further, the union cites Article 3.8 of the CBA, which provides, in relevant part: “Seniority shall be considered lost for the following reasons: * * * When an employee has been discharged for just cause.”', '-4- WCA grants a one-year reinstatement right, “it does not trump the more generous provision of the CBA[,]” citing to § 28-33-47(b) of the WCA in support of that principle.9', 'In a written decision on December 13, 2016, the arbitrator concluded that Tremblay’s grievance was arbitrable. His decision explained that the grievance had merit because “[b]efore November 10 there [was] no indication that the [t]own did not consider Tremblay covered by the [CBA] and entitled to the protections of the [CBA].” He opined that Tremblay was still entitled to the benefits that the CBA afforded him because he “never ceased to be regarded as an employee and was not seeking reinstatement as contemplated by the statute.” In closing, he directed the town to reinstate Tremblay with full back pay and without the loss of benefits.', 'In Providence County Superior Court, the town petitioned to stay and to vacate the arbitration award, and the union filed a cross-petition to confirm and to enforce the same. On January 31, 2017, a Superior Court hearing justice heard argument on the motions. On February 23, 2017, he issued a written decision granting the town’s motion to vacate the award, explicating that the language of the statute clearly and unambiguously gave the Workers’ Compensation Court exclusive jurisdiction over reinstatement disputes. He further explained that the CBA’s seniority provision protected only an injured worker’s right to return to the same level of seniority and did not serve as authority whereby the CBA could supersede the WCA’s jurisdictional grant. The union timely appealed to this Court. 9', 'That statute reads as follows:', '“The right of reinstatement shall be subject to the provisions for', 'seniority rights and other employment restrictions contained in a', 'valid collective bargaining agreement between the employer and a', 'representative of the employer’s employees, and nothing shall', 'exempt any employer from or excuse full compliance with any', 'applicable provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42', 'U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and chapter 87 of title 42.” Section 28-33-', '47(b).', '-5-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Although “judicial authority to review or to vacate an arbitration award is limited, [this Court] must * * * [vacate] the award * * * [when] the arbitrator or arbitrators exceed * * * their powers.” State v.

Town of North Providence ex rel. Lombardi, 41 A.3d 239, 243 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v.', '“The right to compensation for an injury under chapters 29 – 38 of', 'this title, and the remedy for an injury granted by those chapters,', 'shall be in lieu of all rights and remedies as to that injury now', 'existing, either at common law or otherwise against an employer,', 'or its directors, officers, agents, or employees * * *.” “[T]he scope of the exclusive-remedy doctrine as embodied in workers’ compensation law depends upon whether the alleged work-related injury is one for which the applicable workers’ compensation statute provides a compensation remedy.” Nassa v. Hook-SupeRx, Inc., 790 A.2d 368, 372 (R.I. 2002). Further, “[t]he underlying purpose of the [WCA] is to compensate most injured employees adequately on the basis of a calculation of their actual wages.” Bailey v. American Stores, Inc./Star Market, 610 A.2d 117, 119 (R.I. 1992). However, the WCA’s remedial purpose has no footing when the grievant’s claim is based upon a CBA, and not the WCA. For that same reason, we sever our discussion of the exclusivity provision from the body of this opinion to assure the reader that it, in fact, is not as the dissent indicated “the very issue before the Court.”', 'As discussed at length herein, the union asserted that Tremblay was terminated in violation of the CBA, not the WCA. Moreover, we have held that the Workers’ Compensation Court “is not authorized to sit as a labor court and interpret the provisions of a collective bargaining agreement.” Peloquin v. ITT Hammel-Dahl, 110 R.I. 330, 332, 292 A.2d 237, 239 (1972). Because the union’s claim would require the Workers’ Compensation Court to do just that, the WCA’s exclusivity provision does not estop his grievance. The dissent’s desired resolution of this case—that is, for us to hold that the Workers’ Compensation Court is the appropriate body to determine whether an employee was terminated for just cause—would nullify bargained-for rights of the CBA and treat the issue before us as a claim for compensation, and not as a labor dispute.', '-7- Gordon, 30 A.3d 636, 638 (R.I. 2011)). As emphasized in the aforementioned statute, its application is triggered when an employee applies for reinstatement “under this section.” Section 28-33-47(d) (emphasis added). Yet, the union asserted that Tremblay was terminated without just cause in violation of the CBA. Specifically, the union argued that the CBA’s two- year allotted absence, rather than the one-year absence afforded by the WCA, applied to Tremblay.', 'In fact, it would have been fruitless for the union to bring Tremblay’s reinstatement action under § 28-33-47(d). Before the hearing justice, the union’s counsel agreed with the town’s counsel that reinstatement rights under the WCA expired after one year. The union’s counsel continued that, based on that one-year limit, it would have been “absurd” for the union to argue that Tremblay was entitled to relief in Workers’ Compensation Court. We echo that, had the union claimed that Tremblay was entitled to reinstatement under the WCA, that action would have been legally dead on arrival.', 'As such, the union did not seek Tremblay’s reinstatement “under this section” of the WCA, but rather based on rights that the union insisted the CBA afforded Tremblay beyond those delineated in the WCA. Thus, because the union did not bring Tremblay’s grievance in reliance on this statute, we hold that the statute has no bearing on the decision to arbitrate the dispute.', 'Still, we must address whether the union’s contention—that the CBA granted Tremblay greater rights than the WCA—was one that the arbitrator could properly decide. As it stands, our caselaw highlights that an arbitrator “exceed[s] his or her powers by interpreting a CBA in such a way that it contravenes state law * * *.” Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers v. State Department of Corrections, 707 A.2d 1229, 1234 (R.I. 1998). We have held that “state law', '-8- will trump contrary contract provisions when the statute provides for nondelegable or nonmodifiable duties and responsibilities in connection with the functions of state government. * * * But there must be a direct conflict between the statutory language and a competing contractual provision.”', 'State (Department of Administration) v. Rhode Island Council 94, A.F.S.C.M.E., AFL-CIO, Local 2409, 925 A.2d 939, 945 (R.I. 2007) (emphasis added).', 'In the case before us, we are of the opinion that the WCA and the CBA can coexist in that the provisions at issue are not mutually exclusive. We have never held that a CBA cannot afford more rights than state law; in fact, quite the opposite is true. If “there exists ‘a valid and an enforceable collective-bargaining agreement whose terms provide greater * * * benefits than is afforded by the special legislation,’ * * * [then] the provision of the collective bargaining agreement takes precedence over the special act.” Webster v. Perrotta, 774 A.2d 68, 81-82 (R.I. 2001) (quoting Chester v. aRusso, 667 A.2d 519, 521 (R.I. 1995)). That the CBA grants employees—like Tremblay—greater benefits than the WCA is an exhibition of the parties’ freedom of contract, which should not be statutorily abridged in this case.11', 'In sum, applying § 28-33-47(d) as written, our conclusion is that the union necessarily sought Tremblay’s reinstatement under the CBA. See McCain, 41 A.3d at 243. Accordingly, 11', 'While recognizing the paucity of cases having precedential value, we find comfort in knowing that the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court has similarly held that “when a collective bargaining agreement exists, the statute shall not apply.” Turcotte v.

Overturning the trial judge, this appellate panel held it could not[.]”).', '-9- because the union did not seek Tremblay’s reinstatement under § 28-33-47(d), we hold that the action was arbitrable.12', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. The case is remanded to Superior Court with instructions to reinstate the arbitrator’s decision.', 'Justice Goldberg, with whom Chief Justice Suttell joins, dissenting. Because I am of the opinion that the issues in this case have been exclusively and unequivocally committed by the General Assembly to the Workers’ Compensation Court, I respectfully dissent. This is a workers’ compensation case, not an arbitrable labor dispute between the Town of Cumberland and the Cumberland Town Employees Union. The employee, Norman Tremblay (Tremblay), suffered a work-related injury to his ankle on August 5, 2014. Surgery to correct the injury was not performed until June 2015, allegedly because of the recalcitrance of the town’s insurer in approving the surgery. In any event, on November 10, 2015, fifteen months after the date of the injury and five months after the surgery, Tremblay was notified by the town that his right to reinstatement terminated in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 23-33-47(c)(1)(vi) because more than one year had elapsed since the date of his injury and, according to the town, Tremblay remained 12', 'Although the bulk of the parties’ argument focused on arbitrability, we pause briefly to remark that we agree with the hearing justice that the town did not assert any argument other than arbitrability that would justify setting aside the award.

In Rossi v. State of Rhode Island, W.C.C. No. 97-05577 (App. Div. 1998), the Appellate Division, citing the exclusivity provision, declared that this Court “has made it plain beyond dispute that the Workers’ Compensation Court is the forum for workers’ compensation controversies between the employer and the employee.” In Turcotte v. Stop & Shop Companies, Inc., W.C.C. No. 95- 01307 (App. Div. 1995), the Appellate Division held that the reinstatement provision of the Workers’ Compensation Act was subordinate to a collective bargaining agreement that provided less protection to the injured worker; that agreement read:', '“In the event that an employee is unable to work due to sickness,', 'pregnancy or accident, the employee shall be re-employed at such', 'time as the employee is able to resume his normal duties, provided', 'that the employee is able to resume such duties within 6-months.” Although this provision fails to address work-related injuries, the Appellate Division decreed that § 28-33-47(b), which provided that the “right to reinstatement shall be subject to * * * employment restrictions contained in a valid collective bargaining agreement,” was subordinate to the contract. What is most important about these cases, however, is that they were decided in the Workers’ Compensation Court, where they belonged.', 'There is another unpublished decision, from the Superior Court, that was relied upon by the town at the arbitration hearing and was soundly rejected by the arbitrator in light of this Court’s pronouncements that unpublished opinions have no precedential value. Nonetheless, Catholic Cemeteries v. R.I. Laborers District Council, No. 04-6148, 2005 WL 957734 (R.I. Super. Ct.

An arbitrator ordered his reinstatement and rejected the employer’s argument that the dispute was not substantively arbitrable.', 'The arbitrator found that the employee was terminated without just cause, and he was reinstated to his position. The Superior Court justice vacated the award on the ground that the grievance was not arbitrable. He found unpersuasive the arbitrator’s reliance on the seniority provision set forth in § 28-33-47(b). The Superior Court justice rejected the arbitrator’s interpretation of § 28-33-47(b) that a grievant’s right to reinstatement “shall be determined solely by the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between the relevant parties.” The trial justice cogently reasoned that the employee failed to act within the time requirement of the Workers’ Compensation Act, and that his failure to do so was fatal.', '“Reading § 28-33-47 in its entirety, it is apparent to this Court that reinstatement of an injured worker is arbitrable under a collective bargaining agreement only if the grievant has followed the procedures set forth in the Workers’ Compensation Act.” Catholic Cemeteries, 2005 WL 957734, at *4.

39,"Christine Adams et al. : v. : Santander Bank, N.A. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The plaintiffs, Christine Adams and George J. Adams, Jr., appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court in favor of the defendant, Santander Bank, N.A. 1 This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral arguments, and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'There appears to be some confusion as to whether George Adams remains involved in this case. Our review of the record reveals that Mr. Adams signed the notice of appeal. However, there is no docketed entry of appearance of an attorney representing Mr. Adams nor has Mr. Adams filed anything with this Court since the appeal was docketed. Moreover, Mr. Adams did not appear at oral argument. Therefore, although the outcome of this appeal remains unchanged, it would appear that Christine Adams is the only plaintiff properly before this Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On February 19, 2013, Santander conducted a foreclosure sale on property located in Pawtucket. According to a complaint filed in February 2014, that property was owned by Christine Adams. In that complaint, Christine Adams sued Santander, alleging that she was the owner of the property and that Santander had improperly foreclosed on it. The complaint also alleged that plaintiff had filed for bankruptcy in advance of Santander’s scheduled foreclosure sale, which, she alleged, should have operated to stay the sale. 2 The plaintiff also moved for and obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining Santander from selling or transferring the Pawtucket property. 3', 'Several months later, plaintiff amended her complaint. In addition to reasserting her claim that Santander improperly foreclosed on her property during the pendency of her bankruptcy, plaintiff alleged that Santander had failed to comply with the notice requirements set forth in G.L. 1956 §§ 34-27-4(a) and 34-27-4(b) before it conducted the February 19 sale. Respectively, she asserted that § 34-27-4(a) required Santander to give notice of the foreclosure sale by publication “at least once per week for three consecutive weeks” and that § 34-27-4(b) required Santander to give her proper notice by certified mail within thirty days of the publication of the foreclosure sale. In plaintiff’s view, Santander did neither. 2', 'By the time Christine Adams filed suit in February 2014, her bankruptcy case had been closed for several months. After filing for bankruptcy in January 2013, she voluntarily dismissed her petition for bankruptcy just a month later. According to the record, that case was closed in April 2013. 3', 'The motion was based on an affidavit in which Christine Adams stated that she “was the lawful owner” of the property when she filed for bankruptcy prior to the date of foreclosure. Although the record does not specifically indicate what happened to the temporary restraining order that Christine Adams obtained in February 2014, Santander later moved to dissolve it.', '-2-', 'In September 2014, plaintiff amended her complaint for a second and final time. This time, she narrowed the focus of the lawsuit against Santander. She dropped her claim that Santander improperly held the foreclosure sale while her bankruptcy case was pending. That left but a single claim: that Santander did not comply with the notice provisions set forth in §§ 34- 27-4(a) and 34-27-4(b). However, in addition to narrowing the focus of the complaint, plaintiff also added a second plaintiff, her father, George Adams. As noted in the motion to amend, it was George, 4 not Christine, who was “the individual with whom Santander executed a mortgage” on the Pawtucket property. 5', 'In July 2016, Santander moved for summary judgment and filed a detailed memorandum, attached to which were thirty exhibits documenting George’s default on the promissory note that was secured by the mortgage on the Pawtucket property, as well as Santander’s efforts to foreclose on that property.', 'Included in those exhibits were three documents of particular relevance: a letter dated November 16, 2012, sent by certified mail to George at the address of the Pawtucket property; a letter sent on the same date to Christine by certified mail to the address of the Pawtucket property; and an affidavit of Santander’s foreclosure counsel stating that notice of the foreclosure sale had been published in The Providence Journal on December 18, 2012, December 25, 2012, and January 1, 2013. Based on the evidence it proffered, Santander argued that it had complied with the statutory notice provisions of §§ 34-27-4(a) and 34-27-4(b) before the February 19, 2013 sale. 4', 'Where necessary and in the interest of clarity, we refer to the parties by their first names. In doing so, no disrespect is intended. 5', 'Apparently, through a series of transactions, which Santander characterizes as “evasive maneuvers,” Christine Adams, along with her son, obtained title to the property in March 2012. Although there may have been fertile ground for Santander to challenge whether she had standing to bring this case, that issue was not raised below and we need not address it now.', '-3-', 'In response, counsel for plaintiffs filed a one-page memorandum in opposition to the motion for summary judgment. In that document, plaintiffs’ counsel cited two reasons for opposing the motion. First, he wrote, “the [p]laintiffs state that there remain genuine issues of material fact such that [Santander] is not entitled to [s]ummary [j]udgment, as a matter of law.” He did not, however, elaborate on or even identify the material facts that he claimed were in dispute. Second, he averred “that discovery is ongoing,” and that forthcoming depositions of Santander’s employees would “call into question the validity of the mortgage document * * *.” The record reveals that, aside from filing that cursory memorandum in opposition to Santander’s motion, there were no documents, depositions, or affidavits produced to counter Santander’s evidence of its compliance with §§ 34-27-4(a) and 34-27-4(b).', 'Therefore, it should come as no surprise that, after a hearing in December 2016, a justice of the Superior Court granted Santander’s motion, and judgment entered shortly thereafter. It is from that judgment that plaintiffs appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews a trial court’s grant of summary judgment de novo.” Mruk v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 82 A.3d 527, 532 (R.I. 2013). Like the trial justice, “[i]n deciding a motion for summary judgment, [we] view[] the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Id. “Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact is evident from ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits if any,’ and * * * the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.” Id. (quoting Swain v. Estate of Tyre, 57 A.3d 283, 288 (R.I. 2012)). Once a party has moved for summary judgment, “[t]he nonmoving party bears', '-4- the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.” Id. (quoting Daniels v. Fluette, 64 A.3d 302, 304 (R.I. 2013)). Still, we are mindful “that summary judgment is to be employed cautiously because it is such an extreme remedy[.]” Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 394 (R.I. 2008).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'This appeal has less to do with whether Santander properly noticed the foreclosure sale of the Pawtucket property than it has to do with plaintiffs’ burden in responding to Santander’s motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs first argue that Santander failed to comply with the notice provisions of §§ 34-27-4(a) and 34-27-4(b). As a result, they aver, Santander’s foreclosure is null and void. Yet, as Santander points out, plaintiffs have produced no evidence to back up their claims. Indeed, the only evidence in the record reveals that Santander did in fact give notice of its foreclosure sale of the Pawtucket property in compliance with §§ 34-27-4(a) and 34-27-4(b). The plaintiffs’ bare assertions otherwise—“that there remain genuine issues of material fact” and that “discovery is ongoing”—fall well short of “proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact * * *.” Mruk, 82 A.3d at 532 (quoting Daniels, 64 A.3d at 304). “As we have often explained, ‘[o]nce the moving party establishes grounds for [summary] judgment, the opposing party, who counters that there is a material factual dispute, * * * must set forth specific facts that would constitute a genuine issue for resolution at trial.’” McGovern v. Bank of America, N.A., 91 A.3d 853, 858 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Riel v. Harleysville Worcester Insurance Co., 45 A.3d 561, 570 (R.I. 2012)). Once Santander established that it complied with §§ 34-27-4(a) and 34-27-4(b), plaintiffs “ha[d] an affirmative', '-5- duty to demonstrate * * * a genuine issue of fact” showing otherwise. Id. (quoting Robert B. Kent et al., Rhode Island Civil Procedure § 56:5, VII-28 (West 2006)). This they have failed to do.', 'Moreover, plaintiffs contend that summary judgment is improper here because, as they allege, Santander also failed to comply with a notice provision that is contained in the mortgage. 6 However, our review of the record indicates that this is the first time they have raised such an argument, thereby implicating our “raise-or-waive” rule.', 'As we have explained, “[i]n accordance with this Court’s longstanding ‘raise-or-waive’ rule, if an issue was not properly asserted, and thereby preserved, in the lower tribunals, this Court will not consider the issue on appeal.” Miller v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 160 A.3d 975, 980 (R.I. 2017).', 'The record reveals that nowhere in the complaint, first amended complaint, or second amended complaint is there any mention of or reference to a notice provision in the mortgage itself. In their second amended complaint, plaintiffs squarely presented the issue of Santander’s adherence to the aforementioned statutory notice provisions. However, that complaint is silent with respect to any contractual notice provision. Moreover, the memorandum in opposition to Santander’s motion for summary judgment says nothing about contractual notice.', 'Further compounding plaintiffs’ problem on this point is the fact that neither Christine nor George ordered or produced to this Court a transcript of the December 2016 summary judgment hearing. This is a concrete example of the sort of “risky business” associated with failing to order a transcript of the proceeding below. See Bellevue-Ochre Point Neighborhood Association v. Preservation Society of Newport County, 151 A.3d 1223, 1229 n.8 (R.I. 2017) (“The decision to pursue an appeal without ordering the full transcript of the Superior Court 6', 'The plaintiffs have neither provided this Court with a copy of that mortgage nor directed us to the pertinent notice provision contained therein.', '-6- proceeding is ‘risky business.’” (quoting Holden v. Salvadore, 964 A.2d 508, 513 (R.I. 2009))). We conclude without hesitation that the issue of whether Santander complied with any contractual pre-foreclosure notice provision has been waived. See Miller, 160 A.3d at 980. 7', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'After reviewing the record and considering the arguments of the parties, we hold that, because there is no genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether Santander complied with the notice requirements of §§ 34-27-4(a) and 34-27-4(b), summary judgment was appropriate in this case. See Mruk, 82 A.3d at 532. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The papers shall be remanded to that court. 7', 'The plaintiffs also argue that Santander failed to comply with certain Treasury Regulations. However, this argument, which was raised for the first time on appeal, was not developed to any extent, leaving us unable to consider or discuss it. See Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n.1 (R.I. 2002) (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”).', '-7- STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'Christine Adams et al. v.

40,v. : Brandon Alves. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court.', 'The defendant, Brandon Alves (Alves or defendant), appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction on count 1, robbery in the first degree, and count 2, conspiracy. Alves was found guilty of both counts by a jury, and the trial justice sentenced him to the Adult Correctional Institutions for fifteen years, with six years to serve and nine years suspended with probation as to count 1, and ten years suspended as to count 2. Alves seeks to have his conviction and sentence vacated, and asks this Court to grant him a new trial on the grounds that the trial justice erred in admitting into evidence identification testimony and a photograph identification. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On February 7, 2014, Farhan Mustafa was closing his cell-phone-repair shop for the evening when two men entered from the back door and held “guns right in [his] face” and robbed him. Mustafa recognized one of the assailants as “Big D.” Although he did not know the second assailant, Mustafa testified that the man was “very familiar,” and that he had observed him for ten to fifteen seconds from less than two feet away. Mustafa called the Providence police to report the incident and also called his friend, Ryan Gallant, who, Mustafa testified, knew Big D.', '-1- At the Providence police station, Mustafa met with Detective Ronald Riley and described the assailants. He described the second assailant as between five feet eight inches and five feet ten inches tall, with a medium complexion. Detective Riley then showed Mustafa a series of ten to fifteen photographs, from which Mustafa identified the first assailant, Big D. The following day, Det. Riley presented Mustafa with another photo array to identify the second assailant, but Mustafa did not find the second assailant among the photographs presented.', 'Later that day, in a further attempt to identify the second assailant, Mustafa and Gallant visited a website that featured pictures of patrons at various Rhode Island nightclubs. After looking at between twenty and twenty-five photographs, Mustafa identified a photograph depicting the second assailant. Mustafa recognized the assailant “right away.” Gallant informed Mustafa of the name of the man Mustafa had identified in the photograph. Mustafa printed the website photograph and brought it to Det. Riley. Detective Riley asked Mustafa to draw a circle around the individual he identified. Mustafa then wrote “Brandon New Bedford” in the upper left corner of the image, and signed and dated the photograph.', 'On April 16, 2014, Mustafa received a text message from Gallant reporting the then- current location of the second assailant. Mustafa informed the police, who responded and arrested Alves. Two days later, Det. Riley showed Mustafa a single photograph of Alves from a shared-law-enforcement database. Detective Riley testified that he showed Mustafa a single photograph because “[Mustafa] [had] already identified the suspect in the previous photo he gave” to Det. Riley, and that this single photograph was meant to confirm “the name and date of birth” of the suspect. According to Det. Riley, “As soon as [he] put the * * * photo [of Alves] down in front of [Mustafa],” Mustafa “immediately identified” the individual depicted as the second assailant, with one hundred percent confidence.', '-2-', 'Alves was charged with first-degree robbery and conspiracy. He filed a motion to suppress the single photograph shown to Mustafa by Det. Riley. At a hearing on the motion, Alves argued that the identification procedure was “unnecessarily suggestive,” and that there was a “substantial likelihood of misidentification” such that he was denied due process of law. The trial justice denied Alves’s motion and determined that the photographic depiction was not “an unnecessarily suggestive procedure.” A jury trial commenced shortly thereafter, which resulted in Alves’s conviction for first-degree robbery and conspiracy. He timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v.

Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 805 (R.I. 2005)). “The trial justice will not have abused his or her discretion as long as some grounds supporting his or her decision appear in the record.” Id.

The defendant argues that this testimony was impermissible hearsay.1', '“Hearsay is defined in Rule 801(c) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence as ‘a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.’” State v. Gomez, 116 A.3d 216, 226 (R.I. 2015) (quoting R.I. R. Evid. 801(c)). “Rule 802 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence sets forth the general prohibition against the admissibility of hearsay statements other than those well- recognized exceptions carved out by law.” Id. “[A] determination of whether an out-of-court statement meets an exception to the hearsay rule is within the trial justice’s discretion.” Id. (quoting State v. Watkins, 92 A.3d 172, 187 (R.I. 2014)). “Under this standard, this Court will uphold the trial justice’s ruling unless a clear ‘abuse of discretion that prejudices the complaining party is shown.’” Id. (quoting Watkins, 92 A.3d at 187).', 'At trial, the state questioned Mustafa, “[D]id you write anything on the photo when you saw Detective Riley?” and Mustafa began to answer, “[Gallant told] me that is his name so I wr[o]te it[,]” at which point defense counsel objected. The trial justice overruled the objection and stated, “I will permit the answer to stand to explain why he wrote on the photograph. It is not for the truth of the matter asserted, only to explain why he would make a marking on that photograph and no other reason.”', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice should have stricken Mustafa’s answer, which explained that Gallant informed him of the name of the individual depicted in the photograph they found online, as impermissible hearsay. We are of the opinion, however, as was 1', 'The defendant also argues that his “name could have been obscured or redacted” from the photograph exhibit; but defendant neither objected to the written caption nor requested a redaction before the trial justice. Therefore, this issue is waived. See State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 646 (R.I. 2006).', '-4- the trial justice, that the testimony at issue was not offered “for the truth of the matter asserted”—i.e., that a man named Brandon was the individual in the photograph—but was offered, instead, to explain why Mustafa wrote on the photograph. Mustafa had already, on his own, identified the individual depicted in the photograph as the second assailant. As noted by the trial justice in his oral ruling on defendant’s motion to suppress the identification, Mustafa “immediately without any difficulty, without any hesitation when he saw Mr. Alves’ face in that group photograph he said that is the second guy who robbed him.”', 'Moreover, the jurors had access to the photographic evidence and could determine for themselves whether defendant was the individual depicted in the photograph. Finally, we note that Gallant testified at trial and was thereby subject to cross-examination regarding his statement to Mustafa about the name of the individual in the photograph. See State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984, 990 (R.I. 2004) (“Even evidence that traditionally would be categorized as hearsay * * * d[oes] not alter the fact that the Confrontation Clause’s requirements are satisfied when a hearsay declarant is present at trial, is placed under oath and is subject to unrestricted cross-examination, thus affording the jury an opportunity to observe the witness’s demeanor.”). Therefore, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion, and the statement at issue was not hearsay.', 'B', 'The defendant’s second assignment of error is that the trial justice abused his discretion by failing to suppress the single photograph of defendant shown to Mustafa by Det. Riley. The defendant argues that the display of the single photograph by Det. Riley violated his right to due process and was “unnecessarily suggestive and misleading.”', '-5-', '“In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress an identification that was allegedly tainted by an unduly suggestive procedure, we carry out a two-step analysis.” State v. Franco, 750 A.2d 415, 420 (R.I. 2000). “First, we must determine whether ‘the totality of circumstances discloses procedures that were so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification that it constituted a denial of due process of law.’” Id. (quoting State v. Andrade, 657 A.2d 538, 541 (R.I. 1995)). “Only if we determine that the procedures were unduly suggestive do we proceed to the second step of our analysis and assess the reliability of the identification.” Id. Absent “a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification[,]” the out-of-court identification should be admitted. Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968).', 'In the case under review, we need go no further than the first prong of the analysis, indeed if we need go that far. The presentation to Mustafa of the single photograph of defendant was not so much an identification procedure as it was a confirmation of the identification that Mustafa had already made. The evidence revealed that Mustafa was accosted by two individuals brandishing guns as he was closing his cell-phone-repair shop. He had a clear view of their faces for ten to fifteen seconds, from two feet away. Mustafa immediately recognized one of the assailants and said that the other had a very familiar face.', 'With the help of Gallant, but without any police assistance, Mustafa was soon able to positively identify defendant as the second assailant. Approximately two months later, after defendant was arrested, Mustafa instantly identified the second suspect from the individual photograph depicting defendant. Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that the use of a single photograph was neither unnecessarily suggestive, nor did it implicate defendant’s right to due process. See Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 238-39 (2012) (“[D]ue process', '-6- concerns arise only when law enforcement officers use an identification procedure that is both suggestive and unnecessary.”).', 'The facts here are analogous to those in State v. Luciano, 739 A.2d 222 (R.I. 1999), in which this Court ruled that “use of an individual picture of [a] defendant was not unnecessarily suggestive” where witnesses had identified the defendant as the shooter before they were shown the individual photograph of the defendant, because the police had not suggested that the man in the photograph was the shooter, but “simply showed the picture to confirm [the witnesses’ previous] identification.” Luciano, 739 A.2d at 226. Here, Mustafa identified defendant through his own research, without the help of the police. Detective Riley’s display of the individual photograph to Mustafa was strictly a means to confirm the identification Mustafa had already made and relayed to police. Consequently, the photograph display was not unduly suggestive, and the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the photograph into evidence.', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred in admitting the photograph because he did not consider whether Mustafa’s identification was reliable. Again, this Court has made clear that “[o]nly if we determine that the procedures were unduly suggestive do we proceed to the second step of our analysis and assess the reliability of the identification.” Franco, 750 A.2d at 420.', 'Because this Court has determined that the photograph display was not unduly suggestive, we need not proceed to any further analysis regarding reliability.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

41,"Endoscopy Associates, Inc. : v. : Rhode Island Department of Health. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'The petitioner, Endoscopy Associates, Inc. (Endoscopy), appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court that reversed a decision by the Rhode Island Department of Health (the DOH) to grant an application for a Health Care Certificate of Need (CON). This Court granted a petition for a writ of certiorari on February 23, 2016. The parties appeared before the Supreme Court on February 7, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised on appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons discussed herein, we quash the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Endoscopy is a Rhode Island physician-owned professional corporation that provides gastroenterology services to its patients. Five years ago, on January 10, 2013, Endoscopy applied for a CON with the DOH pursuant to the Health Care Certificate of Need Act of Rhode Island, G.L. 1956 chapter 15 of title 23 (the Act), seeking to change its license from a physician', '-1- ambulatory surgery center (PASC) to a freestanding ambulatory surgery center (FASC). As a PASC licensee, Endoscopy is limited to a physician-owned and -operated facility, and by converting to a FASC license, Endoscopy would be able to expand its corporate ownership to nonphysicians and have nonowner physicians practicing in the facility. However, under the Act, a CON will not be approved without an', '“adequate demonstration of need by the applicant at the time and', 'place and under the circumstances proposed, nor shall the approval', 'be made without a determination that a proposal for which need', 'has been demonstrated is also affordable by the people of the', 'state.” Section 23-15-4(b). In its CON application, Endoscopy:', '“[P]ropose[d] to transition to and obtain a license to operate as a', 'freestanding ambulatory surgery center in order to increase its', 'options with respect to its ownership structure. The Applicant', 'currently does not have any plans to change its ownership', 'structure, however, as a physician ambulatory surgery center the', 'Applicant can only be owned by physicians and allow owners to', 'utilize the facility. Upon approval of this CON application, the', 'Applicant would have the option, if ultimately desired, to (i) allow', 'a non-physician to purchase an ownership interest in the Applicant;', 'and (ii) allow non-owner physicians to utilize the facility.”', 'Endoscopy also included a report by Harvey Zimmerman (the Zimmerman Report) that had been commissioned by the DOH entitled “Assessment of Need for Ambulatory Surgery Capacity in Rhode Island: 2009[.]” The Zimmerman Report indicated that, in 2013, sixty-one endoscopy rooms would be needed, but only fifty-seven would be available. In reliance on the Zimmerman Report, Endoscopy contended that there will be a future need to expand, and that operating under a FASC would allow them to meet the need at that time.', 'Additionally, Endoscopy relied on a Rhode Island Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan from 2007, which recommended an increase in the rate of endoscopic screenings for colorectal cancer. Endoscopy’s application also indicated that it was operating at near capacity and had an expected', '-2- utilization rate of 92 percent through 2015, and therefore there was an “obvious need” to change its licensure to a FASC. However, Endoscopy also acknowledged that it had no current plan to change its corporate ownership structure, and that, at the time of its application, its facility was satisfying existing patient needs and services.', 'Endoscopy’s CON application was first reviewed by Project Review Committee-I of the Health Services Council (HSC), an advisory board for the DOH.', 'A competing provider, Blackstone Valley Surgicare Acquisition, L.P. (Blackstone Valley), which operates as a FASC in Johnston, Rhode Island, intervened and filed a letter in opposition to Endoscopy’s application. Blackstone Valley argued that Endoscopy could not meet its burden of proving need and affordability, and that the CON statute and regulations were not designed as a corporate restructuring tool. Following multiple proceedings before the Project Review Committee-I, the committee voted to recommend that the CON be approved. Subsequently, on July 30, 2013, Endoscopy’s CON came under full review by the HSC. Again, Blackstone Valley objected and argued that Endoscopy failed to meet its burden of proving public need for the FASC. The HSC reviewed Endoscopy’s CON application and similarly recommended that the CON be granted. The HSC reasoned that the application identified an adequate need and also satisfied the requirement that the proposal be affordable.', 'On August 5, 2013, the recommendations from the Project Review Committee-I and the HSC came before the director of the DOH. Blackstone Valley submitted another letter in opposition. The director ultimately accepted the positive recommendations and found:', '“The state agency has applied the relevant criteria in the', 'appropriate statute and rules and regulations, and has accorded to', 'them the appropriate weight, and has considered the record and', 'criteria with due deference and balance to those matters which the', 'state agency has deemed to have priority importance.”', '-3- The director then granted the CON, subject to seventeen conditions.1', 'Blackstone Valley requested administrative review pursuant to the Act.2', 'Blackstone Valley argued that the evidence in the record did not support the DOH’s decision that the CON identified a public need for another FASC.', 'An administrative hearing officer from the Department of Administration (the DOA) conducted this administrative review and issued a decision that reversed the approval granted by the DOH.', 'The hearing officer concluded that the CON was in violation of statutory and regulatory requirements and did not demonstrate a public need. The hearing officer declared that “[a] CON decision needs to weigh those considerations [enumerated in § 23-15-4(e)] in order to find whether there is a substantial and/or obvious community need. Such findings were not made by the [d]ecision.” The hearing officer declared that whether Endoscopy had the flexibility to change its corporate structure in the future was not a public need. On February 27, 2014, Endoscopy filed for judicial review in the Superior Court, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15.3', 'In the Superior Court, the trial justice, in accordance with § 42-35-15, determined that § 42-35-15(g) “makes explicit that the Superior Court reviews ‘the decision of the agency[,]’” 1', 'The seventeen conditions adopted by the director of the DOH are not relevant to this appeal. 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 23-15-6(b)(10) provides that,', '“upon the request of any affected person, the decision of the state', 'agency to issue, deny, or withdraw a certificate of need or to grant', 'or deny an exemption shall be administratively reviewed under an', 'appeals mechanism provided for in the rules and regulations of the', 'state agency, with the review to be conducted by a hearing officer', 'appointed by the director of health. The procedures for judicial', 'review shall be in accordance with the provisions of § 42-35-15.”', '(Emphasis added.) 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 42-35-15, entitled “Judicial review of contested cases,” states in pertinent part: “Any person, including any small business, who has exhausted all administrative remedies available to him or her within the agency, and who is aggrieved by a final order in a contested case is entitled to judicial review under this chapter.” Section 42-35-15(a).', '-4- and therefore declared that her review would be limited to the decision of the DOH, rather than the decision of the DOA hearing officer. The trial justice concluded that she sat in a similar position as the DOA hearing officer and was to examine the record “to determine whether some or any legally competent evidence exists to support the DOH’s decision.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In doing so, the trial justice opined that it was “apparent * * * that the CON application process is not tailored for an application of this type * * *”; she then remanded the application to the DOH for further proceedings to establish whether the CON application procedure could encompass Endoscopy’s application and to “ascertain the proper channel for such a corporate restructuring.” However, after a review of the entire record, the trial justice also reversed the DOH’s decision, reasoning that Endoscopy’s application did not demonstrate a public need.', 'This Court granted Endoscopy’s petition for a writ of certiorari on February 23, 2016. We note, however, that although the writ was directed to the DOH, the state agency did not participate in these proceedings; Blackstone Valley was the only respondent. At the outset, in accordance with the trial justice’s direction, we remanded the papers to the DOH in order to ascertain whether Endoscopy’s application was an appropriate avenue for relief under the CON process. In August 2016, the DOH submitted a response entitled “Decision and Response of the Rhode Island Department of Health to Question Ordered by the Court.” The DOH stated that “[w]hile the applicable application is not typical or usual or, common to the CON application process, nevertheless the application filed is suitable * * *.”', 'Before this Court, Endoscopy argues that the trial justice failed to give proper deference to the DOH’s determination that a public need was sufficiently demonstrated to warrant issuance of the CON. Additionally, Endoscopy asserts that there was ample evidence produced to support', '-5- a finding that there was a public need separate and apart from licensing restructure, and that the suggestion that the application was a proposal for corporate restructuring was erroneous. Blackstone Valley responds that the trial justice appropriately upheld the decision of the DOA hearing officer in light of the evidence in the record.', 'Blackstone Valley contends that Endoscopy has failed to demonstrate an unmet public need in its request for a licensure change.', 'Standard of Review', 'Pursuant to § 42-35-15, the Superior Court is vested with appellate jurisdiction to review final orders of state administrative agencies. Rocha v. State Public Utilities Commission, 694 A.2d 722, 725 (R.I. 1997). The trial justice must not “substitute [his or her] judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.” Interstate Navigation Co. v. Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, 824 A.2d 1282, 1286 (R.I. 2003). Instead, the Superior Court must uphold the agency’s decision if it is supported by legally competent evidence. Id. However, pursuant to § 42-35-15(g), the Superior Court may reverse or modify if', '“substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because', 'the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions', 'are:', '“(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;', '“(2) In excess of the statutory authority of the agency;', '“(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;', '“(4) Affected by other error or law;', '“(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and', 'substantial evidence on the whole record; or', '“(6) Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of', 'discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.”', 'When this Court reviews the Superior Court’s decision on certiorari, we apply “the ‘some’ or ‘any’ evidence test and review[] the record to determine whether legally competent', '-6- evidence exists to support the findings.” Sartor v. Coastal Resources Management Council, 542 A.2d 1077, 1083 (R.I. 1988) (quoting Mendonsa v. Corey, 495 A.2d 257, 260 (R.I. 1985)). Additionally, we examine the record for an error of law. See Johnston Ambulatory Surgical Associates, Ltd. v. Nolan, 755 A.2d 799, 805 (R.I. 2000). Finally, “we do not weigh the evidence, but rather determine whether the trial justice was legally justified in modifying or reversing the agency’s order.” Interstate Navigation Co., 824 A.2d at 1286.', 'Analysis', 'In her decision, the trial justice held that Endoscopy’s application did not establish a public need, and that an application for a CON to allow for corporate restructuring did not lend itself to the CON process. She noted, citing to the relevant DOH rules and regulations, that “[i]n order to grant a CON application, there must exist a substantial or obvious community need * * *.” The trial justice then determined that “[t]he public need criteria [does] not relate in any way to flexibility endowed by corporate restructuring.” The trial justice limited her review to that of the DOH’s decision, but referred to the DOA hearing officer’s findings that the 2013 Zimmerman Report was irrelevant. She then similarly concurred with the hearing officer that the “CON application process is not tailored for an application of this type [and that] it is well- established that ‘questions of the wisdom, policy or expediency of a statute are for the Legislature alone.’” (Quoting In re House of Representatives (Special Prosecutor), 575 A.2d 176, 177 (R.I. 1990).) Therefore, based on her review of the entire record, including the DOA hearing officer’s decision, she reversed the decision of the DOH director on the basis that it was clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the record.4 4', 'We use this opportunity to acknowledge an anomaly regarding the procedure for administrative review in the CON process. Pursuant to § 23-15-6(b)(10), the DOH must have an administrative review appeals mechanism in place for any person who may be affected by the agency’s', '-7-', 'Before this Court, Endoscopy contends that the trial justice failed to give proper deference to the DOH’s determination that need has been met and that the CON should issue. Endoscopy argues that there was substantial evidence to support the DOH’s decision to grant its application, including the Zimmerman Report, which projected an undersupply of endoscopy rooms in Rhode Island through 2013, as well as Endoscopy’s high utilization rates.5 Endoscopy also suggests that the trial justice’s reasoning leads to the only alternative approach to demonstrate need, which is for Endoscopy to close its surgical center and begin the CON process anew, seeking the same result. This approach, Endoscopy argues, would lead to an absurd result. Finally, Endoscopy argues that the trial justice mischaracterized Endoscopy’s application by finding it to be an application to change its corporate structure. Endoscopy asserts that it filed the CON application in order to change its licensure status from a PASC to a FASC, and not to change its corporate structure.', 'In response, Blackstone Valley argues that there is not a scintilla of evidence in the record to support an unmet public need for outpatient ambulatory surgery to be performed at another licensed FASC. Blackstone Valley points to Endoscopy’s concession that its patients’ needs for endoscopy procedures are being met and, Blackstone Valley asserts, there is excess decisions. Section 17.5 of its Rules and Regulations for Determination of Need for New Health Care Equipment and New Institutional Health Services (the Rules and Regulations) sets forth the standard of review for the DOH administrative review. However, it is identical to the standard of review contained in § 42-35-15 of the Administrative Procedures Act for judicial review. Thus, in the present case, the hearing officer and the trial justice conducted a duplicative review of the DOH director’s decision. This is troublesome and left us wondering which decision—the decision of the DOH director granting the CON application or the decision of the DOA hearing officer reversing that decision—constituted the “final order in a contested case” and is the “agency act or ruling.” Section 42-35-15(a). We further note that administrative review is not judicial review. 5', 'Endoscopy’s application stated that it had been operating at a utilization rate between 84 percent and 91 percent annually since 2010, and projected a 92 percent utilization through 2015.', '-8- capacity with the existing license.6 Therefore, Blackstone Valley contends that the trial justice’s decision correctly concluded that there was no competent evidence before the DOH to support a CON.', 'The primary issue before this Court is whether, when evaluating a CON application, the governing statute, § 23-15-4(b), allows for the DOH to consider future public need and the undisputed changes to the delivery of health care. It is well settled that Rhode Island courts accord great deference to an agency’s interpretation of its rules and regulations and its governing statutes, provided that the agency’s construction is neither clearly erroneous nor unauthorized. See Rossi v. Employees’ Retirement System, 895 A.2d 106, 113 (R.I. 2006); see also Labor Ready Northeast, Inc. v. McConaghy, 849 A.2d 340, 345-46 (R.I. 2004); Arnold v. Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training Board of Review, 822 A.2d 164, 169 (R.I. 2003). Thus, to resolve this issue, we look to the applicable statutes and DOH rules, as well as the DOH’s interpretation of its rules and regulations.', 'The Act is designated to set forth the “standards for the authorization and allocation of new institutional health services and new health care equipment.” Section 23-15-3. In addition, pursuant to § 23-15-4(a), “[n]o health care provider or health care facility shall develop or offer new health care equipment or new institutional health services in Rhode Island * * * without prior review by the health services council * * *.” Moreover, subsection (b) of § 23-15-4 states that:', '“No approval shall be made without an adequate demonstration of', 'need by the applicant at the time and place and under the 6', 'Blackstone Valley, a business already licensed as a FASC, argued that it has excess capacity for future patients and believes that other licensed FASCs also have excess capacity. Therefore, Blackstone Valley disputes that there is a lack of capacity at existing facilities or that there is a public need for additional FASCs in Rhode Island.', '-9-', 'circumstances proposed, nor shall the approval be made without a', 'determination that a proposal for which need has been', 'demonstrated is also affordable by the people of the state.”7', '(Emphasis added.) “Public need” is defined in § 3.26 of the DOH Rules and Regulations For Determination of Need for New Health Care Equipment and New Institutional Health Services (the Rules and Regulations) as:', '“[A] substantial or obvious community need for the specific new', 'health care equipment or new institutional health service proposed', 'and the scope thereof, in light of the attendant circumstances and in 7', 'Section 4.3(d) of the Rules and Regulations, which governs CON applications, identifies, at a minimum, what an applicant must demonstrate in order to establish a need:', '“Demonstration of a public need for the proposed new institutional', 'health service or new health care equipment and for the scope', 'thereof at the time and place and under the circumstances', 'proposed, considering the availability of existing facilities,', 'equipment and services, both statewide and on a local basis, which', 'may serve as alternatives or substitutes for the whole or any part of', 'the proposed new institutional health service or new health care', 'equipment.', '“In demonstrating public need, the applicant shall, as a minimum,', 'perform the following:', '“(1) Demonstrate the current service and target population', 'involved and where appropriate, the projected population', 'changes;', '“(2) Delineate the health needs of the above populations;', '“(3) Inventory the facilities or services currently available or', 'proposed capable of meeting the types of health needs', 'identified in §4.3(d)(2) of these Regulations;', '“(4) Determine that portion of need which is not satisfied;', '“(5) Identify and evaluate alternative proposals to satisfy the', 'unmet need; and', '“(6) Delineate the justification for the specific alternative', 'proposed, including the scope thereof.”', '- 10 -', 'the context of the considerations outlined in §4.3(d) and §9.12 of', 'these Regulations.” In accordance with the trial justice’s order, which this Court adopted, the DOH was called upon to determine whether Endoscopy’s request for a CON to operate as a FASC was an appropriate application under the CON process.', 'The DOH, in a three-page response to this Court’s order, highlighted Endoscopy’s assertions that the health care delivery system is changing and that the CON process is necessary so that Endoscopy “can be ready to respond to the needs of Rhode Islanders and be ready to respond to the changes that are occurring in health care.” The DOH concluded that Endoscopy’s application specifically required the agency to look to future public need, including current intelligent planning, and confirmed that its jurisdiction allows it to consider future public need in the approval of a CON application.8', 'The DOH stated:', '“Apart from other evidence of public need during the hearings', 'there was presented credible, uncontradicted commentary and', 'testimony that in the future[,] because of the changes underway in', 'the health care system[,] the applicant needs a higher licensure', 'category so that its practice can respond to the needs of Rhode', 'Islanders.

See Rossi, 895 A.2d at 113 (“Although this Court is the final arbiter of questions of statutory construction, it is also true that ‘we give deference to an agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous statute that it has been charged with administering and enforcing * * *.’” (quoting Arnold, 822 A.2d at 169)). In interpreting its governing statutes and Rules and Regulations, the agency confirmed that Endoscopy’s CON application was indeed suitable for the CON application process.', 'We deem the DOH’s response to be reasoned, thoughtful, and within its statutory powers. It is clear to this Court that the DOH correctly applied its Rules and Regulations when it determined that the public need set forth in Endoscopy’s application was appropriate.', 'We are satisfied that the DOH relied upon competent evidence for future public need in support of its decision to grant Endoscopy’s CON application. Specifically, the DOH’s decision found the Zimmerman Report—which projected an increase in the need for endoscopy rooms in 2013—to be reliable and competent evidence to demonstrate community need. Additionally, the Rhode Island Comprehensive Cancer Plan developed in 2007 anticipated that there would be a future 10 percent increase in endoscopy screenings for colon cancer. Further, Endoscopy’s application demonstrated that it was operating at near capacity. These projections supported the DOH’s determination that need has been established and that a FASC license would place Endoscopy in a position to better respond to expected future demands. We are unanimous in our', '- 12 - opinion that there was legally competent evidence before the DOH to support its findings that Endoscopy’s application satisfied the requirements of the CON application process. For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the trial justice and affirm the DOH’s decision to grant Endoscopy’s CON application allowing Endoscopy to become a FASC.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons discussed herein, the judgment of the Superior Court is quashed.

Vaccaro, 422 A.2d 1253, 1255 n.1 (R.I. 1980). The rationale behind the enactment of civil death legislation was originally based on the', '-4- principle that a person convicted of a crime was dead in the eyes of the law. See Chin, 160 U. Pa. L. Rev. at 1795. Rhode Island adopted its civil death statute in 1909. See G.L. 1909, ch. 354, § 59. By 1939, eighteen states still had civil death statutes in effect. Chin, 160 U. Pa. L. Rev. at 1796; see also Civil Death Statutes–Medieval Fiction in a Modern World, 50 Harv. L. Rev. 968, 968 n.1 (1937).', 'While statutes imposing collateral consequences for convicted persons have almost all but vanished, New York, the Virgin Islands, and Rhode Island still retain civil death statutes for persons sentenced to life imprisonment. Chin, 160 U. Pa. L. Rev. at 1798; See § 13-6-1; N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 79-a(1); V.I. Code Ann. tit. 14, § 92. Repeal is the province of the Legislature.', 'At issue in this case is not whether the Superior Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this claim, but whether the Court has authority to hear the merits of plaintiff’s case in light of § 13-6-1. We answer this question in the negative. The civil death statute plainly states:', '“Every person imprisoned in the adult correctional institutions for', 'life shall, with respect to all rights of property, to the bond of', 'matrimony and to all civil rights and relations of any nature', 'whatsoever, be deemed to be dead in all respects, as if his or her', 'natural death had taken place at the time of conviction.”', 'Section 13-6-1 (emphasis added). This Court reviews questions of statutory interpretation de novo. See State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 485 (R.I. 2013). “In matters of statutory interpretation our ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Id. (quoting Alessi v. Bowen Court Condominium, 44 A.3d 736, 740 (R.I. 2012)). In cases such as this, “when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Id. (quoting Alessi, 44 A.3d at 740).', 'We are of the opinion that § 13-6-1 is clear and unambiguous on its face and should be construed according to its plain and ordinary meaning, as intended by the Legislature.', '-5- See Hazard, 68 A.3d at 485. The statute unambiguously declares that a person such as plaintiff, who is serving a life sentence, is deemed civilly dead and thus does not possess most commonly recognized civil rights. Section 13-6-1. The Legislature has enumerated certain exceptions to § 13-6-1—“[h]owever, the bond of matrimony shall not be dissolved”—but there is no exception for claims impacting a prisoner’s civil rights. We decline to read such an exception into the statute. Our interpretation of § 13-6-1 leads to the necessary and logical conclusion that the Superior Court had no authority to hear this case, because plaintiff’s civil rights were extinguished by operation of law once his conviction became final when it was affirmed on May 2, 2014.', 'The plaintiff points to Vaccaro, and argues that his claim is not barred by § 13-6-1 because his conviction was not final until three-and-a-half years after he filed his initial complaint in this case. See Vaccaro, 422 A.2d at 1254. The plaintiff’s reliance on Vaccaro is misplaced. See id. In Vaccaro, this Court held only that “the civil-death proviso found in [§] 13-6-1 cannot be triggered until such time as there has been a final judgment of conviction.” Id. Similar to the defendant in Vaccaro, the chronology of this case does not benefit plaintiff. See id. Once plaintiff’s conviction became final on May 2, 2014, the proviso in § 13-6-1 was triggered, thus rendering his case incapable of adjudication at the hearing held on July 28, 2016—over two years from the time plaintiff was deemed civilly dead. We also distinguish this case from Vaccaro based on the fact that it was Vaccaro, a defendant in a civil case, who sought to invoke immunity from a judgment ordering him to pay a real estate commission to the plaintiff, rather than a plaintiff seeking to assert a legal right. Id. at 1253-54. This Court specifically differentiated between the two scenarios, stating that “[§] 13-6-1 was intended to be', '-6- a limitation on the assertion of any rights by a prisoner serving a life sentence rather than a shield that would insulate him or her from civil liability.” Id. at 1254.', 'Subject-Matter Jurisdiction', 'Although the trial justice in this case raised the issue of the civil death statute sua sponte, on the eve of trial, which led to the dismissal of the case—a practice this Court generally frowns upon—she appropriately notified the parties and afforded them ample opportunity to brief the issue; and, in light of the conclusive effect of § 13-6-1 on this case, she was constrained to do so. However, the trial justice and both parties incorrectly identified the issue in this case as lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The Superior Court has exclusive original jurisdiction over actions at law in which the amount in controversy is at least $10,000. See G.L. 1956 § 8-2-14. Clearly, “subject-matter jurisdiction is an indispensable requisite in any judicial proceeding.” Long v. Dell, Inc., 984 A.2d 1074, 1079 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Newman v. Valleywood Associates, Inc., 874 A.2d 1286, 1288 (R.I. 2005)). “Subject-matter jurisdiction is the very essence of the court’s power to hear and decide a case”; it has been defined as “jurisdiction over the nature of the case and the type of relief sought; the extent to which a court can rule on the conduct of persons or the status of things.” Id. (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 931 (9th ed. 2009)). While the Superior Court had exclusive original subject-matter jurisdiction to hear the case at bar, whether the court has the authority to do so in light of the statutorily mandated disability is the crux of the issue.', 'This Court has drawn a distinction between subject-matter jurisdiction and the authority of the court to proceed. See Chase v. Bouchard, 671 A.2d 794, 795-96 (R.I. 1996); Hartt v. Hartt, 121 R.I. 220, 226, 397 A.2d 518, 521 (1979). In Hartt, this Court held that the Family Court acquired subject-matter jurisdiction over the matter in that case by statute, G.L. 1956 § 15-11-15, and thus any error assigned to that court was by an excess of jurisdiction and not by', '-7- acting without subject-matter jurisdiction. Hartt, 121 R.I. at 225-26, 397 A.2d at 521, 522. This Court distinguished between subject-matter jurisdiction, acting in excess of jurisdiction, and mere error:', '“These distinctions have often proved difficult to draw. The', 'meaning of the term ‘excess of jurisdiction’ has been especially', 'elusive. An order in excess of jurisdiction in the context of', 'collateral attack has been defined as one which the court has not', 'the power under any circumstances to make or render. * * * Such', 'excess of authority or power is said to be more akin to a want of', 'jurisdiction over the subject matter * * * than to mere error. * * *', 'As a practical matter, however, once a court has jurisdiction over', 'the subject matter and person, it is virtually impossible to', 'distinguish acts in excess of jurisdiction from mere error.” Hartt,', '121 R.I. at 226-27, 397 A.2d at 522. This Court went on to provide illustrative examples of acting in excess of jurisdiction rather than acting without subject-matter jurisdiction:', '“Thus, if a probate court, invested only with the authority over', 'wills and the settlement of estates of deceased persons, should', 'proceed to try parties for public offen[s]es, jurisdiction over the', 'subject of offen[s]es (would be) entirely wanting in the court * * *.', 'But if on the other hand a judge of a criminal court, invested with', 'general criminal jurisdiction over offen[s]es committed within a', 'certain district, should hold a particular act to be a public offen[s]e,', 'which is not by law made an offen[s]e, and proceed to the arrest', 'and trial of a party charged with such act, * * * those acts would be', 'in excess of his jurisdiction * * * (and) these are particulars for his', 'judicial consideration, whenever his general jurisdiction over the', 'subject-matter is invoked.” Id. at 228-29, 397 A.2d at 522-23. Similarly, in Chase, this Court upheld its holding in Hartt distinguishing “between the absence of [subject-matter] jurisdiction in the fundamental sense and the commission of an error for which a court might be corrected on appeal, such as an evidentiary ruling or the failure to give effect to a condition precedent or to a defense properly raised by a party to a litigation.” Chase, 671 A.2d at 796. Ultimately in Chase, this Court declared void its previous caselaw holding that', '-8- the failure to comply with a condition precedent deprived the Superior Court of subject-matter jurisdiction, and instead held that:', '“The Superior Court of Rhode Island is a trial court of general', 'jurisdiction. It is granted subject-matter jurisdiction over all cases', 'unless that jurisdiction has been conferred by statute upon another', 'tribunal * * * [and] the failure to file an account did not and could', 'not deprive the Superior Court of jurisdiction to consider * * * the', 'case on its merits.” Id. (emphasis added).', 'In the case at bar, the Legislature has unambiguously mandated that persons serving a life sentence are prohibited from asserting civil actions. Section 13-6-1. The plaintiff does not fall under any exception to § 13-6-1, as prescribed by the Legislature; thus he is without recourse. Under our holdings in Hartt and Chase, it is clear that the Superior Court is vested with subject- matter jurisdiction, in the fundamental sense, over plaintiff’s claims; however, it would have been error and an excess of jurisdiction for the Superior Court to consider plaintiff’s claims when the Legislature has declared plaintiff to be civilly dead. We cannot imagine a case in which the Superior Court is divested completely of its statutorily-granted subject-matter jurisdiction. We do, however, hold that, in cases such as this, it would be error for the Superior Court to proceed. We conclude that the trial justice prudently and accurately dismissed the case.', 'The Second Amended Complaint', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in failing to address his motion to file a second amended complaint. This Court agrees. On July 12, 2016, after the trial justice raised the issue of the civil death statute sua sponte, plaintiff moved for leave to file a second amended complaint and provided a copy to the trial justice. Without addressing plaintiff’s motion, the trial justice granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the case on the basis of § 13-6-1. The plaintiff’s proposed second amended complaint specifically named Galligan in his individual and official capacities and raised, for the first time, claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983', '-9- and 1988; the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; the Rhode Island Constitution; and the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act.', 'The plaintiff attempted to add a § 1983 claim because, he contends, that statute precluded the Superior Court from dismissing his complaint based on his interpretation that § 1983 “invalidates any state law which stands in the way of any person filing suit to vindicate violation of federal protected rights” “under color of law[.]” The plaintiff has failed to produce any authority that holds that a state court is bound to hear a § 1983 action where this Court has deemed the party to be civilly dead. Rather, plaintiff simply argues that the phrase “or other proper proceeding for redress” set forth in § 19833 must include “not only violations of civil rights under color of law, but also related tortious acts associated with the violation of constitutional rights—and that any state law which prevents anyone from filing suit is invalid under the broad language of § 1983.” (Emphasis in original.) The plaintiff’s generic assertions are unaccompanied by jurisdictional support, which will be necessary on remand.', 'Under this Court’s procedural law, plaintiff is prohibited from adding new claims and new parties six years after his injury and after the statute of limitations has run. See DeSantis v. Prelle, 891 A.2d 873, 878 (R.I. 2006) (holding that the plaintiff was barred from bringing a claim against a new party after the three-year statute of limitations had run). The practice of changing the entire nature of a case from a negligence claim to a civil rights action after the trial 3', 'The plaintiff points to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which provides, in relevant part:', '“Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,', 'regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the', 'District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any', 'citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction', 'thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities', 'secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party', 'injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper', 'proceeding for redress * * *.” (Emphasis added.)', '- 10 - was scheduled to begin has been condemned by this Court. See Faerber v. Cavanagh, 568 A.2d 326, 330 (R.I. 1990) (“An addition of a new claim close to trial when discovery is essentially complete and trial strategy already planned invariably delays the resolution of a case, and delay itself may be considered prejudicial * * * especially where excessive delay has already occurred.” (quoting Andrews v. Bechtel Power Corporation, 780 F.2d 124, 139 (1st Cir. 1985))). The trial justice correctly noted in her decision dismissing the case:', '“There was no 1983 claim pled or filed. This case was ready trial.', 'It was ready trial on a negligence suit. The plaintiff did not plead', 'any civil rights action. And I understand that we have very liberal', 'pleading in our state. However, the fact is this case was a go for', 'trial. It was a go on a negligence claim. And it was not a go on a', 'civil rights claim. It’s too late.”', 'Nevertheless, we conclude that the trial justice should have addressed the plaintiff’s second amended complaint before granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss. Although we consistently have held “that the decision to grant or to deny a motion to amend a complaint is confided to the sound discretion of the hearing justice[,]” the trial justice is nonetheless required to rule on the motion. Harodite Industries, Inc., 24 A.3d at 529. This Court cannot review the trial justice’s decision granting or denying a motion to amend for abuse of discretion if the trial justice has not exercised that discretion. See id.; see also Normandin, 621 A.2d at 715. We are of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled, at the very least, to a reasoned decision on his motion for leave to file an amended complaint.', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand this case to the Superior Court with directions to hear and decide the plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint—upon the merits of which we take no position.

43,"Ian DeLong : v. : Rhode Island Sports Center, Inc., et al. :",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The plaintiff, Ian DeLong, a former college hockey player, alleged that he inhaled noxious fumes while playing in a game at an arena owned by the defendant DRF Arena, LLC, and operated by the defendant Rhode Island Sports Center, Inc. He claimed that he, along with several other teammates, became ill upon returning to school after a hockey game against Johnson & Wales University at the defendants’ arena. The plaintiff alleged that he began coughing up blood the next morning and sought medical treatment. He ultimately brought a negligence suit against the defendants, who filed and prevailed on a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff timely appealed to this Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court, sitting at Lincoln High School, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions, and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be', '-1- decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and return the case thereto for trial.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In the complaint that he filed in the Superior Court, plaintiff alleged that on February 17, 2011, defendants negligently maintained their ice rink facility in North Smithfield by allowing noxious fumes to permeate the air. This, according to plaintiff, created a dangerous condition on the premises, and defendants failed to exercise reasonable care or provide adequate warnings. As a result, plaintiff claimed, he became ill with acute respiratory problems, including carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide poisoning. The defendants answered, denying that plaintiff was entitled to relief.', 'Discovery ensued, and on May 13, 2015, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. They argued that there were no genuine issues of material fact regarding (1) the existence of a dangerous or defective condition; (2) the notice to defendants of any such condition; and (3) the causal connection between that condition and any injury that may have been sustained by plaintiff. Indeed, defendants maintained that plaintiff had failed to put forth evidence of any of those elements, all of which are necessary to establish a premises liability claim. Therefore, defendants asserted, they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.', 'To support their motion, defendants pointed to plaintiff’s deposition statement that he neither saw nor smelled any unusual fumes while playing hockey at defendants’ ice rink. They further highlighted the dearth of scientific evidence as to the air quality in the arena on the night of the game. In fact, defendants proffered evidence that the carbon monoxide levels in the facility that night were zero, as demonstrated by the ice rink attendant’s twice-daily notation of', '-2- the air quality reading and the Rhode Island Department of Health’s confirmation the following day. Therefore, defendants argued, plaintiff had no proof that there was a dangerous or defective condition present in the arena, thus failing to prove even the first element of his claim.', 'Continuing to the remaining elements, defendants maintained that they had no notice, actual or constructive, of any potential defect, even assuming one were to have existed. In making that assertion, they relied on the deposition testimony of two employees: Rick Beauregard, the facilities manager, and David L’Etoile, who was responsible for operating a Zamboni to resurface the ice before, during, and after games. 1 Each stated that he was not aware of any complaints ever having been made regarding noxious fumes, and L’Etoile attested that he never observed or smelled any fumes while resurfacing the ice rink. Finally, as to causation, defendants underscored plaintiff’s own deposition statements.', 'The plaintiff admitted that, despite his assumption and belief that it was noxious fumes within the arena that caused his injury, he could not say with complete certainty what it was that made him fall ill. And, according to defendants, even if plaintiff were to prove that he was exposed to airborne toxins, he had no evidence that that exposure occurred on defendants’ premises.', 'The plaintiff opposed defendants’ motion for summary judgment.', 'By way of background, he explained that, after a game between his team, Curry College, and Johnson & Wales University at defendants’ ice rink, “[p]laintiff and a large number of his teammates suffered respiratory illnesses” from nitrogen dioxide, a toxin that can be emitted by Zambonis. On the night in question, the Curry College hockey team traveled to the game by bus, and plaintiff said he detected no fumes during the ride. Once at the rink, the team went into the 1', 'A “Zamboni,” which derives its name from its inventor, is a machine used to resurface an ice rink. The resurfacer shaves the ice, washes the ice, and leaves behind a layer of fresh ice-making water, which freezes to create a smooth sheet of ice.', '-3- visitors’ dressing room, outside of which were situated two propane-fueled Zambonis; one was stored out in the open next to the locker room, the other in a garage near the locker room. One of those Zambonis was used to resurface the ice between the first and second periods, between the second and third periods, and at the end of the game. After the game, the team remained in the rink for a little over half an hour before returning to Curry College on the same bus that had transported them to the rink. Later that evening, one of plaintiff’s teammates asked plaintiff— who himself was already coughing—to bring him to the hospital because he was coughing up blood. By the next morning, plaintiff, too, was coughing up blood and he went to the emergency room. A number of plaintiff’s teammates reportedly also experienced the same symptoms. At the hospital, the plaintiff was diagnosed with an acute lung injury resulting from carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide poisoning.', 'The plaintiff responded to defendants’ summary-judgment arguments with evidence of his own. In terms of proof of a defect, and to rebut defendants’ contention that the Department of Health air quality report was dispositive of the issue, plaintiff offered a regulation showing that the Department of Health does not require testing for nitrogen dioxide and that it does not do so itself. Furthermore, the arena was not tested for carbon monoxide by the Department of Health until the next day, and simply opening doors or windows can properly ventilate a facility and improve air quality, as James Bruckshaw, an official from the department, acknowledged in his deposition. The plaintiff also provided an affidavit from the head coach of his hockey team, Robert Davies. Coach Davies submitted that, based on a lifetime spent in ice rinks, he can immediately discern air quality when entering a rink.', 'He said that, upon walking into defendants’ facility on February 17, 2011, he could smell some kind of gas. In addition, Coach Davies noted that the Zamboni broke down while it was resurfacing the ice during an', '-4- intermission, causing a delay in the action. He further swore that this Zamboni produced a gaseous odor that progressively worsened over time and that it “released a thick blue film that permeated the air.” Coach Davies thereafter heard several of his players begin to cough. In that regard, plaintiff produced affidavits from two of his teammates who recounted smelling gas in the air inside the arena and experiencing symptoms similar to plaintiff’s upon returning to Curry College. And lastly, as further evidence of the presence of a dangerous or defective condition, plaintiff pointed to defendants’ purchase of a new electric Zamboni just months later. As Bruckshaw explained at his deposition, electric Zambonis do not produce combustion emissions, as do those that are propane-fueled.', 'Accordingly, plaintiff argued that he had produced competent evidence that successfully rebutted defendants’ contention that there was no genuine issue of fact as to the air quality in the arena on the night in question, and thus the issue should be left to a factfinder.', 'With respect to the issue of prior notice of the defect, plaintiff pointed to Coach Davies’ affidavit, in which he swore that he had asked a rink attendant if it would be possible to open the doors to the facility because of the smell of gas. Coach Davies also stated that he had become aware of prior similar incidents involving three other college hockey teams. In that regard, plaintiff submitted a newspaper article detailing how players from the Salve Regina University hockey team fell ill following a game against Johnson & Wales at defendants’ facility on February 5, 2011. 2 2', 'The plaintiff later supplemented his objection to defendants’ motion for summary judgment with an affidavit from the head coach of the Salve Regina hockey team. The coach attested that at least three of his players became ill following the above-referenced game, and he thereafter informed the head coach at Johnson & Wales that he thought there was a problem with the air quality in defendants’ ice rink that warranted investigating. When the Salve Regina coach learned of the even “more extensive” bouts of sickness befalling the Curry College hockey team,', '-5-', 'Finally, in terms of establishing a causal link between the defect and plaintiff’s injury, plaintiff highlighted the impressions contained in his medical records: “[a]cute hypoxic respiratory failure caused by inhalation of toxic fumes * * * at the hockey rink” and “[a]cute onset of cough * * * caused by early chemical pneumonitis as a result of exposure to toxic irritating fumes.” 3 The records listed plaintiff’s discharge diagnosis as “Acute Lung Injury” and “Carbon Monoxide and Nitrous Oxide exposure[,]” and described the course of his hospital treatment as “22 [year] old male with nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide exposure from Zamboni machine at a hockey rink, came with cough hemoptysis.” 4 Those records, according to plaintiff, were enough for his case to survive summary judgment.', 'A hearing on the motion was held before a justice of the Superior Court on January 19, 2016, and the motion justice rendered a bench decision the same day. He began by stating: “It appears from this record that there is a lack of evidence that a defective condition existed at the Sports Center on the date of the injury and it further appears that no one from the Sports Center had notice of any such defect, if there was one.” As for the defect itself, the motion justice found that plaintiff’s own testimony—that he did not see or smell any fumes in the rink, and that something else theoretically could have caused his sickness—negated his claim. The motion justice also put stock in the fact that the Department of Health’s air quality test, conducted the day after the alleged exposure, came back negative for toxins, and the “more objective” evidence, as the motion justice coined it, was that the only people who fell ill were from the he contacted Coach Davies and told him what had happened to players on his team just a couple of weeks earlier. 3', 'The impressions also went on to state, however, that the “possibility of infectious process such as atypical pneumonia cannot be totally excluded * * *.” 4', 'The papers before this Court are replete with inconsistencies as to nitrous versus nitrogen and oxide versus dioxide. Because it appears to be the most common in the medical records, we have chosen to refer to the toxin as “nitrogen dioxide” throughout this opinion.', '-6- Curry College hockey team, seeming to indicate that their sickness was from another source, independent of defendants’ facility.', 'As to the notice element, the motion justice cited the deposition testimony of both Beauregard and L’Etoile that they did not see or smell any fumes in the arena on the night in question, and that neither of them recalled receiving any complaints about air quality that night or at any other time. The motion justice expressed his view that plaintiff was relying on nothing more than “testimony that somebody saw blue smoke coming from the Zamboni, that the plaintiff obviously told the people at the emergency room that the smoke came or the fumes came from the locker room, but yet that in and of itself is not sufficient evidence * * *.” As the motion justice saw it, the evidence offered by plaintiff essentially amounted to “supposition[.]” The motion justice declined to consider the newspaper article as evidence of notice because “[n]ewspaper articles are not admissible,” and, he said, the affidavit from the Salve Regina coach to that effect did not necessarily result in knowledge of the problem being imparted to defendants. And finally, according to the motion justice, Coach Davies’ affidavit claiming that he had asked someone at the rink to open the doors for ventilation purposes was not enough to create an issue of fact regarding whether defendants had sufficient notice. Consequently, the motion justice granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When we review the granting of a party’s motion for summary judgment, we do so de novo. Van Hoesen v. Lloyd’s of London, 134 A.3d 178, 181 (R.I. 2016). “In doing so, we ‘examin[e] the case from the vantage point of the trial justice who passed on the motion for summary judgment, * * * view[ing] the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving', '-7- party * * *.’” Id.

We will affirm the judgment only “if we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law * * *.” Id. (quoting Sullo, 68 A.3d at 406-07). And, of course, we are ever mindful that “[s]ummary judgment is a drastic remedy, and a motion for summary judgment should be dealt with cautiously.” Faber v.

DaimlerChrysler Motors Corp., 66 A.3d 446, 451 (R.I. 2013)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The single question with which we are faced in this appeal is whether summary judgment was improperly granted. The summary-judgment procedure begins when the movant files papers seeking to establish the absence of a genuine dispute with respect to the material facts of the case. Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 391 (R.I. 2008). It then becomes necessary for the nonmoving party to demonstrate by competent evidence that a disputed issue of material fact does indeed exist. Id. It is the court’s function to look for such factual issues, but not to determine them one way or the other. Id.', 'In that light, we are tasked with examining whether there is a genuine issue of material fact that should have precluded summary judgment in this case. “In cases involving a latent defect, the plaintiff must prove that sufficient evidence existed to show that the defendants knew or should have known of an unsafe condition on their premises.” Cooley v. Kelly, 160 A.3d 300, 304-05 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Bromaghim v. Furney, 808 A.2d 615, 617 (R.I. 2002)). Of course, “[t]he mere existence of [a dangerous or defective] condition * * * is not sufficient to charge [the] defendant with negligence.” Id. at 305 (quoting Antonakos v. Providence Institution for', '-8- Savings, 94 R.I. 382, 385, 181 A.2d 101, 103 (1962)); see also Hernandez v. Fernandez, 697 A.2d 1101, 1103 (R.I. 1997) (“As we have long held, the mere occurrence of an accident, without more, does not warrant an inference that a defendant has been negligent.”). Rather, to make out a prima facie premises liability case, the “plaintiff ‘must present evidence of an unsafe condition on the premises of which the defendant was aware or should have been aware, and that the condition existed for a long enough time so the owner of the premises should have taken steps to correct the condition.” Cooley, 160 A.3d at 305 (quoting Bromaghim, 808 A.2d at 617); see also Hernandez, 697 A.2d at 1103 (“Unless there is evidence, direct or inferential, that [the defendant] knew, or by the exercise of reasonable care in inspecting and maintaining its premises should have known, of such condition for a long enough period of time prior to the accident, it cannot be charged with notice thereof as a matter of law.

And certainly a “causal connection between negligence and a plaintiff’s injury must be established by competent evidence and may not be based on conjecture or speculation.” Cooley, 160 A.3d at 305 (quoting McLaughlin v. Moura, 754 A.2d 95, 98 (R.I. 2000)). “It is also clear, however, that a plaintiff is not required to demonstrate with absolute certainty each precise step in the causal chain between the tortfeasor’s breach of duty and the injury. Rather, ‘[c]ausation is proved by inference.’” Skaling v. Aetna Insurance Co., 742 A.2d 282, 288 (R.I. 1999) (quoting Cartier v. State, 420 A.2d 843, 848 (R.I. 1980)).', 'Here, then, it was incumbent upon plaintiff to show: (1) the existence of a dangerous or defective condition on defendants’ premises; (2) defendants’ notice of that condition for a sufficient period of time; and (3) a causal link between that condition and plaintiff’s injury. We', '-9- will examine these elements one by one to determine whether there was a factual dispute; only if there was not such a dispute would our function then turn to analyzing whether defendants were entitled, based on the undisputed facts, to judgment as a matter of law.', 'First, arguing that there was no issue of fact in terms of the defect, defendants pointed to: plaintiff’s statement that he did not see or smell any fumes inside defendants’ facility; plaintiff’s paucity of scientific evidence that there were any airborne toxins lingering on the night in question; the notation in the ice rink log of the air quality reading that night; and the results of testing conducted by the Department of Health showing no carbon monoxide in the rink the following day. The plaintiff responded in kind. He highlighted the following evidence: the Department of Health did not conduct a test to determine the levels of nitrogen dioxide and did not perform its carbon monoxide test until a day later; affidavits from his coach and teammates swearing that they smelled gas in the air the night plaintiff was injured, that his coach witnessed the Zamboni malfunction and produce visible emissions, and that his teammates also ended up suffering very similar symptoms as he did; and that defendants purchased an electric, non- propane-fueled Zamboni just months later. 5 In our judgment, based on the competing evidence, the dangerous-or-defective-condition element is factually disputed, and the issue remains to be resolved by a finder of fact.', 'Second, asserting the absence of a factual dispute about whether defendants had notice of any alleged defect, defendants offered deposition statements made by two of their employees that they were unaware of any previous complaints about noxious fumes in the rink, and that they had 5', 'Under Rhode Island law, evidence that defendants bought a new, electric Zamboni shortly after the incident involving plaintiff could have been considered by the motion justice in passing on the motion for summary judgment.

Evid. 407 (“When, after an event, measures are taken which, if taken previously, would have made the event less likely to occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is admissible.”).', '- 10 - never observed any themselves. The plaintiff then submitted evidence in rebuttal: Coach Davies’ affidavit attesting that he had asked someone working at the rink the night of the game to open the doors due to the gaseous smell, and that he was aware of similar incidents involving other teams at defendants’ facility; an affidavit from the coach of the Salve Regina hockey team describing his team’s experience; and a newspaper article describing that occurrence. 6 As was the case with respect to the first element, it is our view that whether defendants had notice of the dangerous condition at all and whether that notice was of a sufficient duration to impose on defendants a duty to fix the danger or warn of its existence are factual issues properly left to the determination of a jury.', 'Third and finally, claiming there were no disputed facts as to causation, defendants relied on plaintiff’s acknowledgement that, despite his belief that it was noxious fumes in the arena that caused his sickness, he could not say so with 100 percent conviction. The defendants also argued that plaintiff had no evidence that any such exposure occurred on their premises, breaking the causal chain plaintiff needed to build. In rebuttal, plaintiff came forward with his medical records, which contained his diagnosis and which indicated that he had presented with an injury after inhaling toxic fumes at the ice rink. It appears from the transcript of the hearing that the 6', 'Although the motion justice ruled that newspaper articles in general are not admissible, and he therefore did not take into account the article that plaintiff submitted, we note that he could have done so.

Hearsay is an out-of- court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. R.I. R. Evid. 801(c). The plaintiff did not introduce the article to prove that members of the Salve Regina hockey team became ill following a game at defendants’ facility; rather, he offered it to establish that defendants were or should have been aware of the problem before plaintiff was injured.', '- 11 - motion justice considered the medical records, but simply found them to be insufficient evidence of causation. 7', 'As we have explained, “proximate cause can be established by circumstantial evidence, and specific direct evidence of * * * proximate cause is not always necessary.” Rose v.

Thus, even putting the medical records aside, the affidavits of plaintiff’s teammates and coach were proper circumstantial evidence of causation as well.

These cases come to us in the wake of what is considered generally to be the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. It is common knowledge that in 2008 the stock market plummeted, and with it the value of real estate throughout the country tumbled as well. It also is well known that Rhode Island was not immune from the effects of that economic collapse. Indeed, as both the plaintiffs and the defendant agree, the value of the plaintiffs’ properties decreased in 2008 and 2009. This appeal, though, is not a contest about the value of the plaintiffs’ properties. Rather, this appeal is about whether certain sections of G.L. 1956 chapter 5 of title 44 require the plaintiffs to base their tax appeals on the fair market value of their properties “as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation * * *.”', 'When the plaintiffs appealed their assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010, the defendant maintained that they were locked in to the value of their properties as of December 31, 2007, the year of Portsmouth’s last revaluation. The plaintiffs, whose properties had experienced a substantial decline in value after December 31, 2007, disagree.

We agree. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts here are undisputed and straightforward. The plaintiffs all own property in the Town of Portsmouth. More specifically, each of the plaintiffs owns a condominium in the same development. In 2007, consistent with his statutory duties as the tax assessor for Portsmouth, defendant conducted a full-scale revaluation of all real estate in the town, including plaintiffs’ properties. 4 The defendant determined that, as of December 31, 2007, the full and fair cash values 5 of plaintiffs’ properties were as follows: the Balmuth Property, $4,430,200; the Qua Property, $5,320,800; and the Antle Property, $4,076,500.', 'Then, in 2008, the economy cratered.

He denied their appeals, informing plaintiffs that, under chapter 5 of title 44, he had properly carried forward the December 31, 2007 valuations for use in determining his assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010.

The trial justice found that plaintiffs could challenge defendant’s tax assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010 using the fair market values of their properties as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009, respectively. He concluded that, contrary to defendant’s interpretation of the language set forth in §§ 44-5-15 and 44-5-26 (language we will discuss infra), plaintiffs were not confined to the December 31, 2007 valuations. The trial justice reasoned that, under § 44-5-30, plaintiffs had satisfied the preconditions necessary to prevail on their tax appeals. Citing § 44-5-30, he wrote:', '“For judgment to enter in favor of the taxpayer challenging [a]', 'property tax assessment, the taxpayer must demonstrate: (1) that an', 'account has been given; (2) that the tax has been assessed in excess', 'of the property’s full and fair cash value; and (3) that the taxes on', 'the property have been paid prior to judgment entering.” Section 44-5-30 provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“If the taxpayer has given in an account, and if on the trial of the', 'petition, either with or without a jury, it appears that the taxpayer’s', 'real estate * * * has been assessed * * * at a value in excess of its', 'full and fair cash value, * * * the court shall give judgment that the', 'sum by which the taxpayer has been so overtaxed, * * * with his or', 'her costs, be deducted from his or her tax * * *.” Seizing on the use of “shall” in that statute, the trial justice determined that he was bound to enter judgment in plaintiffs’ favor because they had satisfied their burden under § 44-5-30. He explained that defendant had even conceded as much, in that there was no dispute that plaintiffs had (1) given an account; (2) been assessed taxes in excess of their properties’ full and fair cash value for tax years 2009 and 2010; and (3) timely paid their taxes for tax years 2009 and 2010.

Stressing the language of those statutes and of the form required by § 44-5-26(b), defendant argues that, when plaintiffs appealed his assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010, they were restricted to the valuations of their properties as of December 31, 2007, the date of Portsmouth’s last revaluation. In support of that interpretation, defendant focuses on two statutory provisions, both of which refer to the fair market value of property “as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation.” Specifically, defendant directs us to § 44-5-15, which requires the annual filing of', '-9- an account stating the value of “real estate as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation[,]” and the form required by § 44-5-26(b), which refers twice to the fair market value of real estate “as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation[.]” According to defendant, those provisions, when read together with the other sections of chapter 5 of title 44, mandate that plaintiffs must base their tax appeals on the valuations of their properties as of December 31, 2007.', 'The plaintiffs disagree. To support their position that the law permits a challenge to defendant’s tax assessments using annual valuations, they first point to this Court’s opinion in Wickes Asset Management, Inc. v. Dupuis, 679 A.2d 314 (R.I. 1996). It is true that, in Wickes, we held that “a property owner disputing an assessment carried over from a prior year is not precluded from challenging the assessment and is therefore not necessarily ‘locked into’ that value until the next decennial revaluation * * *.” Wickes, 679 A.2d at 320. Indeed, the guiding principle of Wickes was that, under the statutory scheme in place at that time, “the Legislature ha[d] provided interim remedies for a person aggrieved by an annual tax assessment.” Id. As the Court noted, those interim remedies were set forth in §§ 44-5-26 and 44-5-27. Id.', 'However, it is significant that, at the time Wickes was decided, revaluations of real property were conducted every ten years. See Wickes, 679 A.2d at 320. As defendant correctly points out, that has since changed.', 'In 1997, a year after Wickes, the General Assembly overhauled the revaluation process, enacting P.L. 1997, ch. 179, § 1 (later codified as §§ 44-5- 11.5, 44-5-11.6, and 44-5-11.7). Under the new revaluation statute, rather than requiring cities and towns to conduct revaluations every ten years, the General Assembly mandated that “each city and town shall conduct a revaluation within nine (9) years of the date of the prior revaluation', '- 10 - and shall conduct an update of real property every three (3) years from the last revaluation.” P.L. 1997, ch. 179, § 1; see § 44-5-11.6(a)(2)(i)-(ii).', 'The transition to a more frequent revaluation-and-update schedule was based on a detailed list of legislative findings. Among other things, the General Assembly recognized that the old ten-year revaluation led to inequitable results for taxpayers. As the General Assembly explained,', '“The state’s ten year property revaluation cycle is the longest', 'revaluation cycle in the country. Infrequent revaluations translate', 'into disparities in property tax burden between types and classes of', 'property within and among cities and towns.

In the view of the General Assembly, the shift to a more frequent revaluation-and-update schedule struck a balance between “ensur[ing] that all taxpayers in Rhode Island are treated equitably” and minimizing the administrative burden placed on cities and towns tasked with conducting more frequent valuations. P.L. 1997, ch. 179, § 1; see § 44-5-11.5(3). According to the General Assembly, “[e]nsuring that taxpayers are treated fairly begins with modernizing the administration of the property tax that ensures:', '“(a) Up-to-date property values are maintained through more', 'frequent property revaluations;', '“(b) Cities and towns meet defined standards related to performing', 'updates of property values;', '“(c) The state shares in the cost of performing updates of property', 'values in the cities and towns;', '“(d) A meaningful and effective method of ensuring that cities and', 'towns comply with the nine year revaluation cycle and the updates', 'of property values are developed;', '“(e) Procedures for administering the property tax are standardized', '— such as general reporting and classification systems;', '“(f) Assessors and contracted property revaluation companies meet', 'appropriate qualifications and standards; and', '- 11 -', '“(g) Intergovernmental cooperation in the administration of the', 'property tax is maximized.” P.L. 1997, ch. 179, § 1; see § 44-5-', '11.5(3). 11 Since that overhaul in 1997, the nine-year revaluation schedule and the three-year update schedule have largely remained the same.', 'Another change in the law further impacts reliance on our holding in Wickes. In 2001, the General Assembly amended both § 44-5-15 and the language in the form required by § 44-5- 26(b). See P.L. 2001, ch. 365, § 1. Those amendments added the phrase “as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation” for real estate to portions of § 44-5-15 and the form required by § 44-5-26(b). 12 Id. In light of the 1997 overhaul and the 2001 amendments, plaintiffs’ reliance on Wickes as binding authority in this case is considerably weakened. On this point, we agree with defendant that perhaps the trial justice should not have relied on Wickes to the extent he did. However, that does not resolve the question of statutory interpretation at hand. Even with this Court’s holding in Wickes being of doubtful value here, what remains unclear is whether plaintiffs are, as defendant argues, confined to the values of their properties as of December 31, 2007. Based on our thorough review of the language contained in chapter 5 of title 44, the only thing that appears clear to us now is just how unclear the conflicting statutory language is. 11', 'The subsections’ labels have since changed. As currently constituted, § 44-5-11.5, which contains the list of legislative findings, labels the subsections of § 44-5-11.5(3) with roman numerals in place of alphabetical letters. See §§ 44-5-11.5(3)(i)–(vii). 12', 'Prior to 2001, the language of § 44-5-15 and the form required by § 44-5-26(b) made no mention of the value of real estate as of December 31 “in the year of the last update or revaluation.” See P.L. 2001, ch. 365, § 1 (adding to § 44-5-15 the phrase “as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation” after the language “describing and specifying the value of every parcel of the real estate” and adding to a parenthetical of one provision of the form required by § 44-5-26(b) that the taxpayer state the fair market value “as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation for real estate” and adding that same phrase—“in the year of the last update or revaluation for real estate”—to another parenthetical).', '- 12 -', 'For example, § 44-5-1—the statute that empowers cities and towns to tax—provides in succinct and unambiguous language that “[t]he tax is apportioned upon the assessed valuations as determined by the assessors of the city or town as of December 31 in each year at 12:00 A.M. midnight, the date being known as the date of assessment of city or town valuations.” (Emphasis added.) A plain reading of that language would suggest that plaintiffs’ position is correct: they may challenge the valuations of their properties “as of December 31 in each year[,]” freeing them from the bonds of the December 31, 2007 valuations. On the other hand, we are confronted with the language of § 44-5-15 and that in the form required by § 44-5-26(b). In each of those places there is language providing that taxpayers state the value of their real estate “as of December 31 in the year of the last update or revaluation * * *.”', 'Also, it does not escape our notice that, in accordance with the 2001 amendments to § 44- 5-15 and to the form required by § 44-5-26(b), taxpayers must state the value of their personal estate “as of December 31 of the tax year,” providing fertile ground for an argument that the General Assembly intended to treat the valuation of real estate and personal estate differently. See §§ 44-5-15 and 44-5-26(b); see also P.L. 2001, ch. 365, § 1. A plain reading of those amendments lends support to defendant’s argument that plaintiffs are able to challenge their tax assessments only by using the fair market value as of December 31, 2007, the date of the last revaluation before their challenges. Unfortunately, the conflict between the language of § 44-5-1 and that of § 44-5-15 and the statutory form required by § 44-5-26(b) is only the most glaring, but not the sole, ambiguity lurking in chapter 5 of title 44.', 'To cloud matters further, there is also the language of § 44-5-12(a), which states that “[a]ll real property subject to taxation shall be assessed at its full and fair cash value, * * * to be determined by the assessors in each town or city[.]” And, lest we forget, the language of § 44-5-', '- 13 - 13—that “[t]he assessors shall assess all valuation and apportion any tax levy on the inhabitants of the city or town and the ratable property in the city or town according to law, and the assessed valuation of the ratable property is made as of the date of assessment provided in § 44-5-1”—and the language of § 44-5-30—which instructs that “the court shall give judgment” in favor of the taxpayer', '“[i]f the taxpayer has given in an account, and if on the trial of the', 'petition [filed pursuant to § 44-5-26], * * * it appears that the', 'taxpayer’s real estate * * * has been assessed, if assessment has', 'been made at full and fair cash value, at a value in excess of its full', 'and fair cash value * * *.” Those provisions add further uncertainty to the resolution of the issue at hand; that is, whether the General Assembly intended that plaintiffs be locked in to the December 31, 2007 valuations per chapter 5 of title 44.', 'Therefore, it is readily apparent that we are faced with ambiguous statutory language. We can reach no other conclusion than that the inartful drafting of the pertinent statutory language here renders it plainly “susceptible of more than one reasonable meaning.” See Drs. Pass and Bertherman, Inc., 31 A.3d at 1269. As explained above, because we are confronted with a genuine ambiguity, and not one divined by crafty lawyering, 13 we “will ‘employ our well- established maxims of statutory construction in an effort to glean the intent of the Legislature.’” In re Proposed Town of New Shoreham Project, 25 A.3d at 505 (quoting Pascoag Apartment 13', 'As this Court previously has observed,', '“Because ambiguity lurks in every word, sentence, and paragraph', 'in the eyes of a skilled advocate * * * the question is not whether', 'there is an ambiguity in the metaphysical sense, but whether the', 'language has only one reasonable meaning when construed, not in', 'a hypertechnical fashion, but in an ordinary, common sense', 'manner.” In re Proposed Town of New Shoreham Project, 25 A.3d', '482, 505 n.30 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Lazarus v. Sherman, 10 A.3d', '456, 464 (R.I. 2011)).', '- 14 - Associates, LLC, 950 A.2d at 445). One such rule is of particular relevance here: “‘taxing statutes are to be strictly construed’ with doubts resolved in favor of the taxpayer.” Maggiacomo v. DiVincenzo, 122 R.I. 615, 618, 410 A.2d 1332, 1333 (1980) (quoting Van Alen v. Stein, 119 R.I. 347, 359, 376 A.2d 1383, 1389 (1977)); see also Inn Group Associates v. Booth, 593 A.2d 49, 55 (R.I. 1991) (explaining that “[d]oubts as to the construction of [taxing] laws * * * are to be resolved in favor of the taxpayer” (quoting Potowomut Golf Club, Inc. v. Norberg, 114 R.I. 589, 592, 337 A.2d 226, 227 (1975))).', 'As belabored above, there is no shortage of doubt about whether the General Assembly intended to restrict plaintiffs to the values of their properties as of December 31, 2007, the year of the revaluation at issue. Unfortunately, neither the 2001 amendments to § 44-5-15 and the form required by § 44-5-26(b), adding the phrase “in the year of the last update or revaluation[,]” nor the legislative findings contained in § 44-5-11.5 are determinative in discerning legislative intent. On one hand, as defendant argues, perhaps by virtue of the 2001 amendments, the General Assembly intended to lock in taxpayers like plaintiffs to the December 31, 2007 valuations. But, on the other hand, perhaps, as plaintiffs argue, in enacting those amendments, the General Assembly simply intended for tax assessors such as defendant to be allowed to use those valuations as a carry-forward, easing the administrative burden of conducting yearly valuations while still affording taxpayers with the opportunity to pursue tax appeals on an annual basis using annual valuations. The language of the pertinent statutes does not resolve our linguistic dilemma.', 'Accordingly, based on the ambiguities created by the conflicting statutory provisions quoted above and the lack of clear legislative intent to the contrary, we hold that plaintiffs had the right to appeal the yearly tax assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010 based on the fair', '- 15 - market valuations of their properties as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009. See Inn Group Associates, 593 A.2d at 55; Maggiacomo, 122 R.I. at 618, 410 A.2d at 1333. In other words, when plaintiffs appealed defendant’s assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010, they were not locked in to the December 31, 2007 valuations of their properties.', 'In so holding, we are cognizant of defendant’s reliance on alternative canons of statutory construction to support his position. He argues first that the specific provisions of § 44-5-15 and the form required by § 44-5-26(b) should control over the general provisions of §§ 44-5-1 and 44-5-12. See, e.g., Whitehouse v. Moran, 808 A.2d 626, 629-30 (R.I. 2002) (explaining that “the general rule of statutory construction clearly provides that when a statute of general application conflicts with a statute that specifically deals with a special subject matter, and when the two statutes cannot be construed harmoniously together, the special statute prevails over the statute of general application”). In the alternative, defendant maintains that, because the language in § 44- 5-15 and § 44-5-26(b)’s form was added after the language in § 44-5-1 and § 44-5-12, the later provisions should govern here. See, e.g., State v. Souza, 456 A.2d 775, 781 (R.I. 1983) (stating that “[o]nly when two statutory provisions are irreconcilably repugnant will a repeal be implied and the last enacted statute preferred”). As a general matter, we do not disagree that those canons of statutory construction may prove useful in resolving statutory ambiguities. But, here, because we are confronted with a tax statute so plainly afflicted with significant ambiguity, we are firm in our view that we are best guided by the maxim which directs that “‘taxing statutes are to be strictly construed’ with doubts resolved in favor of the taxpayer.” Maggiacomo, 122 R.I. at 618, 410 A.2d at 1333 (quoting Van Alen, 119 R.I. at 359, 376 A.2d at 1389). 14 14', 'As amicus curiae, the Rhode Island League of Cities and Towns weighed in on the issue presented by this appeal.

It chose not to do so.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'Because we hold that the plaintiffs were permitted to appeal the yearly tax assessments for tax years 2009 and 2010 based on the fair market valuations of their properties as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2009, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The papers shall be returned to that court. disarray. Besides noting that appealing a tax assessment is in and of itself rather cost- prohibitive, we nonetheless conclude that such a policy concern is best addressed by the General Assembly, not this Court. Here, the concern with a hypothetically possible flood of tax appeals does not overcome our view that the ambiguities lurking in the statutes must be resolved in the taxpayers’ favor. See Inn Group Associates v. Booth, 593 A.2d 49, 55 (R.I. 1991); Maggiacomo v. DiVincenzo, 122 R.I. 615, 618, 410 A.2d 1332, 1333 (1980).

Therefore, we respectfully dissent. We do agree with the majority that the conflicting statutory language in §§ 44-5-1, 44-5-12(a), 44-5-13, and 44-5-15, and the form required by § 44-5-26(b), is inarticulately drafted and ambiguous, requiring us to employ our maxims of statutory construction. What we disagree with is the construction tool used by the majority in its attempt to solve this problem.', 'In 1997, the General Assembly changed the property tax value scheme from the requirement that the revaluation of real property occur every ten years to requiring that it be updated every three years. 1 See P.L. 1997, ch. 179, § 1. As outlined in the legislative findings cited by the majority, one of the purposes of the statutory amendments was to prevent a drastic change in taxpayers’ property values at the time of revaluation.

While the majority relies solely on the first rule, we respectfully suggest that, in this case, the last two are more appropriate in solving our dilemma and in gleaning the General Assembly’s intent.

See P.L. 2001, ch. 365, § 1. This is specific legislation directed at only those choosing to appeal their real estate valuations and, as such, must be considered as controlling the remaining valuation provisions of the statute. Likewise, the fact that the 2001 amendment was adopted later than the overall taxing change of 1997 gives insight to the General Assembly’s attempt to clarify when an appeal can be taken. Using these two rules of construction convinces us that the General Assembly limited taxpayer appeals to the year of the last update or revaluation.', 'We gain comfort in this view when considering the possible ramifications of the majority’s interpretation. 4', 'Some taxpayers could seek a revaluation every year, requiring', '“Doubts as to the construction of laws of this character are to be', 'resolved in favor of the taxpayer.

The trial justice sentenced the defendant to two life sentences, to run concurrently, on each count of first- degree child molestation sexual assault, and a thirty-year sentence, to run concurrently with the life sentences, on the count of second-degree child molestation sexual assault.

Jalette, 119 R.I. 614, 627, 382 A.2d 526, 533 (1978)). The defendant asserted that the alleged incidents of prior sexual misconduct did not satisfy the requirements of nonremoteness and similarity as decreed by this Court. He argued that the incidents were remote from the charged acts because they occurred between the late 1970s and early 1980s, while the charged acts occurred between 1990 and 1999. Further, defendant maintained that the charged acts were not consistent with the modus operandi of the alleged prior sexual misconduct, which defendant summarized as follows: “[defendant] would use the opportunity of a sports injury, claim that he was pursuing training in massage therapy, invite the victims to his home, and would inappropriately touch the victims during the course of a ‘sports massage.’” In contrast, defendant noted that Adam’s alleged abuse was not an isolated incident that occurred under the guise of a sports massage—rather it allegedly occurred over the nine-year period during which Adam lived with defendant.', 'The defendant alternatively argued that the prior sexual misconduct was inadmissible under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence because it had little probative value and was “unquestionably” prejudicial. Specifically, he again asserted that the alleged prior sexual misconduct was too remote and dissimilar to be probative of his modus operandi.

The state cited to State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19 (R.I. 2013), for the principle that when a defendant is charged with second-degree child molestation sexual assault, which is a specific- intent crime that requires proof that the defendant touched the complainant “for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault[,]” similar instances of sexual misconduct are admissible to show the defendant’s intent. Mitchell, 80 A.3d at 29 (quoting State v. Coningford, 901 A.2d 623, 630 (R.I. 2006)). The state then discussed the similarities between the alleged prior sexual misconduct and the charged act; each incident occurred when the children were around the same age, in the same location, and involved the same act of sexual misconduct. The state maintained that the alleged prior sexual misconduct demonstrated defendant’s “systematic and repeated molestation of these young boys.”', 'The defendant disputed the state’s contention that the prior sexual misconduct was probative of his intent to self-gratify. He argued that the trial justice would have to infer that “when [defendant] finished with the sports massage, he goes into a bathroom[] * * * [a]nd then when he comes back, the witnesses are going to draw the inference that somehow he saw something, in the form of a child’s penis, went behind a closed door, and gratified himself.” The defendant maintained, however, that there was no evidence of self-gratification.', 'The trial justice rendered her decision on the state’s motion in limine. Although she was mindful of the time span between the alleged prior sexual misconduct and the charged acts, she found that “[t]he similarities between the relationship of the parties, the nature of the alleged assault and the location of the alleged assault would be so strong that the [c]ourt would find that', '-5- the span of time between the alleged assaults * * * is not rendered so remote that the [c]ourt shall preclude the evidence.” She determined that the 404(b) evidence was relevant to establish motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, identity, and absence of mistake or accident. Accordingly, the trial justice granted the state’s motion in limine and allowed the state to present testimony from witnesses about prior sexual misconduct perpetrated by defendant.', 'B', 'The State’s Case', 'A jury-waived trial began on November 18, 2014. Below we summarize the relevant testimony adduced at trial.', 'The complaining witness, Adam, testified. At the time of trial, he was thirty-three years old. He testified that he first met defendant when he was eight years old and defendant was the coach of his youth football team. Adam said that defendant gave him rides to practices and games because his parents “were always working.” Adam described the progression of his relationship with defendant: “It grew into going out to dinner, going to movies, and then finally it grew into sleeping over during the weekends and then moving in.” He testified that he moved in with defendant at the age of twelve and described this development:', '“My parents saw a huge difference in my attitude and everything.', 'I mean, I had two older brothers who were hell for my mom, and', 'she basically thought it was best in my, you know, interest and', 'pretty much allowed me to stay there. He was a teacher. I mean,', 'to them, you know—something holy, I guess, because it would', 'save me from going with my brothers. Both my brothers got', 'deported. He helped me in every single way he could so my', 'parents thought it was the best thing for me.”', 'Adam testified about the first incident of sexual abuse. He was approximately nine years old and was at defendant’s house watching a television show about cancer and circumcision. Adam, unsure of whether he was circumcised, asked defendant, who, in turn, asked Adam to', '-6- show him his penis. Adam testified that defendant began washing Adam’s penis in the shower. Thereafter, Adam asked defendant what “a normal penis” looked like, and in response defendant showed Adam his penis and told him if he rubbed it, it would get bigger. Adam testified that defendant’s penis was erect and that defendant ejaculated. Adam testified that this incident occurred in defendant’s bedroom, on defendant’s bed.', 'Adam testified that he did not tell his parents about the incident because he was afraid and he did not understand what had happened. He said that, after this first incident, the touching continued every weekend and “[i]t turned into getting in the shower together, washing each other.” Adam characterized these incidents as him masturbating defendant and testified that they continued until he was approximately seventeen-and-a-half years old.', 'In his testimony, Adam discussed the first incident of fellatio, which occurred when he was approximately eleven or twelve years old. He stated that defendant performed fellatio on him at least once per week, but it progressed to three to four times per week. Adam testified that, shortly after defendant began performing fellatio on him, he began performing it on defendant. He testified that the incidents took place in defendant’s bedroom, where he regularly slept with defendant. Adam moved out of defendant’s house when he went to college; after he dropped out of college, Adam moved in with his brother. He did not move back in with defendant because he did not want the sexual abuse to reoccur.', 'The state then introduced the testimony of three 404(b) witnesses, beginning with Colin.3 Colin, who was forty-seven years old at the time of trial, testified about an incident that occurred when he was approximately twelve years old. He went to defendant’s house for a sports massage after pulling a muscle in his groin during football practice.', 'Colin testified that 3', 'As previously noted, we use fictitious names to protect the privacy of the witnesses.', '-7- defendant was giving him a full body massage, then told him to roll over, removed Colin’s underwear, and moved Colin’s penis out of the way of the area he wanted to massage. He described defendant as “shaking very violently” while this happened. Colin testified that his penis was not injured.', 'Colin discussed his involvement with a 2004 investigation of defendant. He said that he was at the beach with his brother and friends when they began discussing “the whole system of the Perry brothers and how they were always around kids’ houses * * *.” He said that he became upset thinking about what defendant did to him and he gave a statement to the Bristol Police Department about the incident.', 'Next, David, who was forty-six years old at the time of trial, said that he first met defendant when he was nine years old and tried out for a little league baseball team that defendant coached. David testified about an incident of sexual misconduct by defendant that occurred when he was approximately nine or ten years old. Because David intended to play football in the fall, defendant repeatedly badgered him about getting a jockstrap and a cup. He testified that defendant asked him “[m]any, many times” to show his genitals to him so that defendant could tell David what cup size he needed. David eventually complied in a shed on defendant’s property; he pulled down his pants and underwear. He testified that defendant then fondled his genitals. David said that defendant never told him what cup size he needed.', 'David discussed another incident that occurred when he was approximately nine or ten years old. While driving David home from a team outing at the movies, defendant told David that he had to talk to him. David testified, “[h]e basically took [me] by my shoulders very tight * * * and he proceeded to tell me that he was falling in love with me.” In 2004, David contacted the Bristol Police Department and gave a statement about the incident. He was prompted to', '-8- come forward about the incident after discussing defendant at the beach with his brother and friends, including Colin. David said that he went to the police because “[he] didn’t want other kids to go through * * * what happened to [him]. It was a known secret. People knew what was going on.”', 'Brian, who was forty-five years old at the time of trial, testified next. He knew defendant because, as a child, he lived on the same street as defendant, and defendant coached the little league baseball team with which Brian was involved. He testified about an incident involving defendant that occurred when Brian was approximately ten years old. He said that defendant invited him over to his house to show him nunchucks, knowing that Brian was interested in martial arts.4 While Brian sat on the edge of defendant’s bed in his bedroom, defendant began rubbing his back and asked Brian if he wanted a massage. Brian testified that defendant asked him to take his shirt off, defendant pulled Brian’s shorts off, and “he started to work his way down towards [Brian’s] private areas.” Brian testified that “[defendant’s] hands were on my penis. I mean, I don’t know any other way to describe it, rubbing * * *.” He approximated that the incident lasted between five and ten minutes. After this first incident, Brian testified, defendant gave him three to five more “massages,” but they were not to the degree of the first incident.', 'Brian also testified about his relationship with Adam, the complaining witness. Brian was in his early twenties when he first met Adam, who was approximately nine or ten years old at the time. They became good friends and Adam ended up working with Brian. Brian testified that, at some point in their friendship, he and Adam confided in each other about what defendant did to them. 4', 'Nunchucks are a martial arts weapon.', '-9-', 'The state then rested its case and dismissed count 2 pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.5', 'C', 'The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss', 'The defendant then moved pursuant to Rule 29(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that “[i]n a case tried without a jury, a motion to dismiss may be filed at the close of the [s]tate’s case to challenge the legal sufficiency of the [s]tate’s trial evidence.” The defendant argued that the counts were duplicitous. He referenced State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250 (R.I. 1998), where this Court addressed the issue of “duplicity,” which is “the joining of two or more offenses, however numerous, in a single count of an indictment.” Saluter, 715 A.2d at 1253.', 'On December 16, 2014, the trial justice issued a decision on defendant’s motion to dismiss. At the outset, she noted that the state dismissed count 2, and it also dismissed count 9 “after the [c]ourt brought an inconsistency to the attention of the parties * * *.” She then recited the standard for deciding a motion to dismiss, noting that “she is required to weigh and evaluate the trial evidence, to pass upon the credibility of the trial witnesses and engage in inferential processes impartially, not being required to view inferences in favor of the nonmoving party and against the moving party.” The trial justice then made credibility findings. She noted that the case depended on the credibility of Adam, whom she deemed to be a credible witness. The trial justice, on the record before her, found defendant to be “a pedophile who developed a sexual relationship with [Adam], which relationship continued throughout his childhood and into his 5', 'Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[t]he attorney for the [s]tate may file a dismissal of an indictment, information, or complaint and the prosecution shall thereupon terminate. Such a dismissal may not be filed during the trial without the consent of the defendant.”', '- 10 - teens. When their sexual contact began, [defendant] convinced the young boy that it was normal, and their sexual relationship became part of their lives together, part of [Adam’s] life.” She further found that “[d]efendant had a pattern of engaging in sexual contact with young boys he either met through his work as an athletic coach or in the case of [Brian], who he met as a neighbor, but who he developed a coach/player relationship with.”', 'The trial justice accepted the testimony of the 404(b) witnesses and found that the testimony satisfied Rule 404(b)’s requirements despite the fact that Brian, Colin, and David testified about single acts of sexual misconduct by defendant, whereas Adam endured regular, long-term sexual abuse, noting that defendant had a greater opportunity to groom and abuse Adam.', 'The trial justice then discussed the specific counts charged against defendant. The trial justice addressed counts 1 and 3, which charged defendant with first-degree child molestation sexual assault. Specifically, count 1 related to fellatio by Adam on defendant, and count 3 related to the first incident of fellatio by defendant on Adam. The trial justice regarded Adam’s testimony on each of these incidents as credible, and accordingly denied defendant’s motion to dismiss with respect to counts 1 and 3.', 'The trial justice also denied defendant’s motion to dismiss with respect to count 4, which charged defendant with second-degree child molestation sexual assault, specifically the first incident of sexual contact, when defendant touched Adam’s penis. She regarded as credible Adam’s testimony about this incident, which he said occurred in the shower under the guise of washing Adam’s uncircumcised penis. She dismissed count 5, however, which also charged defendant with second-degree child molestation sexual assault, because she found it duplicitous in view of that fact that the indictment “[did] not identify this particular act of second degree', '- 11 - sexual assault from any other act of second degree sexual assault testified to by [Adam] as having occurred in the bedroom prior to his 14th birthday or on or before his 14th birthday.”', 'With respect to counts 6, 7, and 8, which charged defendant with first-degree and second- degree sexual assault, the trial justice noted that these counts required the state to prove that defendant used force or coercion. Although the trial justice found that the state proved the requisite force, she dismissed counts 6, 7, and 8 because she found a duplicity issue. In sum, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion to dismiss with respect to counts 1, 3, and 4, and granted the motion with respect to counts 5, 6, 7, and 8.', 'D', 'The Defendant’s Case', 'The defendant testified. He denied having any sexual contact with Colin, David, and Brian, and said that Colin’s testimony was the only one with any truth to it because he had indeed given Colin a heat treatment for a groin injury. The defendant rebutted David’s testimony that defendant had fondled his genitals under the guise of fitting him for a jockstrap and cup; he testified that the incident occurred at the football team’s practice field while defendant was fitting other children for their football gear and that he had David press his own hands against his genitals to see what cup size would best fit him. The defendant explained Colin and David’s allegations against him as “a one upmanship kind of thing.” He testified that Brian made up the allegations because he “had an ax to grind.”', 'The defendant then discussed Adam. He said that he used to give Adam rides to and from football practice. After the football season ended, defendant testified that Adam would call him and ask if he could come over to his house. The defendant testified that he “put him off a few times,” but that eventually he would pick up Adam, and Adam would spend the day at his', '- 12 - house. The defendant stated that Adam began staying the night because he “started begging” to stay over. He testified that Adam lived with him between the ages of twelve and eighteen.', 'The defendant denied having a sexual relationship with Adam or ever touching him in a sexual manner. He was asked about Adam’s testimony concerning the first incident of sexual abuse, when defendant allegedly touched Adam’s penis under the guise of washing it. The defendant testified that he instructed Adam on how to wash himself, but denied touching Adam’s penis or showering with Adam. He testified that Adam’s allegations were untrue, and he accused Adam of being a liar.', 'E', 'The Trial Justice’s Decision', 'On January 5, 2015, after the close of the evidence, the trial justice rendered her decision. She discussed the remaining counts of the indictment: counts 1 and 3, which charged defendant with first-degree child molestation sexual assault, and count 4, which charged him with second- degree child molestation sexual assault. The trial justice then summarized the evidence adduced at trial. She began by discussing the testimony of the 404(b) witnesses. She determined that the testimony of Brian, Colin, and David satisfied the requirements of Rule 404(b) given the similarity of their ages, their relationships to defendant, and the acts of sexual misconduct. She found their testimony to be “probative of a plan, a design, a signature offense absence of mistake or accident.”', 'She regarded all three witnesses’ testimony as credible, and she rejected defendant’s claim that Colin and David’s allegations were the result of “one upmanship.” She stated: “These were not adolescent boys getting together, one with a better story to share than the other. These were mature men. And they weren’t just blabbing to one another, boasting. They were sharing events that led them to the police department to make criminal complaints.”', '- 13 -', 'The trial justice also rejected defendant’s testimony that he “resisted [Adam’s] needy efforts to spend time with him,” finding it not believable given the respective ages, experiences, and education levels of defendant and Adam. She deemed not credible defendant’s explanation of Adam’s testimony about the first incident of sexual assault and his insistence that he solely instructed Adam on how to wash his penis and did not touch it. She characterized his testimony as a feeble attempt at disputing Adam’s testimony. After considering all the evidence, the trial justice found defendant guilty on counts 1 and 3, first-degree child molestation sexual assault, and count 4, second-degree child molestation sexual assault.', 'On May 8, 2015, the trial justice sentenced defendant to serve concurrent terms of life at the Adult Correctional Institutions for counts 1 and 3, and thirty years, to run concurrently with the life sentences, for count 4. The defendant timely appealed.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Rule 404(b)', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in granting the state’s motion in limine and in admitting the testimony of Brian, Colin, and David. He maintains that the alleged prior sexual misconduct was too remote and dissimilar to the charged acts to be admissible.', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'With respect to defendant’s challenge to the trial justice’s decision to admit the 404(b) witnesses’ testimony, “we examine that issue under an abuse-of-discretion standard.” State v. Rainey, 175 A.3d 1169, 1182 (R.I. 2018). “If the evidence was admitted under Rule 404(b), then', '- 14 - ‘this Court is disinclined to perceive an abuse of discretion so long as the record contains some grounds for supporting the trial justice’s decision * * *.’” Id. (quoting State v. Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d 268, 279 (R.I. 2017)).', '2', 'Analysis', 'As a general rule, “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.” R.I. R. Evid. 404(b). However, Rule 404(b) carves out an exception for the admission of such evidence “for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident, or to prove that defendant feared imminent bodily harm and that the fear was reasonable.”', '“In molestation or sexual assault cases, evidence of a defendant’s prior sexual misconduct cannot be admitted to prove that defendant is a bad man, and that he has a propensity toward sexual offenses and, therefore, probably committed the offenses with which he is charged.” Rainey, 175 A.3d at 1182 (quoting Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806). However, evidence of prior sexual misconduct with someone other than the complainant is admissible under the exceptions to Rule 404(b) if the sexual offenses are “nonremote” and “similar.” Id. (quoting Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806). The sexual offenses are “nonremote” and “similar” if they are “closely related in time, place, age, family relationships of the victims, and the form of the sexual acts.” Id. (quoting Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806). Further, to be admissible, “the evidence must [also] be relevant to the crime charged and reasonably necessary.” Id. at 1185 (quoting Coningford, 901 A.2d at 628-29).', '- 15 -', 'Based on the foregoing, we begin our analysis by examining whether the testimony of Brian, Colin, and David satisfied the “nonremote” and “similar” requirements of our Rule 404(b) jurisprudence.', 'a', 'Nonremoteness', 'When determining whether to admit Rule 404(b) evidence, “the trial justice ‘must balance the relevance of the evidence against its remoteness and the potential for improper prejudicial impact.’” State v. Buchanan, 81 A.3d 1119, 1125 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Dubois, 36 A.3d 191, 200 (R.I. 2012)). Here, the trial justice did just that. She remained conscious of the time span between the alleged prior sexual misconduct and the charged acts, and she weighed this time span against the relevance of the evidence.6 Ultimately, the trial justice determined that the similarities between the prior sexual misconduct and the charged acts were “so strong” that any remoteness was outweighed. We discern no abuse of the considerable discretion afforded to trial justices in evidentiary matters.', 'We are further convinced that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in light of this Court’s opinions wherein we have upheld the admission of uncharged sexual misconduct where similar time spans existed between such misconduct and the charged acts. See Rainey, 175 A.3d at 1184 (affirming a trial justice’s finding that a time span of eleven to fifteen years was nonremote); Coningford, 901 A.2d at 628 (concluding that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in finding that the probative value of the 404(b) evidence outweighed the alleged remoteness of the prior acts of sexual misconduct, which occurred seven and eleven years before 6', 'As noted above, the incidents of sexual misconduct that the 404(b) witnesses testified to occurred between approximately 1977 and 1980, whereas the complainant’s abuse occurred from approximately 1990 through 1999.', '- 16 - the charged act); State v. Hopkins, 698 A.2d 183, 186 (R.I. 1997) (upholding the trial justice’s finding that the evidence’s probative value outweighed the ten-year span between the prior sexual misconduct and the charged acts).', 'In Hopkins, the trial justice admitted the testimony of two witnesses concerning the defendant’s sexual misconduct that occurred when they were of an age similar to that of the complainant. Hopkins, 698 A.2d at 186. This Court held that, despite the ten-year time span between the prior sexual misconduct and the charged act, the trial justice did not err in finding that the alleged remoteness of the 404(b) evidence was outweighed:', '“(1) by its potential probative value concerning the similar age and', 'relationship of the boys to [the defendant] when they were', 'allegedly victimized by him and (2) by the other indicia that [the', 'defendant’s] sexual forays involving young boys under his', 'dominion constituted ‘a modus operandi that bore [his] signature.’”', 'Id. (quoting State v. Lamoureux, 623 A.2d 9, 13 (R.I. 1993)). Similarly, here, the trial justice found that any remoteness was outweighed by the evidence’s probative value, given the similarities between the victims’ relationships to defendant, the nature of the sexual acts, and the location of the misconduct. She further determined that defendant’s prior sexual misconduct would tend to prove his motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, identity, and absence of mistake or accident. Consequently, we are of the opinion that the trial justice was within her discretion to conclude that the probative value of the 404(b) evidence outweighed the alleged remoteness.', 'b', 'Similarity', '“[T]he factors to be considered when comparing the charged incident and the prior sexual misconduct are ‘time, place, age, family relationships of the victims, and the form of the sexual acts.’” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 807 (quoting State v. Brigham, 638 A.2d 1043, 1045 (R.I.', '- 17 - 1994)). Looking to these factors, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in finding that the prior acts of sexual misconduct were similar to the charged acts. The victims were of similar ages, between nine and twelve years old, when defendant’s sexual abuse occurred.', 'Although Adam’s abuse continued until he was much older, the trial justice perceptively noted that defendant had a greater opportunity to abuse him. Additionally, the victims were all local boys who participated in the youth sports leagues in which defendant was involved. The incidents of sexual misconduct all occurred at defendant’s residence. The sexual acts all involved defendant touching the genitals of the victims, under the guise of: fitting one victim for a cup; performing a sports massage on another victim with a groin injury; giving another victim a massage; and showing the complainant how to wash his genitals.', 'The defendant maintains that the charged acts are dissimilar to the alleged prior sexual misconduct because Adam alleged oral penetration and the 404(b) witnesses did not. However, it is again relevant to note, as the trial justice did, that defendant had an increased opportunity to groom and abuse Adam. Further, “we are not concerned with whether the incidents were exactly the same, nor with whether they contained ‘uncannily similar facts.’” Rainey, 175 A.3d at 1183. Given the striking similarities between the ages of the victims, the relationships of the victims to defendant, the locations of the sexual misconduct, and the nature of the sexual acts, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in finding the prior sexual misconduct similar to the charged acts.', 'c', 'Relevant and Reasonably Necessary', 'Our inquiry does not end there. To be admitted under Rule 404(b), “the evidence must [also] be relevant to the crime charged and reasonably necessary.” Rainey, 175 A.3d at 1185', '- 18 - (quoting Coningford, 901 A.2d at 628-29). Pertinent to our analysis is Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, which defines “relevant evidence” as “evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.”', '“We have held on more than one occasion that, when a defendant is charged with second-degree molestation, similar incidents involving other victims are admissible to demonstrate the defendant’s intent to sexually gratify.” Mitchell, 80 A.3d at 29.', 'Because defendant was charged with second-degree child molestation sexual assault,7 evidence that defendant engaged in similar acts of sexual misconduct—namely touching the genitals of similarly-aged boys—was relevant to demonstrate defendant’s specific intent to self-gratify. See id. (concluding that evidence that the defendant touched the complainant’s older sister was relevant to demonstrate his specific intent to sexually gratify in touching the complainant); Coningford, 901 A.2d at 629 (“[T]he jury could infer, from the evidence of similar incidents involving two other young boys, that [the] defendant’s intent in touching [the complainant] was for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification.”); Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 808 (“The fact that similar incidents occurred with different women tends to prove [the] defendant’s intent to touch [the complainant] for the purpose of sexual gratification.”).', 'In addition to the relevancy requirement, this Court has held that the 404(b) evidence must be reasonably necessary. Rainey, 175 A.3d at 1186. Recently, in Rainey, this Court concluded that testimony about other incidents of the defendant’s sexual misconduct was reasonably necessary because: (1) the abuse of the complainant occurred more than twenty years ago; (2) the complainant was the only witness to testify to the incidents of sexual misconduct 7', 'Counts 4 and 5 charged defendant with second-degree child molestation sexual assault, although, as noted above, the trial justice dismissed count 5.', '- 19 - against her, as there was no physical evidence or third-party eyewitness testimony; and (3) the defendant denied the allegations, creating a “credibility contest” between the defendant and the complainant.

In reaching our holding in Rainey, this Court relied on Cavanaugh, where we deemed evidence about the defendant’s prior sexual misconduct to be relevant and reasonably necessary because “the evidence revealed a crime committed in private with a significant lapse of time between the sexual assaults and the prosecution * * * [and] [t]he credibility of the complainant was placed at center stage.” Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d at 280.', 'In the instant case, we are faced with circumstances similar to those present in Rainey and Cavanaugh. Adam testified to abuse that occurred between approximately 1990 and 1999, some fifteen to twenty-four years prior to the 2014 trial. Further, as the trial justice noted, the case relied on Adam’s credibility, which defendant attacked by denying the allegations levied against him and by claiming that Adam was a liar who fabricated the sexual abuse.', 'Given the “significant lapse of time between the sexual assaults and the prosecution[,]” and the “credibility contest” between defendant and Adam, the testimony about defendant’s alleged prior sexual misconduct was reasonably necessary. Rainey, 175 A.3d at 1186 (quoting Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d at 280).

The trial justice began her Rule 29(b) analysis by setting forth the relevant law, then she discussed the evidence that the state had presented and made credibility determinations regarding the witnesses. She deemed Adam and the 404(b) witnesses credible, and found the testimony by Colin and Brian to be especially cogent. The trial justice then addressed each of the remaining counts against defendant. She deemed credible Adam’s testimony about counts 1 and 3, which charged defendant with first-degree child molestation sexual assault, to wit, the first incident of fellatio by Adam on defendant and the first incident of fellatio by defendant on Adam. Accordingly, she denied defendant’s motion to dismiss in relation to counts 1 and 3. The trial justice also found credible Adam’s testimony related to count 4, namely the first incident of defendant touching Adam’s penis, and she accordingly denied the motion to dismiss with respect to count 4.', 'We also reject defendant’s contention that the trial justice’s decision on his Rule 29(b) motion, in its essence, amounted to a guilty verdict and deprived him of an opportunity to present his defense.

We respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority in this case. We do so primarily for the reasons we previously set forth in dissent in State v. Rainey, 175 A.3d 1169, 1193 (R.I. 2018) (Flaherty, J., joined by Robinson, J., dissenting), reasons which we incorporate here. As we explained in Rainey, it is our firm opinion that, for evidence to be admissible under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, it must be, among other things, both nonremote and similar to the charged conduct. Rainey, 175 A.3d at 1193. In other words, and with particular regard to this case, for “evidence of a defendant’s sexual offenses against a person other than the complaining witness” to be admitted, “it [first] must be * * * nonremote and similar to the charged conduct * * *.” Id. (emphasis added). Indeed, it remains our view that remoteness and similarity are distinct inquiries. For that reason, we can reach no other conclusion than that the testimony of Brian, Colin, and David was too remote to be admissible under Rule 404(b).1', 'In reaching a contrary conclusion, the majority purports to separate the nonremote and similarity analyses, writing that the Court would “begin [its] analysis by examining whether the testimony of Brian, Colin, and David satisfied the ‘nonremote’ and ‘similar’ requirements of our Rule 404(b) jurisprudence.” Nevertheless, in analyzing the remoteness of the evidence offered by the testimony of Brian, Colin, and David, the majority then explains that the trial justice did not err in finding “that any remoteness was outweighed by the evidence’s probative value, given the similarities between the victims’ relationships to defendant, the nature of the sexual acts, and the location of the misconduct.” However, the factors employed by the majority to assess remoteness are the very same factors used to assess similarity for purposes of analyzing the 1', 'Though our primary concern relates to the remoteness of this evidence, we also note that there are significant differences in the continuing course of conduct described by the complainant, Adam, and the uncharged conduct testified to by Brian, Colin, and David.', '- 26 - admissibility of evidence under Rule 404(b). See, e.g., State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 807 (R.I. 2005) (“[T]he factors to be considered when comparing the charged incident and the prior sexual misconduct are ‘time, place, age, family relationships of the victims, and the form of the sexual acts.’” (quoting State v. Brigham, 638 A.2d 1043, 1045 (R.I. 1994))). As we said in dissent in Rainey, we believe that the remoteness inquiry must be separate and, as was the case in Rainey, the Rule 404(b) evidence here was, in our opinion, too remote. In this case, the evidence admitted under Rule 404(b) concerning uncharged conduct ranged in time from ten to twenty- two years prior to the charged conduct.2', 'Not only are we in disagreement with the majority as to the admissibility of the testimony of Brian, Colin, and David on the basis that it was too remote, but we are also concerned by what we see, respectfully, as a troubling trend developing in our Rule 404(b) caselaw. In this case, the trial justice admitted the Rule 404(b) evidence because it was “relevant to show motive, opportunity and intent, preparation, plan, identity and certainly absence of mistake or accident.” This Court then affirmed the trial justice, delineating all the same Rule 404(b) exceptions as acceptable.3 Similarly, in Rainey, the trial justice admitted the Rule 404(b) evidence to show the 2', 'Based on the majority’s discussion of the testimony of Brian, Colin, and David, the Rule 404(b) incidents occurred between 1977 and 1980. Because the charged conduct to which Adam testified occurred between 1990 and 1999, the time between the charged conduct and uncharged Rule 404(b) incidents ranges from ten to twenty-two years. 3', 'We do acknowledge, as the majority points out, that, when she rendered her decision, the trial justice appeared to narrow the list of purposes for which she was considering the Rule 404(b) evidence. As the trial justice stated when she rendered her decision, she found the testimony of Brian, Colin, and David “probative of a plan, a design, a signature offense absence of mistake or accident.” However, thereafter, the trial justice returned to a broader list:', '“I did not consider any of [the Rule 404(b)] testimony evidence of', 'bad character or that the Defendant acted in conformity with the', 'prior acts, but all of this evidence was probative, highly probative', 'of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge,', '- 27 - defendant’s “motive, his opportunity, his intent, preparation, [and] his plan * * *.” Rainey, 175 A.3d at 1184. However, in Rainey, this Court zeroed in on the “common scheme or plan” exception, selecting that option from the trial justice’s broader listing in his charge to the jury. Without reiterating our objections to those specific holdings, we remain troubled by the movement toward what appears to be an implicit resurrection of the “scatter-shot” approach to Rule 404(b), an approach about which this Court expressed disapproval long ago. See State v. Jalette, 119 R.I. 614, 627, 382 A.2d 526, 533 (1978) (“In its charge the trial court should not take a scatter-shot approach and list all of the exceptions to the exclusionary rule. Rather, it shall designate with particularity the specific exceptions to which the ‘other crimes’ evidence is relevant and delete from its charge the remaining exceptions.”).4', 'In keeping with the proposition that “[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith[,]” we feel compelled to express our concern with this Court’s apparent retreat from its disapproval of a scatter-shot approach to Rule 404(b). See R.I. R. Evid. 404(b); Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627, 382 A.2d at 533. A trial justice’s mere recitation of various exceptions set forth in the rule is, in our view, insufficient—especially in light of the premise of Rule 404(b). See R.I. R. Evid. 404(b); see also People v. Zackowitz, 172 N.E. 466, 468 (N.Y. 1930) (Cardozo, C.J.) (“In a very real sense a defendant starts his life afresh when he stands before a jury, a prisoner at the', 'absence of mistake or accident.', 'It was probative of them all,', 'signature crime.” In any event, we remain firm in the view that the error in this case stems from the initial admission of the testimony when the trial justice ruled on the motion in limine, concluding that the Rule 404(b) testimony was “relevant to show motive, opportunity and intent, preparation, plan, identity and certainly absence of mistake or accident.” 4', 'We realize that this case, unlike Rainey, was tried before a justice sitting without a jury.

The admissibility of evidence under Rule 404(b) should not entail a formulaic exercise.

See Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627, 382 A.2d at 533 (“In seeking to attain this particular goal [that the applicable exception is relevant to proving the charge lodged against the defendant], the trial court may insist that the prosecutor point to the specific exception on which he relies and show how that exception relates to the pending charge.”). A blanket assertion that evidence is offered to show a majority of the Rule 404(b) purposes—i.e., “proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident”—does not satisfy this requirement. We should not allow a trial justice to make such a blanket assertion, admit the evidence, and thereafter wait for this Court to pluck a purpose that it considers acceptable from the transcript.5', 'For those reasons, we must respectfully dissent. 5', 'Assessing whether evidence is sufficiently nonremote for purposes of admissibility under Rule 404(b) ought to be contingent on the specific purpose for which that evidence is offered.', '- 29 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'State v.

State of Rhode Island : (PM 14-4730),non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court.', 'The petitioner/defendant, Frederick Gibson, was convicted of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, and, as a sex offender, he became obligated to register with and notify local authorities when he changed his residence from town to town in the state of Rhode Island. But one thorny issue to be determined in these consolidated cases is the duration of that obligation. Is he required to register for life, as the state argues, or for a period of ten years, as he maintains? An equally vexing question that must be addressed by this Court in this case of first impression is whether changes to the law requiring Gibson to register—namely, two amendments to G.L. 1956 § 11-37.1-4(a), which governs the duration and frequency of registration, and an increase in the punishment for the failure to comply with the', '-1- sex-offender registration laws—violate the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions.', 'Gibson seeks review on certiorari of a decision of a magistrate of the Superior Court denying his motion to dismiss a 2012 charge for failing to notify law enforcement of a change in residence, in violation of §§ 11-37.1-9 and 11-37.1-10. In denying Gibson’s motion to dismiss, the magistrate determined that Gibson had a lifetime duty to register; therefore, his duty to register had not expired, and the 2012 charge would not be dismissed. Also, Gibson appeals from a judgment embodying a decision of a justice of the Superior Court denying his application for postconviction relief from three failure-to-notify convictions in 2007, 2009, and 2010, in violation of § 11-37.1-9. 1 The hearing justice in the postconviction relief matter also found that Gibson was burdened by a lifetime duty to register. In addition, she ruled that Gibson’s three failure-to-notify convictions did not violate the ex post facto clause.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm both the magistrate’s denial of Gibson’s motion to dismiss and the judgment of the Superior Court denying Gibson’s application for postconviction relief. However, in so doing, we deviate slightly from the reasoning on which the decision and judgment were based. We depart from the conclusions of the magistrate and the hearing justice that Gibson has a lifetime duty to register. Rather, we hold that, in accordance with the language of §§ 11-37.1-18 and 11-37.1-4(a), Gibson’s duty to register expires “ten (10) 1', 'Because of the considerable overlap of the issues presented in these cases, we consolidated Gibson’s petition for a writ of certiorari and his appeal from the denial of his application for postconviction relief. Gibson’s challenge to the denial of postconviction relief comes to us on appeal, not certiorari, because he filed his notice of appeal prior to the 2015 amendment to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-9 requiring an applicant seeking review of a final judgment regarding postconviction relief to do so “by filing a petition for writ of certiorari * * *.” See P.L. 2015, ch. 91, § 1; P.L. 2015, ch. 92, § 1. Still, final judgment in the Superior Court did not enter until July 7, 2015, shortly after that amendment’s date of enactment. In what appears to be an attempt to ensure that the appeal of his application for postconviction relief was procedurally proper, Gibson filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and a motion to consolidate, which we granted.', '-2- years from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *.” Section 11-37.1-4(a).

Under the provisions of § 11-37-16, a statute that the General Assembly had enacted in 1992, Gibson was required to register as a sex offender. 4 In 1996, the General Assembly repealed § 11-37-16 and enacted a more comprehensive registration regime entitled the “Sexual Offender Registration and Community Notification Act,” chapter 37.1 of title 11 (the “Registration Act”).

Although this was Gibson’s first conviction for failing to notify in accordance with the Registration Act, it would not be his last. In both 2009 and 2010, Gibson—for a second and third time, respectively—pleaded nolo contendere to failing to notify in violation of § 11-37.1-9.

For his 2010 transgression, he received a ten-year sentence, with six months to serve and the balance suspended with probation. Thus, by the close of 2010, Gibson had been convicted on three separate occasions of failing to notify in accordance with the Registration Act.', 'Finally, in July 2012, Gibson was charged for a fourth time with failing to notify in violation of §§ 11-37.1-9 and 11-37.1-10. To this charge, though, Gibson did not plead nolo contendere. Rather, he moved to dismiss the criminal information, arguing that his duty to register as a sex offender had expired in 2004—ten years from the date of his conviction in 1994 and well before the 2012 charge.', 'However, a magistrate of the Superior Court decided otherwise. In a written decision, the magistrate denied Gibson’s motion to dismiss, concluding that Gibson was saddled with a lifetime duty to register. Gibson then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with this Court, seeking review of the magistrate’s decision. We granted his petition.', 'Several months after the magistrate denied his motion to dismiss, Gibson filed an application for postconviction relief from his three prior failure-to-notify convictions that had occurred in 2007, 2009, and 2010. Before a justice of the Superior Court, Gibson made the same argument that he had raised in his motion to dismiss: the duration of his duty to register was limited to ten years, not for the remainder of his life. He further argued that his prior failure-to- notify convictions violated the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions because (a) amendments to the Registration Act impermissibly extended the duration of his duty to register, and (b) the Registration Act increased the punishment for failing to comply with the sex-offender registration laws from a misdemeanor to a felony.

Significantly, he does not dispute his duty to register. The question for this Court is whether the duration of Gibson’s duty to register is governed by either the repealed § 11-37-16—the registration statute in effect in 1993, the year of the underlying sex offense—or chapter 37.1 of title 11—the registration statute he has been convicted of violating on three separate and subsequent occasions.', 'As noted above, in 2012, Gibson was charged by criminal information with, for the fourth time, failing to notify in violation of §§ 11-37.1-9 and 11-37.1-10. 7 He moved to dismiss the criminal information, 8 arguing to the magistrate that his duty to register expired in 2004, ten years from the date of his conviction for second-degree child molestation sexual assault. The state, on the other hand, argued that Gibson’s duty to register was without expiration.

In the alternative, the state also argued that Gibson’s duty to register, as a consequence of the child molestation conviction, even if not for life, would not expire until at least November 2019, ten years after the expiration of his sentence for second-degree child molestation sexual assault, in accordance with § 11-37.1-4(a).', 'In a written decision, the magistrate denied Gibson’s motion to dismiss, holding that the statute in effect at the time of his plea, § 11-37-16, burdened him with lifetime registration. Relying on an opinion from the United States District Court for the District of Maine that interpreted the repealed Rhode Island statute, the magistrate held that the clear and unambiguous language of § 11-37-16 imposed a lifetime duty to register, because it lacked a durational requirement. 9 Then, quoting from this Court’s opinion in State v. Flores, 714 A.2d 581 (R.I. 1998), the magistrate reasoned that Gibson, who was charged with a crime prior to the enactment of the Registration Act in 1996, “must register as a sex offender pursuant to the registration requirements in effect at the time he was charged, that is, pursuant to § 11-37-16.” Flores, 714 A.2d at 583.

Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069, 1078 (R.I. 2013)).', 'B', 'Discussion', 'We are confronted with a nettlesome question: Which statute controls the duration of Gibson’s duty to register—the repealed § 11-37-16, which was silent with respect to the durational limit on the duty to register, arguably imposing a lifetime duty to register, or § 11- 37.1-4(a), which limits the duty to register of certain offenders to “a period of ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence”? Gibson, who does not dispute that he was under a duty to register, argues that the ten-year duration contained in § 11-37.1-4(a) controls. However, he further argues that the duration of his duty to register was set as of 1996, when the version of the Registration Act in effect at that time stated that the duty to register for offenders such as him ran “for a period of ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction * * *.” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1. According to Gibson, because his conviction for second-degree child molestation sexual assault was in 1994, his duty to register concluded ten years later, in 2004.', 'The state does not agree. It first posits that the duration of Gibson’s duty to register is governed by § 11-37-16, the statute in effect at the time of the sex offense. Under the state’s interpretation of that statute, Gibson has a lifetime duty to register because he was convicted in', '-8- 1994, and because the statute was silent on the issue of how long an offender must register. Indeed, the state maintains that § 11-37.1-4 applies by its specific and unambiguous terms only to offenses occurring after its enactment in 1996.', 'In the alternative, the state contends that the duration of Gibson’s duty to register, if governed by chapter 37.1 of title 11, ends in 2019, ten years from the expiration of his fifteen- year sentence, pursuant to the terms of the current version of § 11-37.1-4, and not, as Gibson maintains, ten years from the date of his 1994 conviction, under the terms of the since-amended 1996 version of that section.', 'According to Gibson, his duty to register expired in 2004. But, to accept that argument would require us to ignore changes to § 11-37.1-4(a) that extended the duration of the duty to register for those subject to its terms from “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction” to “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of release from confinement or placement on parole, supervised release or probation” to the current requirement of “ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *.” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1; P.L. 1997, ch. 156, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1.', 'With respect to the state’s argument that there is a lifetime obligation, it does not escape us that we cannot overlook the specific language of § 11-37.1-18, which provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“Any person who pursuant to the provisions of former § 11-37-16', 'had a duty to register under that section after having been', 'convicted of any violation of the provisions of chapter 37 of this', 'title * * * shall have the duty to register in accordance with the', 'provisions of this chapter.” (Emphasis added.) That language preserves only Gibson’s duty to register, not its duration. See § 11-37.1-18. To complicate matters further, the 1996 Registration Act included a general provision that it “shall', '-9- apply to those persons who are convicted of an offense requiring registration * * * which was committed after the effective date of [the Registration Act].” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 4 (emphasis added). Of course, the sex offense to which Gibson later pled was in 1993, three years prior to the effective date of the Registration Act. See Flores, 714 A.2d at 583.', 'After considering the thoughtful arguments of counsel, we are persuaded that a slightly different rationale resolves the question of the duration of Gibson’s duty to register. Starting with § 11-37.1-18, it is clear to us that, in enacting the Registration Act, the Legislature preserved Gibson’s duty to register because he had an obligation to do so under the former § 11- 37-16. Therefore, in our opinion the passage of the Registration Act did not free Gibson from the responsibility to register. However, the General Assembly’s mandate that offenders “shall have the duty to register in accordance with the provisions of [chapter 37.1 of title 11]” included the ten-year duration period set forth in § 11-37.1-4(a). Section 11-37.1-18 (emphasis added). It is important to note that the savings clause in § 11-37.1-18 says nothing about the duration of the duty to register. Id. (“Nothing in this section shall be construed to abrogate any duty to register which exists or existed under the provisions of former § 11-37-16.” (Emphasis added.)). This clear and unambiguous language constrains us to conclude that, in accordance with chapter 37.1, the duration of Gibson’s duty to register is governed by § 11-37.1-4(a). 10 In other words, when it repealed and replaced § 11-37-16, the General Assembly not only preserved the duty to register 10', 'Looking at the Registration Act as a whole, we also note that the crime for which Gibson was convicted—second-degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of § 11-37-8.3—is defined in § 11-37.1-3(a)(1) as “a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor[,]” bringing Gibson within the universe of persons whose annual duty to register is governed by § 11-37.1- 4(a). See § 11-37.1-4(a) (stating that “[a]ny person required to register under § 11-37.1-3(a)(1) * * * shall annually register * * * for a period of ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *”); § 11-37.1-3(a)(1) (requiring “[a]ny person who, in this or any other jurisdiction * * * has been convicted of a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor” to register as a sex offender “for the time period specified in § 11-37.1-4”); § 11-37.1-2(e)(3) (defining a “[c]riminal offense against a victim who is a minor” to include “[a]ny violation of * * * [§] 11-37-8.3”).', '- 10 - from that statute, but it also imposed the provisions of the new enactment, including the duration of registration. 11 Therefore, it is our opinion that Gibson’s duty to register is for a period of ten years, not a lifetime.', 'The next question we must address is, ten years from when? We do not agree with Gibson that the duration of his duty to register was fixed as of the enactment of the Registration Act in 1996. As we explained above, in 1997 and again in 2003, the General Assembly amended the durational period contained in § 11-37.1-4(a), extending it from, in 1996, “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction” to, in 1997, “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of release from confinement or placement on parole, supervised release or probation” and, as of 2003, “ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *.” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1; P.L. 1997, ch. 156, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1; see also § 11- 37.1-4(a).', 'Those amendments extended Gibson’s duty to register beyond 2004, and, in accordance with the provisions of the present version of the Registration Act, see § 11-37.1-18, Gibson’s duty to register is “ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *.” Section 11-37.1-4(a).', 'Accordingly, it is our opinion that the magistrate was correct in denying Gibson’s motion to dismiss the 2012 charge for failing to notify in violation of §§ 11-37.1-9 and 11-37.1-10. However, we differ from the reasoning on which the magistrate based his decision. Instead, we hold that § 11-37.1-18 preserved Gibson’s duty to register, not its duration. Thus, in accordance 11', 'We offer no opinion as to whether the duration of the duty to register under the former § 11- 37-16 was a lifetime. Because the duration of Gibson’s duty to register was shoehorned into the Registration Act by virtue of § 11-37.1-18, we need not reach that issue.', '- 11 - with § 11-37.1-18, the duration of Gibson’s duty to register is controlled by § 11-37.1-4(a). Simply put, he does not have a lifetime duty to register. 12', 'In reaching this conclusion, however, we do acknowledge that there has been understandable uncertainty on this issue based on this Court’s previous language in Flores— language on which the magistrate relied in his decision. As the magistrate noted, in Flores, “this Court conclude[d] that petitioner must register as a sex offender pursuant to the registration requirements in effect at the time he was charged, that is, pursuant to § 11-37-16.” Flores, 714 A.2d at 583. Moreover, it is true that this Court “reach[ed] [that] conclusion by noting that the registration requirements of chapter 37.1 of title 11 [did] not apply to petitioner by the clear and express language of the public law that enacted that statute.”', 'Id.', 'However, Flores is distinguishable from this case. The petitioner in Flores argued that, because of the timing of his conviction and the effective date of the Registration Act in 1996, he had no duty to register whatsoever. 13 Id. at 582. Here, however, Gibson contested the duration of his duty to register, not the duty itself. Thus Flores resolved an issue distinct from the issue with which we are confronted here.', 'Despite this Court’s language in Flores regarding the interplay between the effective date of the 1996 Registration Act and that particular petitioner’s duty to register, we are firm in our view that the provisions of the Registration Act control here. It would be wholly inconsistent to hold that the provisions of the Registration Act are effective as to Gibson’s duty to register but ineffective as to the conditions of his duty to register, including its duration.

In his application, Gibson challenged his convictions on constitutional grounds. His primary contention was that each of those failure- to-notify convictions violated the ex post facto clause, pointing out two grounds as to why those convictions were constitutionally infirm. First, based on Gibson’s contention that the duration of his duty to register was not for the remainder of his life, but for only ten years, he argued that the General Assembly unconstitutionally extended his duty to register when it amended the Registration Act in 1997 and 2003. According to Gibson, the duration of his duty to register was set under the 1996 version of § 11-37.1-4, which required him to register “for a period of ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction * * *.” See P.L. 1996 ch. 104, § 1. Under that formula, Gibson argued that his duty to register expired in 2004 and that his subsequent convictions in 2007, 2009, and 2010 for failing to notify constituted unconstitutional retroactive', '- 13 - punishment in violation of the ex post facto clause. However, the hearing justice dispatched Gibson’s argument by holding that he had a lifetime duty to register under the since-repealed § 11-37-16, the registration statute in existence at the time of the second-degree child molestation sexual assault in 1993.', 'Second, Gibson argued that the 1996 Registration Act unconstitutionally increased the punishment for the crime of failure to register or notify from a misdemeanor to a felony. As Gibson pointed out, under the 1992 Act, failure to notify was a misdemeanor, but, in 1996, under the Registration Act, it became a felony. See § 11-37-16(g) (1994 Reenactment); P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1. Nevertheless, the hearing justice held that there was no constitutional violation. She reasoned that at the time Gibson committed each criminal offense of failing to notify—in 2007, 2009, and again in 2010—the punishment for the offense was already in place.', 'As she explained, there was no retroactive punishment because the “penalty for failing to [notify] did not change after [Gibson] was charged with the criminal offense of failing to [notify].” The ten- year penalty was added to § 11-37.1-10 in 2003—at least three years prior to Gibson’s first failure-to-notify offense in 2006, an offense for which he was convicted in 2007.', 'However, before turning to the merits of Gibson’s ex post facto arguments, we must briefly summarize the history of the Registration Act.', 'B', 'History of the Registration Act', 'In 1992, the General Assembly enacted § 11-37-16, as enacted by P.L. 1992, ch. 196, § 1, imposing on sex offenders a duty to register.

In addition to preserving the duty to register of offenders whose duty originated under the former § 11-37-16, the Registration Act also, in § 11-37.1-4, contained a durational period for the duty to register for certain offenders. See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1. As originally enacted in 1996, § 11-37.1-4(A) stated: “Any person required to register under section 11-37.1-3, shall annually register with a designated state law enforcement agency for a period of ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction for such offense or offenses * * *.” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1 (emphasis added).', 'Moreover, the Registration Act also enhanced the penalty for the criminal offense of the failure to register or notify. Under the 1992 Act, codified as § 11-37-16, the failure to register or notify was a misdemeanor. See P.L. 1992, ch. 196, § 1. However, under the 1996 Registration Act, it became a felony.

The language of that ten-year durational period changed a final time in 2003, when the General Assembly amended § 11-37.1-4(a) to provide that the duty to register for “[a]ny person required to register under section 11-37.1-3(a)(1) or (2)” runs “for a period of ten (10) years, from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *.” See P.L. 2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1.

For that reason, the state argues that Gibson is severely limited in his ability to launch a collateral attack against those convictions in his application for postconviction relief. According to the state, because Gibson entered those pleas, he waived his right to argue that his 2007, 2009, and 2010 convictions are constitutionally defective.

Gibson reasons that, in 1993, when the offense that precipitated his 1994 conviction for second-degree child molestation sexual assault occurred, he had a duty to register in accordance with the since-repealed § 11-37-16. As discussed above, in 1996, however, his duty to register—preserved by the savings clause set forth in § 11-37.1-18—became governed by the Registration Act, chapter 37.1 of title 11. Under the Registration Act, as it was constituted in 1996, the duty to register for an offender like Gibson was limited to “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction * * *.” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1. Gibson argues that the duration of his duty to register became fixed as of that time, meaning that his duty to register expired in 2004, ten years from the date of his conviction. Thus, Gibson reasons that, in 1997, when the General Assembly extended the duty to register to “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of release from confinement or placement on parole, supervised release or probation[,]” and again in 2003 to “ten (10) years, from the expiration of sentence for the offense[,]” it impermissibly increased a punishment—the duty to register— annexed to his original crime of second-degree child molestation sexual assault.

Gibson focuses on the third category: he alleges an increase in punishment from the one initially annexed to the sex offense of 1993.', '- 20 - Gibson, because his duty to register should have expired in 2004, his convictions for failing to notify in 2007, 2009, and 2010 are unconstitutional because they violate the ex post facto clause.', 'Under our caselaw, however, Gibson’s argument that the duration of his duty to register amounted to an unconstitutional extension of his punishment does not pass muster. There is a distinction between the imposition of a duty to register as a sex offender, which we have held to be a civil, nonpunitive regulatory measure, and the criminal offense of failing to register or notify. As this Court explained in Germane, “[a]lthough it follows as a consequence of a criminal conviction, sexual offender registration and notification is a civil regulatory process.” Germane, 971 A.2d at 593. In Germane, we held that the retroactive imposition of the duty to register did not implicate “the Rhode Island ex post facto clause because the registration requirement is simply part of a nonpunitive, civil regulatory scheme.” Id. The United States Supreme Court has held likewise with respect to the federal ex post facto clause. See Smith v. Doe I, 538 U.S. 84, 105-06 (holding that Alaska’s sex-offender registration act, modeled after Megan’s Law, was “nonpunitive, and its retroactive application [did] not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause”). Thus, the duty to register and the civil, nonpunitive regulatory conditions attached to that duty did not implicate the ex post facto clause’s prohibition on retroactive penal legislation in Germane.', 'In our opinion, we face precisely the same situation here. Gibson’s core contention is that the combination of changes to the Registration Act transformed his requirement to register from a civil regulation to a criminal punishment. The duration of his duty to register went from (arguably) a lifetime, under the former § 11-37-16, to 2004 (ten years from the date of his conviction) under the 1996 Registration Act, to 2009 (ten years from his release or the beginning of his parole, supervised release or probation) under the 1997 amendment, and to 2019 (ten years', '- 21 - from the expiration of his fifteen-year sentence, imposed in 1994) under the 2003 amendment. However, it is our firm opinion that the ex post facto clause is not implicated here because the duration of his duty to register is merely a condition attached to a civil, nonpunitive regulatory measure. See Germane, 971 A.2d at 593. The extension of his obligation to register from 1996 onward is the product of the General Assembly’s fine-tuning a civil regulatory scheme, not the imposition of retroactive punishment. As the United States Supreme Court has noted, the federal ex post facto clause “does not preclude a State from making reasonable categorical judgments that conviction of specified crimes should entail particular regulatory consequences.” Doe I, 538 U.S. at 103-04. We conclude that the same is true of the Rhode Island ex post facto clause; the extension of the expiration of Gibson’s duty to register from 2004 to 2019 does not transform a civil, nonpunitive regulatory requirement into retroactive penal legislation. See id.; Germane, 971 A.2d at 593.', 'Our opinion on this issue gains support from the “intent-effects” test that the United States Supreme Court has applied in determining whether sex-offender registration and notification requirements implicate the ex post facto clause. Under this test, a court first “must ascertain whether the legislature meant the statute to establish ‘civil’ proceedings.” Doe I, 538 U.S. at 92 (citation omitted). This requires us to discern the intent of the Legislature:', '“If the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment, that', 'ends the inquiry. If, however, the intention was to enact a', 'regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, we must further', 'examine whether the statutory scheme is ‘so punitive either in', 'purpose or effect as to negate [the State’s] intention to deem it', 'civil.’” Id. (citation omitted). Furthermore, “only the clearest proof will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.” Id. (quoting Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 100 (1997)).', '- 22 -', 'This Court previously has explained that the overall purpose of the Registration Act is civil and nonpunitive:', '“It is evident that the purpose of the Registration Act is not to', 'punish the offending [individual], but rather to protect the safety', 'and general welfare of the public. Supplying the names and', 'addresses of sex offenders to law enforcement agencies enables the', 'agencies to deal more successfully with the serious problem of', 'recidivist sex offenders. * * * [T]he proceeding remains', 'rehabilitative, rather than punitive * * *.” Germane, 971 A.2d at', '593 (quoting In re Richard A., 946 A.2d 204, 213 (R.I. 2008)). In our judgment, with respect to the first prong of the “intent-effects” test, see Doe I, 538 U.S. at 92-93, the intent behind the specific amendments extending Gibson’s duty to register was similarly civil and nonpunitive. See Germane, 971 A.2d at 593. In extending the duration of the duty to register by amendment in 1997 and 2003, the General Assembly intended not to impose punishment, but merely to further the civil, nonpunitive sex-offender registration and notification scheme. As we concluded in Germane, we are of the opinion that this was done in furtherance of “protect[ing] the safety and general welfare of the public[,]” not for the purpose of imposing further punishment on Gibson. Id. (quoting In re Richard A., 946 A.2d at 213).', 'Having concluded that the General Assembly’s intent was nonpunitive, we turn next to the “effects” part of the analysis; that is, “whether the statutory scheme is ‘so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the General Assembly’s] intention to deem it civil.’” See Doe I, 538 U.S. at 92. The United States Supreme Court has identified seven factors that serve as “useful guideposts” in analyzing whether the effects of a law are sufficiently punitive to overcome a legislature’s nonpunitive intent. Id. at 97 (quoting Hudson, 522 U.S. at 99). Known as the “Mendoza-Martinez factors,” they are: whether the law (1) “has been regarded in our history and traditions as a punishment”; (2) “imposes an affirmative disability or restraint”; (3) “promotes the traditional aims of punishment”; (4) “has a rational connection to a nonpunitive', '- 23 - purpose”; (5) “is excessive with respect to this purpose”; (6) “comes into play on a finding of scienter”; and (7) “whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime[.]” Id. at 97, 105. Accordingly, our analysis must be whether, after applying those factors, the General Assembly’s extension of Gibson’s duty to register evidences a punitive effect or purpose so onerous as to negate its intent to enact a civil, nonpunitive statutory scheme. See id. at 92, 97.', 'It is our considered opinion that the Mendoza-Martinez factors do not militate in Gibson’s favor. Since we first addressed this issue in 2008, we have considered the registration requirement itself to be nonpunitive. See In re Richard A., 946 A.2d at 213. We are not persuaded that the extension of the duration of Gibson’s registration requirement by amendments to the Registration Act in 1997 and 2003 strays from that historically nonpunitive intent. Furthermore, the duration of the duty to register neither “imposes an affirmative disability or restraint” on Gibson nor does it “promote[] the traditional aims of punishment.” See Doe I, 538 U.S. at 97. In addition, of particular import, extending the duty to register is not so excessive as to stray from the requirement’s purposes, which are to curb recidivism and protect the public. See id.; Germane, 971 A.2d at 593. Finally, the last two factors are of no significance here; there is no issue of scienter, and it is well settled that the registration requirement and the duration attached thereto flow from the commission of a criminal, sexual offense. See Doe I, 538 U.S. at 105. Therefore, there is no punitive effect as applied to Gibson, nor were the amendments in furtherance of a punitive purpose. Gibson’s argument that those amendments violate the ex post facto clause of either the federal or state constitutions must therefore fail.', 'We do pause to note, however, that although Gibson’s constitutional right against the passage of ex post facto laws has not been violated by the amendments that have been enacted to date, this does not foreclose the possibility that there is some threshold that the General', '- 24 - Assembly could someday cross that might lead to a different conclusion. In fact, the New Hampshire Supreme Court recently held that its state’s sex-offender registration act was so punitive in its effects on an offender that it negated the civil, nonpunitive purpose of the legislation. In Doe v. State, 111 A.3d 1077 (N.H. 2015), that court applied the “intent-effects” test to several changes in New Hampshire’s onerous sex-offender registration and notification statute.', 'Doe, 111 A.3d at 1093-1100.', 'While “[n]o one amendment or provision [was] determinative, * * * the aggregate effects of the statute” compelled the court to hold that the statute “ha[d] a punitive effect as applied to the [offender].” Id. at 1100. The court emphasized that two requirements of the statute were particularly punitive: the lifetime registration requirement and the requirement that the offender register in person. Id. at 1094, 1096, 1100.', 'We are satisfied that the extended duration of Gibson’s duty to register pales in comparison with the situation that was held to be constitutionally deficient in Doe. First, in contrast to the history of Gibson’s duty to register, the first iteration of New Hampshire’s registration statute was passed four years after the Doe offender’s probation ended. Doe, 111 A.3d at 1082. Further, Gibson, unlike the offender in Doe, has not been subjected to a cascading effect of onerous registration requirements.', 'For example, it was significant to the New Hampshire Supreme Court that the offender there, unlike Gibson, was required to register in person four times per year, a requirement that he had no opportunity to alleviate under the registration statute. Id. at 1094-95, 1096. Also, contrary to Gibson’s present scenario, the law in New Hampshire imposed on the offender a lifetime duty to register, a duration that the court considered particularly excessive in light of the fact that the offender had not reoffended. See id. at 1100. While Gibson, too, has not reoffended, he does not, in our opinion, have a lifetime duty to register.', 'Moreover, the offender in Doe suffered from a serious permanent disability,', '- 25 - furthering the court’s conclusion that the more onerous changes to the registration statute had constrained his ability to change addresses. Id. at 1082.', 'Those facts, when churned through the “intent-effects” analytical framework, weigh far more heavily in the Doe offender’s favor than they do in Gibson’s. This is especially true because we do not believe that the extension of Gibson’s duty to register is excessive in relation to the nonpunitive purpose underlying the 1997 and 2003 amendments. See Doe, 111 A.3d at 1100 (stating that “[a] number of courts give greatest weight” to the factor that asks whether the law “appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned” (citations omitted)). Gibson is not subject to a lifetime duty to register, nor must he register in person multiple times per year. See id. at 1100. We conclude that the extension of Gibson’s duty to register is an example of the General Assembly’s modification of the civil, nonpunitive regulatory requirements of the Registration Act, and nothing more.', '2', 'The Penalty for Failure to Register or Notify: From a Misdemeanor to a Felony', 'Gibson also argues that the General Assembly’s enhancement of the punishment for failing to notify from a misdemeanor to a felony violates the ex post facto clause. Again, we disagree. It is true that in 1993, when the offense that precipitated his 1994 conviction for second-degree child molestation sexual assault occurred, the failure to register as a sex offender or notify local law enforcement was a misdemeanor, punishable by ninety days in jail and one year probation. See P.L. 1992, ch. 196, § 1. It is also true that, in 1996, the failure to register or notify became a felony, punishable by up to two years in jail and fines of up to $2,000, see P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1, penalties which were increased in 2003 when the sentence for failing to', '- 26 - register or notify became up to ten years in jail and fines of up to $10,000. See § 11-37.1-10(a); P.L. 2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1.', 'However, what Gibson’s argument overlooks is that at the times when he failed to notify in multiple years, leading to his convictions in 2007, 2009, and 2010, the punishment for that crime already was in full force and effect. See §§ 11-37.1-9, 11-37.1-10(a); P.L. 2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1. Furthermore, his failures to notify were offenses separate and apart from the second-degree child molestation sexual assault of 1993, rendering them insufficiently annexed to that crime as to trigger a violation of the ex post facto clause. See State v. Pelz, 765 A.2d 824, 830-31 (R.I. 2001). Therefore, there has been no retroactive punishment and no ex post facto violation. See Pereira, 973 A.2d at 32. Accordingly, as applied to Gibson, the amended statutory framework does not violate the ex post facto clause.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm in part and quash in part the decision of the magistrate on the motion to dismiss. We affirm that part of the decision denying the motion to dismiss, but reverse the magistrate’s ruling that Gibson has a lifetime duty to register as a sex offender. With respect to the application for postconviction relief, we affirm the judgment denying relief, but reverse the hearing justice’s ruling that Gibson’s obligation to register is for the remainder of his life. 18 The papers in this case are remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. 18', 'We note that the hearing justice who denied Gibson’s application for postconviction relief concluded that Gibson’s duty to register, if not a lifetime in length, will expire in November 2030. She reached that conclusion based upon her interpretation of a 2008 amendment to a provision of the definitional section of chapter 37.1 by the General Assembly. See § 11-37.1- 2(e)(8) (defining the term “[c]riminal offense against a victim who is a minor” to include “[a]ny violation of § 11-37.1-10”); P.L. 2008, ch. 155, § 1; P.L. 2008, ch. 202, § 1; see also § 11-37.1-', '- 27 - 10(a) (“Any person who is required to register or verify his or her address or give notice of a change of address or residence who knowingly fails to do so shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, be imprisoned not more than ten (10) years, or fined not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or both.”).

47,"West Davisville Realty Co., LLC : v. : Alpha Nutrition, Inc. et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The defendant, David Paolo (defendant or Paolo), appeals from a Providence County Superior Court judgment granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, West Davisville Realty Co., LLC (plaintiff or West Davisville), holding Paolo liable on a personal guaranty of a termination of lease agreement between West Davisville and Alpha Nutrition, Inc. d/b/a Doggiefood.com (Alpha).1 This case came before the Supreme Court on March 8, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and reviewing their memoranda, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide this appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In August 2012, Alpha entered into a lease agreement with West Davisville to rent commercial space in North Kingstown for a five-year term—from September 1, 2012 to August 1', 'Although Alpha is also a defendant in this action, default entered against Alpha on February 3, 2016, and no further action was taken. Therefore, Alpha is not a party to this appeal.', '1 31, 2017. In 2015, after suffering some financial setbacks, Alpha was past due on its rent payments to West Davisville. In response to this problem, Paolo, after developing a plan with Alpha’s sole shareholder, said that he “communicated with West Davisville to determine whether [it] was willing to terminate its lease with Alpha prior to the full term of the written lease.” Paolo explained that he was not a shareholder or officer of Alpha at that time, but he was under the impression that he might eventually hold such a position, and so he participated in the negotiations.2', 'In exchange for ending the lease agreement early, on June 25, 2015, Alpha entered a Termination and Release Agreement (the termination agreement) with West Davisville, and issued a promissory note, personally guaranteed by Paolo, for the sum of $62,362.50. The termination agreement provided, in pertinent part, that:', '“WHEREAS, the Landlord has agreed to terminate the Lease at', 'Tenant’s request in exchange for the consideration set forth below', 'and upon the other terms hereof.', '***', '2.

In response, Paolo filed an answer with affirmative defenses, including the defenses of failure of consideration, fraud in the inducement by an Alpha shareholder, failure to join an indispensable party, and failure to properly mitigate damages.', 'West Davisville moved for summary judgment on May 2, 2016. Paolo objected to the motion, arguing that (1) there was a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether West Davisville fraudulently induced Paolo to sign the contracts; (2) plaintiff failed to mitigate its damages; and (3) Paolo had received no consideration for his personal signatures on the documents, including the personal guaranty. Paolo also submitted an affidavit in support of his', '3 objection to plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. In the affidavit, Paolo explained that, despite his understanding that he was likely to become a shareholder of Alpha, he never actually became one.3', 'In that affidavit, Paolo also stated that he had discovered that another tenant moved into Alpha’s rented space soon after the agreement was made, which he believed occurred before the agreement was signed. He explained: “If I had known that West Davisville had organized another tenant to occupy the leasehold, I would not have signed the contracts. I believe now that I was fraudulently misled by West Davisville during negotiations.”', 'After the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, in an attempt to “clarify certain factual issues” in his first affidavit, before a ruling was made, Paolo submitted a second affidavit. In it, he admitted that he had held himself out as a stockholder of Alpha during the negotiations. He also identified the two representations made by officers of West Davisville that caused him to sign the personal guaranty: (1) “that Alpha owed back rent in the amount of $62,362.50”; and (2) “that Alpha might eventually owe more rent because West Davisville was facing a potential vacancy of the [property].”', 'Paolo’s contention was that West Davisville actually had a tenant in Alpha’s location paying rent during the months for which West Davisville sought rent from Alpha, and, had Paolo known that, he would not have signed the documents. As evidence of his contention, Paolo 3', 'At the summary-judgment hearing, the hearing justice expressed serious concerns with Paolo’s sworn affidavit that conflicted with the information provided to the Rhode Island Secretary of State that listed Paolo as Alpha’s CEO, suggesting that the affidavit stating that he was not the CEO of Alpha could be “very close to not only being a fraud upon the [c]ourt but perhaps a crime.”', '4 submitted an excerpt from an email authored by Steven DiCenso, the managing member of West Davisville, to an employee at the Quonset Development Corporation.4', 'On October 27, 2016, the hearing justice issued a written decision granting plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. First, the hearing justice determined that whether Paolo was a corporate officer of Alpha at the time he signed the termination agreement was not material to the resolution of the motion for summary judgment. The hearing justice concluded that the consideration sufficient to bind Alpha to the contract—the early release of Alpha from the lease—also flowed to the personal guaranty signed by Paolo, such that a valid contract was executed.', 'Next, the hearing justice determined that Paolo had not demonstrated any evidence to support his allegation of fraudulent inducement, but had only relied on the bare allegation in the following affirmative defense contained in his answer to plaintiff’s complaint: “Fraud in the inducement, specifically that a prior shareholder of Alpha Nutrition, Inc., Tony Gabriele, falsely represented the business situation of Alpha Nutrition, causing this Defendant to enter into a guarantee which benefitted Mr. Gabriele.” The hearing justice explained: “In offering a moving target of allegedly fraudulent statements—raising one type of fraud in his pleading but opposing summary judgment on another—Paolo has fallen well short of ‘[setting] forth specific facts showing * * * a genuine issue of material fact’ to successfully oppose summary judgment.” The hearing justice also determined that Paolo had failed to establish his fraud defense by clear and 4', 'That email reads, in part, as follows:', '“I cannot start paying [Alpha’s] bills because it will effect [sic] my', 'case.

I’m keeping it quiet because it’s very short-term and is', 'allowing me to recoup some of the monies owed to me.”', '5 convincing evidence. Accordingly, he concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether Paolo was fraudulently induced into signing the termination agreement, the promissory note, and the personal guaranty.', 'On the issue of West Davisville’s purported failure to mitigate damages, the hearing justice held that any duty to mitigate evaporated with the lease—that is, the termination agreement replaced the lease and, under the termination agreement, West Davisville had no duty to mitigate damages. The hearing justice also determined that West Davisville was entitled to reasonable attorneys’ fees based on the terms of the promissory note, to be calculated at a later date. Consequently, the hearing justice granted summary judgment in favor of West Davisville.

West Davisville counters that Paolo failed to plead fraud against plaintiff as an affirmative defense.', 'West Davisville alternatively argues that Paolo’s allegations of fraud are inapposite because it is undisputed that Alpha owed past-due rent based on an acceleration clause in the lease, making Alpha liable regardless of whether West Davisville had secured another tenant.5', 'Furthermore, West Davisville highlights that Paolo never filed a Rule 56(f) affidavit seeking limited discovery on the fraud issue.6 5', 'The acceleration clause contained in the lease provides as follows:', '“Tenant hereby agrees that, in the event of Tenant’s breach of this', 'Lease, Tenant expressly waives any rights concerning [sic], and', 'releases Landlord from, any and all mitigation obligations, and', 'Tenant is responsible for paying all sums, including accelerated', 'obligations, as aforesaid regardless of the potential or actual', 'reletting of the Leased Premises.” 6', 'Rule 56(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in relevant part, that “[s]hould it appear from the affidavits of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for', '7', 'It is well established that “[f]raud vitiates all contracts.” Guzman v.

The only fraud that Paolo pleaded was against “a prior shareholder of Alpha Nutrition, Inc., Tony Gabriele,” who Paolo alleged “falsely represented the business situation of Alpha Nutrition,” which allegedly caused Paolo “to enter into a guarantee which benefitted Mr. Gabriele.” That is insufficient to put West Davisville on notice that there were allegations of fraud against it.

48,State : v. : Eugene Danis. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. On November 19, 2014, a grand jury indicted Eugene Danis (Danis or defendant) on charges of one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.1 and 11-37-8.2, and one count of the sale or distribution of photographs of a minor suggesting that the minor engaged in, or is about to engage in, a sexual act, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-9-1(b). A Kent County Superior Court jury convicted the defendant on both counts on February 9, 2016. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice deprived him of his constitutional rights to confront and cross- examine the complaining witness. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '1', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant was charged with sexually abusing his stepdaughter, Veronica.1 At trial, Veronica testified that her mother began dating defendant when Veronica was about seven years old, and he moved in with Veronica and her mother some time before they were married. Once they were married in 2009, Veronica testified that she began calling defendant “dad.”', 'In 2012, Veronica moved with her mother and defendant to defendant’s aunt’s house in West Warwick. The defendant’s aunt passed away that same year. Because defendant was not working at that time, Veronica recalled, he would watch her after school when her mother was at work.', 'Although Veronica had a positive relationship with defendant prior to his aunt’s passing, she testified that, once she was twelve years old, her relationship with him began to change. Specifically, Veronica remembered defendant speaking about topics that “a normal father wouldn’t really talk about,” such as “sexual” topics. For example, Veronica testified that defendant would enter the bathroom while she was showering and speak to her through the curtain, even opening the curtain one time while he was shirtless, pretending as though he planned to get in the shower with her.', 'Veronica testified that, on a number of occasions, defendant showed her some pornographic pamphlets that arrived in the mail and told her that the women in the pictures made money from posing nude. Eventually, Veronica stated, defendant had a few conversations with her about making money if she posed for such pictures. After those conversations, Veronica agreed to take such pictures, explaining that she did so because “in [her] twelve-year[-]old mind” 1', 'We use pseudonyms to identify the complaining witness and other minors referenced in this opinion.', '2 she thought she would “get money” if she did so—money that she could use to purchase “an I- pad, electronics, and stuff like that.”', 'According to Veronica, she posed for defendant about five times—once on defendant and her mother’s bed, and the other times in the basement. The first time she posed on the bed was in the fall of 2012. She wore no clothes and had on only high-heeled shoes, and defendant instructed her on how to position herself to expose her breasts and vagina to the camera. After defendant took the pictures with the camera on Veronica’s cell phone, Veronica removed the SD card and put it in the printer because she was “pretty sure” defendant “couldn’t figure out how to work the printer * * *.” Then, defendant told her to delete the photographs from the phone and the SD card. On cross-examination, Veronica explained that defendant told her that he was sending the printed pictures to the owner of Playboy, who he said was a friend of his.', 'Veronica said defendant used a disposable camera to take the downstairs photographs. She recollected that defendant told her to use lubricant and a vibrator so they could get more money for the pictures; Veronica remembered being “reluctant” to use the vibrator because she had “never been * * * penetrated before.” Nevertheless, Veronica testified, defendant “put it in” her, but she held it while he took the pictures. The entirety of the photo shoot lasted about one hour.', 'Veronica recalled telling defendant around her thirteenth birthday that she did not want to take pictures any longer. After that, Veronica testified that defendant asked her to wear a “strap- on” that her mom had “tried * * * on[,]” but Veronica declined.', 'At this point, Veronica testified, she did not tell her mom what was happening because she believed her mother was happy with defendant and if she said anything, they would break up,', '3 and defendant told Veronica that she would be taken away from her mother. She also testified that he told her he would be put in jail and “wouldn’t be [her] dad” anymore.', 'After Veronica decided she no longer wanted to take the pictures, defendant became more strict with her, which caused tension between them, culminating in a fight over Veronica’s failure to clean out her guinea pig’s cage. During that fight, Veronica recalled that defendant accused her of not keeping her promises. In response, she showed him a camera she owned at the time, to indicate that she had kept her promise regarding the pictures, but defendant responded that that was in the past and did not matter anymore.', 'Veronica’s friend, Nadia, was present at the time of the fight, and both girls went for a walk, during which time Veronica explained to Nadia what defendant had done to her. Nadia expressed to Veronica that she did not know what to do, but that Nadia could explain the situation to Nadia’s grandmother. After Nadia did so, her grandmother called Veronica’s mother and told her to come to Nadia’s house. When Veronica’s mother learned what had happened, she returned home to confront defendant about Veronica’s allegations.', 'During the course of the trial, the trial justice held a voir dire hearing on the issue of permitting defense counsel to question Veronica regarding prior sexual-abuse allegations she purportedly made against her biological father when she was five years old. The state attempted to keep this evidence out at trial, while the defense argued that it was relevant to Veronica’s motive to lie about sexual assault by father figures in her life. The trial justice ultimately precluded defense counsel from pursuing this line of questioning, and this decision is at issue in this appeal.', 'Veronica’s mother also testified at trial. She testified that Veronica’s biological father had “sporadic” visitation with Veronica from 2000 to 2005.', 'She testified that, in 2007,', '4 defendant moved in with her and Veronica at their Coventry residence. At that time, Veronica’s grandmother lived with them and was primarily responsible for the care of Veronica while Veronica’s mother was at work. Eventually, Veronica’s mother and defendant moved with Veronica to the West Warwick house, at which time defendant was unemployed and took over watching Veronica in the mornings and afternoons.', 'Veronica’s mother recalled that, in April 2014, her daughter wanted to go to a birthday party, but defendant said that she could not go because she had not cleaned her guinea pig’s cage. After the argument between Veronica and defendant ended, Veronica’s mother took Veronica and her friend, Nadia, to a store, after which the girls went to Nadia’s house. Soon after, Veronica’s mother remembered receiving a phone call from Nadia, asking her to come to Nadia’s house because Nadia’s grandmother wanted to speak to her. When Veronica’s mother arrived at the house, she discovered Veronica crying, sitting in the passenger’s seat of Nadia’s grandmother’s car. When Veronica calmed down, Veronica told her that defendant had taken nude photographs of her and that she did not want to return home.', 'When Veronica’s mother first confronted defendant, he initially denied the allegations, and he stated, “‘I knew this was coming. Get [Veronica] so we can talk.’” Veronica’s mother met Veronica at another store, where Nadia’s grandmother had taken the two girls, and, in the car, Veronica shared details with her mother regarding the sexual assaults—including that defendant used a vibrator on her.', 'After Veronica’s mother went back to her house for a second time, she again spoke with defendant; she testified that he said, “‘It was all her idea.’” Veronica’s mother told defendant to move out of the house, and he complied. The next day, Veronica’s mother called the police to', '5 give a statement, and the police confiscated two laptops and Veronica’s old cell phone; at some point later, she gave police defendant’s old cell phone as well.', 'Nadia also testified at trial. She recalled the day of Veronica’s argument with defendant over failing to clean her pet’s cage and not attending a birthday party; she also recalled Veronica telling her that defendant had taken nude pictures of her. Nadia testified that the girls took a walk together, during which Veronica told her that defendant had taken the pictures of her and touched her.', 'Officer Trenna Beltrami2 of the West Warwick Police Department testified on behalf of the state. She recalled being dispatched to a West Warwick address because Veronica’s mother had requested to speak with a female police officer to report her husband having taken nude photographs of her daughter. Officer Beltrami stated that Veronica’s mother told her that her daughter had explained that, in the photographs, a vibrator was used as well as a “strap-on sex toy,” which had been thrown in the trash. When she spoke with Veronica, Officer Beltrami remembered that she was told that the photographs were taken upstairs at first, and the rest were taken in the basement of the house. During that house call, Officer Beltrami also retrieved a “strap-on” and a bottle of lubricant from the trash can.', 'Detective Jonathan Izzi of the West Warwick Police Department testified that he had reviewed the statements that Veronica and her mother had given to Officer Beltrami, and he visited their house to follow up on the case. Veronica’s mother gave Det. Izzi two laptop computers and defendant’s old cell phone, which Det. Izzi turned over to the Rhode Island State Police Forensic Computer Unit, along with Veronica’s cell phone. However, Brittnee Morgan, a digital forensic analyst for the Rhode Island State Police, testified that, when she conducted the 2', 'At the time she responded to the call, Officer Beltrami’s last name was Heemond.', '6 analysis on the devices on June 2, 2014, she did not recover any pictures of a young, nude female.', 'At the end of the trial, the jury convicted defendant on both counts, and defendant moved for a new trial. The trial justice denied the motion for a new trial and sentenced defendant to fifty years’ imprisonment, with thirty-five years to serve and the balance suspended with probation on the first count, and five years’ imprisonment with three to serve and the balance suspended with probation on the second count, both to run concurrently. The defendant timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Upon review of a trial justice’s evidentiary ruling, we only overturn that decision where it “constitutes an abuse of [his or her] * * * discretion that prejudices the complaining party.” State v. Manning, 973 A.2d 524, 530 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1015 (R.I. 2005)). “[T]he exercise of discretion by the trial justice in limiting the scope of cross- examination will not be disturbed absent a clear abuse of that discretion.” State v.

However, this is not an unfettered right, and “it may be circumscribed within reasonable parameters of relevance in the exercise of the trial justice’s discretion.” Dorsey, 783 A.2d at 950. As long as there is an opportunity for “‘sufficient cross-examination to satisfy a defendant’s constitutional confrontation rights,’ the trial justice may exercise his sound discretion in limiting further cross-examination.” Manning, 973 A.2d at 531 (quoting State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 473 (R.I. 1998)). 3', 'While the state addresses both this argument and an argument under Rule 608 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, defendant states in his reply brief that he is focused only on the Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine to demonstrate motive to lie, rather than the general credibility of the witness implicated by Rule 608. See State v. Manning, 973 A.2d 524, 534, 535 (R.I. 2009) (recognizing the difference between evidentiary rulings based on impeachment of the general credibility of a witness and cross-examination related to a complaining witness’s bias or motive).', '8', 'The United States Supreme Court has recognized that “establishing the witness’s motives or bias in testifying is * * * a key part of the constitutionally protected right to cross- examination,” Dorsey, 783 A.2d at 951 (citing Davis v.

See Pettiway, 657 A.2d at 163 (acknowledging the defendant’s argument that his constitutional rights were violated when he was not allowed to show that the complaining witness “lodged sexual-abuse allegations against other men”). In Pettiway, we held that the defendant’s right to confrontation was limited where he was foreclosed from inquiring into the complaining witness’s pattern of alleging sexual abuse by her mother’s boyfriends. Id. at 163-64. We acknowledged that it was “sheer speculation that the jury would have accepted this line of reasoning[,]” but we concluded that the jury was', '9 “entitled to consider the defense theory so that [it] could make an informed judgment about the weight to place on [the witness’s] testimony.” Id. at 164.', 'However, in a number of sexual-abuse cases decided since Pettiway, we have determined that a defendant’s right to confrontation was not violated where prior allegations were “fundamentally different” from the ones faced by that defendant.

Botelho, 753 A.2d 343, 345, 347 (R.I. 2000) (concluding that precluding cross-examination of a complaining witness was not abuse of discretion where the complaining witness’s DCYF complaint against her father related to physical abuse, not sexual abuse like the complaints against the defendant, who was her mother’s boyfriend).', 'Before ruling on the admissibility of the evidence at issue, the trial justice first heard argument from counsel, including defense counsel’s Sixth Amendment argument. Initially, the trial justice decided that, despite the fact that he had some concerns as to whether Veronica was competent to make such allegations because she was very young at the time, “the [Sixth] [A]mendment rights of * * * defendant” required that defense counsel be permitted to ask about such events “in a very limited way.”4 The motive-to-lie argument that the defense first pursued 4', 'The trial justice also mentioned Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence at this point, explaining that:', '“In terms of the 403 analysis, the [c]ourt is going to make that', 'determination on a question-by-question basis through objections.', 'The [c]ourt does not believe as a whole the topic is so prejudicial.', 'However, as the [c]ourt mentioned during argument on this, we', '10 at trial was that Veronica made allegations against father figures when she was not happy with their actions.', 'After Veronica’s direct examination, the trial justice decided that, based on the issue raised regarding Veronica’s allegations against her biological father in “the oral motion in limine[,] it would be helpful for the [c]ourt to hear certain testimony of [Veronica] outside of the presence of the jury.” During that voir dire hearing, defense counsel introduced records from St. Mary’s Home for Children regarding behavior management services for Veronica when she was around five years old.', 'The March 2006 record, written by a Children Intensive Services clinician, states the following:', '“In December 2004 [Veronica] told her mother ‘daddy touched my', 'froggie’ (vagina) * * *.

The trial justice found that Veronica had no recollection of “making any statement about recanting[,]” and he also noted that the purported incident occurred when Veronica was five years old, quite a number of years before defendant’s alleged actions in the case at bar.', 'Finally, the trial justice reasoned as follows:', '“[T]he only potential evidence or information of this is a hearsay', 'report certainly extrinsic evidence, and the [c]ourt can’t get beyond', 'the fact listening to that that other than this new theory that maybe', 'the father came back in her life when she was [thirteen] that the', 'only possible reason for this testimony would be to impermissibly', 'put in the jury’s mind that she somehow lied before and somehow', 'she is lying in this case and that clearly is impermissible.”', 'The trial justice concluded that, even assuming that the defense successfully got past a Rule 608 analysis, the trial justice would still keep the evidence out on Rule 403 grounds. 8 In conclusion, the trial justice ruled that Veronica’s testimony was not admissible pursuant to Rule 608, and furthermore, it was unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403, and defense counsel was not permitted to engage in that line of questioning in the presence of the jury.', 'The purported motive defense counsel sought to elucidate was whether Veronica had a pattern of making sexual-abuse allegations against father figures whom she no longer wanted in her life. As was evidenced by her testimony during the voir dire hearing and highlighted by the the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” 8', 'The trial justice explained:', '“What the [c]ourt has heard in terms of balancing any evidence', 'that may come in with the evidence to the jury as opposed to the', 'prejudicial [e]ffect certainly with there being no memory and no', 'admissible evidence, the [c]ourt finds that any questioning or', 'testimony would be more prejudicial and certainly the [c]ourt can', 'advise the jury that the questions themselves are not evidence only', 'the answers.

While we do acknowledge that both allegations were of sexual misconduct against father figures, the accusations defense counsel sought to introduce were different from the specific allegations against defendant of sexual penetration and the taking of nude photographs. Not only did the abuse by her biological father purportedly occur when Veronica was five years old or younger, she also made the allegations at that tender age. See Dorsey, 783 A.2d at 953 (highlighting the difference between sexual-assault allegations made when the complaining witness was twenty-seven years old and sexual-abuse allegations made against someone other than the defendant when she was thirteen years old regarding events that occurred when she was only seven years old). The trial justice found that defense counsel failed to lay a foundation for his requested line of questioning—to demonstrate that Veronica remembered making these allegations. Based upon the lack of reliable testimony on the matter, it was well within the trial justice’s discretion to not permit such questioning at trial.9 See Cookson v. Schwartz, 556 F.3d 647, 655 (7th Cir. 2009) (upholding appellate court’s affirmance of a trial justice’s refusal to permit the defendant to inquire into victim’s sexual-abuse allegations against another individual and reasoning that the trial justice had concluded that the victim “was not clever enough to concoct false allegations of sexual abuse[,]” which was a “factual determination on a matter so quintessentially within the province of a trial judge who had the 9', 'While it was not addressed below or asserted by the parties, we pause to note that Rule 602 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, in pertinent part, provides the following:', '“A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is', 'introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has', 'personal knowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal', 'knowledge may, but need not, consist of the testimony of the', 'witness himself or herself.”', '15 unique opportunity to observe the witness”); but see Henry v. Speckard, 22 F.3d 1209, 1215 (2d Cir. 1994) (determining that the defendant’s right to confrontation was violated where the trial justice precluded the defendant from inquiring into whether the victim had a motive to make false allegations of sexual abuse against the defendant because she resented having to babysit her siblings).', 'Most fatal to defendant’s case, however, is the fact that defense counsel failed to attempt this line of questioning once the jury was brought back into the courtroom. After he ruled on the oral motion in limine, the trial justice explained to defense counsel that, if he wanted to pursue, in his words, whether Veronica “had a memory of telling someone that her father had touched her froggy,” he could “ask for a sidebar and we’ll address it * * *.” However, defense counsel never asked such questions, which constitutes a waiver of the issue. See State v. Tejeda, 171 A.3d 983, 1001 (R.I. 2017) (“We repeatedly have expressed our view that a failure to object in the vital context of the trial itself (except where the in limine ruling was unequivocally definitive) [constitutes] a waiver of the evidentiary objection and [is] therefore an issue that may not be raised on appeal.” (quoting State v. Andujar, 899 A.2d 1209, 1222 (R.I. 2006))).', 'Moreover, “[w]hat is required for a fair trial is ‘that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner. This latitude should include an opportunity for a defendant to establish or reveal possible bias, prejudice, or ulterior motives as they may relate to the case being tried.’” Ogoffa, 159 A.3d at 1052 (quoting Tiernan, 941 A.2d at 134). At trial, defense counsel did have the opportunity to thoroughly attack Veronica’s credibility when he asked her about the defendant’s role as a disciplinarian in her life, including how strict she perceived him to be. In other words, the defendant was afforded an opportunity to inquire into Veronica’s purported motive to bring false accusations against the defendant. But see Oliveira, 576 A.2d at 113 (“By not allowing', '16 [the] defendant the opportunity to challenge [the complaining witness’s] credibility, the trial justice inappropriately infringed on [the] defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights of confrontation and effective cross-examination.”).

The state appeals a Providence County Superior Court justice’s decision granting a motion to suppress brought by the defendant, Marc Gouin (Gouin or defendant). The defendant was indicted by a grand jury on four counts of child molestation. Prior to trial, he moved to suppress statements he made to a Massachusetts Department of Children and Families (DCF) investigator on grounds that he had rendered the statements involuntarily.

Prescott had worked for DCF at its office in Taunton, Massachusetts, as an investigator for eighteen years. In that role, she probed abuse and neglect allegations to ascertain their veracity. In 2012, she began investigating defendant.', 'Prescott testified that DCF had received a report from a mandated reporter3 stating that Emma revealed during a July 9, 2012 SAIN interview4 that she had been sexually abused by defendant, as well as by her father. According to Prescott, Emma told the mandated reporter specifically that defendant “had touched her in her vaginal area under her underwear,” that he had “‘put his thing in her mouth’ on more than one occasion,” and that “he would touch himself while he was touching her, things of that nature.”', 'The defendant also had a stepdaughter, Marie.5 During the SAIN interview, Emma indicated that Marie’s daughter, Olivia,6 lived with defendant, and Emma was concerned for Olivia’s safety.7 2', 'The defendant also filed a motion in limine, arguing that his statements were inadmissible pursuant to the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 3', 'A mandated reporter is a person who has a statutory duty to report any evidence of criminal activity to the police.

Prescott alerted law enforcement to Emma’s allegations against defendant and her father; and, on July 10, 2012, Prescott made an unannounced visit to defendant’s Seekonk, Massachusetts home. The defendant was not home, and Prescott scheduled a visit with him through Michelle Gouin—defendant’s wife—for July 11, the following day.9 Prescott testified that, during that July 10 conversation, when she informed Michelle of Emma’s claims, Michelle became upset and “told [her] this [was] something that happened a long time ago * * *.”', 'Prior to the July 11 interview, Prescott contacted the East Providence and Seekonk police departments to obtain the 2005 records of the accusations against defendant. She received East Providence police reports regarding defendant the morning of the interview and attempted to contact a detective there, but was unsuccessful.', 'Prescott testified that neither the East Providence nor the Seekonk police instructed her to speak with defendant.', 'B', 'Interview with Defendant', 'On July 11, 2012, Prescott went to defendant’s home for the scheduled visit.

He was never angry. * * * [A]t the beginning he was a little defensive and upset that [Prescott] was there and the reason that [Prescott] was there, but that changed and [defendant and Prescott] had a conversation * * *.”', 'Prescott reiterated that “the conversation was difficult” and that it was emotional, highlighting that defendant “recognized the concerns around the conversation * * *.” Prescott testified that neither defendant nor Michelle asked her to stop the interview, leave their home, or wait until they contacted an attorney. She could not recall if defendant or Michelle asked for an attorney, nor could she recall if she told them that they had the right to stop the interview at any time or ask her to leave.11 In addition, she stated that, despite knowing the nature of her visit, neither defendant nor Michelle engaged an attorney to be present.

Prescott also insisted that she never spoke about Olivia’s potential removal from the home and, in fact, there was no cause to remove her at that point.12', 'On cross-examination, Prescott said that—at some point during the interview—she handed defendant and Michelle a brochure entitled “A Family’s Guide to Protective Services for Children.” The brochure discussed the purpose of a DCF investigation and was typically given to every family involved with DCF. It advised that a parent involved with DCF has “the right to speak with an attorney or have one with [him or her] at any time. * * * If DCF takes the case to court and [he or she is not] able to pay for an attorney, the Judge will appoint one for [him or her].”', 'Prescott indicated, however, that DCF investigators were not required to inform interviewees of these rights at the start of the interview. The brochure also explained that if a DCF investigator received evidence of abuse, then the investigator was required to give that evidence to law enforcement. Prescott also testified that she provided defendant with a letter informing him that allegations had been levied against him. However, Prescott could not recall precisely when during the interview she gave defendant that letter.', 'Michelle testified for the defense. She stated that Prescott’s interview lasted between an hour and an hour and a half and that Prescott gave defendant and Michelle the letter and the brochure as she was leaving their home. Michelle also conveyed that, during the interview, she and defendant asked Prescott if they should get an attorney, to which Prescott responded that “there was no time, that she could take [Olivia] that day, and she kept on picking up her cell phone. She said, ‘All I have to do is make a phone call.’” 12', 'After Prescott concluded her investigation, she allowed Olivia to stay in the home provided that defendant left the premises; however, Olivia was removed after it was discovered that defendant visited the home. Prescott testified that, when Olivia was eventually removed from the home, “it was much later[,] * * * far after [her] investigation.” When she testified at the hearing, Michelle confirmed that Olivia was removed approximately nine months after the interview.', '-5-', 'C', 'Hearing Justice’s Decision', 'In his argument to the hearing justice, defendant conceded that Miranda13 protections did not apply because he was not in custody during the interview. The defendant argued, however, that the state had not met its burden of proving the voluntariness of the statements. Based on the totality of the circumstances, defense counsel argued that Prescott’s failure to advise defendant of his rights rendered the statements involuntary. In response, the state asserted that Prescott was not acting at the direction of the police when she spoke with defendant; rather, her sole purpose was to check on Olivia’s well-being. Alternatively, the state argued that defendant had made the statements voluntarily.', 'In a bench decision on January 20, 2016, the hearing justice granted defendant’s motion to suppress. He concluded that, while Prescott was not a law-enforcement official, she was “clearly an agent of the government * * *.” In support of that holding, he focused on the fact that she worked with the police on child-abuse complaints and was a mandated reporter. On the issue of the voluntariness of defendant’s statements, the hearing justice found that the DCF brochure, which stated that defendant had the right to counsel at any time, was delivered after the interview was over. He found Prescott “evasive” in her testimony that she was unaware that the brochure contained information about defendant’s right to counsel. The totality of these facts, he concluded, reflected either “sloppy investigative techniques” or “establish[ed] an inference of deception on the part of the government regarding defendant’s rights. Either way it diminishes the [s]tate’s quantum of proof that has been presented.” He did note, however, that he did not 13', 'Miranda v.

Id. at 1139.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'We begin by accepting defendant’s concession that he was not in custody at the time of the interview. As such, defendant is foreclosed from arguing that his statements were taken in violation of his Miranda rights. Moreover, defendant does not contend that his right to counsel had attached at the time of the interview. His sole remaining argument is that his statements were involuntary, in violation of the due process clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', 'In deferring to the hearing justice’s factual findings, we review them for clear error. See Sabourin, 161 A.3d at 1138.

Based on our comprehensive review of the cold record before us, we cannot say that his findings were clearly erroneous, and we thus accept them and continue to our de novo analysis. See id.; see also Sabourin, 161 A.3d at 1138.', 'Before evaluating the voluntariness of defendant’s statements, we first must determine whether Prescott was an agent of the police during the interview. See Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 163 (1986).', 'We have previously considered whether a state protective agency investigator acted as an agent of the police. In State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299 (R.I. 2008), we held that a Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) investigator was a state actor for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 307, 311. We recognized that, while she “did not interview [the] defendant at the direct behest of the police or prosecution, she had met and exchanged information with them on the previous day * * *.” Id. at 310. We emphasized that “she was statutorily required to forward any information she * * * obtain[ed] from [the] defendant concerning child abuse to the police.” Id. We further noted that the investigator’s “role as a child protective investigator was not primarily prosecutorial; rather it was to protect children who might have been at risk due to [the] defendant’s suspected abuse.” Id. at 310-11. Nevertheless, we concluded that she was a state actor because “[i]t [was] clear to us * * * that [she] deliberately intended to elicit incriminating evidence from [the] defendant, which she knew she would then be required to turn over to the police * * *.” Id. at 311.', 'While the analysis in Oliveira concentrated on a claimed Sixth Amendment violation, we believe that the rationale for holding that a DCYF investigator was a state actor translates to this', '-8- case. Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 310. Like the investigator in Oliveira, here Prescott communicated with the police about defendant and was statutorily obligated to report any incriminating information to them. See id. The fact that she interviewed defendant for reasons other than prosecutorial purposes does not convince us now, as it did not convince us in Oliveira, that she was not acting as an agent of the police. See id. at 310-11. Accordingly, we hold that Prescott acted as a police agent during the interview.', 'We can now address the voluntariness of defendant’s statements.15', '“A defendant’s statement is voluntary when it is the product of his free and rational choice.” State v. Bojang, 138 A.3d 171, 180 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 836 (R.I. 2008)). In contrast, an involuntary statement is one “extracted from the defendant by coercion or improper inducement, including threats, violence, or any undue influence that overcomes the free will of the defendant.”', 'Id. (quoting Bido, 941 A.2d at 836).', 'When a defendant alleges that his statements were coerced, we require the state to “prove voluntariness by clear and convincing evidence.” State v. Amado, 424 A.2d 1057, 1061 (R.I. 1981). “In deciding whether a statement is voluntary, this Court considers the totality of the circumstances surrounding the challenged statement.”', 'Bojang, 138 A.3d at 180 (quoting Bido, 941 A.2d at 836).', 'The relevant considerations “are the background, experience and conduct of the accused, as well as the level of a suspect’s educational attainments.” Id. at 181 (quoting Bido, 941 A.2d at 836).', 'The gravamen of defendant’s argument is that Prescott’s failure to tell defendant at the start of the interview that she was a mandatory reporter and her failure to give him the DCF brochure informing him of his right to counsel “created confusion and resulted in a statement 15', 'While the state asserts that the hearing justice applied the incorrect standard in analyzing defendant’s statements, we need not decide whether that is so because our review is conducted de novo.', '-9- that can only be described as coerced.” However, the hearing justice’s factual findings illustrate that Prescott and defendant engaged in a dialogue that defendant never sought to cease.', 'The “conversation,” as Prescott described it, does not reflect a coercive confabulation. Prescott remembered defendant as mostly polite and cooperative during the interview; at worst, she described him as “a little defensive” and emotional. See Bido, 941 A.2d at 836 (holding that there was no evidence of coercion or intimidation where the defendant appeared “calm” and “spoke spontaneously”). She further described defendant as intelligent, thus evidencing that he “had the capacity and knowledge to understand what he was doing[.]” State v. Marini, 638 A.2d 507, 513 (R.I. 1994); see also State v. Ramsey, 844 A.2d 715, 720 (R.I. 2004) (concluding that “[t]he defendant also had held positions of employment and responsibility that required intelligence and competence; he therefore had the intelligence to make the statement a voluntary product”). Moreover, Prescott’s July 11 interview with defendant was scheduled in advance, giving him an opportunity to cancel it or obtain counsel. And yet, defendant willingly met with her without counsel.', 'See Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 734 (determining that the defendant made statements voluntarily where the “defendant’s own attorney admitted that [the] defendant was not forced to make a statement to police”).', 'It is also significant that the hearing justice found Michelle’s testimony that Prescott said Olivia could be removed with one phone call incredible. That testimony is the only evidence that even remotely suggests coercive tactics. Because the hearing justice determined that it was unreliable, we discern no viable basis for defendant’s claim of coercion. It is undisputed that defendant never told Prescott that he was confused or asked Prescott to leave; nor is there any credible evidence that Prescott threatened him. See Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 734. This “exposes the lack of any evidence suggesting that defendant’s statements * * * were not of his own free will.”', '- 10 - Id. In fact, Prescott’s interview at defendant’s kitchen table is the antithesis of a coercive interrogation likely to cause a suspect to make an involuntary statement. See State v. Hall, 940 A.2d 645, 657 (R.I. 2008) (holding that the defendant’s statement to police was voluntary where “although [he] had one arm in a handcuff affixed to the wall, there [was] nothing in the record to suggest that he even was uncomfortable”).', 'The defendant relies heavily on the fact that Prescott gave him the brochure at the end of the interview, contending that Prescott’s untimely delivery of the brochure prevented him from being adequately informed of his rights. We disagree. Because defendant conceded that he was not in custody, his Fifth Amendment right to counsel had not attached; and, because he had not been charged with a crime, neither had his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.16 It is axiomatic that “[o]nce the right to counsel has attached and been asserted, the [s]tate must of course honor it.” Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 170 (1985). But if the right to counsel has not attached, then there is nothing for the state to honor. See id.; cf. Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 310-11 (holding that the DCYF investigator obtained statements from the defendant while he was incarcerated in violation of his Sixth Amendment right, where the defendant had been charged and was in custody). No DCF policy required Prescott to give defendant the brochure at the beginning of the interview. While Prescott could have done so, it does not follow that it was unconstitutional for her to have waited.', 'In conclusion, we hold that the defendant’s statements were voluntary and that the motion to suppress should have been denied. 16', 'While defendant initially argued to the hearing justice in support of his motion to suppress that he had a right to counsel based on the 2005 criminal charges against him, defendant did not pursue that argument at the hearing on the motion to suppress, and thus it is not before us now.', '- 11 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the decision of the Superior Court.

The plaintiff, Frances Ahearn (plaintiff or Ahearn), appeals from a final judgment granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant, the City of Providence (defendant or the city), on the plaintiff’s amended complaint. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided without further briefing or argument. We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 28, 2013, Ahearn, who at that time was seventy-nine years old, was walking on or near Charles Street in Providence when she tripped and fell on what she described as “an oversized crack in the cement located beside the first tree.” As a result of her fall, plaintiff suffered injuries. On October 31, 2013, plaintiff filed a notice of claim with the Providence City', '-1- Council, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 45-15-9.1 It is this notice of claim that brings the parties before this Court. In her notice, plaintiff stated:', '“On October 28, 2013 Ms. [Ahearn] was walking on Charles Street', 'about 100 feet from the 95 North Exit 23 off ramp. At which point', 'Ms. [Ahearn] fell due to an oversized crack in the cement located', 'beside the first tree. She sustained a broken right arm and a', 'concussion. The full extents [sic] of her injuries are as of yet', 'unknown.” (Emphasis added.) The record discloses that, after the city received plaintiff’s notice of claim, it attempted to investigate the claim and ascertain the site of plaintiff’s alleged fall. The city was unable to fix the fall site, however, because the location described in plaintiff’s notice of claim does not exist; specifically, a Route 95 North Exit 23 does not exit onto Charles Street.2', 'On January 15, 2015, plaintiff filed a complaint in Superior Court alleging that she fell and sustained injuries due to the city’s negligence in maintaining its sidewalk located “on or near Charles Street about 100 fee[t] from the 95 North Exit 23 off ramp, in the City of Providence * * *.” (Emphasis added.) Shortly thereafter, on March 18, 2015, plaintiff moved to amend her complaint to change the location of her fall to “on or near Charles Street about 100 feet from the 95 South Exit 23 off ramp, in the City of Providence * * *.” (Emphasis added.)

The plaintiff objected to the city’s motion for summary judgment, and a hearing was held on October 6, 2015. The city asserted that, pursuant to § 45-15-9, plaintiff’s claim should be dismissed because her notice “excludes the actual area where the accident occurred,” and is therefore “inadequate as a matter of law[.]” Conversely, plaintiff argued that the city is a “sophisticated entity” and could have been on notice of the location of plaintiff’s fall by simply looking at a map. The plaintiff further contended that the caselaw requires only that a plaintiff state where she fell in a reasonably sufficient manner, and that the court should consider the notice of claim as a whole. The trial justice stated that “[a] notice of claim that fails to describe with sufficient specificity of location where the incident giving rise to the claim occurred is defective as a matter of law.” Although he recognized that granting summary judgment in favor of defendant was a harsh result, the trial justice concluded that identifying the wrong highway exit direction in the notice rendered plaintiff’s notice inadequate, and granted defendant’s motion. Plaintiff filed a timely appeal on November 12, 2015.', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that, despite the fact that her notice did not provide the exact location of her fall, it is nonetheless adequate because it describes the defect in the sidewalk in a reasonably sufficient manner. The city contends that the notice fails because it does not indicate the actual area where plaintiff’s fall occurred, and that plaintiff’s amended complaint could not cure the defective notice because it was filed outside the sixty-day limitations period for filing a notice of claim under § 45-15-9.', '-3-', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews a trial justice’s decision granting summary judgment de novo.

City of Providence, 996 A.2d 1139, 1143 (R.I. 2010). In this case, plaintiff did not move to amend her claim until nearly two years after her initial notice was filed with the city. It is undeniable that plaintiff filed her amended complaint setting forth a revised location outside of the prescribed statutory time frame, and thus we deem this April 8, 2015 attempt to amend her notice of claim invalid.', '-4-', 'Section 45-15-9(a) requires an injured person to provide notice to the city of “the time, place, and cause of the injury or damage” within sixty days from the time of injury.

Although plaintiff contends that the notice language leads to only two possible locations where the sidewalk defect could be found—either on Orms Street or Charles Street—we are of the opinion that the Legislature relieved the city of having to engage in guesswork or to canvass the neighborhood to eliminate potential fall sites when it enacted § 45-15-9(a). The statute is clear and unambiguous in providing a notice requirement for actions brought under § 45-15-9(a), and should be construed in accordance with its plain and ordinary meaning.

Id. at 447. The plaintiff’s narrow interpretation of Carbone is misplaced. We conclude in this case that plaintiff’s error in describing the entirely wrong exit and highway direction, and a location that is geographically nonexistent, is far more egregious than the plaintiff’s error in Carbone.

Ballard et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. Before this Court is yet another chapter in the long- running spat between Newport’s renowned feuding neighbors, Carol C. Ballard and A.L. Ballard (the Ballards) against SVF Foundation (the Foundation) and its predecessor owner, the Dorrance H. Hamilton Trust (the Trust), regarding the former “Edgehill property” located in Newport, Rhode Island. The parties have engaged in an embittered and unseemly battle that has endured for more than seventeen years. In the multiple cases that have been filed in the Superior Court— presided over by a series of intrepid trial justices—not a single count, claim, or counterclaim has proceeded to trial.1 Rather, a plethora of summary judgments and Rule 54(b) judgments abound. The Ballards currently appeal from summary judgments and an order of dismissal entered by the 1', 'See Moore v. Ballard, 914 A.2d 487 (R.I. 2007); Hamilton v. Ballard, 161 A.3d 470 (R.I. 2017).', '-1- Superior Court, on the eve of trial, in these consolidated cases. The parties appeared before the Supreme Court for oral argument on November 7, 2017. After carefully reviewing the record and considering the parties’ written and oral submissions, we affirm the judgment in all respects.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In early 2001, in the context of pending litigation, the Superior Court ordered a partition of the Edgehill property and appointed a partition commissioner (the commissioner) to assess the equities and recommend a fair division of the property between the Ballards and the Foundation’s previous owner, the Trust.2 On February 8, 2002, the commissioner issued his report, including his findings and recommendations; on September 27, 2002, the commissioner issued a supplemental report and recommendation. The Superior Court adopted the commissioner’s findings and recommendations, and a judgment of partition entered on December 16, 2002. The Ballards and the Foundation were awarded equal portions of the property—specifically, the Foundation was awarded approximately 17.172 acres, comprising a masonry complex known as the “Swiss Village,” and the Ballards were awarded 11.478 acres, which included two structures known as the “Manor House” and the “Carriage House.” Carol Ballard also owned a separate parcel identified as “Lot 20,” an undeveloped lot that abuts the Edgehill property on the westerly side.3 Lot 20 is featured in the current phase of this battle. The partition order was not challenged by either side, and it ripened into a final judgment. However, the parties’ incessant squabbles over access easements and sewer debate have persisted for many years. This Court has been confronted with a petition for relief from the partition judgment arising from an access easement, the unending sewer debate, as well as 2', 'For convenience, we shall refer to the Foundation as the owner throughout this opinion. 3', 'Carol Ballard originally bought Lot 20 in 1995; it is now owned by Ballard Properties, LP.', '-2- numerous amendments to the original complaint, additional claims, counterclaims, and new complaints.4', 'The Sewer System and Lot 20', '(NC-2000-0340)', 'Among the post-partition disputes from which these appeals arise was the Edgehill property sewer system (the sewer system). Questions about joint responsibility for the sewer system and whether the sewer system could be utilized to service adjacent lots were raised during the partition proceeding. The Ballards sought, and were denied, an easement to connect Lot 20 to the sewer system; their request had been opposed by the Foundation. This was not the Ballards’ first attempt to do so, nor was it their last. Indeed, it is fair to say that much of this litigation has centered on the Ballards’ persistent efforts to expand the sewer system for their personal benefit. On September 27, 2002, the commissioner issued his supplemental report and recommendation to address the post-partition sewer system issues. The commissioner expressly determined that it was not necessary to address whether the Ballards may access the sewer system to service abutting properties such as Lot 20, as that issue did not relate to the partitioned estate.', 'On December 6, 2002, the Superior Court issued an order of partition that adopted the original and supplemental findings and recommendations of the commissioner. As explained in the order, the sewer pump facility and its sewer lines serviced the Swiss Village, the Manor House, and the Carriage House. The trial justice awarded the Ballards and the Foundation―in joint ownership―all the benefits and rights to the sewer pump station, the forced main sewer line, and the main sewer feed line on the Edgehill property, and directed that any repair and 4', 'As discussed below, in 2005, the Foundation filed a fifth amended complaint in case number NC-2000-0340. In response, the Ballards filed numerous counterclaims.', '-3- maintenance responsibilities be allocated on a pro rata basis. The order also awarded individual ownership of any lateral sewer lines located on the parties’ respective properties. The Superior Court declared that “[t]o the extent that other necessary but unspecified utility or drainage lines, conditions or facilities exist which predate the partition, such shall be deemed pre-existing easements by necessity or implication which inure to the benefit of the dominant tenant.” The Ballards are before the Court arguing that the sewer system qualifies as an “unspecified utility or drainage line.” Although no appeal was taken by either party from the partition judgment, the Ballards’ efforts to connect the sewer system to Lot 20 have persisted.', 'In a 2005 fifth amended complaint in the original action, the Foundation sought injunctive relief to prevent the Ballards from connecting Lot 20 to the Edgehill property’s sewer station.5 The Ballards then filed an answer and counterclaim, which included claims for trespass, declaratory judgment, and an accounting.6 A decade later, in 2015, with the trial date looming, the Ballards moved to amend their counterclaim to add a new count, seeking a declaration that an implied easement to access the sewer system arose when they bought Lot 20. The motion to amend was denied. No appeal was taken. 5', 'There were numerous counts set forth in the Foundation’s fifth amended complaint: Count I, injunctive relief for the sewer system; Count II, injunctive relief for overburdening an access easement; Count III, accounting relative to the Edgehill property; Count IV, unjust enrichment; Count V, implied easement or easement arising as a matter of law; Count VI, trespass; Count VII, wetlands violations; Count VIII, quiet title/acquiescence; Count IIX [sic], fraud; and Count IX, slander of title. 6', 'The Ballards’ counterclaim alleged: Count I, trespass; Count II, malicious prosecution; Count III, abuse of process; Count IV, waste; Count V, declaratory judgment; Count VI, accounting; and Count VII, unreasonable interference with easement.', '-4-', 'The Driveway Easement', '(NC-2013-0499)', 'An easement that is described in the commissioner’s report and recommendation as “a driveway easement for access to the Carriage House” (the driveway easement) is also before us on appeal.7 The driveway easement provided the Ballards with access to a driveway over the Foundation’s property to the Carriage House. Due to zoning setback requirements, this easement was a necessary part of the partition judgment. Two stone pillars stood at the entrance to the driveway: one on the Foundation’s property and the other on the Ballards’ property, with an iron gate between them. The stone pillars and the iron gate were in poor condition and in need of repair. Given the parties’ toxic relationship, it was only a matter of time before this circumstance led to acrimony and litigation.', 'The Ballards, concerned about the appearance and the condition of the pillars and the gate, sought to initiate the restoration of these structures. A.L. Ballard approached the Trust, the owner at the time, with an offer to relocate the pillars and to move the driveway. Before this Court, the Ballards allege that, after replacing the pillars and gate and relocating the driveway, thus eliminating the need for access to the Foundation’s property, they nonetheless intended to continue to use “their easement.” They planned to install a garden with landscaping and a grass or gravel path for foot or vehicular traffic over “their easement”; and not for its original purpose as “an access easement over existing driveway to [the] Carriage House.” Indeed, at a July 9, 2015, pretrial conference, the Ballards’ counsel argued to the trial justice that “the whole purpose 7', 'Another easement, known as the “interior access easement,” was litigated in case number NC- 2000-340 in the context of a motion for relief from a judgment. The issue came before us in Hamilton, 161 A.3d at 480. This court vacated the trial justices’ judgment and remanded for further proceedings. The issue remains pending in the Superior Court.', '-5- of moving the driveway is so we can landscape on our easement[.]” Counsel also argued that the Ballards moved the driveway but that “[w]e didn’t move the easement.”', 'According to the Foundation, it agreed to the offer to relocate the driveway and move the pillars onto the Ballards’ property; however, in return, the Foundation declared its intent to erect a fence on its property, where the stone pillar once stood. The Foundation also contends that, by relocating the driveway, the Ballards abandoned the driveway easement. Despite knowing the Foundation’s intention once the driveway was relocated, the Ballards claim that they “proceeded with the project of relocating and rebuilding the stone pillars and relocating the carriage house driveway.” Thereafter, the Foundation began installing the fence, and another donnybrook erupted.', 'The Ballards filed a new complaint in Superior Court on December 16, 2013, seeking to enjoin the Foundation from erecting the fence and obstructing their use and enjoyment of “their easement.”8 The Ballards argued that, notwithstanding their request to move the pillars and relocate the driveway, and the Foundation’s conditional acceptance, they had no intention of abandoning the driveway easement. The Foundation responded that the proposal to relocate the driveway was accepted based on the understanding that the Foundation would install a fence at the entry of the driveway. The Foundation also filed a counterclaim alleging several counts, including a request for a declaration that the Ballards had abandoned the driveway easement.', 'These consolidated actions were set for trial on July 29, 2015. 8', 'The 2013 complaint filed by the Ballards related to the driveway easement and Lot 20. It alleged: Count I, seeking to restrain or enjoin the Foundation from obstructing and interfering with the Ballards’ driveway easement; and Count II, seeking a declaratory judgment that the Ballards have a right to make improvements on their Lot 20 easement (which had also been created by the 2002 partition judgment).', '-6-', 'Pretrial Dispositions', 'On May 4 and June 1, 2015, the parties came before the trial justice on the Foundation’s motion for partial summary judgment on Count I of the Foundation’s fifth amended complaint, seeking to enjoin the Ballards from accessing the jointly owned Edgehill property sewer system to service a subdivision of Lot 20. The trial justice noted at the later hearing date that', '“[t]his Court gave the parties a month to try to resolve the matter', 'by trying to reach a resolution that would pay for the sewerage', 'system. * * * There seems to be no material fact that I can see. As', 'a matter of law, [the sewer easement] apparently cannot be', 'extended to benefit other lots that were not a part of the initial', 'partition.” In recognizing that another easement would have to be created in order for the Ballards to connect to the sewer system, the trial justice granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the Foundation, awarding injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent the expansion of the sewer system. An appeal of that order is before us in this matter.', 'On July 9, 2015, the trial justice conducted an on-the-record pretrial conference in an attempt to narrow the issues in the consolidated cases and clarify which claims would proceed to trial on July 29, 2015. The trial justice patiently plowed through the multiple claims in each complaint and counterclaim.9', 'In open court and on the record, the parties agreed to dismiss a number of the claims in advance of trial. Included in the claims addressed at the conference was the Ballards’ demand 9', 'During the July 9, 2015, hearing, the parties continued to bicker over whether some claims had been dismissed by stipulation; the trial justice expressed his frustration:', '“I’ll let you know, as I’m sitting here and thinking about a', 'potential jury in this case, and people in this town are wealthy, and', 'then there’s those less fortunate, probably sometimes can’t buy', 'groceries, and the amount of silly money spent in this case for', '[fourteen] years, this is going to be embarrassing for someone in', 'the long run, I can tell you that.”', '-7- for an accounting as set forth in its counterclaim to the Foundation’s fifth amended complaint. Counsel for the Ballards agreed to dismiss this claim. Soon thereafter, counsel for the Ballards notified the Foundation that he intended to pursue an accounting claim at trial. The record before us reflects that the Ballards attempted to recast their accounting claim as a demand for expenses related to post-partition work on the sewer system, which was unrelated to the original accounting claim. Accompanying this eleventh-hour about-face was an e-mail, characterized as a “document dump”―consisting of voluminous written material―in support of the Ballards’ claim for reimbursement for post-partition sewer expenses. The Foundation filed an emergency motion to enforce the Ballards’ previous dismissal of their accounting claim, and, on July 27, 2015, two days before trial, the trial justice held a hearing.10 The Foundation argued that, based on counsel’s colloquy with the court on July 9, 2015 the Ballards’ accounting claim had been dismissed.', 'In light of the shifting posture of his adversary, counsel for the Foundation prudently arrived at the courthouse early on the morning of July 27, 2015, and secured a transcript of the pretrial conference concerning the accounting counterclaim.', 'The trial justice reviewed the transcript and confirmed the dismissal of the newly formulated accounting claim, based on counsel’s representation to the court on the July 9, 2015 hearing. An order entered that granted the Foundation’s emergency motion to enforce a settlement agreement, and dismissed the Ballards’ accounting counterclaim.11 The Ballards have appealed the dismissal. 10', 'Due to the timing of the Ballards’ “document dump,” the Foundation was left with no alternative course of action other than to file an emergency motion. 11', 'In the same order, the trial justice also granted the Foundation’s motion to dismiss without prejudice its unjust enrichment claim (Count IV of the fifth amended complaint) pending an appeal, and dismissed without prejudice the Ballards’ trespass claim (Count I of their counterclaim) pending appeal.', '-8-', 'There was no trial on any claim. After the July 27, 2015 hearing, counsel for the Ballards filed a motion for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, alleging that counsel for the Foundation had falsely represented that a settlement agreement had been reached on July 9, 2015. He also accused counsel and the trial justice of engaging in ex parte communications, a serious accusation that was based on the fact that the trial justice was provided with the transcript in advance of the emergency hearing.', 'On August 31, 2015, the parties came before the trial justice yet again, on the Foundation’s motion for summary judgment on the driveway easement. During this hearing, in obvious frustration over the moving pieces in this case, the trial justice likened this action to that of a shell game:', '“THE COURT: * * * I mean if I watched this case, that has been', 'going on for 15 years, it is beginning to look like a pea. There’s', 'one pea under the shell and everybody is kind of moving it around.', 'I wonder if there’s a pea at all?” The Court admonished counsel for the Ballards:', '“THE COURT: This is what I was saying about the pea under the', 'shell.”', 'The trial justice ultimately granted the Foundation’s motion for summary judgment on the driveway easement claim, and summarily denied the Ballards’ motion for sanctions. A final judgment was entered on October 19, 2015. The Ballards filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that “[t]his Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Sullo v.

Ward Fisher & Co., 47 A.3d 319, 323 (R.I. 2012)). In the absence of a credible showing of the existence of material facts, summary judgment is warranted.', 'Analysis', 'The Ballards have narrowed their appeal to the judgments concerning the sewer system and the driveway easement; the order dismissing the accounting claim, based on the in-court conference; and the denial of their Rule 11 motion for sanctions against the attorney for the Foundation. We address these issues in turn.', 'A', 'The Sewer System', '(NC-2000-0340)', 'It is apparent from the multiple complaints and counterclaims, and the voluminous record, that the Ballards’ efforts to connect Lot 20 to the sewer system have never abated. In 2000, before the partition proceedings began, the Ballards requested an easement to connect their abutting Lot 20 to the sewer system. The Trust, the owner at the time, objected and filed an action seeking to enjoin the Ballards from expanding the sewer system in order to service abutting properties. The Superior Court subsequently entered the partition judgment and adopted the findings and recommendations of the commissioner. Notably, the commissioner addressed the sewer issue, finding that the main sewer line crosses from the pump house, through the rear', '- 10 - of the Foundation’s Swiss Village property, and traverses Lot 20 for a short distance. The commissioner expressly reported in 2002 that:', '“The question of whether the Ballards or [the Foundation] may use', 'the system in order to service their adjacent properties (lots #20', 'and #66, respectively) need not be addressed in this', 'recommendation. Any such future use (or misuse) is presently', 'speculative. The resolution of any such contingency would require', 'a fact-intensive analysis of the issues presented at the time, should', 'the need arise.', '“Any and all lateral sewer lines, i.e., those that are connected to the', 'main feed line (which runs from the pump house crossing the', 'Swiss Village to lot #20) and the forced main line (which traverses', 'the Carriage House and Manor House lots from the pump house)', 'should be owned and maintained solely by the owners of the', 'respective lots [, under] which such lateral lines serve.” On June 1, 2015, the trial justice granted summary judgment in favor of the Foundation and enjoined the Ballards from connecting Lot 20 to the sewer system. The trial justice declared:', '“As a matter of law, this easement apparently cannot be extended', 'to benefit other lots that were not a part of the initial partition. So', 'the rights to full usage across this piece of property would be in the', 'nature of an easement, so therefore I’m going to grant the Motion', 'for Summary Judgment for [the] Foundation.”', 'The Ballards contend before this Court that the trial justice erred in rejecting their claim of a sewer easement. The Ballards argue that an easement by necessity or implication to use the sewer system to service Lot 20 arose from the partition judgment.', 'Notwithstanding the commissioner’s specific findings rejecting any such easement, the Ballards rely upon a different portion of the partition judgment that declares “[t]o the extent that other necessary but unspecified utility or drainage lines, conditions, or facilities exist which predate the partition, such shall be deemed pre-existing easements by necessity or implication which inure to the benefit of the dominant tenant.” (Emphasis added.) This argument is wholly without merit. This portion of the partition judgment is separate and apart from the specific declaration in the', '- 11 - judgment relating to the sewer system. The sewer system is not an “unspecified utility or drainage line.” The Ballards also contend that “below-ground flow of sewage” and a manhole located on Lot 20 somehow amount to a preexisting easement. The Ballards have failed to articulate how a manhole and underground sewer pipe can service an uninhabited parcel of land. The Ballards also claim—without any supporting evidence—that an easement was created by and through their deed to Lot 20.', 'The Foundation responds that Lot 20 has never been serviced by the sewer system and that, therefore, the partition of the Edgehill property did not create an easement for Lot 20. Although acknowledging that sewer pipes extend underneath Lot 20 for a short distance, the Foundation argues that this circumstance does not create an easement for Lot 20 to access the sewer system.12 Nor does the placement of a manhole on Lot 20 give the Ballards any right to connect to the sewer system, contends the Foundation. Finally, the Foundation argues that the Ballards’ deed to Lot 20 neither grants an easement for access to the sewer system, nor does it purport to create any issue of material fact. We agree with these contentions and proceed to resolve the issue of Lot 20 and the sewer system with finality.', 'There is nothing in the unappealed partition judgment that gives rise to an easement, express or implied, for Lot 20 to access the sewer system.', 'Lot 20 and the sewer issue specifically were excluded in the partition judgment. The Ballards’ contention that the location of a manhole on Lot 20 somehow gives them the right to tie into the sewer system, while artful, is delusory. The manhole that is situated on Lot 20 has no bearing on the issues in this case. To the extent that it constitutes a trespass, the Foundation has agreed to remove it. Similarly, the 12', 'The Foundation has consistently offered to relocate the pipes that intrude onto Lot 20, to no avail. Counsel for the Ballards responded that the Foundation has no right to come onto their land.', '- 12 - fact that a lateral sewer line extends for a short distance onto Lot 20 is equally irrelevant; Lot 20 is an undeveloped parcel of land.', 'Finally, we briefly address the Ballards’ argument that they were granted an easement to connect to the sewer system through the original property deed to Lot 20. The Ballards raised this issue a month before trial in a motion to amend their counterclaim. Their attempt to add this claim to a case that had been pending for over a decade was rebuffed. They are foreclosed from raising that issue on appeal. As we consistently have held on numerous occasions, “[t]his Court staunchly adheres to the ‘raise or waive’ rule.” State v. Barros, 148 A.3d 168, 174 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 (R.I. 2011)). “The raise-or-waive rule requires that objections are to be raised at trial so that opposing counsel has ‘an opportunity to respond appropriately to claims raised.’” Id. at 175 (quoting State v. Burke, 522 A.2d 725, 731 (R.I. 1987)). Because the Ballards failed to raise and articulate any claim that the property deed to Lot 20 granted them, as they contend on appeal, “the right to lay sewer and other underground lines” into the Edgehill property, we deem this argument waived. Accordingly, the Ballards have no right to connect Lot 20 to the sewer system; they have no express or implied easement in the sewer system, as a matter of law.', 'B', 'The Driveway Easement', '(NC-2013-0499)', 'In 2013, after they dismantled and relocated the existing driveway, the Ballards filed an action seeking to prevent the Foundation from erecting a fence on the Foundation’s property. As noted above, it was the Ballards who sought to repair and relocate the driveway, along with the stone pillars and the iron gate. The Foundation, through written correspondence, had agreed to the Ballards’ request to relocate the driveway, with the understanding that the Foundation would', '- 13 - erect a fence on the Foundation’s side.13 However, when the Foundation undertook to install the fence, the Ballards balked. They filed suit seeking to enjoin the construction of the fence, alleging that there was no agreement between the parties and that they intended to continue to use the driveway easement for “landscaping and plantings.” It was a short fight; the Ballards lost. Injunctive relief was denied, and summary judgment was eventually sought. On August 31, 2015, the trial justice granted summary judgment, declaring that the Foundation was no longer burdened by the driveway easement.', 'Before this Court, the Ballards contend that the issues surrounding whether there was a contract between the parties or whether the Ballards abandoned the driveway easement are fact- bound inquiries for which summary judgment should not have been granted. This argument is without merit. The existence of a contract, of course, is a matter of law. See Fogarty v. Palumbo, 163 A.3d 526, 539 (R.I. 2017) (affirming trial justice’s grant of summary judgment because the evidence presented, as a matter of law, did not establish the existence of a contract); Filippi v.

However, we need not delve deeply into the law of contracts, because the issue before the Court is controlled by the law of easements.', 'The record discloses that, due to zoning setback requirements, the Carriage House driveway was on the Foundation’s portion of the property, and an easement was necessary in order for the Ballards to access the Carriage House. Although this easement was an express grant of easement in the partition judgment, it was nonetheless a necessary component of the partition and was granted for a specific purpose. Thus, it possessed all of the characteristics of an easement by necessity.', 'When the Ballards relocated the driveway to their property, the driveway easement was no longer necessary. The law is clear that when an easement of necessity is no longer necessary, the right to that easement is terminated and the easement thereafter ceases to exist. See Fusaro v. Varrecchione, 51 R.I. 35, 36, 150 A. 462, 462 (1930) (“A right of way of necessity ceases when the necessity for its continuance ceases[.]” (quoting Sweezy v. Vallette, 37 R.I. 51, 54, 90 A. 1078, 1080 (1914))). Generally, this occurs when another lawful way onto the property has been acquired, thus eliminating the necessity. Sweezy, 37 R.I. at 54, 90 A. at 1080.', 'Furthermore, we are of the opinion that the driveway easement was abandoned by the Ballards themselves based on the undisputed evidence produced on summary judgment. It has been held that “[w]hether or not a way has been abandoned by acts in pais is a question of intention and such intention must be shown by positive evidence of an express declaration to that effect or by acts of a decisive character.” Sweezy, 37 R.I. at 54, 90 A. at 1080 (emphasis added). In the case before us, we are hard pressed to envision a more decisive act of abandonment than relocating the very driveway over which the easement runs, taking a stone pillar and the gate along with you, and then excavating the driveway surface from the servient estate. The Ballards', '- 15 - not only abandoned the easement, they demolished it. When the owner of an easement “has voluntarily acted in so decisive a manner as to clearly indicate his intent to abandon the easement,” and these acts “were relied upon by the person owning the land subject to the easement[,]” the easement has been abandoned as a matter of law. Charles C. Gardiner Lumber Co. v. Graves, 63 R.I. 345, 350, 8 A.2d 862, 864 (1939). The evidence produced on summary judgment is uncontradicted and conclusive. The easement has been abandoned by the acts of the Ballards.', 'Accordingly, there were no genuine issues of material fact presented in this case, and the trial justice properly granted summary judgment. We affirm.', 'C', 'Accounting Counterclaim and Sanctions', 'We now turn to the more troubling issues in this case: the Ballards’ shifting position on the dismissal of their accounting counterclaim and the eleventh-hour transmutation of the claim itself. In 2005, in their answer and counterclaim to the Foundation’s fifth amended complaint, the Ballards sought an accounting pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-2-1.14 The Ballards alleged that, 14', 'General Laws 1956 § 10-2-1 provides:', '“Whenever two (2) or more persons have and hold any estate,', 'interest or property, whether real or personal, in common as joint', 'tenants, tenants in common, co-parceners or joint owners and one', 'or more of the owners of the common property shall take, receive,', 'use or have benefit thereof, in greater proportion than his, her, or', 'their interest therein, such owner or owners, his, her, or their', 'executors and administrators shall be liable to render his, her, or', 'their account of the use and profit of such common property to his,', 'her or their fellow commoner or commoners, jointly or severally;', 'and such of the fellow commoner or commoners or any or either of', 'them, their executors or administrators, shall have his, her, or their', 'action against such receiver or receivers or either of them, as his,', '- 16 - before the partition judgment, the Trust had committed waste on the jointly owned property, including demolition and reconstruction of structures in violation of local regulations and ordinances, and altering and destroying extensive wetlands, in contradiction of the Ballards’ interests. The Ballards alleged that they were cited by the state’s Department of Environmental Management for wetlands violations and ordered, “along with Hamilton, to perform extensive restoration work and pay administrative penalties[,]” requiring them to “expend great sums on attorneys’ fees and expert fees[.]” They sought an accounting.', 'In 2006, in response to an interrogatory inquiring about the facts and documents in support of the accounting claim, the Ballards answered:', '“The plaintiff and defendants were joint tenants in the Edgehill', 'property. During the time of the joint tenancy, the plaintiff', 'embarked on significant alterations to the jointly held property', 'without the knowledge or approval of the defendants.” (Emphasis', 'added.) Additionally, when asked in another 2006 interrogatory to set forth the specific amount of damages they were seeking for each claim in their counterclaim, the Ballards responded:', '“The defendants’ claim for money damages is for the legal and', 'professional fees they were required to incur in protecting their', 'interests after being named as defendants in the Department of', 'Environmental Management’s enforcement action that arose out of', 'Mrs. Hamilton’s uncontested alterations and destruction of', 'wetlands on the jointly owned property.” The Ballards are bound by these responses, and their attempt to transmute the claim into one seeking post-partition sewer expenses must fail.', 'her, or their bailiff or bailiffs, for receiving more than his, her, or', 'their part or proportion as provided in this section.”', '- 17 -', 'Furthermore, the accounting claim lay dormant for many years until the July 9, 2015 pretrial conference.', 'It was at that time that counsel for the Ballards made the following statements with respect to several claims, including the accounting claim:', '“[COUNSEL FOR THE BALLARDS]: * * * Count 2, malicious', 'prosecution: We do not intend to pursue that claim and I offered to', 'dismiss that with prejudice; abusive [sic] process, the same; waste,', 'the same.', '“* * *', '“Accounting, I’ve offered to dismiss that with prejudice.', '“And interference with access easement is in the Supreme Court', 'and is pending appeal.”', 'As the trial date approached, there was no writing reflecting this agreement. However, counsel for the Ballards notified the Foundation of his intention to pursue the newly clothed accounting claim, and filed a pretrial memorandum that set forth the basis of an entirely new claim. In the memorandum counsel stated:', '“The Ballards seek an accounting to impose liability on [the', 'Foundation] for its share of expenditures that the Ballards have', 'made for maintenance of and repairs and improvements to the', 'Edgehill sewer system which Ballards and [the Foundation] own as', 'tenants in common.” (Emphasis added.)', 'Counsel forwarded more than 90 pages of correspondence, invoices, and photographs to the Foundation in an effort to recast the accounting claim under a new set of facts. As noted, counsel for the Foundation immediately filed an emergency motion to enforce the Ballards’ agreement to dismiss the claim and wisely procured a transcript on the morning of the hearing. After reviewing the transcript, the trial justice granted the Foundation’s motion to enforce the agreement to dismiss the claim:', '“[COUNSEL FOR THE FOUNDATION]: Your honor, this is a', 'count going back a year that [the Ballards’ counsel] has told me', '- 18 -', 'was dismissed. It relates to a 2000 case. Now we came before this', 'Court on pretrial conference to limit the issues so the parties would', 'know what is going to be tried and so the Court would know what', 'is going to be tried.

The motion is granted. I want to', 'move on. You can note your objection.” Regrettably, the Ballards next sought Rule 11 sanctions, arguing that counsel for the Foundation had fraudulently represented to the trial justice that the Ballards’ accounting claim had been dismissed and that he and the trial justice had engaged in an ex parte communication. The Ballard’s counsel acknowledged at oral argument before us that this latter claim was based on the fact that the trial justice was provided with a transcript of the July 9, 2015 proceeding.', 'We begin our analysis of this troubling conduct by noting that Rule 1.4 of the Superior Court Rules of Practice provides that “[a]ll agreements of parties or attorneys touching the business of the court shall be in writing, unless orally made or assented to by them in the presence of the court when disposing of such business, or they will be considered of no validity.” (Emphasis added.) Additionally, this Court has held that “stipulated agreements [must] be placed on the record or * * * be reduced to an agreed-upon writing [to ensure] that the', '- 19 - agreement itself does not become a source of further controversy and litigation.”', 'In re McBurney Law Services, Inc., 798 A.2d 877, 881 (R.I. 2002) (emphasis added) (quoting DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757, 776 (R.I. 2000)). “A party may not escape its obligations simply because one of the parties may not consider the agreement to be as palatable to them as when they entered into it.” Id.', 'The record in this case is clear: counsel for the Ballards stipulated in open court that he was dismissing the accounting claim, along with several other counts in the consolidated actions. We reject as disingenuous counsel’s appellate contention that his statement was not “a statement of present intention” to dismiss the Ballards’ accounting claim. It is undisputed that the purpose of the pretrial conference on the record was to narrow the claims asserted in the complaints and counterclaims in order to prepare for trial.', 'Moreover, counsel’s argument that there was no dismissal of the accounting claim because there was no writing is wrong. First, as noted, a writing is not required when the stipulation is made in open court. Secondly, and of greater concern, counsel made identical representations, in open court, for three additional counts that were dismissed without a written stipulation. When asked about this disparity at oral argument, counsel insisted that he was “entitled to pick and choose.” This response speaks to the fallacy of counsel’s contentions before this Court.', 'Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice properly dismissed the Ballards’ accounting counterclaim.', 'The Ballards further contend that it was inappropriate for the trial justice to deny Rule 11 sanctions against counsel for the Foundation.15 The Ballards insist that counsel’s motion seeking 15', 'Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in relevant part:', '- 20 - to enforce a settlement agreement was fraudulent because no settlement agreement had been reached by the parties. The Ballards also accused the trial justice of engaging in ex parte communication with counsel for the Foundation because counsel prudently obtained a transcript of the pretrial conference and provided it to the Court at the later hearing. The Ballards contend that it was an abuse of discretion by the trial justice to deny sanctions without setting forth his reasoning on the record. These contentions are without merit. Counsel has failed to proffer a good-faith basis for seeking Rule 11 sanctions.', 'This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s decision to impose or deny sanctions for an attorney’s alleged misconduct unless the trial justice based his or her ruling on “an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.” Michalopoulos v.

52,(00-1831-6) (00-1831-7) In re James H. et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The respondent mother, Crystal M.,1 appeals from a decree of the Family Court terminating her parental rights with respect to her three children, James H., Dalicia W., and Dalilah W. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on December 6, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 30, 2015, the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) filed petitions to terminate Crystal’s parental rights2 as to three of her minor children: James, Dalicia, 1', 'In this opinion, we shall refer to respondent by her first name; in so doing, we intend no disrespect. 2', 'The parental rights of the fathers of the children were terminated by the Family Court on July 26, 2016, and no appeal was taken therefrom.', '-1- and Dalilah.3 Citing G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(3), those petitions alleged that all three children had been in the legal custody of DCYF for at least twelve months without a substantial probability that the children would be able to return safely to Crystal’s care within a reasonable period of time, considering the children’s ages and their needs for permanent homes.', 'Trial commenced in the Family Court on June 1, 2016 and continued over four days, during which time the trial justice heard testimony from eight witnesses. We summarize below the salient aspects of the testimony that was adduced at that trial.', 'A', 'The Witnesses Presented by DCYF', '1. Diane Crabtree', 'Diane Crabtree, a social caseworker for DCYF, testified that case files as to Dalicia and Dalilah, who are twins, were opened on March 27, 2013 because both girls had tested positive for cocaine at birth.4 She further testified that she was assigned to the cases of James, Dalicia, and Dalilah from April of 2013 until August of 2014. Ms. Crabtree stated that she developed two case plans during said period, which case plans had recommended that Crystal complete the following services in order to reunify with her children: substance abuse counseling, mental health counseling, family counseling, family visitation, parenting education, a psychological evaluation with Dr. John Parsons, and a neuropsychological evaluation with Dr. Steven Hirsch. 3', 'The legal status of Crystal vis-à-vis her other minor child (Eleanor S.) is not at issue in this case. Reference is made to Eleanor in this opinion only to the extent necessary to provide context for the issues properly before this Court. 4', 'The case file as to James was opened on April 3, 2013, the date on which the child protective investigator submitted a petition to the Family Court seeking to remove James from Crystal’s care based on allegations of neglect. The child protective investigator’s report as to James, as well as the physician’s reports finding that Dalicia and Dalilah had tested positive for cocaine at birth, were admitted as full exhibits at trial.', '-2-', 'According to Ms. Crabtree, Crystal was cooperative with some services but uncooperative with others. She stated, for example, that Crystal successfully completed the psychological evaluation with Dr. Parsons in December of 2013 and completed the substance abuse counseling program through MAP Behavioral Health Services in May of 2014. However, she added that Crystal pursued the MAP program only after she had been discharged for noncompliance from an earlier substance abuse program, known as the “Project Link” program; and she stated that Crystal had tested positive for cocaine during her enrollment in the MAP program. Additionally, Ms. Crabtree stated that, although Crystal had participated in the Families Together parenting education program, she had been terminated from that program in March of 2014 due to a clinician’s conclusion that she had demonstrated “little motivation to change her behaviors” and that, therefore, reunification would “put the children at risk.”', 'Ms. Crabtree also testified that Crystal had failed to comply with the schedules for family visitation by virtue of her absence from eight of twenty-four scheduled visits, by her arriving late at other visits, and by her refusing to provide DCYF with her work schedule. She added that Crystal had uttered “profanities” towards DCYF employees during the visits; she also stated that Crystal had been visibly intoxicated during one of the visits and, therefore, was asked to leave. Ms. Crabtree did acknowledge, however, that, towards the end of her involvement with Crystal, she saw some improvement in Crystal’s attendance at the visits and in her behavior towards DCYF employees.', '2. Rosemary Masterson', 'Rosemary Masterson testified that she was the DCYF social worker who became responsible for Crystal’s case after the departure of Ms. Crabtree. She stated that, when she assumed responsibility for the case in August of 2014, Crystal had completed evaluations with Dr. Parsons and Dr. Hirsch, but had not yet followed through with their recommendations or', '-3- completed the other services outlined in the case plans, such as substance abuse counseling and mental health counseling. Ms. Masterson stated that Crystal “just would not cooperate” with the objectives of the case plans, expressing the belief that “she had done everything she needed to do and no longer wished to do anymore [sic] services.” She testified that Crystal had not been receptive to recommendations for mental health treatment because “[Crystal] didn’t feel she needed counseling.” She also stated that, in July of 2015, Crystal had been terminated from a second parenting education program, “the HER program,” due to her “lack of progress with reunification” and her consistent failure to attend her appointments.', 'Ms. Masterson testified that Crystal missed twenty-seven of sixty-four scheduled visits with her children between August of 2014 and October of 2015 and that Crystal stopped attending visits altogether as of August of 2015. She further testified that Crystal’s behavior towards her children during those visits was “not appropriate,” specifically noting that Crystal would focus her attention exclusively on the twins while “purposely ignoring” James. She added that, at Crystal’s last visit, on August 17, 2015, she had departed without speaking to the children, thereby causing the children to become “very upset.” Ms. Masterson stated that, as a result of the latter incident, she filed a motion to suspend visitation, which motion was granted by the Family Court on October 26, 2015.', '3. Doctor John Parsons', 'The next witness was Dr. Parsons, who was qualified as an expert in forensic psychology as well as child and family psychology. He testified that, in October of 2013, Crystal was referred to him by Ms. Crabtree for a psychological evaluation; he stated that Ms. Crabtree was concerned about Crystal’s parenting ability, her history of smoking marijuana during pregnancy, her cocaine use during pregnancy, and her history of DCYF involvement. He testified that his evaluation of Crystal occurred over a series of appointments and concluded on December 16, 2013.', '-4-', 'Doctor Parsons testified that he made the following diagnoses with respect to Crystal: “cannabis abuse in early/full remission;” “cocaine dependency in early/partial remission;” bipolar disorder; borderline intellectual functioning; and a “personality disorder with borderline narcissistic and personality disorder features.” Based on his diagnoses and observations, Dr. Parsons testified that he had reached the opinion that reunification would be “high risk” and would be harmful to the children. His report recommended that Crystal should be given three months to deal with chronic mental health and substance abuse issues and to receive therapy to address both her “non-productive relationships with people” and her lack of “protective capacity” towards the children. His report further recommended that Crystal receive “a psychiatric evaluation * * * to assess the need for psychotropic medications.” Doctor Parsons testified that he had recommended that the Family Court should terminate Crystal’s parental rights or give her the option of an open adoption if she was unable to comply with his recommendations within the three-month timeline. Doctor Parsons having recommended that Crystal undergo a second psychological evaluation, DCYF identified Dr. Hirsch as the clinician who would conduct that evaluation.', '4. Doctor Steven Hirsch', 'Doctor Hirsch, who was qualified as an expert in psychology and clinical neuropsychology, testified that he evaluated Crystal in May of 2014 pursuant to a referral from DCYF and that the focus of his evaluation was to assess Crystal’s “mental health functioning, as well as her cognitive and neuropsychological functioning;” he added that his evaluation had not included an assessment of Crystal’s parenting abilities. When counsel for DCYF moved to admit into evidence Dr. Hirsch’s report, which summarized his findings and recommendations, Crystal’s', '-5- standby counsel5 objected, arguing that the report was not court-ordered and that, therefore, there was no foundation for the report to come into evidence. Although the trial justice initially sustained the objection, she ultimately admitted the report as a full exhibit, finding that Dr. Hirsch’s evaluation and report were, in actuality, court-ordered because they were conducted in accordance with Dr. Parsons’s recommendations, which were court-ordered.', 'Doctor Hirsch testified that he made the following diagnoses as to Crystal: cocaine abuse; daily cannabis use; post-traumatic stress disorder resulting from events in her childhood; a personality disorder; borderline intellectual functioning; and cognitive memory problems. He further testified that he had made two recommendations for further treatment: (1) that Crystal participate in outpatient counseling to address her “coping skills” and “substance abuse issues;” and (2) that Crystal engage in a “medication consultation” to determine whether psychotropic medications would help to treat her “post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression * * *.”', '5. Respondent', 'Crystal was the last witness to testify during DCYF’s case, having been called as an adverse witness. She acknowledged that the twins had been removed from her care at birth because they had tested positive for cocaine, and she admitted that DCYF had previously indicated6 her for neglect when her older daughter, Eleanor, had tested positive for marijuana at birth. Counsel for DCYF then asked Crystal whether she had had a second interaction with DCYF concerning Eleanor, and the following colloquy occurred: 5', 'Prior to the start of trial, Crystal’s appointed counsel was permitted to withdraw from the case due to “a breakdown in [attorney-client] communication;” Crystal thereafter elected to proceed pro se. Nonetheless, she was afforded the assistance of standby counsel at trial. 6', '“Child Protective Investigators ‘indicate’ a case if, upon completion of an investigation, a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates to them that a child has been abused or neglected.” In re Brooklyn M., 933 A.2d 1113, 1115 n.1 (R.I. 2007).', '-6-', '“Q.', 'So in 2007, you were indicated for lack of supervision as to', 'Eleanor again, correct?', '“A.', 'No, I never seen DCYF for Eleanor twice. It was one time.', '“Q.', 'Didn’t the Providence Police go to your home and you were', 'arrested?', '“A.', 'Oh, yup, yup, yup, yup, yup.', '“Q.', 'What was that for?', '“A.', 'That was for – –', '[STANDBY COUNSEL]: Your Honor, objection, per Rule', '609.', '“A.', 'It was the same thing, for marijuana.” The trial justice overruled the objection, noting that counsel for DCYF was “trying to refresh her recollection about DCYF’s involvement, not her arrest.” After the trial justice so ruled, Crystal offered her explanation as to the circumstances of the 2007 incident.', 'Crystal also testified that she had never been on any medication to treat her mental health issues and that she did not feel medication was necessary; she added, however, that she had nonetheless started seeing one Earl Thurber, a counselor at “Gateway,”7 to determine whether medication might be necessary. Crystal also testified that, contrary to what Ms. Crabtree and Ms. Masterson had stated, she had not been discharged from the Project Link substance abuse counseling program, but had left voluntarily because she was “uncomfortable there.” She stated that she subsequently enrolled in the MAP substance abuse counseling program, but she acknowledged that she had tested positive for cocaine while she was enrolled in that program. Additionally, Crystal testified that her visits with her children were “good visit[s]” and that, during the visits, she would sing and play with the children. Crystal also stated that she did not voluntarily stop visiting the children in August of 2015; rather, she claimed, DCYF had asked a judge to prevent her from attending the visits. 7', 'We infer that the “Gateway” referred to in Crystal’s testimony is Gateway Healthcare, a nonprofit behavioral health organization. See GATEWAY HEALTHCARE https://www.gatewayhealth. org (last visited on April 6, 2018).', '-7-', 'B', 'The Witnesses Presented by Respondent: Valerie Khalil and Johnetta McLean', 'DCYF having rested its case, Crystal called Valerie Khalil and Johnetta McLean to testify on her behalf.', 'Ms. Khalil stated that she had served as Crystal’s sponsor in Narcotics Anonymous for three years and that she was “shocked when all this happened” because, in her opinion, Crystal was “not a drug addict.”', 'Ms. McLean, one of Crystal’s adult daughters, testified that she was not aware that her mother had ever used drugs, that she had “[n]ever been without food, clothes, anything,” and that she “fe[lt] good” about her mother.', 'C', 'The Trial Justice’s Decision', 'After reviewing the testimony and evidence, the trial justice concluded that, by clear and convincing evidence, DCYF had proven: (1) that James, Dalicia, and Dalilah had been in the legal care and custody of DCYF for at least twelve months; (2) that DCYF had made reasonable efforts to offer Crystal services to “correct the situation;” and (3) that, notwithstanding DCYF’s efforts, Crystal had “failed to address her parenting and substance abuse issues, as well as her need for mental health counseling.” The trial justice further found that terminating Crystal’s parental rights was in the best interests of the children.', 'The trial justice accepted some aspects of Crystal’s testimony as credible while rejecting others. Specifically, the trial justice found that there had been “a total of twelve DCYF case plans developed” to help Crystal reunify with the three children and that, even though Crystal had admitted to the allegations of neglect, she “did not cooperate with DCYF or with DCYF case plans” and had “made no progress with any of the case plan objectives.” Although the trial justice', '-8- acknowledged that Crystal had successfully completed the MAP substance abuse counseling program, she also observed that Crystal had tested positive for drugs while enrolled in that program and that “[t]he MAP program [had] not recommend[ed] reunification based on [Crystal’s] failure to comply with the program objectives and goals.” The trial justice rejected Crystal’s testimony that she had left certain DCYF-recommended programs voluntarily, finding instead that Crystal had been terminated from said programs due to her lack of progress. The trial justice further found that Crystal “did not comply with the recommendations of Dr. Parsons and Dr. Hirsch,” specifically referencing Dr. Parsons’s testimony that, if Crystal were unable to cooperate with the services he had recommended, “reunification would be harmful to the children.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)', 'In assessing the best interests of the children, the trial justice found that, at the time of trial, all three children had been placed in non-relative foster care and that each child was living in a pre-adoptive home. She added that “both twins ha[d] been placed in the same foster home, together, for most of their lives,” and that James had been in a separate foster home since September of 2013, where he was “doing really well.” Having found that there was “not a substantial probability that the children [would] be able to return safely to [Crystal’s] care within a reasonable period of time, considering their age[s] and their need[s] for a permanent home,” the trial justice concluded that it would be in the children’s best interests to terminate Crystal’s parental rights as to them “so that her three children may be adopted and provided with permanency.”', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We have long held that “[n]atural parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their child that does not evaporate if they are not model parents or', '-9- have lost temporary custody of their child.” In re Natalya C., 946 A.2d 198, 202 (R.I. 2008) (quoting In re Antonio G., 657 A.2d 1052, 1057 (R.I. 1995) (citing Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982))). We are mindful as well that the termination of parental rights is a “drastic and irreversible” measure and, as such, “due process requires that, before the state may terminate a parent’s rights in his or her children, the state must support its allegations by clear and convincing evidence.” In re Max M., 116 A.3d 185, 193 (R.I. 2015) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Bearing the just-referenced principles in mind, when reviewing a decision terminating parental rights, we “examine[] the record to determine whether legally competent evidence exists to support the findings of the trial justice.” In re Natalya C., 946 A.2d at 202. In doing so, “we (1) examine the trial justice’s finding of parental unfitness; (2) review the finding that reasonable efforts at reunification were made by the state agency charged with that duty; and (3) review the finding that termination is in the children’s best interests.” In re Max M., 116 A.3d at 193 (internal quotation marks omitted). And the trial justice’s findings “are accorded great weight on appeal and will not be disturbed unless it can be shown that they are clearly wrong or [that] the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'Crystal argues on appeal that the trial justice: (1) erred in admitting into evidence Dr. Hirsch’s report; (2) erred in admitting into evidence Crystal’s admission that she had been arrested for possession of marijuana; and (3) erred by overlooking Crystal’s compliance with DCYF’s case plans and recommendations when she found that DCYF had proved by clear and convincing evidence that Crystal was unfit to parent James, Dalicia, and Dalilah.', '- 10 -', 'Crystal first argues that the trial justice erred by admitting Dr. Hirsch’s report because Crystal interprets Rule 706(a) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence as providing, in her words, that “only the [c]ourt may appoint an expert;” she further observes that Dr. Hirsch was not appointed by the court. This argument is without merit. First, while Rule 706(a) provides that “[t]he court may appoint any expert witnesses,” nowhere does that rule state that only the court may appoint expert witnesses. Indeed, subsection (d) explicitly provides that “[n]othing in this rule limits the parties in calling expert witnesses of their own selection.” As such, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in admitting Dr. Hirsch’s report.', 'Crystal next argues that the trial justice erred when she admitted into evidence Crystal’s testimony about her arrest for possession of marijuana; she posits that Rule 609 of the Rules of Evidence was violated when DCYF failed to produce evidence that her arrest resulted in a conviction. This argument similarly lacks in merit. Rule 609(a) provides, in pertinent part: “For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that the witness has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted if elicited from the witness or established by public record.” (Emphasis added.) In the instant case, the trial justice expressly found that Crystal’s testimony about her arrest was elicited merely to refresh her recollection as to her prior encounters with DCYF and was not offered to attack her credibility. As such, it is our view that Rule 609 was not violated in this instance. Moreover, even if the testimony about the arrest were erroneously admitted, such error would have been harmless because the record reveals that, in rendering her decision, the trial justice did not rely upon the evidence of Crystal’s arrest; rather, she cited to numerous other indicators of Crystal’s parental unfitness.8 8', 'See, e.g., Guertin v. Guertin, 870 A.2d 1011, 1018 (R.I. 2005) (noting that, even where a trial justice has erroneously relied on improperly admitted evidence, such error is harmless if the trial justice “relied on ample evidence independent of [the improperly admitted evidence] to support her ultimate decision * * *”); Thibaudeau v. Thibaudeau, 947 A.2d 243, 247 (R.I. 2008)', '- 11 -', 'Crystal next argues that “her efforts to be reunited with her children by complying with the demands of DCYF were overlooked” by the trial justice. It is indeed a basic principle that, “before parental rights may be terminated, a specific finding of parental unfitness must be made.”9 In re Max M., 116 A.3d at 193. However, “a parent whose child is in the care of DCYF has an obligation (1) to maintain contact with the child and (2) to plan for the child’s future.” In re Rosalie H., 889 A.2d 199, 205 (R.I. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). As such, we have held that “a parent’s lack of interest in his or her child evidenced by an unwillingness to cooperate with DCYF services can be a basis for a finding of unfitness.” In re Max M., 116 A.3d at 194 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also In re Anthony M., 773 A.2d 878, 881 (R.I. 2001).', 'In the instant case, the trial justice made several specific findings to support her conclusion that Crystal was unfit to parent the children. For example, the trial justice found that, in spite of having been presented with twelve different case plans (four case plans for each child) between April of 2013 and October of 2015, Crystal “did not cooperate with DCYF or with DCYF case plans,” and “made no progress with any of the case plan objectives.” The trial justice further found that Crystal “denied” that she suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and refused to engage in mental health counseling due to the fact that, in the trial justice’s words, Crystal “felt she did not need any counseling.” The trial justice also observed that Crystal was discharged from a number (concluding that the hearing justice relied on sufficient evidence independent of an improperly admitted report and that, therefore, “[a]ny error in the hearing justice’s reference to the report was * * * harmless”). 9', 'We note that there are occasions when we are called upon to “review the finding that reasonable efforts at reunification were made by [DCYF]” and to “review the finding that termination is in the children’s best interests.” In re Max M., 116 A.3d 185, 193 (R.I. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, on appeal, Crystal has challenged neither the reasonableness of DCYF’s efforts at reunification nor the trial justice’s finding that the termination of parental rights was in the children’s best interests. Accordingly, as is our wont, we will limit our review to the issues properly raised on appeal. See Gianquitti v. Atwood Medical Associates, Ltd., 973 A.2d 580, 590-91 n.10 (R.I. 2009); see also Johnston v. Poulin, 844 A.2d 707, 710 n.3 (R.I. 2004).', '- 12 - of programs due to her failure to have complied with the requirements of those programs. Additionally, the trial justice found that Crystal had not seen any of her children since August 17, 2015 and “never petitioned the [c]ourt for visits to be reinitiated” after the visits were suspended in October of 2015.', 'Our review of the record reveals that there was ample legally competent evidence to support the trial justice’s finding that Crystal refused to cooperate with DCYF’s reunification efforts and that she did not make any meaningful effort to maintain contact with her children between her last visit on August 17, 2015 and the time of trial several months later. See In re Gabrielle D., 39 A.3d 655, 665 (R.I. 2012). We are further of the opinion that Crystal’s refusal to cooperate with the objectives of the case plans constitutes clear and convincing evidence of her lack of interest in her three children and, as such, could properly serve as a basis for a finding of parental unfitness. See In re Max M., 116 A.3d at 194.', 'Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence in finding that Crystal was unfit to parent her three children and that, therefore, the trial justice did not err when she terminated Crystal’s parental rights as to James, Dalicia, and Dalilah.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court terminating the parental rights of the respondent.

The petitioner, Tracey Barros, appeals from the May 20, 2015 judgment entered in accordance with a May 18, 2015 written decision of a justice1 in Providence County Superior Court denying his application for postconviction relief.', 'He contends on appeal that “indigent funding ought to have been provided, in the post conviction proceeding, to hire the proposed expert witness to demonstrate the availability of the issue of false confession and to establish trial counsel’s ineffectiveness in failing to utilize the available defense at trial.” It is further his contention on appeal that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel by both his trial counsel and his appellate counsel with respect to his original criminal case. Lastly, he avers that the justice should have recused himself from hearing the instant application for postconviction relief.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Since the same justice presided over both of Mr. Barros’s criminal trials and his application for postconviction relief, we refer to him throughout simply as “the justice.”', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel 2', 'On April 27, 2005, the body of Deivy Felipe was discovered on Althea Street in Providence, the decedent having suffered from multiple gunshot wounds. Later that year, in December of 2005, Mr. Barros was arrested for possession of a pistol without a license. After being interrogated by the Providence police and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, Mr. Barros ultimately confessed to the murder of Mr. Felipe. Mr. Barros was indicted by a grand jury on the following offenses: first-degree murder, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-23-1 and 11-23-2; conspiracy to commit murder, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-1-6 and 11-23-1; discharge of a firearm while committing a crime of violence, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(b)(3); and carrying a firearm without a license, in violation of § 11-47- 8(a). Prior to Mr. Barros’s first trial,3 he moved to suppress his confession, and that motion was denied after a hearing; prior to his second trial, he renewed his previously-made motion to suppress his confession, and the justice again determined that the confession could be admitted. On January 18, 2008, Mr. Barros was found guilty by a jury on all four counts charged against him. This Court affirmed his conviction in State v. Barros, 24 A.3d 1158 (R.I. 2011). We refer the interested reader to our opinion in that case for a more detailed recitation of the facts pertaining to Mr. Barros’s criminal case. 2', 'Several additional facts will be supplied in the “Analysis” portion of this opinion in order to provide further context for our discussion of petitioner’s various legal contentions. 3', 'A motion for a mistrial was granted in Mr. Barros’s first trial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. A second trial was then conducted.', '-2-', 'As to the postconviction relief action now before us, the docket sheet reflects the fact that a complaint was filed on October 6, 2011.4 Subsequently, on January 3, 2013, Mr. Barros filed his first amended petition for postconviction relief.5 He then amended his petition on two more occasions, ultimately filing a third amended petition for postconviction relief on June 11, 2014. The third amended petition for postconviction relief contained three counts of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for: (1) “failure to consider and present expert testimony in the area of false confessions” at Mr. Barros’s trial; (2) “failure to file a recusal motion” at Mr. Barros’s trial; and (3) failure to “attempt to elicit information from certain prospective jurors regarding potential predisposition against Barros as it relates to issues surrounding his alleged confession.” The third amended petition also contained one count of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel for “failure to raise the issue of undue limitation of voir dire * * *.”', 'Also pertinent to this appeal is the fact that, on May 24, 2012, Mr. Barros’s court- appointed attorney appeared before the justice and requested “funds to hire an expert on false confessions.” He argued that he wanted to hire an expert witness “to identify risk factors that might be involved or presented by Mr. Barros, and then to give * * * an opinion of whether this', '-- an expert would have been helpful in this case.” After a hearing was held with respect to that request, the justice denied the request for funds.

Mr. Barros’s trial counsel testified at the April 27, 2015 hearing, as did two public defenders who assisted Mr. Barros’s trial counsel at the second trial. On May 18, 2015, the justice issued a written decision denying Mr. Barros’s application for postconviction relief and declining to recuse himself. Mr. Barros filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Mr. Barros argues on appeal that the justice, in presiding over his application for postconviction relief, erred in denying his request for funds to hire an expert on false confessions. He further alleges that trial counsel at his criminal trial was ineffective for failing to present an expert on false confessions as a witness at his trial. Mr. Barros also posits that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion for the recusal of the justice at Mr. Barros’s second criminal trial and for failing to conduct an adequate voir dire at the second criminal trial. Additionally, Mr. Barros avers that his appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to “explore” what Mr. Barros categorizes as the improper limitation on voir dire by the justice and, consequently, for failing to raise that issue on appeal.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'The right to seek postconviction relief is a right provided by statute—G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1- 1—and is “available to a convicted defendant who contends that his original conviction or sentence violated rights afforded to him under the state or federal constitution.” Hazard v.

State, 945 A.2d 335, 337 (R.I. 2008).

We also bear in mind the principle that “a strong (albeit rebuttable) presumption exists that counsel’s performance was competent,” Page, 995 A.2d at 942 (internal quotation marks omitted), and that “counsel’s strategy and tactics fall within the range of reasonable professional assistance.” Knight v.

Request for Funds', 'On May 24, 2012, a hearing was held, at which Mr. Barros’s counsel requested “funds to hire an expert on false confessions” in order to advise counsel as to whether or not “an expert would have been helpful in this case.” An exchange ensued between counsel for both parties and the justice with respect to what Mr. Barros’s counsel contended would have been testified to by such an expert at trial and whether or not testimony of such an expert would have been admissible at the trial. Mr. Barros’s counsel stated:', '“I’m not asking, or I’m not looking for an expert to come in and say', 'Mr. Barros was telling the truth or lying when he made the', 'confession.

He held that, taking into account that he had been the trial justice in Mr. Barros’s criminal trial, he would not have permitted expert testimony on false confessions because “[c]redibility decisions are quintessentially issues for a jury.”', 'b. Final Hearing on the Application for Postconviction Relief', 'On April 27, 2015, at the final hearing on the instant application for postconviction relief, Mr. Barros presented multiple witnesses; we shall briefly address the pertinent portions of their testimony in turn.', 'Mr. Barros’s trial counsel, who was counsel at both of his criminal trials, testified first. It was his testimony that he never “consider[ed] * * * utilizing an expert in false confession[s]” despite being “familiar with that area of defense * * *.” On cross-examination, trial counsel stated that he was aware that the law was different from state to state on the question of whether an expert would be permitted to give such an opinion in court. However, trial counsel stated that he “never * * * considered whether or not [he] should hire an expert.” When he was asked the reason for his never having considered it, he stated:', '“I wondered, as I was reviewing my file in preparation for this', 'proceeding, why I didn’t do it and I -- I -- it’s really -- it’s', 'extraordinary for me, because we had a false confession seminar in', 'our office probably in 2005 or 2006 that I went to and I learned a', 'lot from it. And as I reviewed notes from that, from that file that I', 'made, I noticed now that there was -- I should have thought about', 'it. I should have called an expert witness. That was part of the false', 'confession seminar. I didn’t think about it at the time.” He further stated that he was “embarrassed” by his failure to consider using an expert on false confessions at Mr. Barros’s trial due to what he characterized as his inability “to prepare in such a short period of time.”', '-8-', 'The second attorney to testify at the hearing stated that she was employed by the public defender’s office and had been involved in representing Mr. Barros in connection with his second trial for the murder of Mr. Felipe; specifically, it was her testimony that she sat as “second chair” and that Mr. Barros’s trial counsel was “calling [the] shots.” It was her testimony that she was aware of the availability of expert witnesses on false confessions at the time of Mr. Barros’s second trial, but that she had no recollection of having a conversation with trial counsel about hiring an expert in false confessions to testify. She further stated, on redirect examination, that she was “not aware of this jurisdiction allowing the defense to call such an expert as of yet.”', 'The third attorney to testify at the April 27, 2015 hearing stated that he worked at the public defender’s office and that he was involved in Mr. Barros’s second trial. It was his testimony that his primary involvement was with the issue of the recording of confessions; he stated that he actually attended the trial only “maybe a day or two, perhaps more,” and did not sit at the counsel table. He stated that he had no recollection of having discussed the possibility of retaining an expert on false confessions with trial counsel.', 'c. The Decision of the Justice', 'Subsequent to the April 27, 2015 hearing, the justice issued a decision denying Mr. Barros’s application for postconviction relief.', 'In that decision, he answered the following question in the negative: “whether trial counsel’s omission to advance such expert testimony— when its admissibility was (and still is), at best, questionable—amounted to a constitutionally deficient misstep.” (Emphasis in original.) He specifically stated that, taking into account that he had been the trial justice, he would not have allowed the admission of an expert on false confessions; and he pointed out that Mr. Barros was “not hindered from explaining and challenging the reliability of his statements” and in fact had done so “through other witnesses on', '-9- direct and cross-examination, but also through his own testimony.” It was further the justice’s holding that “such an expert’s testimony ineluctably trespasses upon the jury’s quintessential function of determining the trustworthiness and reliability of the evidence.”', 'Finally, he concluded that “it [could] scarcely be said that trial counsel provided defective representation by not trying to wedge into the jury’s deliberations expert advice on how to evaluate Barros’ confession.”', 'Mr. Barros challenges that conclusion on appeal. He further challenges the denial of funding for the hiring of an expert witness on false confessions. He contends that the justice should have conducted a hearing pursuant to Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), before determining whether or not to permit funding. He refers specifically to what he describes as the “growing acceptance of the false confession expert testimony nationally,” and he states that the denial of funds “deprived the petitioner from developing the primary issue he had initially identified” for postconviction relief. In summation, Mr. Barros argues that the justice “ought to have allowed funding and an opportunity to build the [postconviction relief] case that false confession expert testimony could and should have been put to the instant jury and the failure to do so violated Strickland and was prejudicial in that it denied the jury insight into the phenomena which could have better informed their judgment especially give [sic] the paucity of other evidence of guilt.”', 'd. Discussion', 'In assessing Mr. Barros’s contentions on appeal with respect to expert testimony on false confessions, we initially deem it important to lay out with absolute clarity what is and what is not before the Court in the instant case: the truth or falsity of Mr. Barros’s confession, the voluntariness of his confession, and the justice’s denial of his motion to suppress the confession', '- 10 - are not before this Court. Those issues could have been, and indeed some of them were, raised by Mr. Barros in his direct appeal. We have already ruled on the issues raised in Mr. Barros’s direct appeal in Barros, 24 A.3d at 1158, and any issues that were not raised therein but could have been raised are barred from consideration by the doctrine of res judicata. See § 10-9.1-8 (“Any ground finally adjudicated or not so raised, or knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived in the proceeding that resulted in the conviction or sentence or in any other proceeding the applicant has taken to secure relief, may not be the basis for a subsequent application, unless the court finds that in the interest of justice the applicant should be permitted to assert such a ground for relief.”); Glassie v. Doucette, 159 A.3d 88, 95 (R.I. 2017) (“Res judicata makes a prior judgment in a civil action between the same parties conclusive with regard to any issues that were litigated in the prior action, or, that could have been presented and litigated therein.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see generally Bossian v. Anderson, 991 A.2d 1025, 1027 (R.I. 2010).', 'Accordingly, the only two questions properly before this Court in the instant action as it relates to expert testimony on false confessions are: (1) whether or not Mr. Barros’s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to utilize an expert witness on false confessions; and (2) whether or not the justice erred in refusing funds to hire such an expert in this postconviction relief action. In order to answer those questions, we need not pass upon whether or not the testimony of an expert witness on false confessions would have been admissible in Mr. Barros’s criminal trial. In our opinion, it is clear from the record in this case and from the silence of our jurisprudence concerning this issue that failure to call such an expert witness on false confessions in Mr. Barros’s criminal trial was not an error which rendered trial counsel ineffective.', '- 11 -', 'We reach that conclusion because it is clear that, at the time of trial, courts around the country were divided on the admissibility of such evidence and remain divided on its admissibility. See David A. Perez, The (In)Admissibility of False Confession Expert Testimony, 26 Touro L. Rev. 23, 24-25 (2010) (stating that “state and federal courts remain bitterly divided on the question of admissibility of false confession expert testimony” and citing cases on each side of the divide); see also Admissibility of Expert Testimony Regarding False Confessions, 11 A.L.R. 7th, Art. 6, §§ 13-27 (2016) (citing numerous cases from various jurisdictions allowing the admission of expert false confession testimony and numerous cases from other jurisdictions excluding such testimony). Mr. Barros’s postconviction relief counsel himself conceded, in his August 27, 2014 “Memorandum in Support of Petitioner’s Motion for Recusal and Third Amended Petit[io]n for Post-Conviction Relief,” that “the value and relevancy of false confession experts is an area untested in Rhode Island jurisprudence,” and he further conceded that “[c]ourts around the country are divided on the value of such evidence.”6 Even on appeal, Mr. Barros’s counsel refers to the “growing acceptance of the false confession expert testimony nationally.”', 'It is also important to bear in mind that this Court has never ruled on the admissibility vel non of such expert testimony.', 'In view of these circumstances, it would strain rationality to rule that an attorney was constitutionally ineffective for not introducing expert testimony on false confessions. Certainly under an objective standard of reasonableness, trial counsel need not have produced expert testimony that this state has never held to be admissible—and when courts around the country are divided as to its admissibility. See Page, 995 A.2d at 942. As such, Mr. Barros has not met 6', 'We do note that postconviction relief counsel also alleged in the memorandum that the “trend in this area appears to be heading toward admission of expert false confession testimony * * *.”', '- 12 - his burden of rebutting the “strong * * * presumption * * * that counsel’s performance was competent” by alleging that counsel should have introduced expert testimony whose admissibility was questionable at best. Id. at 943.', 'We would emphasize that, in evaluating an attorney’s performance under Strickland, our approach is to look at the legal landscape and what was known to the attorney at the time at issue. Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d 603, 606 (R.I. 2011) (noting that “[t]he United States Supreme Court stated in Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689, * * * that [a] fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel’s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel’s perspective at the time”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'However, in this case, even applying the hindsight available to us in view of the seven years that elapsed between Mr. Barros’s trial and the Superior Court’s decision on his application for postconviction relief, we would still be of the decided opinion that Mr. Barros’s trial counsel was not ineffective. It necessarily follows that, if it would not have been ineffective to fail to introduce expert testimony on false confessions due to the unsettled state of the law at the time this application for postconviction relief was denied in Superior Court, then it certainly could not have been ineffective assistance of counsel to have failed to do so at the time of Mr. Barros’s trial. Accordingly, we are in agreement with the justice’s determination that Mr. Barros’s trial counsel was not ineffective and that, therefore, his application for postconviction relief must be denied.', 'Additionally, for the just-discussed reasons, we are unable to perceive any error in the justice’s refusal to approve funding for the hiring of an expert witness on false confessions in this postconviction relief action. Such an expert simply was not necessary to determine this claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and we commend the justice for his conserving of meager state', '- 13 - resources in a situation where the requested expenditure would have been unnecessary. 7 And we remain unpersuaded by Mr. Barros’s contention that a hearing pursuant to Daubert, 509 U.S. at 579, was necessary in this case.', '2. Recusal of the Justice', 'On appeal, Mr. Barros contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to recuse the justice during the trial based on remarks which the justice made in the course of ruling on Mr. Barros’s motion to suppress his confession prior to his first trial. He further avers that the justice erred in failing to recuse himself with respect to the postconviction relief application. Mr. Barros bases his argument for recusal of the justice presiding over the application for postconviction relief on the same statements the justice made in ruling on the motion to suppress and statements made in ruling on the motion for a new trial following Mr. Barros’s second trial, which statements Mr. Barros contends illustrate a continuing bias.', 'In order to properly consider Mr. Barros’s contentions we must look, initially, at the comments by the justice with which Mr. Barros takes issue. Mr. Barros points to the following exchange during the ruling on the motion to suppress prior to Mr. Barros’s first trial:', '“THE COURT: * * * We come then to the issue as to', 'whether or not the defendant thereafter voluntarily, without police', 'coercion, compulsion or overreaching, offered to speak to the', 'officers freely and voluntarily. As [trial counsel] indicated', 'yesterday, we have a clearly demarcated line.', '“The officers all testified that at no time did this man speak', 'of a lawyer. The defendant testified that he did. But credibility', 'decisions have to be made. The defendant offered testimony that I', 'find not credible at all.', '“[TRIAL COUNSEL]: Judge, I hate to interrupt. Am I', 'going to be allowed to argue? 7', 'We do not mean to suggest that there may not be another case, arising in a different factual and procedural posture, where providing the funding for such an expert might be appropriate.', '- 14 -', '“THE COURT: I don’t think I need any argument. You can', 'offer comment when I’m done, if I’ve missed anything. If I’ve', 'missed a hole that needs to be plugged, you can bring it up.', '“I’m satisfied from what I’ve heard that the defendant lied', 'to me in certain respects, and those lies and mendacious statements', 'cast a very dim light on his credibility.” Mr. Barros further points to comments the justice made in the course of ruling on the motion to suppress to the effect that Mr. Barros was “Houdini” and a “lip-reader.” The justice stated that he found a portion of Mr. Barros’s testimony “incomprehensible;” he found another portion of the testimony to be “flat out prevarication.”', 'The justice further stated that Mr. Barros’s testimony at the motion to suppress hearing with respect to the recording of his confession was “an outrageous and blatant lie.”', 'Finally, Mr. Barros directs this Court’s attention to the following statement made by the justice in ruling on Mr. Barros’s motion for a new trial subsequent to his second trial: “I have referenced a number of comments that your client made that are absolutely simply disbelief.”', 'The justice held, in his written opinion denying Mr. Barros’s application for postconviction relief, that Mr. Barros had waived his right to seek recusal as to the application for postconviction relief because it was not until nearly two years after the first amended petition for postconviction relief was filed in the case that a recusal motion was made. He further held that, in ruling on Mr. Barros’s motion to suppress, he was “obligated to make definitive factual and credibility findings” in the “restricted confines of a suppression motion hearing * * *.” It was his ultimate holding that “[m]aking such determinations on the basis of facts at a pretrial proceeding does not * * * constitute a valid basis for recusal.” He went on to state:', '“All that occurred in this case was that the Court presided', 'at a suppression hearing, which Barros demanded be convened,', 'and offered a ruling on his motion—a ruling which was restricted', 'to the evidence at that hearing. The Court did precisely what it was', 'expected, nay, mandated to do: Determine who was credible and', '- 15 -', 'who was not; decide who told the truth and who didn’t. The Court', 'made those determinations. Recusal does not thereafter lie when a', 'court fulfills its judicial obligation.” (Emphasis in original.) Finally, the justice held that it was not ineffective assistance of counsel to have failed to move for recusal during trial because “there were no grounds for trial counsel to have urged this Court’s recusal;” and he added that Mr. Barros could “demonstrate no prejudice if the case had proceeded to trial before a different judge.”', 'In assessing Mr. Barros’s contentions, we look to our jurisprudence with respect to recusal. We have stated that “[a] judicial officer must recuse only if he is unable to render a fair or an impartial decision;” and we have also indicated that “justices have an equally great obligation not to disqualify themselves when there is no sound reason to do so.” State v. McWilliams, 47 A.3d 251, 260 (R.I. 2012) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 185 (R.I. 2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 955 (2008). The party who seeks to have a justice recuse himself or herself “bears the burden of establishing that the judicial officer possesses a personal bias or prejudice by reason of a preconceived or settled opinion of a character calculated to impair his [or her] impartiality seriously and to sway his [or her] judgment.” McWilliams, 47 A.3d at 260 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Mattatall v. State, 947 A.2d 896, 902 (R.I. 2008). In meeting his or her burden, a “defendant’s subjective feelings and unsupported accusations are not sufficient grounds for recusal.” State v. Sampson, 884 A.2d 399, 405 (R.I. 2005); see also State v. Clark, 423 A.2d 1151, 1158 (R.I. 1980).', 'Additionally, we have stated that “it is essential for us to review the justice’s comments * * * in the context in which they were spoken.” McWilliams, 47 A.3d at 260; see, e.g., State v. Howard, 23 A.3d 1133, 1137 (R.I. 2011) (The trial justice’s views, “even though', '- 16 - harshly and caustically expressed, would likely not have warranted the hearing justice’s recusal had he expressed them after he had fairly conducted the violation hearing and then adjudged defendant to be a violator of his probation or had he expressed them in the context of determining how much of defendant’s suspended sentence to remove.”) (emphasis in original). In making the statements that Mr. Barros points to on appeal, the justice was either: (1) announcing the credibility determinations which he was required to make before arriving at a decision on Mr. Barros’s motion to suppress his confession; or (2) was in the process of ruling on Mr. Barros’s motion for a new trial. As such, the statements made in the instant case, in the context in which they were made, certainly did not require recusal. In our view, there was no error in the justice’s ruling with respect to recusal. And we are unable to improve upon that justice’s pithy statement of principle: “Recusal does not * * * lie when a court fulfills its judicial obligation.” See McWilliams, 47 A.3d at 261-62 (“[T]hose comments [made by the justice] were * * * made in strict compliance with the justice’s duties in conducting the hearing. We have no hesitation in deciding that no reasonable observer would conclude that the trial justice was unable to render fair treatment in the later trial of this case.”); Mattatall, 947 A.2d at 903 (“We are in complete agreement with the hearing justice’s statement that ‘[r]ecusal does not thereafter lie simply because the court has carried out its judicial responsibility of explaining the reasons for', 'that', 'sentence.’', 'Rather', 'than', 'making', 'biased', 'or', 'prejudicial', 'statements', 'about applicant,[ ] * * * the hearing justice, in accordance with what this Court has encouraged judicial officers to do, was simply articulating his reasons for enhancing applicant’s sentence in accordance with the habitual offender statute.”). Indeed, it would be virtually antinomian for us to declare that, every time a trial justice ruled against a defendant with respect to a pretrial', '- 17 - motion or a motion for a new trial, said justice was required to recuse from any further proceedings involving that defendant. We have ample jurisprudence to the contrary.', 'In light of the foregoing considerations, we are unable to countenance Mr. Barros’s contention that his seasoned trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move for recusal after the justice’s ruling on Mr. Barros’s motion to suppress. Not having done so most certainly did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness, nor is there a reasonable probability that the making of such a motion would have led to a different result. See Page, 995 A.2d at 942. Furthermore, for all of the above-discussed reasons, the justice certainly need not have recused himself from presiding over the application for postconviction relief.', '3. Voir Dire', 'The petitioner alleged in his third amended petition for postconviction relief that his trial counsel was ineffective because he “failed to attempt to elicit information from certain prospective jurors regarding potential predisposition against Barros as it relates to issues surrounding his alleged confession.” On appeal, Mr. Barros presses that argument, averring that, “[a]lthough courts are reluctant to second-guess the decisions or performance of trial counsel, the woefully inadequate voir dire of the jury pool on the most critical issue at Barros’ trial was grossly ineffective.” He also contends that, after the interview of the initial group of prospective jurors, “out of the nine subsequently called prospective jurors, trial counsel only asked one person a question on the subject [of false confessions].”', 'We turn, therefore, to a review of the voir dire at Mr. Barros’s second criminal trial— specifically, to the portions of the voir dire pointed to by Mr. Barros. During the course of the voir dire, the following exchange occurred:', '“[TRIAL COUNSEL]: * * * There is nothing linking [Mr.', 'Barros] to the crime. The only evidence against Mr. Barros is the', '- 18 -', 'fact that he made a statement admitting to it. Now, [Juror], what do', 'you think about that?', '“A JUROR: Why would he make the statement if he didn’t', 'do it?', '“[TRIAL COUNSEL]: That’s a question that I have. The', 'question that many of you I’m sure have.', '“Now, you’re going to hear from [the trial justice] that you', 'have a duty to judge whether or not Tracey Barros has personally', 'and voluntarily given up his right to remain silent and make a', 'statement in this case, or whether or not it was coerced from him,', 'whether or not pressure was put on him in order to have him make', 'a statement. Now, [Juror], do you agree with me, sir, that a person', 'charged with a criminal offense could have pressure put on him in', 'order to force him to make a statement against his own interest?', '“A JUROR: Some people maybe; but I wouldn’t admit to', 'anything I didn’t do.', '“[TRIAL COUNSEL]: Okay. Anyone else feel like that?', '8', 'Okay.” Trial counsel then proceeded to relate some of the facts of the interrogation of Mr. Barros by the police in the instant case. When the just-referenced juror remained “steadfast in [his] belief,” trial counsel went into more detail with respect to the interrogation. As trial counsel was pointing to the fact that only the confession was taped and that “[we] don’t actually know what went on during” the interrogation, the prosecutor objected. The Court ruled as follows:', '“I’m going to sustain the objection. I’m not going to have the case', 'played out in a thumbnail fashion of factual renditions during voir', 'dire. Set forth in Rule 24, very specific and particular issues are the', 'subject of inquiry. This is not one of them.” After trial counsel resumed and another objection was quickly made and sustained, trial counsel asked the prospective jurors the following: “Can you all promise Tracey Barros that you will be able to look at everything that happened prior to him making this statement and how it came to be that he was interrogated for this charge? Can you all promise me that?” 8', 'The juror with whom trial counsel engaged in the above-quoted discussion was ultimately stricken from the jury panel by the prosecution.', '- 19 -', 'Trial counsel then asked a prospective juror later in the voir dire: “Do you believe that there could be pressure brought to bear on someone who makes a confession?” The justice then immediately stated: “I told you we’re not going to do that. That’s factual in nature. You’re not going to be heard in a vacuum.” We note additionally that trial counsel was later permitted to make the following inquiry of a juror:', '“[Y]ou heard the prosecutor ask you about whether or not a', 'confession would be enough, if you believed it, to have you return', 'a verdict of guilty. Would you promise the defendant that you', 'would look into the circumstances surrounding as well as the', 'contents of what the confession says as to whether or not you give', 'it any reliability? Could you do that?”', 'After reviewing the voir dire transcript, in presiding over the application for postconviction relief, the justice held that Mr. Barros’s criticisms of his trial counsel with respect to the voir dire were “wholly misplaced.” The justice specifically stated: “It was the Court, not Barros’ trial attorney, who refined the voir dire. No error can be assigned to trial counsel under such circumstances.” He further ruled as follows:', '“To the extent that this Court placed some restrictions on', 'trial counsel’s inquiry, those limitations were entirely consistent', 'with [precedent] and the purpose of Rule 24(a) [of the Superior', 'Court Rules of Criminal Procedure]. In any event, trial counsel was', 'allowed to make a completely fair and reasonable inquiry of the', 'jurors regarding Barros’ custodial statements, and he made entirely', 'clear to the panel that their assessment of the circumstances', 'surrounding those statements would be the centerpiece of his case.', 'Further, Barros was not in any way limited from that goal during a', 'thorough cross-examination of the State’s witnesses, his own', 'testimony, and during counsel’s closing argument.”', 'Rule 24(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure governs the examination of prospective jurors and provides in pertinent part that “[t]he examination of prospective jurors shall be for the purpose of determining whether a prospective juror is related to a party, or has any interest in the case, or has expressed or formed an opinion or is sensible of any bias or', '- 20 - prejudice therein.”', 'We have stated that, “[a]lthough the trial justice may not hinder the attorneys’ attempts to inquire into the objectivity of the prospective jurors, the scope of examination of prospective jurors during voir dire is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Lopez, 78 A.3d 773, 780 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Kaba, 798 A.2d 383, 389 (R.I. 2002). We have similarly made it clear that “[t]he exercise of [the trial justice’s] discretion does not mean that [the trial justice] must permit every question * * * that can be devised by an ingenious attorney.” Lopez, 78 A.3d at 780; see also Kaba, 798 A.2d at 390. Questioning during voir dire should certainly not be “argumentative, cumulative or tangential.” State v. Johnson, 119 R.I. 749, 759, 383 A.2d 1012, 1018 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Lopez, 78 A.3d at 780. It is also a basic principle that it is not the proper role of counsel to “try the case on voir dire, * * * attempt to elicit a commitment from the jurors about how they would react to hypothetical facts, [or] * * * seek to predispose any of the jurors to react a certain way to anticipated evidence.” State v. Holmquest, 243 S.W.3d 444, 451 (Mo. Ct. App. 2007); see also People v. Polk, 942 N.E.2d 44, 66 (Ill. App. Ct. 2010) (“The purpose of voir dire is to select an impartial jury, not to indoctrinate a jury or choose a jury with a predisposition.”).', 'It is incumbent upon us to determine whether or not Mr. Barros’s trial counsel was ineffective in his conducting of the voir dire at Mr. Barros’s second trial. After a careful review of the transcript of the voir dire, we can perceive nothing that would indicate that trial counsel was constitutionally deficient in the manner in which he conducted voir dire. It is true that the justice did limit some of trial counsel’s attempted questions to prospective jurors. However, in our view, those limitations were within the justice’s discretion. See Lopez, 78 A.3d at 780; Kaba, 798 A.2d at 389. Trial counsel’s questions were not limited solely to assessing the', '- 21 - objectivity of the prospective jurors and “[a] * * * court properly refuses questions designed to educate the jurors on the defendant’s theory of defense and ensure the selected jurors are receptive to that defense.” Polk, 942 N.E.2d at 66. We simply cannot say that failure to further contest the justice’s limiting of his questioning fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. See Page, 995 A.2d at 942. Nor could Mr. Barros possibly show that, but for trial counsel’s not further contesting the limitation imposed on his questioning of prospective jurors, the jury would have reached a different verdict. Id. at 943.', 'Moreover, we note that trial counsel was able to ask: “Can you all promise Tracey Barros that you will be able to look at everything that happened prior to him making this statement and how it came to be that he was interrogated for this charge? Can you all promise me that?” He also made it clear that the voluntariness of Mr. Barros’s confession would be at issue: “Now, you’re going to hear from [the trial justice] that you have a duty to judge whether or not Tracey Barros has personally and voluntarily given up his right to remain silent and make a statement in this case, or whether or not it was coerced from him, whether or not pressure was put on him in order to have him make a statement.” We acknowledge that trial counsel did not specifically ask each replacement juror a question with respect to false confessions. However, his questioning had been permissibly limited by the justice, and he frequently inquired of the replacement jurors if they had heard and understood his previous questions to the prospective jurors and whether or not they had any responses.', 'Accordingly, we can perceive no error in the justice’s denial of Mr. Barros’s application for postconviction relief on the issue of whether or not his trial counsel was ineffective in conducting the voir dire at the second criminal trial.', '- 22 -', 'B', 'Alleged Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel', 'Mr. Barros contends that his appellate counsel, who represented him on his direct appeal after his second criminal trial, was ineffective because she failed to “explore th[e] improper limit[ing]” by the justice of trial counsel’s questioning during voir dire. He points to the fact that she never ordered the transcript of the voir dire in the course of her review of the case.', 'At the April 27, 2015 final hearing on his application for postconviction relief, Mr. Barros’s counsel represented that he had “made the offer of proof” to the effect that he had discussed the case with Mr. Barros’s appellate counsel and that she represented to him that she met with trial counsel and “he never indicated to her that there were any issues in the voir dire that he believed merited explorations and that’s part of the reason she didn’t explore it.”', 'We have stated that the Strickland standard for reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel applies to appellate counsel as well as trial counsel.', 'Page, 995 A.2d at 943. Moreover, “for appellate counsel’s performance to pass muster under the Strickland test, appellate counsel need not (and should not) raise every nonfrivolous claim, but rather may select from among them in order to maximize the likelihood of success on appeal.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 288 (2000). Thus, to show that appellate counsel has been ineffective, “an applicant must demonstrate that the omitted issue was not only meritorious, but clearly stronger than those issues that actually were raised on appeal.” Page, 995 A.2d at 944 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In our opinion in Barros, 24 A.3d at 1163-81, this Court wrestled at length with the question of whether the police were required to record Mr. Barros’s entire interrogation (rather than recording just his confession itself) and with the issue of the voluntariness of that', '- 23 - confession. It is our considered judgment that the issue of the limits placed on trial counsel’s questions during voir dire certainly was not clearly stronger than the issues raised on appeal by appellate counsel.9 Moreover, as discussed above, there was no error in the justice’s limiting of trial counsel’s voir dire questioning. Accordingly, it is our opinion that the justice did not err in denying Mr. Barros’s application for postconviction relief based on ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.', 'As such, it is our conclusion that there was no error on the part of the justice in denying Mr. Barros’s application for postconviction relief, in denying his request for funds, or in refusing to recuse himself from presiding over the application for postconviction relief.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The plaintiff, Boghos Terzian, appeals from a June 12, 2015 final judgment entered following a bench decision in Providence County Superior Court granting the motions for summary judgment filed by the defendants, Laborers’ International Union of North America, AFL-CIO, Public Service Employees’ Local Union Number 1033 (the Union) and James J. Lombardi, in his capacity as Treasurer for the City of Providence. Mr. Terzian argues on appeal that the hearing justice erred in granting defendants’ motions for summary judgment because, he contends, the City of Providence could not suspend and ultimately terminate him for off-duty conduct and because the Union did not comply with its duty to fairly represent him.1', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'This appeal first came before this Court on February 8, 2017 pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of the parties and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we concluded that cause had been shown, and we assigned this case to the regular calendar for further briefing and argument.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Although it appears from the record that there are some disputed facts in the instant case, the essential facts are not in dispute. For our purposes, we need only relate those essential facts. We rely on the May 28, 2015 bench decision of the hearing justice as well as other documents contained in the record for the recitation thereof.', 'Mr. Terzian was hired by the City in 2003. At all times pertinent to this case, he was a member of the Union. On August 1, 2007, Mr. Terzian was arrested and charged with three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of carrying a pistol without a license. Those charges stemmed from an incident which transpired in front of Mr. Terzian’s home when he was off-duty. The City suspended Mr. Terzian without pay the next day—August 2, 2007. The collective bargaining agreement between the City and the Union (the CBA) provides for a three-step grievance procedure; additionally, it provides that if “a grievance is not settled, such grievance may at the request of the Union, be referred to [arbitration].” After Mr. Terzian’s suspension, a Union representative filed a grievance with respect to the suspension.', 'That grievance progressed through the three steps provided for by the CBA and was ultimately held in abeyance pending the outcome of the criminal charges against Mr. Terzian.', 'On May 12, 2008, a jury found Mr. Terzian guilty of all four criminal charges, and he was ultimately sentenced to eight years in prison, with one year to serve and seven years suspended with probation on each of the four charges, said sentences to be served concurrently.2 2', 'Mr. Terzian’s criminal convictions were vacated by this Court in State v. Terzian, 162 A.3d 1230, 1244 (R.I. 2017). That fact has no bearing on this appeal given our conclusion that Mr. Terzian has waived his appellate arguments in this case.', '-2- On October 16, 2008, following Mr. Terzian’s conviction and while he was incarcerated, a pre- termination hearing was conducted with respect to his job with the City. Mr. Terzian was not present at the hearing, but a Union representative and Mr. Terzian’s private attorney did appear at the hearing. Subsequent to that hearing, in a letter dated October 31, 2008, the City informed Mr. Terzian that his employment had been terminated; that letter cited his inability to “report to work and perform [his] job duties” as the reason for his termination.', 'Mr. Terzian contacted the Union in December of 2008, after he had been released from prison. On December 9, 2008,3 the Union filed a second grievance, this time contesting Mr. Terzian’s termination. The Union submitted the new grievance to all three steps in the grievance procedure, but it did not pursue either of Mr. Terzian’s grievances to arbitration.', 'On April 26, 2011, Mr. Terzian filed the present action against the City’s Treasurer and the Union, alleging that the City breached the CBA and violated G.L. 1956 § 28-7-13 and that the Union “failed to adequately represent plaintiff regarding his grievances on the suspension and termination of his employment.” The defendants each individually moved for summary judgment, with the City adopting the arguments articulated by the Union. On March 24, 2015, a hearing was conducted on those motions; thereafter, on May 28, 2015, the hearing justice issued a bench decision granting the motions for summary judgment of both defendants. On June 2, 2015, Mr. Terzian filed a notice of appeal. Final judgment was later entered on June 12, 2015.4 3', 'We note that December 9, 2008, was past the time allowed by the CBA for the filing of a grievance. 4', 'We note that Mr. Terzian’s appeal was filed prior to the entry of final judgment in the case.

The defendant, Leron Porter, is before the Supreme Court on appeal from a judgment of conviction after being found guilty of: (1) second-degree murder (count one); (2) discharging a weapon while committing a crime of violence (count two); and (3) possession of a firearm, having been previously convicted of a felony (count four). The trial justice denied the defendant’s motion for a new trial and, on March 6, 2014, sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment on count one, a consecutive term of life imprisonment on count two, and a consecutive term of ten years to serve on count four. The trial justice also declared the defendant to be a habitual offender and imposed an additional consecutive term of twenty- five years to serve, of which fifteen years must be served before he is eligible for parole.1', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she denied his motion for a new trial and refused to pass the case after a spectator’s outburst.

In May 2011, Debryonna Fortes (Debryonna) was residing in a multifamily building located at 17-19 Spruce Street in Providence, Rhode Island, along with Wendy Tallo (Wendy) and her two daughters, Ashley Tallo (Ashley) and Tiphany.', 'Debryonna’s boyfriend, Jermaine, and Ashley’s boyfriend, Brandon Crumady (Brandon), also were living in the same apartment.', 'On May 9, 2011, Ashley, Debryonna, Brandon, and Jermaine were heading to Oakland Beach in Warwick for the afternoon when they decided to make a brief stop at a store located on Atwells Avenue in Providence, during which Ashley ran into Danessa “Mooky” Porter (Mooky). Ashley and Mooky shared a strained and contentious relationship due to Mooky’s involvement with Ashley’s boyfriend Brandon. The two exchanged words; Mooky kicked Ashley, and Ashley responded by punching Mooky in the face and tearing her shirt. After this encounter, the parties retreated to their respective vehicles and left the area; the plan to visit Oakland Beach was abandoned, and Ashley and Debryonna returned to 19 Spruce Street, where a melee subsequently erupted, culminating in this homicide.', 'Once home, Ashley and Debryonna discussed the incident with Wendy and Tiphany. The four women then decided to join their neighbors, Sherissa and Kaleena Monroe, Loretta Gonzalez, and Ashley Turner (the neighbors), at a spot they frequented in the front of the building.', 'Two vehicles—one red and one black—appeared on Spruce Street, and headed 2', 'Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).', '-2- towards the apartment building. There were five persons in the red vehicle and three persons in the black vehicle; all were female except for a lone male, later identified as defendant, who is Mooky’s brother.', 'The vehicles stopped in front of a church on Spruce Street. Mooky immediately exited the red vehicle and approached Ashley in a loud and aggressive manner. Mooky cursed at Ashley and insulted Ashley’s son, while flaunting her sexual relationship with Brandon. Not to be outdone, Ashley charged toward Mooky and attempted to strike her, but was elbowed in the face by defendant. At this point a street fight between Ashley and Mooky ensued. Although there were no weapons, Ashley was outnumbered. According to the witnesses, as the fight progressed to the yard of the nearby church, Ashley had the best of Mooky, at which point Mooky’s compatriots joined the fray. The women produced two knives and a baseball bat that was enhanced with nails. Ashley was stabbed, beaten with the bat, kicked, and punched. At some point, defendant pulled a firearm from his waistband, causing Debryonna and Tiphany to move toward Ashley. Witnesses testified that as Debryonna and Tiphany began to run toward the fight, defendant raised his gun and fired the weapon in their direction. Immediately after, Tiphany placed her hand on her chest, began to retreat to the apartment building, and collapsed. According to Debryonna, defendant passed the gun to another female—Asia Porter—then ran to the red vehicle and fled the scene. The remaining participants followed in the second car. Tiphany was transported to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead. The manner of death was homicide. She was seventeen years old.', 'Providence Police Officer Ricardo Silva was the first officer to arrive on the scene; he responded within minutes of the shooting. Based on information he obtained from the witnesses, an alert including the vehicles, license plates, and the direction the vehicles traveled was', '-3- broadcast throughout the city. Detective Kris Poplakski (Det. Poplakski) and Detective Patrick Potter (Det. Potter) heard the broadcast for a “[r]ed Impala with out of state plates.”3 Shortly thereafter, the detectives saw a vehicle that matched the description pass directly in front of them on Pleasant Valley Parkway. The detectives stopped the vehicle and confronted one male driver and five female passengers.4 The male driver was identified as defendant; Mooky also was in the car.5 Detective Poplakski testified that defendant was sweating profusely, and the female passengers “couldn’t sit still, any of them. They were bouncing in the back seat nervously.” Detective Poplakski testified that he also found a purse, a dark navy blue Yankees baseball cap, and a wooden bat embedded with several nails. Within an hour of the homicide, multiple witnesses—most of whom were neighbors and eyewitnesses—identified defendant as the shooter.', 'The defendant was arrested and charged by indictment with the murder of Tiphany Tallo, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-23-1 and 11-23-2; discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, to wit, murder, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(b)(3); possession of a firearm, having been previously convicted of a crime of violence, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11- 47-5; and assault upon Ashley Tallo with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a firearm, in violation of 3', 'The license plate indicated that the red car had a Connecticut registration. 4', 'The second vehicle, described as a black Impala, was later found at the home of defendant’s mother’s goddaughter, Renee Sparfven (Sparfven).

However, by agreement not to prosecute her for obstruction, Sparfven changed her story and promised to tell the truth at trial.

The trial spanned more than seventeen days and the jury heard from eight eyewitnesses. On December 6, 2013, the jury declared defendant guilty of murder in the second degree and the two firearm offenses. The defendant was acquitted on the count charging him with assault with a dangerous weapon upon Ashley Tallo. He timely appealed.', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, defendant raises multiple issues.', 'First, defendant challenges his conviction based on two alleged Batson violations by the first justice when he permitted the state to exercise two peremptory challenges during the jury selection. The defendant further contends that the trial justice improperly restricted the cross-examination of a witness about a gun the witness saw at some point before the murder. Next, defendant argues that the trial justice abused her discretion by denying defendant’s motion to pass the case after an emotional outburst during the defense’s opening statement. Finally, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for a new trial. 6', 'The defendant was also charged with assault upon Wendy Tallo with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a firearm, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (count three); conspiracy to commit assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6 (count five); assault upon Ashley Tallo with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a knife, in violation of § 11-5-2 (count seven); assault upon Ashley Tallo with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a wooden club, in violation of § 11-5-2 (count eight); and assault upon Ashley Tallo with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a shod foot, in violation of § 11-5-2 (count nine). The state later dismissed these charges before trial, pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-5-', 'I', 'Batson Violations', 'During jury selection, the state exercised peremptory challenges to strike two prospective jurors: Juror 216, a juror of Hispanic descent, and Juror 103, an African American.', 'The defendant objected to both peremptory challenges, citing to Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986). The defendant now contends that the first trial justice erred by allowing the state to strike the two prospective minority jurors.', 'Included in the rights under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution is a guarantee “that the [s]tate will not exclude members of his [or her] race from the jury venire on account of race[.]” State v.

The United States Supreme Court, in Batson, established a tripartite test to determine whether a defendant has been deprived of this constitutional guarantee by a prosecutor’s wrongful exercise of a peremptory challenge. Batson, 476 U.S. at 96-98; see also Pona II, 66 A.3d at 472.', 'The first step in the three-prong Batson analysis requires that the defendant “establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination[.]” Pona II, 66 A.3d at 472 (quoting Pona I, 926 A.2d at 601); see also Batson, 476 U.S. at 96. A prima facie case of purposeful discrimination is based on the “totality of the relevant facts [which give] rise to an inference of discriminatory purpose.” Batson, 476 U.S. at 94. However, “[t]his step of the analysis will become moot if the trial justice moves beyond it to consider the second and third steps.” State v. Gallop, 89 A.3d 795, 805 (R.I. 2014); see also Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.S. 352, 359 (1991) (“Once a prosecutor has offered a race-neutral explanation for the peremptory challenges and the trial court has ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination, the preliminary issue of', '-6- whether the defendant had made a prima facie showing becomes moot.”); State v. Austin, 642 A.2d 673, 678 (R.I. 1994) (“Because the trial justice below similarly ruled on the ultimate question of intentional discrimination, we need not determine whether the exclusion from the jury of the only black person in the jury panel establishes a prima facie showing that the prosecutor exercised the state’s peremptory challenge on the basis of race. We instead need only determine whether the trial justice erred in accepting the prosecutor’s race-neutral reason for excluding the prospective juror.”).', 'Under the second step of the Batson test, the burden shifts to the prosecution to “articulate its race-neutral reason(s) for challenging that particular juror.” Pona II, 66 A.3d at 472 (quoting State v. Price, 706 A.2d 929, 935 (R.I. 1998)). The prosecutor cannot satisfy this burden by merely “denying that he [or she] had a discriminatory motive or [affirming] [his or her] good faith in making individual selections.” Pona I, 926 A.2d at 602 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Batson, 476 U.S. at 98). During the second step of a Batson analysis, “the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor’s explanation. Unless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor’s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race neutral.” Id. (quoting Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 360); see also Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 767-68 (1995) (“The second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible.”). Finally, the third step requires the trial justice “to determine whether the defendant has carried his or her burden of proving purposeful racial discrimination.” Pona II, 66 A.3d at 472 (quoting Price, 706 A.2d at 935). “There will seldom be much evidence bearing on that issue, and the best evidence often will be the demeanor of the attorney who exercises the challenge.” Pona I, 926 A.2d at 602 (quoting Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 365). This determination rests with the trial justice.', '-7-', 'Accordingly, “[t]he trial justice’s evaluation of the prosecutor’s state of mind is accorded great deference.” State v. Nichols, 155 A.3d 1180, 1191 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Pona II, 66 A.3d at 472).

Louisiana, 552 U.S. 472, 477 (2008)).', 'The state sought to remove Juror 216 because of the juror’s demeanor during the empaneling process. Although Juror 216 stated that she could be fair and impartial, it was the state’s position that she exhibited a general lack of interest in the proceedings; the prosecutor expressed concerns about the juror’s lack of attention and her failure to make eye contact during the voir dire. Specifically, the state explained:', '“[W]e have seen on continuous occasions where she has not made', 'eye contact specifically with me when I’m questioning her. Her', 'head is down when I’m questioning other jurors and with her, she’s', 'closing her eyes at times, and doesn’t appear to be paying', 'attention, specifically when I’m making inquiry of other jurors.”', 'Defense counsel objected to the state’s comments and argued that the state’s alleged race- neutral reason for requesting the dismissal of Juror 216 was not supported, nor did defense counsel share the same observations of the juror’s demeanor.', 'In contrast, the trial justice expressed similar concerns about Juror 216’s demeanor. The trial justice reasoned:', '“There have been occasions when I have noticed that [Juror 216’s]', 'eyes were closed. I can’t say that she was asleep. But [the state’s]', 'concern of her lack of attention and/or disinterest are things that I', 'find as credible commentary from him, and I have shared some of', 'those same observations, and I’m satisfied that the offering that he', 'has made to explain his reasons for dismissing a juror are not', 'pretextual, and that the juror is not being excused for ethnic', 'reasons at all * * *.”', 'Juror 103, an institutional attendant at the Eleanor Slater Hospital—a state hospital that cares for certain inmates from the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) as well as forensic', '-8- patients—also was challenged by the state. At the outset, after his number was drawn Juror 103 raised a sua sponte request for a sidebar with the trial justice, in order to express his concerns about potential retaliation that he could experience in the course of his employment, regardless of the jury’s verdict. Juror 103 stated:', '“We have forensic patients and behavioral patients * * * that', 'follow these cases * * * and word goes around. Being a juror is', 'public information. They’ll get information. * * * [W]e also, as I', 'said, have inmates from the ACI there. So chances are, regardless', 'which way [the verdict] goes, I can find myself subject of either', 'allegations or hostile treatment either from the staff or from', 'patients.”', 'Based on the concerns raised by Juror 103, the state subsequently exercised a peremptory challenge. In response, defendant’s counsel objected to the challenge, arguing that Juror 103 is an “articulate, well-defined, apparently, African male, who has indicated, without question, that he could be fair and impartial to both the State and to the defendant.” However, based on the circumstances and evidence before him, the trial justice granted the state’s peremptory challenge and excused Juror 103 from the panel. The trial justice reasoned:', '“[Juror 103], at the very outset when his name was called, declined', 'to take his seat in the jury box and immediately asked to come to', 'the bench, and his first comments to us clearly indicated that he', 'wanted to be excused. He * * * [d]oes not want to be here. He', 'explained to us the concerns he has that there will be some kind of', 'repercussion at the workplace, regardless of what the verdict is, the', 'result of the deliberations.', '“I also have a concern that this man’s explanations about his', 'workplace situation would be shared with other jurors. That’s', 'something that might inject into the deliberations * * *.”', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by granting the state’s peremptory challenges as to Jurors 216 and 103, and contends that the state failed to offer a valid race-neutral reason for challenging the two jurors. We begin our analysis by concluding that the', '-9- first prong of the Batson test has been met as to both Juror 216 and Juror 103, because the trial justice acknowledged that the jurors are of minority descent, considered the prosecution’s race- neutral reasons for each strike, and entertained defendant’s objections. Thus, “the preliminary issue of whether * * * defendant had made a prima facie showing [became] moot.” Austin, 642 A.2d at 678 (quoting Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 359).', 'To satisfy the second step of a Batson analysis, the state was required to proffer a race- neutral reason for its peremptory strike. See Pona II, 66 A.3d at 472. In the case of Juror 216, the state rested its peremptory challenge on the juror’s demeanor, which, the prosecutor contended, exhibited inattention and a general lack of interest in the proceedings. In regard to Juror 103, the prosecutor reasoned that a strike was necessary based on Juror 103’s concerns— raised at the outset—about potential retaliation he could face as a juror in this case. We have little difficulty concluding that the state’s reasoning for challenging both jurors qualifies as race- neutral and nonpretextual. In each instance, the challenge was “based on something other than the race of the juror.” Hernandez, 500 U.S. at 360. Thus, we find no error in the trial justice’s conclusion that the state’s explanation for each challenge could qualify as a race-neutral reason for excusing the juror.', 'Under the third step, the Court is tasked with determining whether the trial justice properly concluded that the race-neutral reasons for the strike did not amount to purposeful discrimination. As to Juror 216, this Court has previously held that the demeanor of a juror that impacts a juror’s interest and attentiveness is a valid race-neutral reason for a peremptory strike. See State v. Holley, 604 A.2d 772, 778 (R.I. 1992) (upholding the prosecutor’s peremptory strike based on the prosecutor’s concerns of the only black juror’s demeanor and ability to follow the trial justice’s instructions). Moreover, we note the trial justice’s statement that he made the same', '- 10 - observations of Juror 216’s demeanor as the prosecutor: “[t]here have been occasions when I have noticed that her eyes were closed * * *. [The prosecutor’s] concern of her lack of attention and/or disinterest are things that I find as credible commentary from him, and I have shared those same observations.” We see no error in the trial justice’s determination that the state’s reasoning was race-neutral, and we therefore conclude that his decision to excuse Juror 216 was proper.', 'We pause briefly to address defendant’s request that this Court conduct a comparative juror analysis. For the first time on appeal, defendant argues that the state’s demeanor-based challenge in regard to Juror 216 is racially discriminatory because, defendant posits, the other potential jurors during voir dire also appeared disinterested when they were not being directly questioned. Satisfying defendant’s request, however, would require this Court to overrule Pona I, a case in which we declined to consider a comparative juror analysis that was requested for the first time on appeal. Pona I, 926 A.2d at 609-10. We are not inclined to do so. Furthermore, the record before us does not permit such an analysis; other than a general comment about jurors looking disinterested when not being directly questioned, defendant did not offer any facts or observations to the trial justice to support his contention. Based on our well-settled raise-or- waive jurisprudence, we deem this argument waived. Id.', 'Finally, as to Juror 103, we similarly are persuaded that the state’s reasoning for challenging Juror 103 supports the trial justice’s finding that the stated reason was neither race- based nor pretextual. See Pona II, 66 A.3d at 473. This juror sua sponte requested a sidebar in order to discuss his concerns about potential retaliation at work regardless of the outcome of the trial.7 These concerns qualify as a race-neutral reason for a peremptory challenge. We afford the 7', 'We take a moment to note, however, that it would have been more appropriate for the trial justice, at this juncture, to have excused Juror 103 for cause. The juror clearly was concerned about retaliation at his place of employment, where during the ordinary course of business, he', '- 11 - trial justice great deference when evaluating the prosecution’s state of mind, and we perceive no error in his conclusion. Nichols, 155 A.3d at 1191. We therefore affirm the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s Batson claims as to Juror 216 and Juror 103.', 'II', 'Cross-Examination of Matthew Roy', 'The defendant next argues that the second trial justice erred when she precluded cross- examination of Matthew Roy (Roy), a witness to the melee, about a gun that his roommate had prior to the homicide. Roy had been living with a man named John Santos (Santos) in an apartment located in the same building as the decedent. Roy testified, outside the presence of the jury, that two days before the murder, Santos showed him a firearm and said that it was a .380- caliber semiautomatic. On the night of the murder, Roy and Santos witnessed the fight from the balcony of their apartment; however, there is not a scintilla of evidence that Roy, Santos, or Santos’s putative firearm were involved in the altercation.', 'The defense sought to cross-examine Roy about Santos’s weapon in order to inject a new defense theory into the case: that Santos’s firearm could have been used to murder Tiphany. The defense argued that Roy’s testimony was “clearly relevant, especially in light of the fact that * * * the [murder weapon was] not found” and because “the jury is under the impression that no other weapon was in that house[.]” The defendant argued that the testimony could help establish that a weapon was fired from the apartment building where Santos was at the time of the murder.8 encounters patients from the Adult Correctional Institutions and the forensic unit. The trial justice concluded that the juror had made more than one reason for not wanting to serve. These concerns were a sufficient basis for excusing this juror. 8', 'John Santos did not testify at trial.', '- 12 -', 'The trial justice excluded the evidence on the basis of Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. She acknowledged that there was inconsistent evidence as to the precise location of the decedent when she was shot, but she found that there was no evidence whatsoever that the firearm that Santos had on May 7, 2011, was available two days later, on May 9, 2011. The trial justice stated:', '“There’s no evidence whatsoever that [Santos] was involved in the', 'altercation that ended up causing [decedent] her life. There’s no', 'evidence whatsoever that would suggest any motive on the part of', 'Santos to fire his weapon on that day at anyone, whether it was', '[the decedent], the [d]efendant or any other person at the scene.”', 'Although this reasoning, standing alone, was sufficient to exclude this evidence, the trial justice also considered the testimony of Neil Clapperton (Clapperton), an expert in firearm and toolmark identification, who testified to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that the projectile could not have been discharged from a .380-caliber firearm, the type of weapon Santos allegedly told Roy he possessed.', 'Clapperton further testified that the firearm used in the altercation was a .45-caliber. The trial justice concluded:', '“The fact that there’s a total absence of evidence that [Santos] was', 'involved in the altercation or that he fired the weapon on May 9th', 'at her near the time [the decedent] was shot, and the expert', 'testimony that if it was a .380 it just was not a firearm used to kill', '[the decedent], and I considered all of that. The inconsistent', 'evidence as to her exact direction and location when she was shot', 'was substantially outweighed by the evidence that suggested that', 'the firearm seen by * * * Roy was not the firearm that shot her.', 'And coupled with the testimony of the medical examiner as to how', 'close the shooter was from [the decedent], there is no evidence that', 'the shooter could have been on the balcony, which would have', 'been where [Santos] would have been standing if at all.', '“So for all of these reasons, there’s no relevant evidence that the', 'firearm described by Roy was the firearm used to kill [the', 'decedent]. And if there was any relevant evidence on this point, it', 'is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,', 'confusion of the issues and misleading of the jury.”', '- 13 - On appeal before this Court, defendant asserts that the trial justice’s decision violated his right to confrontation by failing to allow him to cross-examine Roy. We disagree.', 'It is well established that a defendant’s entitlement to cross-examine the witnesses against him or her is an essential element of the due-process guarantees of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions and the right of confrontation; however, the “scope of cross-examination is not unlimited and the questioning is subject to the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Wright, 817 A.2d 600, 610 (R.I. 2003); see also State v. Manning, 973 A.2d 524, 530 (R.I. 2009); State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 621 (R.I. 2012). “Inquiries that are potentially misleading or irrelevant, that offer little or no probative value, or that exceed the scope of the direct examination are objectionable[,]” and may be restricted by the trial justice. Id.; see also State v. Brennan, 526 A.2d 483, 488 (R.I. 1987). “A trial justice’s exercise of discretion to limit the scope of cross-examination ‘is not reviewable except for clear abuse, and only if it constitutes prejudicial error.’” Lomba, 37 A.3d at 621 (quoting Wright, 817 A.2d at 610).', 'After careful review of the record, we conclude that the trial justice appropriately precluded inquiry of Roy about a firearm that he saw two days before the homicide, which was offered to inject the possibility that there was a second gun and another shooter at the scene. It is within the trial justice’s discretion to determine the relevance of the evidence before her and to balance any probative value of that evidence against the danger of confusing or misleading the jurors. See State v. Warner, 626 A.2d 205, 209 (R.I. 1993). In the case before us, defendant could not point to even a scintilla of evidence connecting this purported .380-caliber weapon that he saw on May 7, 2011, to the murder on May 9, 2011. We are satisfied that the trial justice properly performed the balancing test required by Rule 403, and are equally convinced that this evidence simply was not relevant to the issues at trial. We reiterate that an inquiry that is', '- 14 - determined to be irrelevant or misleading is appropriate grounds for exclusion. See Lomba, 37 A.3d at 621. Therefore, we affirm the trial justice’s decision to deny defendant’s request.', 'III', 'Motion to Pass', 'The defendant next contends that it was error for the second trial justice to deny defendant’s motion to pass the case after an emotional outburst from a spectator during the defense’s opening statement. In his opening statement, defense counsel stated:', '“Now, we know unfortunately that Tiphany Tallo died, and we', 'know she was shot with a gun that was never recovered. That is', 'the extent of what you will hear. The fact of the matter is that he', 'did not kill Tiphany.”', 'At that point, an unidentified spectator yelled out, “How’s that?” and repeated the outburst while the jury was being escorted out of the courtroom. The trial justice immediately excused the jury and excluded the unidentified man from the courtroom for the remainder of the trial. Defense counsel thereafter moved for a mistrial, which was denied. In her ruling, the trial justice reasoned that:', '“There was nothing about [defense counsel’s] opening statement', 'that was unusual or should have evoked an emotional outburst. It', 'was actually, the tone of [defense counsel’s] opening statement', 'was professional and really non-emotional. * * *', '“[T]he question becomes, was that one outburst, I think about four', 'words before I immediately had the jury removed, prejudicial to', 'the defendant to the extent that the defendant is now denied a fair', 'trial? * * * [T]his single outburst, regrettable as it is, was not so', 'prejudicial that the Court cannot cure it with an instruction and', 'continue with the trial.” The trial justice then issued a curative instruction to the jury that has not been challenged on appeal. Before this Court, defendant asserts that the emotional outburst negatively impacted the', '- 15 - jury’s first impression of the defendant and was prejudicial. It is defendant’s contention that the trial justice abused her discretion by denying his motion to pass this case. We disagree.', '“It is well settled that a decision to pass a case and declare a mistrial are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Dubois, 36 A.3d 191, 197 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d 984, 1007 (R.I. 2008)). This abuse-of-discretion standard obtains because “[t]he trial justice enjoys a ringside seat at the trial and therefore is in the best posture to determine whether a witness’s inappropriate remark [or action] has so inflamed the jurors that they no longer would be able to decide the case based on a calm and dispassionate evaluation of the evidence.” State v. Hie, 93 A.3d 963, 972 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Disla, 874 A.2d 190, 198 (R.I. 2005)). Therefore, “[t]he ruling of the trial justice * * * is accorded great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly wrong.”', 'Dubois, 36 A.3d at 197 (quoting Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 1007).', 'Immediately following the emotional outburst, which consisted of two remarks, the trial justice removed the jury from the courtroom; she admonished the spectators for the remainder of the trial and gave a curative instruction to the jury. The trial justice’s response was prudent, swift, and definite. For these reasons, coupled with the fact that the emotional outburst was made during the opening statement on the first day of a seventeen-day trial, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not clearly err in refusing to pass the case. We are not convinced that a member of the jury would even recall the remark or be influenced by a comment from a person who was excluded from the courtroom for the remainder of the trial. Thus, we affirm the trial justice’s ruling.', '- 16 -', 'IV', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'Lastly, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she denied his motion for a new trial. The defendant challenges the verdict on the weight of the evidence, contending that the evidence of “stippling”9 around the gunshot wound established that the shooter was several inches to a foot away from the decedent when the gun was fired and that there was no testimony that placed defendant in such close proximity to the decedent.10 The defendant asserts that it is irrelevant that witnesses saw defendant with a gun, if there was no evidence that he also was placed close to the decedent.', '“It is well settled that when reviewing a motion for a new trial, the trial justice must determine whether the evidence adduced at trial is sufficient for the jury to conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Phannavong, 21 A.3d 321, 324 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Peoples, 996 A.2d 660, 664 (R.I. 2010)). “The trial justice acts ‘as a thirteenth juror, exercising independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” Id. (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)). “If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” Id. at 324-25 (quoting Heredia, 10 A.3d at 9', '“[G]un powder marks consist of peppered-like, dotted bruises and/or abrasions. These lesions [are] called * * * “stippling” [and] are produced by grains of burnt and unburnt powder striking the skin.” 2 Cyril H. Wecht, Forensic Sciences § 25.04[a][iv] (Matthew Bender) (2017). (Emphasis added.) 10', 'During the hearing on the motion for a new trial, defendant also challenged two other legal rulings: (1) the failure to pass the case after Breona Porter allegedly was intimidated on social media by Ashley Tallo, which convinced her not to testify; and (2) the court’s exclusion of testimony concerning a police dispatch based on a second- or third-hand description of the shooter. However, before this Court, defendant concedes that these issues are not before the Court. The defendant therefore limits his appeal of the trial justice’s denial of his motion for new trial to the weight of the forensic evidence.', '- 17 - 446). “As long as ‘the trial justice has complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, his or her decision will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.’” Id. at 325 (quoting Peoples, 996 A.2d at 664).', 'In addressing the sufficiency of the evidence, the trial justice declared that had she been presiding without the assistance of a jury, she would have reached an identical conclusion. The trial justice acknowledged that the turbulent events that occurred on Spruce Street unfolded so quickly that it was unsurprising that there were “some inconsistencies concerning where people were standing or moving at various times[.]” However, the trial justice was persuaded by eight credible eyewitnesses who consistently identified or accurately described defendant and placed him at the scene.11 Further, there was abundant testimony that defendant was the lone male in the melee and the only person who brandished a gun, then fled in a red vehicle. Additionally, the trial justice found persuasive the testimony of Charles Catanese, M.D., the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on the decedent. Doctor Catanese determined that the decedent was shot at close range and that the barrel of the gun was within several inches to a foot away from her. The trial justice concluded that the evidence overwhelmingly favored a verdict of guilty for second-degree murder, and that the testimony of the eyewitnesses was consistent and credible, and supported the jury’s finding that defendant fired the fatal shot.', 'Based on our careful review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence, and that she was not clearly wrong. The eyewitness 11', 'At trial, Gian Benedetti, Heather Smith, Debryonna Fortes, Kaleena Monroe, Loretta Gonzalez, Theresa Palumbo, Christopher Smolenski, and Matthew Roy—all eyewitnesses to the incident—described defendant as a black male with braids wearing a white T-shirt and a hat.

Furthermore, Debryonna Fortes, Kaleena Monroe, Loretta Gonzalez, and Theresa Palumbo identified defendant shortly after the incident occurred.', '- 18 - testimony overwhelmingly established that the defendant was the only male involved in the incident and that it was the defendant who brandished a gun and fatally shot Tiphany Tallo, and then fled from the scene.', 'Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s decision denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

56,"ABC Building Corporation d/b/a Advanced : Building Concepts v. : Ropolo Family, LLC. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Ropolo Family, LLC, appeals from an order of the Superior Court that confirmed an arbitration award in favor of the plaintiff, ABC Building Corporation, and from a corresponding judgment of the Superior Court in favor of ABC and against Ropolo in the amount of $72,415, plus statutory interest in the amount of $7,086.24 through the date of the arbitration award, and post-award interest thereafter. Ropolo contends on appeal that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by (1) manifestly disregarding clear and unambiguous contractual language that should have precluded any award in favor of ABC, and (2) manifestly disregarding well-settled law by awarding ABC recovery in quasi-contract when a valid and enforceable contract was in existence. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral arguments, and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that', '-1- this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the order and judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'ABC and Ropolo entered into a contract for the construction of a restaurant in Newport. Sometime thereafter, a dispute arose regarding payment that Ropolo owed to ABC.', 'It is uncontroverted that, when it failed to receive full payment on the bills it submitted to Ropolo, ABC ceased work on the project. 1 The contract provided that the parties would submit their dispute to binding arbitration. They did, and, after significant discovery and protracted hearings, the arbitrator awarded $72,415 to ABC, plus $7,086.24 in interest. The arbitrator predicated his award on the following pertinent findings:', '“3.', 'I find that under the factual circumstances of this matter,', 'the Agreement and its General Conditions require payment', 'by [Ropolo] to [ABC] of the fair and reasonable value of', 'labor and materials supplied on the project.', '“4.', 'I find that [ABC’s] testimony, taken as a whole, was', 'sufficient and credible as to the fair and reasonable cost of', 'work, the reasonable necessity of the work, payment by', '[ABC] for the work, and [ABC’s] communication of the', 'same to [Ropolo].', '“***', '“8.', 'I find that [ABC] did not materially breach the', 'Agreement.” In rendering his award, the arbitrator decided that “[ABC] is entitled to recover from [Ropolo] under the contract and alternatively in quantum meruit * * *.”', 'ABC moved to confirm the arbitration award in the Superior Court. Ropolo objected to ABC’s motion to confirm and simultaneously moved to vacate the arbitration award. Ropolo 1', 'ABC characterizes its cessation of work on the project as its electing to terminate the contract pursuant to article 10 of the contract due to lack of payment by Ropolo. Ropolo characterizes ABC’s stoppage as a material breach of the contract.', '-2- argued that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded clear and unambiguous contractual language— specifically, § 7.1.4:', '“With each Application for Payment, the Construction Manager', 'shall submit payrolls, petty cash accounts, receipted invoices or', 'invoices with check vouchers attached, and any other evidence', 'required by the Owner or Architect to demonstrate that cash', 'disbursements already made by the Construction Manager on', 'account of the Cost of the Work equal or exceed progress', 'payments already received by the Construction Manager, less that', 'portion of those payments attributable to the Construction', 'Manager’s Fee, plus payrolls for the period covered by the present', 'Application for Payment.” This language, according to Ropolo, “required that ABC submit specific items with each [a]pplication for [p]ayment to substantiate each line item billed[,]” including documentation of payroll, receipted invoices, and evidence of prior payments made by the owner. This, Ropolo claimed, ABC failed to do. Ropolo asserted that much of the work for which ABC was seeking compensation related to intangible supervisory and management labor and that, because ABC had not submitted time sheets or other documentation, it was impossible for Ropolo to know if the work had actually been performed. Ropolo further averred that it had not received the requisite backup documentation for that work from ABC until after ABC initiated arbitration, and thus Ropolo considered itself justified in withholding payment to ABC. Furthermore, Ropolo argued, the arbitrator manifestly disregarded applicable law when he awarded ABC recovery in quantum meruit despite the existence of a valid, legally enforceable contract. Subsequently, ABC filed an objection to Ropolo’s motion to vacate the arbitration award, maintaining that it had provided sufficient substantiation for the bills it submitted to Ropolo, and that the arbitrator had so found.', 'On July 1, 2016, a hearing was held on the parties’ cross-motions to confirm and vacate the arbitration award. ABC explained that it was a general contractor hired by Ropolo “to do a', '-3- construction build-out of a new restaurant location in Newport.” However, ABC posited, a disagreement arose between the parties because Ropolo “was complaining about the progress and was disputing the invoices”; in response, ABC notified Ropolo that it was terminating their agreement. Thereafter, according to ABC, the arbitrator found that the documentation provided by ABC to Ropolo with the applications for payment was sufficient to substantiate those invoices, and, as such, ABC had not breached the contract by stopping work.', 'ABC next addressed the two arguments that had been raised by Ropolo as grounds for vacating the arbitration award. First, with respect to whether the arbitrator had disregarded the contract, ABC emphasized that the arbitrator, who had significant experience in this area of the law, had held multiple days of hearings, heard from witnesses involved in the dispute, and accepted lengthy post-arbitration memoranda from the parties addressing the very issues Ropolo was raising before the Superior Court. According to ABC, the arbitrator conducted a thorough review of the evidence before him and “clearly found that there [were] clear and unambiguous terms of the contract that supported [ABC’s] claim for breach of contract, that [ABC] had supplied sufficient evidence of those damages and was entitled to recover.”', 'Second, with respect to whether the arbitrator had disregarded the law when providing for recovery in quantum meruit as an alternative to a contract-based recovery, ABC asserted that the arbitrator did not misapply the law or make a mistake of law. But even if he had ruled that the elements of quasi-contract were satisfied, ABC argued, mere error of law is an insufficient basis for vacating an arbitration award. In light of the Superior Court’s limited review of arbitration awards pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-3-12, and given that the arbitrator had already examined and rejected the arguments raised by Ropolo, ABC maintained that the award should be confirmed.', '-4-', 'Ropolo disagreed. It first recognized the heavy burden it had to overcome in asking the Superior Court to vacate the arbitrator’s award. Nonetheless, Ropolo argued—as it had at arbitration—that ABC had not complied with § 7.1.4 of the contract by failing to submit backup documentation, in the form of payrolls or receipts, with its invoices to Ropolo. According to Ropolo, the arbitrator did not find that, under the contract, ABC had submitted sufficient documentation to Ropolo with each application for payment; in fact, the arbitrator did not find that substantiating documentation had been submitted to Ropolo at all. Rather, as Ropolo saw it, the arbitrator simply found “that [ABC’s] testimony, * * * taken as a whole, was sufficient and credible as to the fair and reasonable cost of the work”—language Ropolo characterized as sounding in quantum meruit. Ropolo thus maintained that the arbitrator based his award solely on the testimony at arbitration, and not on a finding that ABC had complied with § 7.1.4 before terminating the contract and initiating arbitration. 2', 'ABC countered that, in fact, the arbitrator had based his decision on the applications for payment and the corresponding time sheets, which ABC introduced into evidence at arbitration and which Ropolo had exhaustively examined. ABC conceded that the actual time sheets had not been submitted to Ropolo with the applications for payment during the course of the project. 3 Nevertheless, according to ABC, the applications for payment did indeed include summaries of the time spent on the project. Moreover, according to ABC, during the course of the project, Ropolo never once asked for the supporting time sheets; Ropolo simply began selectively paying ABC for some charges and not for others. It was not until ABC terminated the contract for such 2', 'In response to questioning by the hearing justice, Ropolo acknowledged that it had raised these very issues in its post-arbitration memorandum to the arbitrator. 3', 'The time sheets were produced during pre-arbitration discovery.', '-5- selective payments that Ropolo complained of a lack of substantiating documentation accompanying each application.', 'Following the parties’ arguments, the hearing justice rendered his decision. He, too, was impressed by the experience of the arbitrator in the field of contract law, and the hearing justice noted that it was the parties who selected that arbitrator to perform that role. The hearing justice expressed his reluctance to set aside the arbitrator’s award, especially where it had not been shown to be “clearly ambiguous, totally arbitrary, [or] otherwise unreasonable.” In addition, the hearing justice found that the arbitrator had performed his function by making findings of fact, “and based on that [the hearing justice would] sustain the arbitrator[’]s award.” Accordingly, the hearing justice confirmed the arbitration award and entered a judgment for the awarded amount of $72,415, plus statutory interest in the amount of $7,086.24 through the date of the arbitration award, as well as interest thereafter. Ropolo timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Rhode Island has a strong public policy in favor of the finality of arbitration awards.” Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC v. Bilray Demolition Co., Inc., 91 A.3d 830, 834 (R.I. 2014). In that light, “[t]o preserve the integrity and efficacy of arbitration proceedings, judicial review of arbitration awards is extremely limited.” Id. at 834-35. This “policy of finality is reflected in the limited grounds that the Legislature has delineated for vacating an arbitration award.” Id. at 835 (quoting Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Co. v. Flynn, 687 A.2d 440, 441 (R.I. 1996)).', 'In reviewing an arbitrator’s award, this Court, like the Superior Court, follows the Arbitration Act, codified at G.L. 1956 chapter 3 of title 10. “Section 10-3-12 sets forth the', '-6- narrow conditions pursuant to which an arbitration award must be vacated[.]” Atwood Health Properties, LLC v. Calson Construction Co., 111 A.3d 311, 314 (R.I. 2015). It provides, in pertinent part, that “the court must make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration * * * [w]here the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.” Section 10-3-12(4). “An arbitrator may exceed his or her authority by giving an interpretation that fails to draw its essence from the parties’ agreement, is not passably plausible, reaches an irrational result, or manifestly disregards a provision of the agreement.” Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC, 91 A.3d at 835. An arbitration award may also be vacated “when the arbitrator has manifestly disregarded the law.” Id. “[A] manifest disregard of the law requires something beyond and different from a mere error in the law or failure on the part of the arbitrator[ ] to understand or apply the law.” Id. at 836-37 (quoting City of East Providence v. International Association of Firefighters Local 850, 982 A.2d 1281, 1286 (R.I. 2009)). Rather, it “occurs when an arbitrator ‘understands and correctly articulates the law, but then proceeds to disregard it.’” Id. at 837 (quoting City of Cranston v. Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council Local 1033, 960 A.2d 529, 533 (R.I. 2008)).', 'At the same time, the General Assembly has also provided that “any party to the arbitration may apply to the [Superior Court] for an order confirming the award, and thereupon the court must grant the order confirming the award unless the award is vacated, * * * as prescribed in §[] 10-3-12 * * *.” Section 10-3-11. Thus, if none of the “narrow conditions” delineated in § 10-3-12—as this Court has interpreted them—are present, and if there has been no manifest disregard of the law, “[t]he statutory directive is clear: a reviewing justice must confirm the award * * *.” Wheeler v. Encompass Insurance Co., 66 A.3d 477, 480, 481 (R.I.', '-7- 2013) (emphasis added).

To that end, “[p]arties who have contractually agreed to accept arbitration as binding are not allowed to circumvent an award by coming to the courts and arguing that the arbitrators misconstrued the contract or misapplied the law.” Id. at 835 (quoting Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 687 A.2d at 441).', 'In our considered opinion, Ropolo is attempting to do just that. The company disagrees with the manner in which the arbitrator viewed and applied the contract between the parties, and it disagrees with the basis on which the arbitrator awarded recovery to ABC. However, neither', '-8- avenue by which Ropolo has sought to vacate the arbitration award—first in the Superior Court, and now before this Court—can afford Ropolo any relief.', 'First, we note that “review of an arbitration award does not permit ‘judicial re- examination’ of the relevant contractual language.” Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC, 91 A.3d at 837 (quoting Jacinto, 120 R.I. at 912, 391 A.2d at 1175). The arbitrator clearly was aware of and considered § 7.1.4 of the contract. In fact, Ropolo exploited the requirements of that provision extensively throughout the arbitration hearings and in its post-arbitration memorandum, relying on § 7.1.4 to argue for an award in its favor. Quite simply, Ropolo does not agree with the outcome that the arbitrator reached in the face of that contractual language. Despite the lack of an explicit reference to § 7.1.4 in the award, it is simply not appropriate for this Court to now hold—in hindsight, and contrary to our long-standing jurisprudence about the finality of arbitration awards—that the arbitrator “manifestly disregard[ed] [that] provision of the agreement.” Id. at 835.', 'In its argument to this Court, Ropolo relies on Nappa Construction Management, LLC v. Flynn, 152 A.3d 1128 (R.I. 2017), but, in our opinion, that case is inapposite. In Nappa, although the arbitrator faulted both parties for the delays in a construction project, he “effectively found [the contractor] to be in breach of contract” due to its subpar performance. Nappa Construction Management, LLC, 152 A.3d at 1133-34, 1135. Thus, under the terms of the contract, the owners had the right both to order the contractor to temporarily suspend construction and to withhold payment from the contractor until the problems were addressed. Id. at 1133-34. As a result, the arbitrator ruled, such nonpayment was not a justifiable cause for the contractor to terminate the contract. Id. at 1134, 1135. Nevertheless, in his efforts to craft what he believed to be a fair remedy given what he viewed as equally borne fault, the arbitrator “took', '-9- it upon himself to end the parties’ ‘combative, contentious, dysfunctional relationship’ by employing the fiction that the [owners] had terminated the contract ‘for convenience[,]’” as they were permitted to do under the agreement. Id. at 1134. We vacated the award, however, because, “[u]nder the parties’ agreement, a termination for convenience [could] be exercised only by the [owners] and completely in their discretion”—a right that the owners had not, in fact, exercised. Id. (emphasis added). Accordingly, a majority of this Court held that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by triggering that contractual provision himself; “[i]ndeed, the arbitrator’s interpretation [was] in direct contravention of the contractual language.” Id. at 1133, 1134. In contrast, the arbitrator here plainly found in his award that the contract “require[s] payment by [Ropolo] to [ABC]” based on his finding of “sufficient and credible [evidence] as to the fair and reasonable cost of work * * * and [ABC’s] communication of the same to [Ropolo].” (Emphasis added.) Consequently, we hold that the award “draw[s] its essence from the parties’ agreement,” including the contractual language and requirements of § 7.1.4. Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC, 91 A.3d at 835. As such, “[w]e believe the decision of the arbitrator * * * is sufficiently ‘grounded in the contract’ to be within the scope of his authority.” Jacinto, 120 R.I. at 913-14, 391 A.2d at 1176 (quoting United Steelworkers of America v. United States Gypsum Co., 492 F.2d 713, 731-32 (5th Cir. 1974)).', 'Second, “[t]he deference due to the arbitrator is such that an arbitrator’s mere error of law is insufficient grounds to vacate his award.” Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC, 91 A.3d at 836. Nor is a “failure on the part of the arbitrator[] to understand or apply the law” sufficient for vacation. Id. at 837 (quoting City of East Providence, 982 A.2d at 1286). Rather, a manifest disregard of the law—which “occurs when an arbitrator ‘understands and correctly articulates the law, but then proceeds to disregard it’”—is required for this Court to vacate an arbitrator’s', '- 10 - award. Id. (quoting City of Cranston, 960 A.2d at 533). According to Ropolo, the arbitrator did just that when he decided that “[ABC] is entitled to recover from [Ropolo] under the contract and alternatively in quantum meruit the total amount of $72,415.00[.]” (Emphasis added.) Because, as Ropolo sees it, neither party contests that there was a valid contract in existence, and because ABC materially breached the agreement when it stopped working on the project, ABC is precluded from recovering under a quasi-contract theory.', 'However, to accept that argument would require us to ignore the express finding by the arbitrator that “[ABC] did not materially breach the Agreement.” That, we cannot and will not do. It is clear to us that the arbitrator awarded ABC recovery under the contract itself; recovery in quantum meruit was merely an alternative basis.', 'It bears emphasizing that, “[i]n general, courts look with disfavor on efforts to overturn arbitration awards and thereby frustrate the arbitration process. Only in cases in which an award is so tainted by impropriety or irrationality that the integrity of the process is compromised should courts intervene.” Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 687 A.2d at 441. This is simply not such a case.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the order and judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be remanded to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Goldberg participated on the basis of the briefs.', '- 11 -', 'Justice Robinson, dissenting.', 'I respectfully dissent from the majority’s opinion affirming the grant of ABC Building Corporation’s (ABC) motion to confirm the arbitration award in this case. In my view, this Court should vacate that award. In ruminating on this case, I have been guided by the following eloquent statement of Justice William O. Douglas, writing for the United States Supreme Court in the case of United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960):', '“[An arbitrator] does not sit to dispense his own brand of industrial', 'justice. He may of course look for guidance from many sources,', 'yet his award is legitimate only so long as it draws its essence from', 'the [contract]. When the arbitrator’s words manifest an infidelity to', 'this obligation, courts have no choice but to refuse enforcement of', 'the award.” 1', 'In my judgment, Justice Douglas’s statement is entirely consistent with Rhode Island’s law with respect to arbitration awards. We have stated that an arbitrator is “confined to interpret the terms of the agreement [between the parties] so as to effectuate the intentions of the parties to the contract.” Rhode Island Council 94, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v. State, 714 A.2d 584, 588 (R.I. 1998). An arbitrator’s “broad authority to interpret the agreement between the parties and fashion an appropriate remedy is not unbridled. His or her authority is contractual in nature and is limited to the powers conferred in the parties’ [contractual agreement].” Nappa Construction Management, LLC v. Flynn, 152 A.3d 1128, 1133 (R.I. 2017) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'This Court “must make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration * * * [w]here the arbitrators exceeded their powers * * *.” G.L. 1956 § 10-3-12(4).

However, my unblinking view that the arbitration award should be vacated in this case is not the product of a mere disagreement with the arbitrator’s award. Rather, in my opinion, even keeping in mind the “extremely limited” standard of review that applies here, the award in this case failed to draw its essence from the contract between the parties and manifestly disregarded that contract. Nappa Construction Management, LLC, 152 A.3d at 1332-33. Accordingly, the just-cited precedent in this area of the law leads me ineluctably to the view that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and that the award in this case should be vacated. See § 10-3-12(4).', 'The arbitration award at issue in the instant case states that the contract required payment of the “fair and reasonable value of labor and materials supplied on the project” and that ABC’s testimony was “sufficient and credible” as to “the fair and reasonable cost” of the work done by ABC and as to ABC’s “communication of the same to [Ropolo Family, LLC].” However, the words “fair and reasonable” do not appear at all in the contract between the parties—neither literally nor in paraphrase. In my opinion, it strains credulity to suggest that the arbitration award in this case properly drew its essence from the contract between the parties when the', '- 13 - standard which the arbitrator asserted was required by the contract, and which he ultimately employed, does not exist in the contract at all. This Court has stated that, in Rhode Island, “[a]rbitration is a creature of the contract between the parties * * *.” Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 866 A.2d at 1247. It is clear to me that the arbitration award in the instant case most certainly was not a “creature of the contract.”', 'Moreover, the arbitrator was asked to resolve the debate between the parties over what documentation ABC was required to include with its bills when those bills were presented to Ropolo Family, LLC. Specifically, the application of § 7.1.4 of the agreement between the parties was at issue. Shockingly, however, nowhere in the arbitration award does the arbitrator even mention § 7.1.4, nor does he resolve the question of what backup documentation was required; the arbitrator simply states in an utterly conclusory manner that ABC did not materially breach the contract. That fact serves to confirm my view that, even viewing it through a generous and liberal lens, the arbitration award in this case was not based even loosely on the contract between the parties. See Rhode Island Council 94, 714 A.2d at 588 (stating that “an arbitration award not grounded in the contract between the parties * * * must be vacated”); see also Nappa Construction Management, LLC, 152 A.3d at 1132. In so stating, I consciously (albeit respectfully) place myself unequivocally at odds with the majority’s statement that “[d]espite the lack of an explicit reference to § 7.1.4 in the award, it is simply not appropriate for this Court to now hold—in hindsight, and contrary to our long-standing jurisprudence about the finality of arbitration awards—that the arbitrator ‘manifestly disregard[ed] [that] provision of the agreement.’” (quoting Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC v. Bilray Demolition Co., Inc., 91 A.3d 830, 835 (R.I. 2014)).

As the majority opinion in the instant case reflects, in Nappa Construction Management, LLC, 152 A.3d at 1134, as the basis for his award, the arbitrator at least sought to take refuge in actual language contained in a portion of the agreement between the parties. However, we found fault with the arbitration award because that portion of the agreement could be “exercised only by the [owners].” Id. In that case, the arbitrator at least based his award on a clause of the contract, however ill-advised his choice of contract clause may have been. Id. By contrast, in the instant case, the standard applied by the arbitrator does not exist anywhere in the contract. Accordingly, I firmly believe that my view with respect to the instant case is not at all inconsistent with this Court’s holding in Nappa Construction Management, LLC; indeed, as I mull over our holding in Nappa Construction Management, LLC, I consider the instant case to be an a fortiori instance of an arbitrator exceeding his or her power.', 'Consequently, while I acknowledge that there are understandable policy reasons for this Court’s practice of engaging in limited review of arbitration awards, it is nonetheless my view that this case represents one of the relatively rare situations where an arbitrator has exceeded his authority; for that reason, I am convinced that the arbitration award should be vacated.

57,Simeng Wu-Carter : v. : Thomas G.J. Carter. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Thomas Carter, appeals from a Family Court decision pending entry of final judgment following a divorce proceeding. The trial justice found the marital estate to be virtually nonexistent, with most of the disputed assets belonging solely to the plaintiff, Simeng Wu-Carter. Thomas disagrees with that finding; he argues that the trial justice erred in not identifying certain assets as marital property, which would have been subject to equitable distribution upon divorce. 1', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and vacate in part the 1', 'To avoid confusion, we refer to the parties by their first names. No disrespect is intended.', '-1- Family Court decision pending entry of final judgment, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'The Marriage and Its Dissolution', 'It appears that the short-lived marriage between Simeng and Thomas was doomed from “I do.” The couple met in the summer of 2012 via an online dating service. Just a few short months later, they planned to wed on October 20, 2012, on Cape Cod. Turmoil arose shortly before the wedding, however, when Thomas revealed to Simeng that, in fact, they could not be legally married at that time because his divorce from his third wife had yet to be finalized in California.', 'Not surprisingly, this fact caused Simeng, a Chinese citizen, significant distress. Her visa, allowing her to remain in the United States, was scheduled to expire in February 2013, and this surprising and unwelcome hitch in her plans to marry Thomas meant she would soon lose her status to remain lawfully in this country. According to Simeng, she “was deceived” by Thomas as to his legal ability to marry her. She testified that he had assured her that his lawyer would be able to backdate his divorce so that their wedding would result in a valid marriage. This apparently false assurance—further complicated by the fact that Simeng had already made arrangements for her parents to travel from China for the nuptials—led the two to go through with their planned wedding ceremony, even though it would not result in a legal marriage.', 'Eventually, on October 7, 2013, Simeng and Thomas were officially married in Rhode Island. It was at that point that Simeng and Thomas were able to move forward with an', '-2- application for Simeng’s temporary two-year green card. 2 There were two requirements for Simeng to obtain a green card: first, she had to be legally married to an American citizen, and second, her spouse had to sponsor her. By the time she submitted her application in December 2013, Simeng and Thomas were legally married. But other shortcomings relating to Thomas’s sponsorship caused delay.', 'For Thomas to have qualified as Simeng’s sponsor, there was a requirement that his income be 125 percent above the poverty line for the applicable family size to show that he could support her financially. At that time, Simeng was living with Thomas and his three minor children from his second marriage; the poverty line for a family of five in 2014 was $27,910. Accordingly, Thomas required $34,887 in income to qualify as Simeng’s sponsor. But he did not earn that amount, so Simeng and Thomas had to find another way to demonstrate his financial capacity to support her. One way to do so was to prove that Thomas had assets in his name totaling five times the difference between the above required income and his actual income. All told, this calculation amounted to $99,435 in assets. Unfortunately, Thomas did not meet that qualification either.', 'As a result, Simeng turned to her parents for help. Simeng’s parents agreed to wire- transfer $100,000 to her so that she could effectuate Thomas’s qualifying as her sponsor. By then, Simeng’s visa had expired; therefore, she was unable to open a bank account in her own name. For that reason, Thomas added Simeng’s name to his preexisting Bank of America account, and her parents wired the money (in two $50,000 payments) to Thomas and Simeng’s newly-joint bank account. Now, with a bank statement evidencing $100,000 in assets on hand, Thomas was able to prove that he had the requisite assets to qualify as his wife’s sponsor. 2', 'A green card, or “Permanent Resident Card,” allows a resident alien to live and work in the United States.', '-3-', 'Shortly thereafter, in April 2014, Simeng’s green card application was approved. She began working and immediately opened checking and savings accounts with Bank of America in her own name, into which she deposited her paychecks. Simeng also took $30,000 of the $100,000 that her parents had transferred to her and deposited it into her individual savings account; she deposited another $8,000 of that money into her checking account. She then wired the remaining $62,000 back to her parents’ Bank of China account. According to Simeng, Thomas was aware of these transfers from their joint bank account and he did not object.', 'However, the personal relationship between the couple had begun to unravel. By the spring of 2014, Simeng and Thomas were, in essence, leading separate lives. As Simeng explained it, Thomas and his children lived upstairs in the house, while she lived alone in the half-finished basement. She went upstairs only to use the bathroom; she bought a table, hot plate, couch, and toaster oven, and ate her meals in the basement next to the washing machine and dryer. Simeng testified that she paid all her own living expenses, including her car, gas, automobile insurance, health insurance, and groceries. On the other hand, Thomas testified that he paid for “[e]verything.” Simeng kept her money completely apart from Thomas’s, and she did not withdraw from or deposit into the joint bank account. Occasionally, Simeng said, she would give Thomas money if he had run out of funds, because he did not have a stable job. Thomas did receive monthly social security payments, which he deposited, along with any and all other income, into the joint bank account.', 'Simeng and Thomas each testified to myriad troubles plaguing their relationship. She said the troubles first began when she learned that Thomas’s divorce was not finalized. Yet even after they were actually married and Simeng had obtained her green card, she described enduring anger and jealousy from Thomas every time she left the house. That, according to Simeng, led to', '-4- verbal altercations as well as physical assaults at the hands of Thomas. She said that she never reported him to the police because of various threats that he made. Thomas, on the other hand, placed the blame on Simeng. No matter what the topic, he said, she would frequently have violent outbursts: “she scratched, she bit, she threw things, she smashed things, [and] she was verbally abusive.” Thomas described suffering emotional abuse from Simeng, who told him that he had to choose between her and his children. Simeng moved out of the marital domicile in November 2015.', 'On December 18, 2015, Simeng filed a complaint for divorce, citing irreconcilable differences between her and Thomas that had caused the irremediable breakdown of their marriage. On June 3, 2016, Thomas filed a counterclaim for divorce, citing the same grounds. In October 2016, a trial was held in the Family Court.', 'B', 'The Trial Justice’s Analysis', 'The trial justice issued a bench decision on October 31, 2016. She began by noting that “the main issue here seems to be the identification of certain assets and the determination as to whether * * * they are marital or nonmarital.” To that end, the trial justice first found that the legal marriage date was October 7, 2013. This was despite the testimony regarding the wedding ceremony and attempted marriage that had occurred in October 2012, because “both parties knew that they were not free to be married as [Thomas] was still married to his third wife at that time[,]” a marriage which did not legally end until August 2013. The trial justice then found that Simeng and Thomas separated in November 2015 due to irreconcilable differences in their lifestyles and in their goals for the marriage. With the relevant dates fixed, the trial justice proceeded to determine the marital estate.', '-5-', 'When she determined the marital estate, the trial justice listed all the parties’ assets that were in existence at the time of trial; she then analyzed them one by one to decide which should be characterized as marital or nonmarital. 3 In dispute was a 2008 BMW automobile that Simeng had purchased in the spring of 2013. The trial justice found that Simeng purchased the car with $16,000 that her parents had given to her as a gift prior to the marriage. The trial justice found that the car was registered in Simeng’s name alone, and “[i]t was for the most part for her exclusive use.” Accordingly, the trial justice concluded that the 2008 BMW was a nonmarital asset.', 'The “most significant” asset in dispute was the funds in the amount of $100,000 that Simeng’s parents had wire-transferred into her and Thomas’s joint Bank of America account during the marriage. The trial justice began her analysis of that asset by chronologically tracing the path of the money. On February 19, 2014, the money was wired to Thomas and Simeng’s joint checking account. That same day, the couple transferred it into a joint savings account and finally into a joint money-market account. The money remained in the joint money-market account from February 19, 2014, until May 5, 2014, during which time the parties were working with an attorney in an effort to satisfy the immigration requirements so that Simeng could obtain her green card. On May 5, Simeng transferred $30,000 of that money from the joint money- market account to a new individual savings account standing in her name, then transferred $8,000 of it to a checking account that she had opened individually. Two days later, Simeng wired the remaining $62,000 back to her parents’ bank account in China.', 'The trial justice noted that the money arrived from Simeng’s parents within days of Thomas and Simeng learning from their immigration attorney that their last option to fulfill the 3', 'We will discuss only those assets that are at issue on appeal.', '-6- green card application was to demonstrate that Thomas, as Simeng’s sponsor, had approximately $100,000 in assets. The trial justice accepted Simeng’s testimony that the money was a loan or gift from her parents that was intended to satisfy that requirement.', 'The trial justice also considered that matters had been further complicated by the fact that Simeng could not maintain her own bank account as a consequence of her immigration status at the time. Indeed, the trial justice found that that was the reason Simeng’s name was added to Thomas’s Bank of America account and why the money was transferred into that account. Thus, contrary to Thomas’s assertion, the trial justice found that the money was not a wedding gift to the couple from Simeng’s parents. After all, the trial justice emphasized, from the time the $100,000 was wired into the joint account until Simeng transferred it to her individual accounts and back to her parents, neither party ever spent a penny of it.', 'In sum, the trial justice concluded that “at all times the $16,000 premarital gift to [Simeng] [for the car] and the $100,000 gift to [Simeng] [for immigration purposes] during the marriage were never intended to be joint gifts, * * * nor at any point during the marriage did [Simeng] transmute these assets to become marital.” As such, the trial justice awarded Simeng her individual bank accounts and Thomas the remaining joint bank accounts. The trial justice decided that the only marital assets subject to equitable distribution were two boats, which had a combined value of $3,000. And because Simeng made no claim to the boats, the trial justice awarded the boats to Thomas despite the parties’ stipulation that any marital property should be divided equally.', 'The trial justice granted both the complaint and the counterclaim for divorce. She also denied Thomas’s request for counsel fees. On November 15, 2016, the trial justice entered a', '-7- decision pending entry of final judgment, which incorporated all findings, awards, and decisions made in her bench decision. It is from that decision that Thomas appeals. 4', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“When hearing an appeal from the Family Court, we have said that it is not our function to arrive at de novo findings and conclusions of fact based on the evidence presented at trial.” Curry v.

And because Simeng had no interest in receiving the boats or any money possibly derived therefrom, the trial justice awarded them to Thomas.', 'This award was notwithstanding the stipulated-to equal division of marital assets. As such, Thomas cannot claim to be aggrieved by receiving 100 percent of what the trial justice determined to be the marital estate. Moreover, given the parties’ stipulation, there was no need for the trial justice to engage in an analysis of each and every statutory factor to arrive at percentages for purposes of equitable distribution; the parties provided the 50 percent apportionment figure for her.', 'Thus, it is apparent that Thomas’s real quarrel lies with the trial justice’s determination as to whether certain assets constituted marital or nonmarital property. We will now proceed to analyze those claimed errors.', 'B', 'The Marital Estate', 'Thomas maintains that the trial justice erred in determining the marital estate. He asserts that the trial justice incorrectly identified two assets as nonmarital property: (1) Simeng’s bank accounts containing $57,500—$38,000 of which had been transferred from the parties’ joint money-market account; and (2) the value of Simeng’s 2008 BMW, which she had traded in to lease a new car. According to Thomas, the marital property was as follows: Simeng’s bank accounts ($57,500), Thomas’s bank accounts ($720), the Kelley Blue Book 6 value of the BMW ($10,000), and the boats (which he contended had no value). Therefore, Thomas claims, the total value of the marital estate was $68,220, of which he should have received $34,110 pursuant to the parties’ stipulation. 6', 'Kelley Blue Book is a reference book listing the prices of used cars. Consumers and retailers alike commonly refer to a car’s listed price as its “blue book” value.', '- 11 -', '1', 'The Car', 'During the pendency of the divorce proceedings, Simeng traded in her BMW as a down payment on the lease of a new car. 7 She received $6,000 for the trade. According to Thomas, however, the blue book value of the BMW was $10,000. He argues that the BMW was marital property, subject to equitable distribution, and that, because Simeng traded in the car for less than full value, he is entitled to half its value when she traded it in as part of the transaction for the leased vehicle.', 'The trial justice found that the car was purchased by Simeng with money that her parents had gifted to her alone in the spring of 2013—before the marriage. Despite Thomas’s assertion to the contrary, the $16,000 from Simeng’s parents that she put toward the purchase price of the car was not a wedding gift, the trial justice declared. Simeng testified that the vehicle cost $19,788.48 and that she paid the difference between that price and the amount her parents had given her. She also conceded that Thomas paid a $300 deposit for the car, as well as the sales tax and registration fee totaling $1,414.48. Nevertheless, Simeng maintained that the car was registered in her name only and that Thomas had his own vehicle, exclusive to him. Thomas, meanwhile, testified that he paid for the insurance on the car and that he had cashed out an annuity to do so. For those reasons, Thomas argues that the 2008 BMW was marital property that was subject to equitable distribution. And, because the car was supposedly worth $10,000 when Simeng traded it in for $6,000, he believes he is entitled to half its actual value. 7', 'The trial justice noted that, technically, Simeng had violated an automatic court order when she sold the BMW after the divorce proceedings had been initiated. Nevertheless, because the trial justice found the car to be a nonmarital asset, she characterized Simeng’s violation as harmless.', '- 12 -', 'Yet, quibbling over the value of the vehicle is putting the cart before the horse. Thomas would first have us find that the trial justice erred in determining that the car was a nonmarital asset. Deferring, as we must, to the trial justice’s findings of fact, we simply cannot do as Thomas asks. The trial justice found that the money used to purchase the car was not a wedding gift to both parties, but rather a gift to Simeng for the purpose of buying the car; that the car was purchased and registered to Simeng before the parties were married; and that the car was used almost exclusively by Simeng. We perceive no error in the determination by the trial justice that the 2008 BMW was not marital property subject to equitable distribution upon divorce. We have explained that', '“§ 15-5-16.1(b) prohibits the trial justice ‘from assigning three', 'categories of property’: (1) ‘property * * * held by the party prior', 'to the marriage’; (2) ‘property or an interest in property which has', 'been transferred to one of the parties by inheritance before, during,', 'or after the term of the marriage’; and (3) ‘property or an interest', 'in property which has been transferred to one of the parties by gift', 'from a third party before, during, or after the term of the', 'marriage.’” Curry, 987 A.2d at 238 (quoting Ruffel, 900 A.2d at', '1187); see § 15-5-16.1(b). The car falls squarely within the first category because, based on the trial justice’s findings, it was property held by Simeng prior to the marriage. Thus it was nonmarital property, and the trial justice was prohibited from assigning any interest therein to Thomas.', '2', 'The Bank Accounts', 'As soon as Simeng obtained her green card, she opened bank accounts of her own. Into those accounts she began depositing her paychecks. She also transferred to her own accounts $38,000 of the $100,000 that her parents had wired to the joint Bank of America account. Thomas asserts that the $100,000 was a wedding gift, as evidenced by its initial presence in the', '- 13 - joint account. Therefore, he claims entitlement to half of the $57,500 contained in Simeng’s individual bank accounts, which includes funds derived from her income earned during the marriage and the $38,000 from that purported wedding gift. 8 Thomas argues that the trial justice erred by not including the money in those accounts in the marital estate.', 'At issue, then, is whether the trial justice erroneously identified the $100,000 transferred to the joint account by Simeng’s parents as nonmarital property. The trial justice found that Simeng’s parents transferred the money to the joint account for the sole purpose of assisting Simeng to satisfy the pertinent immigration requirements. Indeed, as the trial justice detailed, the timing of the wire transfer was perfectly in sync with Simeng and Thomas’s receipt of correspondence from their immigration attorney advising them that they needed to show possession of assets worth precisely that amount. The trial justice further found that none of the $100,000 was alienated by either Thomas or Simeng. The first time that either of them touched the money was when Simeng moved all of it out of the joint money-market account—transfers, the trial justice found, that Thomas never questioned and to which he lodged no objection. Based on those facts, the trial justice ultimately found that, despite the placement of the $100,000 in the joint account, there was never an intent, by either Simeng’s parents or Simeng herself, to make the money marital property, and there was never any transmutation of the funds into marital property. Accordingly, the trial justice determined that the $100,000 was a gift during the marriage to Simeng alone, and hence it was nonmarital property.', 'This Court has had occasion to discuss the effect of one spouse’s intent on the classification of a piece of property as marital or nonmarital. In Stephenson, we examined whether a husband’s adding his wife’s name to his preexisting bank accounts, thereby creating 8', 'Thomas makes no claim to the remaining $62,000, which Simeng had already wired to her parents’ bank account in China.', '- 14 - joint accounts, automatically converted those accounts to marital property. Stephenson, 811 A.2d at 1141-43. The trial justice had made explicit findings that the husband was the sole source of the funding of the accounts; that the only activity on the accounts during the marriage was the addition of the wife’s name and the posting of interest by the bank; that the husband credibly testified that he did not intend to give his wife any present interest in the accounts and that he merely added her name for convenience and for estate planning purposes; and that the husband did not intend to give his wife a gift or make her a co-owner of the accounts. Id. at 1142-43. Yet, the trial justice determined that the act of adding the wife’s name to the accounts in and of itself rendered the resulting joint bank accounts part of the marital estate. Id. at 1142. Along those lines, we discussed the doctrine of transmutation, whereby “property can be converted from nonmarital property into marital property if changed in form and put into joint names.” Id. (quoting Cloutier v. Cloutier, 567 A.2d 1131, 1132 (R.I. 1989)); see also Quinn, 512 A.2d at 852. Nevertheless, we cited Mitchell v. Mitchell, 756 A.2d 179 (R.I. 2000), for the proposition that “[w]hile both parties are still alive, * * * the existence of a joint bank account only gives rise to a rebuttable presumption of an intent to make a gift of a joint interest therein * * *.” Stephenson, 811 A.2d at 1143 (quoting Mitchell, 756 A.2d at 182). We therefore held that “[b]ecause the trial justice specifically found that [the husband] did not have the requisite intent to create for [his wife] any present possessory interest in the joint accounts,” the trial justice erred by “then find[ing] that the contested joint accounts had transmuted into marital property by operation of law.” Id.', 'The trial justice in this case made near-identical factual findings. We agree with her conclusion that there was no transmutation of the monetary gift to Simeng into marital property. See Stephenson, 811 A.2d at 1142. Plainly, the trial justice found, the $100,000 was not a', '- 15 - wedding gift to both parties, and there was never an intent for Thomas to have any interest in or right to the money. See Quinn, 512 A.2d at 852 (“The doctrine [of transmutation], which represents an application of the presumption-of-gift principle * * *, refers to a change in character of property from separate to marital by an exercise of an actual intention objectively manifested. * * * A transfer of nonmarital assets from one spouse to both spouses jointly, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, will be understood as evincing an intention to transfer the property to the marital estate.” (Emphasis added.)). Indeed, in this case the trial justice found “by clear and convincing evidence that there was no intent for [the money] to be a marital asset.” Again, deferring to the trial justice’s findings, we perceive no error in her determination that the $100,000 wired by Simeng’s parents into the joint account was nonmarital property. It clearly was “property * * * transferred to one of the parties by gift from a third party * * * during * * * the term of the marriage.” Section 15-5-16.1(b). In our opinion, the trial justice was correct in not assigning any interest in that money to Thomas upon divorce because it was nonmarital property not subject to equitable distribution. See Curry, 987 A.2d at 238.', 'Our review of the record, however, leads us to the conclusion that the same cannot be said about the remaining funds, stated to be $19,500, in Simeng’s individual bank accounts. The trial justice likewise found that, “although both [Simeng] and [Thomas] had bank accounts, and any income that they had flowing into these accounts are technically marital assets,” the money held in those accounts was meant to remain nonmarital property. (Emphasis added.) This was so because Simeng and Thomas, the trial justice found, “always kept separate accounts” and “always paid their own bills out of their own accounts[,]” thereby evincing a clear “intent to keep the accounts separate and distinguished.” Accordingly, the trial justice excluded the rest of the money in Simeng’s individual bank accounts from the marital estate.', '- 16 -', 'But, in our opinion, that $19,500 was not just “technically” a marital asset—it was in fact a marital asset. It is true that property that one spouse alone receives from a third party via gift or inheritance during the marriage, unless somehow transmuted, is properly classified as nonmarital property under § 15-5-16.1(b). Otherwise, in accordance with the partnership theory of marriage, assets that one spouse acquires while married are subject to equitable distribution upon divorce. D’Agostino v. D’Agostino, 463 A.2d 200, 203 (R.I. 1983). In other words, property acquired during a marriage is part of the marital estate unless specifically excluded by § 15-5-16.1(b). Vanni v. Vanni, 535 A.2d 1268, 1270 (R.I. 1988).', 'Here, the $19,500 in Simeng’s bank accounts—money that was neither gifted nor loaned to her by her parents—necessarily must have been acquired during the marriage, as she could not, and did not, open the accounts until she obtained her green card. Based on Simeng’s testimony and the trial justice’s findings, it is clear that Simeng’s income was the source of that money. Simeng’s intent to keep the income that she earned from her employment separate and apart from Thomas’s finances has no bearing on its classification as marital property. Spousal intent matters only in determining whether assets have been transmuted from nonmarital to marital property, and not the opposite. See Quinn, 512 A.2d at 852. Because, after excluding the $38,000 from the marital estate, the $19,500 remaining in Simeng’s individual bank accounts was a marital asset, it should have been distributed in accordance with the parties’ stipulation. We therefore remand for the Family Court to do so. 9 9', 'On remand, consistent with our above holding, the trial justice shall also distribute pursuant to the parties’ stipulation any money in Thomas’s bank accounts that is determined to be marital property. However, because Simeng already has eschewed any interest in the two boats, they need not be revisited.', '- 17 -', 'C', 'Counsel Fees', 'Thomas also requested counsel fees, and the trial justice addressed that request after assigning the property. “Pursuant to § 15-5-16, the Family Court has the authority to order one spouse to pay the counsel fees of the other spouse.” Quinn, 512 A.2d at 854; see § 15-5-16. Section 15-5-16(b) sets forth certain factors that a trial justice is required to consider in deciding whether, and in what amount, to order one spouse to pay counsel fees to the other. Thomas argues before this Court that the trial justice did not address those statutory factors.', 'In developing that argument, however, he then frames the issue as simply this: the trial justice’s decision misconstrued the marital estate, leaving him unable to pay his legal fees, and if this Court does not reverse what he deems to be an inequitable distribution of assets, Simeng should be required to contribute to his counsel fees.', 'There is no need to engage in those mental gymnastics. It is abundantly clear from the record that the trial justice did in fact consider and expressly address the factors enumerated in § 15-5-16(b). It is clear from the record that she began her discussion of Thomas’s request by listing those requisite factors. She then applied them to the facts of the instant case, placing emphasis on the short duration of the marriage and the fact that no children were born of the union. Moreover, the trial justice considered that each party was admittedly self-supporting, and that they had led completely separate financial lives throughout the term of the marriage. She discussed the fact that Thomas had supported his children from previous marriages on his own both before and during his marriage to Simeng. Thomas also had a paucity of expenses because', '- 18 - his mother owned the house in which he and his minor children lived, rent-free. We need delve no further; the trial justice did not err in denying Thomas’s request for counsel fees. 10', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated above, we affirm in part and vacate in part the Family Court decision pending entry of final judgment, and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. The record shall be remanded to the Family Court. 10', 'If anything, we pause only to add that the trial justice believed it was Thomas who “unnecessarily delayed” the case for nearly a year, causing not only himself to incur needless legal expenses, but Simeng as well.', '- 19 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'Simeng Wu-Carter v.

This matter came before the Supreme Court on February 15, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, the Superior Court’s judgment is affirmed.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case derives from a dispute between the New Shoreham town council and plaintiffs.1 On June 6, 2016, the town council held a meeting to consider the prospective purchase of two- thirds of the shares of BIPCO for $1.8 million. Three members of the town council voted in 1', 'We recite these facts as they appear in plaintiffs’ complaint.', '1 favor of authorizing the execution of the Stock Purchase Agreement (the agreement). However, two members dissented.', 'Nevertheless, in early July 2016,2 the town executed the agreement memorializing the sale. Thereafter, on July 16, 2016, counsel for the town wrote to the Division of Public Utilities and Carriers (the division) requesting an opinion from the division as to whether any approvals were required by the division before the town could purchase a majority share of stock in BIPCO. The division responded on July 22, 2016, informing counsel that the division’s approval was not required because the transaction was not between public utilities and, further, the division declined to exercise its discretionary authority to review the transaction. Three months later, during a September 26, 2016 financial town meeting, voters authorized the town treasurer to issue the funds in consideration of the stock.', 'Discontented with the outcome of the financial meeting, especially as it pertained to environmental concerns, on October 18, 2016, plaintiffs filed a motion in the Superior Court seeking to enjoin the closing of the stock sale. Subsequent to that filing, on October 24, 2016, plaintiffs filed a complaint in which they enumerated three grievances against the town: (1) the town’s actions were ultra vires; (2) the agreement was voidable by operation of law; and (3) equitable estoppel should be applied. In their complaint, plaintiffs requested that the Superior Court “enjoin[] the closing of the transaction,” as well as “any other such relief [the court saw] fit to grant, until such time as a full, independent, public hearing can be conducted by the Public Utilities Commission pursuant to RIGL 39-1-38[.]”', 'Shortly after plaintiffs filed their complaint, the town moved to dismiss.

The hearing justice did not decide the case’s potential mootness, plaintiffs’ questionable standing to file suit, or their alleged failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Following that decision, the stock sale closed on November 7, 2016.', 'On November 22, 2016, a final judgment was entered in the Superior Court in favor of the town.

59,David DiSano : v. : Argonaut Insurance Company. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The plaintiff, David DiSano (DiSano), appeals from a Superior Court order that denied his petition to vacate an arbitration award; granted the petition of the defendant, Argonaut Insurance Company (Argonaut), to confirm the arbitration award; and granted Argonaut’s motion to quash the deposition subpoena of the dissenting arbitrator. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case concerns an automobile accident that occurred on April 14, 2010, involving DiSano and an individual named Justin Lorello. At the time of the accident, DiSano was employed by the Providence Water Supply Board (PWSB) and was operating a PWSB-owned vehicle. DiSano sought underinsured-motorist coverage through an insurance policy issued by', '1 Argonaut to PWSB.1 Because the policy contained an arbitration provision, the parties executed an arbitration-submission agreement in which they agreed that the Superior Court Rules Governing Arbitration of Civil Actions would apply.', 'A two-day hearing was conducted before a panel of three arbitrators. On August 25, 2014, a majority of the arbitrators issued a decision that found in favor of Argonaut; one arbitrator dissented from the decision. The majority found Lorello liable for the April 14, 2010 accident. The majority also found that: (1) Lorello’s insurer, Liberty Insurance Company, had paid DiSano $25,000, the policy limit; (2) DiSano’s insurer, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, had paid DiSano $25,000, the underinsured-motorist coverage policy limit; and (3) the workers’ compensation insurer for PWSB, Liberty Mutual, had paid DiSano $258,303 in workers’ compensation benefits.', 'Consequently, the majority determined that Argonaut was entitled to an offset of $308,303 from any damages awarded to DiSano in the arbitration, which it calculated by adding the aforementioned insurance payments and workers’ compensation benefits received by DiSano.', 'The majority further found that DiSano “had significant pre-existing hip and low back conditions which pre-dated the subject accident[,]” and that the accident marginally aggravated these conditions. The majority determined that the medical testimony demonstrated that the accident exacerbated DiSano’s low-back condition for approximately three months, but that hip replacement surgery that he underwent on February 23, 2011, after the accident, “was not causally related to the accident.” The majority concluded that DiSano was entitled to damages for three months with respect to reasonable pain and suffering, medical expenses, and lost wages. However, because the majority also found that DiSano’s damages were less than the $308,303 1', 'We note that DiSano sought underinsured-motorist coverage through an uninsured-motorist coverage endorsement in the policy.', '2 offset amount to which it had determined Argonaut was entitled, “judgment” was entered in favor of Argonaut.', 'On September 16, 2014, DiSano filed a petition in the Superior Court to vacate the arbitration award, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-3-12. Argonaut objected to DiSano’s petition and brought a cross-petition to confirm the arbitration award, pursuant to § 10-3-11. On November 13, 2015, DiSano filed a notice to depose the dissenting arbitrator. Argonaut moved to quash the deposition subpoena pursuant to Rules 26(c) and 45(c)(3) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. It maintained that: (1) Superior Court Arbitration Rule 5(f) prohibits the deposition of an arbitrator; (2) common law provides arbitrators with quasi-judicial immunity; and (3) there is no factual or legal basis to depose the dissenting arbitrator. DiSano objected to the motion to quash.', 'On January 21, 2016, a hearing was held before a justice of the Superior Court on the parties’ pending petitions and Argonaut’s motion to quash. DiSano explained, in support of his petition to vacate the arbitration award, that he was relying on the fourth ground provided in § 10-3-12, which mandates that an arbitration award must be vacated “[w]here the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.” Section 10-3-12(4). DiSano noted that he was not disputing that Argonaut was entitled to an offset; however, he maintained that the majority had miscalculated the offset amount. Specifically, DiSano asserted that the arbitrators miscalculated the amount because they did not subtract from his workers’ compensation benefits the amount that was attributable to his hip replacement. DiSano argued that “a substantial portion of that $308,[303] * * * included the hip replacement surgery [and] the lost wages incurred as a result of the hip replacement surgery.”', '3', 'In response, Argonaut first noted the limited review of arbitration awards and the “strong public policy in favor of arbitration awards.” It asserted that, although DiSano was attempting to challenge the adequacy of the award by arguing that the award was miscalculated, the purported inadequacy of an arbitration award is not a ground upon which the courts can vacate an arbitration award.', 'With respect to Argonaut’s motion to quash the deposition subpoena, DiSano explained that he sought to depose the dissenting arbitrator to ascertain why the majority, in calculating the offset, had included certain amounts that he had received. However, Argonaut argued that DiSano’s attempt to depose the dissenting arbitrator violated Superior Court Arbitration Rule 5(f), as well as various recognized immunities for arbitrators.', 'The hearing justice rendered a bench decision. He found the majority’s decision to be “rational and logical.” He stated that the majority found DiSano’s injuries to be minor, and accordingly had decided that the offset amount exceeded his damages. The hearing justice noted that, although the majority did not specify the amount of DiSano’s damages, it was “clearly because the arbitrators did not believe it was necessary to get to that point.” He stated:', '“While [plaintiff] says he should be able to recover his losses here', 'disregarding the workers’ compensation award, not even that is', 'clear. He received $50,000 in liability. There’s no evidence that', 'he incurred special damages, lost pay, and wages above that or that', 'he suffered pain and suffering above that.” Further, the hearing justice noted that it was not necessary for the arbitrators to quantify the amount of damages, nor should arbitrators be required to do so.', 'When considering the motion to quash, the hearing justice noted that he was “skeptical * * * about the deposition of an arbitrator, particularly, in this case, the minority arbitrator * * *.” He deemed DiSano’s subpoena seeking to depose the dissenting arbitrator to be “unusual” and', '4 “unnecessary.”', 'Accordingly, the hearing justice denied DiSano’s petition to vacate the arbitration award and granted Argonaut’s petition to confirm the arbitration award and motion to quash the deposition subpoena.

Section 10-3-12 sets forth the statutory grounds for when an arbitration award must be vacated:', '“In any of the following cases, the court must make an order', 'vacating the award upon the application of any party to the', 'arbitration:', '“(1) Where the award was procured by corruption, fraud or', 'undue means.', '“(2) Where there was evident partiality or corruption on the', 'part of the arbitrators, or either of them.', '6', '“(3) Where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in', 'refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause', 'shown, or in hearing legally immaterial evidence, or', 'refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the', 'controversy, or of any other misbehavior by which the', 'rights of any party have been substantially prejudiced.', '“(4) Where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so', 'imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite', 'award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.”', 'As noted above, in the Superior Court, DiSano relied on the basis provided in § 10-3-12(4), maintaining that the majority imperfectly executed their powers by miscalculating the offset amount. DiSano challenges the portion of the offset that was calculated with the workers’ compensation benefits that were attributable to his hip replacement. However, because the arbitrators did not quantify the total amount of damages, there is no support for DiSano’s suggestion that, but for the inclusion of this amount in the offset, his damages award would have been greater than the offset amount and judgment would have entered in his favor.2 Aside from the workers’ compensation benefits, there is an additional $50,000 offset amount that arose from insurance payments, which DiSano does not challenge. As the hearing justice astutely remarked, it is conceivable that DiSano’s damages award did not even rise above this $50,000 offset amount, given the finding of minimal damages by the majority. Because of this very real possibility, this Court cannot say that the majority of the arbitrators “so imperfectly executed [their powers] that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.” Section 10-3-12. 2', 'We note, as the hearing justice also mentioned, that the arbitrators were not required to quantify the damages amount.

Calson Construction Co., 111 A.3d 311, 315 (R.I. 2015). We are persuaded by the following language set forth in Loretta Realty Corp. v.

Pournaras (Pournaras), are the two surviving children of Constantine W. Pournaras (Constantine or decedent).1 The matter presently before us is the defendant’s appeal from a Superior Court judgment granting the plaintiff’s request for declaratory relief and prohibiting the defendant from transferring assets of the decedent’s irrevocable living trust into the decedent’s estate. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'We refer to the decedent by his first name to avoid confusion. No disrespect is intended.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Constantine, who passed away on November 10, 2012, executed three documents during his lifetime that are pertinent to this appeal: a revocable living trust (the living trust), an irrevocable living trust (the irrevocable trust), and a last will and testament (the will).', 'The living trust was executed on December 2, 1993, amended on August 22, 2003, and amended a second time on October 17, 2008. In the living trust’s most recent restatement, Constantine is named as trustor and sole trustee, and Pournaras is named as the sole successor trustee. According to Jaffe, the living trust was “funded with approximately $500,000.” The living trust provides that, upon Constantine’s death, the trustee (Pournaras) “shall pay the property located at 43 Knollwood Avenue, Cranston * * * to * * * POURNARAS * * *”; the living trust also provides that, if the trust owned liquid resources, the trustee shall pay $50,000 from those liquid resources to Jaffe, not including the aforementioned real property.', 'The irrevocable trust was executed on August 22, 2003, and names Pournaras as trustee. Jaffe maintains that Pournaras advised her that the irrevocable trust contained assets worth approximately $694,000. Article 4, section 2 of the irrevocable trust reserves to Constantine the power “to appoint any part or all of the [t]rust [e]state to or for the benefit of any of [his] descendants, in equal or unequal amounts, either directly or in [t]rust, as [he] may direct.” The irrevocable trust specifies that this power of appointment is “exercisable by written instrument during [his] lifetime or by [w]ill or any [c]odicil thereto[.]” The power of appointment, however, is limited and cannot “be exercised in favor of [Constantine’s] estate, the creditors of [his] estate or in any way that would result in any economic benefit to [him].”', 'Also, article 8, section 1', '-2- directs Pournaras, as trustee, to divide the trust assets into “separate and equal shares” between Jaffe and Pournaras, as his surviving children, upon Constantine’s death.', 'The will was executed on October 17, 2008.', 'It names Pournaras as personal representative and provides that he “shall distribute [Constantine’s] residuary estate to the then acting [t]rustee” of the living trust (Pournaras). Section 5.01 of the will defines “residuary estate” as, in relevant part, “any property over which [Constantine] may have a power of appointment * * * less all valid claims asserted against [his] estate * * *.”', 'In January 2014, the will was admitted to probate and Pournaras was appointed as the personal representative of Constantine’s estate. Jaffe filed a complaint in May 2014 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent Pournaras from transferring the assets of the irrevocable trust into Constantine’s estate, and also to have Pournaras removed as trustee. In her complaint, Jaffe alleged that Pournaras intended to transfer assets from the irrevocable trust to Constantine’s estate by exercising the limited power of appointment under article 4, section 2 of the irrevocable trust. In his counterclaim, Pournaras maintained that section 5.01 of the will was intended to be an exercise of the limited power of appointment contained within article 4, section 2 of the irrevocable trust.', 'Jaffe and Pournaras filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Following a hearing, the Superior Court issued a decision on June 23, 2016, in favor of Jaffe; the court concluded that Pournaras’s intended exercise of the limited power of appointment reserved by Constantine would be in contravention of Constantine’s intentions as expressed in article 4, section 2 of the irrevocable trust by exposing the trust assets to the potential claims of creditors. The decision pronounced that Constantine’s “clear intent, as expressed in [a]rticle [4], [s]ection 2 of the [i]rrevocable [t]rust, was that the limited power of appointment be exercised for the benefit of his', '-3- descendants, rather than his creditors[,]” and that, if the court “were to adopt Pournaras’[s] reading of [s]ection 5 of the [w]ill as a valid exercise of the decedent’s limited power of appointment, the [i]rrevocable [t]rust assets would become part of the decedent’s residuary estate and would then be subject to the claims of the decedent’s creditors.” The Superior Court prohibited Pournaras “from transferring the assets of the [i]rrevocable [t]rust into [Constantine’s] estate[,]” and directed him to divide the trust into two equal shares “to be distributed as otherwise provided in the trust instrument * * *.”', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.” Newstone Development, LLC v.

We agree.', '-5-', 'Section 5.01 of the will clearly defines Constantine’s residuary estate as “any property over which [Constantine] may have a power of appointment * * * less all valid claims asserted against [his] estate[.]”', 'To read this clause as a valid exercise of Constantine’s power of appointment would allow trust assets to be placed in the residuary estate, and thereby subject to the claims of creditors. This would be inconsistent with the terms of the irrevocable trust and, therefore, impermissible without specific language in the irrevocable trust that reserved such a right. See Garneau v. Garneau, 63 R.I. 416, 424, 9 A.2d 15, 18 (1939) (a settlor of a trust may not revoke or modify a trust he created unless he has reserved for himself the power to do so).', 'We are also of the opinion that Pournaras’s reliance on Hooker v. Drayton, 69 R.I. 290, 33 A.2d 206 (1943), for the proposition that “property which is transmitted by a testator in the exercise of a power granted to him by another to appoint by will is neither in law nor in fact a part of the testator’s estate[,]” is misplaced. Hooker, 69 R.I. at 295, 33 A.2d at 209. The question confronting this Court in Hooker was whether the testator intended to charge to his residuary estate the obligation for the payment of taxes on the testator’s exercise of a testamentary power of appointment. Id. at 292, 33 A.2d at 208. This Court held: “In the absence of a clearly expressed intent to the contrary in the decedent donee’s will such tax is ultimately to be borne by the appointed property, and not by his residuary estate.” Id. at 296, 33 A.2d at 210.', 'In the case before us, however, if the exercise of the power of appointment were deemed valid, the very terms of Constantine’s will would place the assets of the irrevocable trust in his residuary estate, thereby subjecting them to the demands of creditors.', 'As the trial justice cogently remarked, “[a]lthough the exercise of the limited power of appointment would not, ipso facto, result in the assets of the [i]rrevocable [t]rust becoming part of the decedent’s estate, Pournaras’[s] reading of [s]ection 5 of the [w]ill would have the effect of placing [i]rrevocable', '-6- [t]rust assets in the residuary estate where they would be subject to the claims of the decedent’s creditors[,]” contrary to Constantine’s intent as expressed in the irrevocable trust.', 'Pournaras also argues that we should consider extrinsic evidence to ascertain Constantine’s intent in creating the irrevocable trust. Specifically, he contends that the terms of the will and the 2008 restatement of the living trust “altered” the testamentary directives contained in the irrevocable trust. Pournaras argues that “[Constantine], by including property over which he had reserved a power of appointment in his residuary estate, could not have consciously intended to defeat or frustrate his clearly stated objective of limiting [Jaffe’s] inheritance to $50,000.00 of available liquid assets.”', 'Because we find the language of the irrevocable trust to be clear and unambiguous, however, we need not resort to extrinsic evidence to determine Constantine’s intent. The power of appointment was to be executed “for the benefit of any of [his] descendants, in equal or unequal amounts,” and “not * * * in favor of [his] estate[.]”', 'It is our opinion that a reading of section 5.01 of the will as a valid exercise of Constantine’s power of appointment would be inconsistent with the clear language contained in article 4, section 2 of the irrevocable trust. Therefore, we conclude that the Superior Court did not err in holding that the defendant’s intended exercise of the limited power of appointment contained in article 4, section 2 of Constantine’s irrevocable living trust was invalid.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendants, the City of Providence (the city) and the Retirement Board of the Employees Retirement System of the City of Providence (the board), (collectively defendants), appeal from the entry of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, John Sauro (plaintiff or Sauro). On appeal, the defendants argue that the trial justice erred by requiring the city to continue to provide accidental disability pension benefits to the plaintiff and to place him on a waiting list to return to his position at the Providence Fire Department pursuant to § 17-189(8)(a) of the Providence Code of Ordinances.1 1', 'Section 17-189(8)(a) of the Providence Code of Ordinances provides:', '“Re-examination of members retired on account of disability: Once', 'each year the director of personnel may require all pensioners to', 'undergo a medical examination, by a physician or physicians', 'engaged by the director of personnel.

In April 2011, footage of plaintiff lifting substantial weights at a gym aired on a local television channel.

At the 2011 IME, it was determined that plaintiff remained disabled from his 1998 injury. Again in 2013, the board directed plaintiff to undergo an IME, to be conducted by Brian McKeon, M.D., in Boston, Massachusetts; plaintiff refused to do so because, he asserted, he was bedridden due to both physical and psychological illnesses. The city then hired a private investigator to undertake surveillance of plaintiff. In September 2013, plaintiff was observed leaving his home, driving his vehicle, and shopping at various retail stores. On December 18, 2013, the board voted to suspend plaintiff’s accidental disability pension based on his failure to attend the IME that had been scheduled for October 16, 2013.', 'The plaintiff filed this action on July 8, 2014, seeking to overturn the board’s decision to suspend his benefits. The plaintiff sought a preliminary injunction to restore his accidental disability pension benefits, and a five-day hearing was held in October 2014. The trial justice issued a written decision on December 2, 2014, denying plaintiff’s motion for a preliminary injunction. In the face of that decision, plaintiff agreed to undergo the IME on December 23, 2014, and his accidental disability pension benefits immediately were reinstated. The examining physician, Dr. McKeon, concluded that “[plaintiff] could fight fires with [the right] shoulder and work through this as he [h]as in the last 15 years[,]” and that “[r]elative to [plaintiff’s] right shoulder, he is functional.” However, Dr. McKeon ultimately opined that plaintiff was not fit to return to his firefighter duties based on unrelated psychological disabilities and colorectal illness. The record discloses that it was plaintiff who convinced Dr. McKeon that he was not fit to serve as a firefighter. The plaintiff produced a comprehensive file detailing his complicated physical and mental health history, which he presented to Dr. McKeon at the IME. In his opinion letter to the board, Dr. McKeon disclosed that plaintiff provided him with medical documentation and personal notes about his maladies:', '-3-', '“I also received several MRI reports which the patient gave to me', 'today.', '“* * *', '“The patient also gave me a tremendous amount of handwritten', 'notes with all of his significant psychiatric conditions that have', 'deteriorated over the last 2 years.', '“* * *', '“Finally, I want to mention there is a significant amount of', 'colorectal notes that were given to me by the patient.', '“* * *', '“He takes multiple medications.

I believe based', 'on his shoulder that this gentleman is clearly not totally disabled.', 'The status of his disability is not related to his shoulder.', '“* * *', '“Overall I believe this patient is disabled because of the other', 'issues, but not relative to the right shoulder.” On April 22, 2015, the board voted to discontinue plaintiff’s accidental disability pension “pursuant to medical documentation received by the [b]oard confirming that [plaintiff was] no longer disabled as a result of [his] July 17, 1998 job-related injury.” Based on his inability to return to work as a firefighter, the board did not place plaintiff on a list for appointment to duty. Significantly, although both plaintiff and his attorney were notified on April 17, 2015, of the impending board meeting scheduled for April 22, 2015, neither plaintiff nor his previous counsel attended the proceeding.', 'On August 13, 2015, plaintiff filed a thirteen-count second-amended complaint.

In count 13, plaintiff alleged that, in accordance with § 17-189(8)(a), the city was required to pay accidental disability pension benefits until his appointment to a position within the department. Both plaintiff and the city filed cross-motions for summary judgment on the sole remaining count, and a hearing was held on October 5, 2015. At the outset, the trial justice determined that the Superior Court was vested with subject-matter jurisdiction over a claim for declaratory and injunctive relief,4 because plaintiff was simply Amendment Violation of Due Process; Count 3, Fourteenth Amendment Violation of Equal Protection; Count 4, Contract Clause; Count 5, Takings Clause; Count 6, Breach of Contract; Count 7, Promissory Estoppel; Count 8, Tortious Interference with a Contract; Count 9, Breach of Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; Count 10, Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress; Count 11, Loss of Consortium; and Count 12, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief. 3', 'On November 24, 2014, defendants filed a motion to dismiss, in which they asserted that the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction to hear the merits of plaintiff’s claims.

In light of the jurisdictional tension in this case, it may have been prudent for the trial justice to decline to grant declaratory and injunctive relief rather than struggle with such a narrow path. However, we are not of the opinion that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial justice to soldier on in this case. See id.; see also, Woonsocket Teachers’ Guild Local Union 951, AFT v.

The plaintiff vigorously maintained that he was bedridden and could not travel to Boston for an IME, nor could he withstand a medical examination. Upon finally agreeing to undergo a medical examination—in order for his benefits to be reinstated—plaintiff provided Dr. McKeon with a voluminous, self-created file of copious handwritten notes and medical reports pertaining to his unrelated medical problems. As plaintiff asked him to do, Dr. McKeon opined that plaintiff was unfit to resume service based on his psychological and colorectal illnesses. At this point, although plaintiff may have won the battle, he abandoned the arena and failed to appear at the meeting of the board. The trial justice’s conclusion that there must be “a formal determination after a hearing as to whether or not [plaintiff] can, in fact, return to work[,]” misses the mark. The board did conduct a hearing on this question, but plaintiff elected not to attend.', 'Upon receipt of Dr. McKeon’s report, the board concluded that, although plaintiff was no longer disabled from his work-related injury, he was nonetheless unable to return to work due to other unrelated illnesses; the board voted to terminate his accidental disability pension benefits. A mere ten months after Dr. McKeon’s report, plaintiff avowed before the same trial justice to whom he had previously asserted an inability to return to work that all of his illnesses had subsided and he was now able to return to work. Evidence of plaintiff’s cure and his swift recovery is not on the record; nor are we convinced that it was cognizable by the Superior Court. Without reconciling his current state of well-being with his own grievous assertions to Dr. McKeon a mere ten months earlier, plaintiff argued that he must be placed on a waiting list in order to “see what happens.”', 'The trial justice correctly declined to make any findings concerning plaintiff’s purported fitness for duty or his state of health.

I respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority in this case. Although this Court previously has observed that a portion of the operative version of the ordinance at issue in this case “is not well drafted and is certainly not clear and unambiguous,” Prew v. Employee Retirement System of Providence, 139 A.3d 556, 561 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Morse v. Employees Retirement System of Providence, 139 A.3d 385, 391-92 (R.I. 2016)), I am in agreement with the majority that the section of the ordinance at issue here, § 17-189(8)(a), is clear and unambiguous. I also agree with the majority that § 17-189(8)(a) “does not specifically set forth the responsibility of the board in a situation such as this * * *.” Yet, unlike the majority, I am constrained to conclude that nothing in the ordinance empowered the board to suspend John Sauro’s pension benefits under the circumstances present in this case. My reading of the ordinance leads me to the inevitable conclusion that § 17-189(8)(a) empowers the board to suspend or revoke a pensioner’s disability benefits under two scenarios only, neither of which is present here. Therefore, I conclude that the clear and unambiguous language of § 17- 189(8)(a) directs the board to place Sauro on a list for reinstatement and, in the interim, to continue to provide his disability benefits.', 'Because the provision of the ordinance is clear and unambiguous, our task should be confined to applying “the plain and ordinary meaning of [its] words.” Town of Warren v. Bristol Warren Regional School District, 159 A.3d 1029, 1039 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069, 1078 (R.I. 2013)).', 'Section 17-189(8)(a) sets forth a straightforward scheme for the re-examination of disability pensioners.', 'Once per year, a pensioner may be required to undergo an independent medical examination (IME).', 'If a pensioner refuses to do so, the board has the authority to suspend his pension benefits. If a pensioner’s refusal to submit to an IME continues for a year, the board is required to revoke his', '- 14 - disability pension. Thus refusal of an IME presents the first scenario in which the board may suspend or revoke a pensioner’s disability pension.1', 'After a pensioner undergoes an IME, there are three possible outcomes. The examination could reveal that the pensioner’s disability persists. In that case, the pensioner’s disability benefits continue to flow, uninterrupted. Alternatively, the examination could “indicate[] that the disability of the pensioner has been removed[.]” If that is the case, then the pensioner’s age determines the result. If the disability has been removed and the pensioner has reached the age of service retirement, then the pensioner’s disability pension is converted to a “normal retirement benefit as if he or she had not been disabled.” However, if the disability has been removed and the pensioner is “under the age of service retirement,” a third situation arises. In that case, the pensioner’s “name shall be placed on such appropriate lists of candidates as are prepared for appointment to a position in his department for which he is stated to be qualified in a salary grade comparable to that from which he or she was last retired.” (Emphasis added.)', 'Once the pensioner is placed on the reinstatement list, “he or she shall be reinstated as a member and participate in the benefits of the retirement system with credit for service rendered prior to disability retirement, and for the period during which he received the disability allowance[.]” The credit-for-service regime applies, however, only if the pensioner “did not refuse to accept such reinstatement when it was first offered to him or her[.]” If the pensioner declines reinstatement after placement on the reinstatement list, then “the pension shall be discontinued and any right to further benefits under the retirement system shall be based solely on his or her service rendered prior to his or her disability retirement.” Accordingly, refusal of 1', 'In fact, as the majority notes, this precise situation occurred in this case. In 2013, the board suspended Sauro’s pension benefits after he initially refused to attend an IME with Brian McKeon, M.D., in Boston, Massachusetts.', '- 15 - reinstatement presents the second scenario in which the board is authorized to terminate a pensioner’s disability pension benefits.', 'It seems clear to me, therefore, that there are only two scenarios under § 17-189(8)(a) that empower the board to suspend or revoke a pensioner’s disability benefits: one, when a pensioner refuses to undergo an IME; and, two, when a pensioner whose disability has been removed and who is under the age of service retirement refuses reinstatement. It is beyond dispute that neither of those situations applies in this case. Sauro, who is under the age of service retirement, has undergone an IME with Brian McKeon, M.D., and has not yet refused reinstatement. Sauro is therefore in the following position: He has undergone an IME but, even though he remains under the age of service retirement and subject to reinstatement, the board has declined to place him on the reinstatement list. According to the majority, Dr. McKeon’s opinion that Sauro is unfit to return to work for reasons other than his original disability empowers the board to refuse to place him on the reinstatement list and to suspend his disability pension benefits until Sauro proves he is fit for service in the fire department. I cannot agree with that conclusion.', 'I do not take issue with the facts as they are set forth in the majority opinion. And, as the majority aptly points out, most of Sauro’s difficulties in this case appear to be largely of his own doing. However, an unattractive fact pattern does not enlarge the powers of the board beyond those set forth in § 17-189(8)(a). Doctor McKeon’s examination revealed that Sauro’s shoulder injury—the injury upon which his disability pension was premised—has been removed. Moreover, it is also true that Dr. McKeon concluded that Sauro had other ailments, both physical and psychological, which render him disabled and unable to return to work as a firefighter. 2 As 2', 'Although there may have been fertile ground to challenge the opinion of Dr. McKeon, an orthopedic surgeon, about medical conditions beyond his area of expertise, for some reason', '- 16 - the majority observes, § 17-189(8)(a) does not specify what the responsibility of the board is in a scenario such as this, where the disability that triggered pension benefits “has been removed” but an IME reveals that the pensioner is unable to work for other reasons. Nonetheless, because Sauro’s operative disability—his shoulder injury—has been removed, and because Sauro is under the age of service retirement, under the ordinance the board was required to place Sauro on the reinstatement list.', 'If the board had done that, and if it had recalled Sauro, the board could have reevaluated its position if some other condition prevented him from accepting an appointment. As of this time, however, Sauro has not been placed on a list and consequently has not had the opportunity to accept or decline reinstatement to any position.', 'Respectfully, I also disagree with the majority’s rationale that Sauro is neither “prepared” nor “qualified” to return to work in the fire department. The majority reaches this conclusion based on a grammatical analysis of § 17-189(8)(a), an analysis with which I cannot concur.', 'The pertinent portion of § 17-189(8)(a) provides:', '“If the examination indicates that the disability of the pensioner', 'has been removed and said pensioner is under the age of service', 'retirement, his or her name shall be placed on such appropriate lists', 'of candidates as are prepared for appointment to a position in his', 'department for which he is stated to be qualified in a salary grade', 'comparable to that from which he or she was last retired.”', '(Emphasis added.) The fulcrum of the majority’s interpretation of this ordinance rests on two words: “prepared” and “qualified.” The majority first emphasizes that Sauro is not “prepared” to return to work, defining that term to mean “properly expectant, organized, or equipped; ready[.]” In defining “prepared” to include a physical connotation, the majority also declares that the word “prepared” Sauro did not appear at that hearing nor did he seek review of the board’s decision to accept the doctor’s medical opinions.', '- 17 - modifies the word “candidates.” The majority then reasons that because Sauro is a “candidate” who is not “prepared”—meaning he is not “properly expectant, organized, or equipped; ready”— to return to work in the Providence Fire Department, the board need not place his name on a list for reinstatement. Although it provides no definition for the term, the majority also holds that Sauro is not “qualified” to return to work.', 'First, I am of the firm opinion that the word “prepared” modifies the word “lists,” not the word “candidates.” The term “candidates” is part of a prepositional phrase—i.e., “lists of candidates”—that the term “prepared” modifies in its entirety. Therefore, in my opinion, a plain reading of this section of the ordinance means that, when an IME shows that a pensioner’s disability “has been removed,” his name “shall be placed on” a list for reinstatement, a list—not a candidate—that has been “prepared.” Pursuant to my understanding of § 17-189(8)(a)’s clear and unambiguous language, the removal of the triggering disability requires the board to place that pensioner on a “prepared” list for reinstatement.', 'In addition, I must also depart from the majority’s application of the word “qualified.” Although the majority does not define what it means for a pensioner to be “qualified”—despite concluding that Sauro is not—I am led to the conclusion that the word “qualified” carries with it no connotation of physical readiness.', 'See Black’s Law Dictionary 1436 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “qualified” to mean “[p]ossessing the necessary qualifications; capable or competent”); see also Random House Unabridged Dictionary 1578 (2d ed. 1993) (defining “qualified” as “having the qualities, accomplishments, etc., that fit a person for some function, office, or the like”). In my opinion, the word “qualified” conveys a set of professional characteristics, not physical condition. As an example, Sauro, formerly a firefighter, may not be “qualified” to be on the arson squad or the fire prevention bureau. However, in my view, Sauro is “qualified” to', '- 18 - return to work in the fire department, at least for purposes of placing his name on a reinstatement list. Based on the clear paths set forth by the language of § 17-189(8)(a), whether he is physically capable of actually returning to work fighting fires is a question for another day.', 'Therefore, I cannot agree that the board is empowered to ignore the clear mandate of the ordinance—i.e., Sauro’s name “shall be placed on such appropriate lists of candidates as are prepared for appointment to a position in his department for which he is stated to be qualified in a salary grade comparable to that from which he or she was last retired.”', 'Moreover, after concluding—correctly in my view—that § 17-189(8)(a) is clear and unambiguous, the majority then goes on to say that, had it considered § 17-189(8)(a) to be ambiguous, it would have reached the same result in this case. Here, I must again respectfully depart from the majority’s analysis.', 'As this Court has recently explained, Providence’s accidental-disability-retirement ordinance, located in § 17-189, “is remedial in nature.” Prew, 139 A.3d at 563. Therefore, based on this Court’s well established case law, if § 17-189(8)(a) were ambiguous, we would construe it in Sauro’s favor. Id. Indeed, “[a]s a remedial measure intended to compensate employees who become disabled as the result of an injury suffered in the line of duty, ‘any ambiguities * * * must be construed liberally in favor of the employee.’” Id. (quoting McCarthy v. Environmental Transportation Services, Inc., 865 A.2d 1056, 1063 (R.I. 2005)).3 3', 'Nor do I concur with the majority’s assessment that interpreting § 17-189(8)(a) in this manner reaches an “absurd result.” I adhere to the position that this Court, as a matter of law, ought to invoke the “absurd result” doctrine in only the most extraordinary of circumstances, such as when an interpretation of a statute or ordinance would render legislative language wholly meaningless or render a statutory scheme unable to function. In this case, it is not absurd for the board to follow the ordinance’s clear language and place Sauro on a list for reinstatement. Thereafter, when called upon for a job for which he is qualified—likely the position of firefighter—the board can reassess whether Sauro is fit to serve. His placement on the list, in and of itself, is not an absurd result. In my view, the ordinance’s structure—which does not', '- 19 -', 'Although Sauro’s actions during the time he collected a disability pension at the expense of the taxpayers of the City of Providence can certainly be called into question, I nonetheless reach the conclusion that the governing ordinance, § 17-189(8)(a), does not cloak the board with the power the majority grants to it today. For those reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. render language meaningless or leave the board unable to function—demands it. It may be troubling in the view of many that Sauro continues to receive disability benefits in the interim, but that is a decision left to the City of Providence’s elected officials, who enact legislation, not this Court. Here, § 17-189(8)(a) is unequivocal: Sauro shall be placed on a list for reinstatement; thereafter, he has the option to accept or refuse being recalled for duty. Based on the language employed in the ordinance, I am perplexed as to how this wait-and-see approach—again, an approach dictated by the ordinance—would lead to an “absurd result.”', '- 20 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET', 'John Sauro v.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 2, 2015, the Providence Police Department filed two delinquency petitions in the Family Court against respondent, alleging that he had committed two offenses that, if committed by an adult, would constitute the felony offenses of first-degree robbery, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1, and conspiracy to commit robbery, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6. A trial was held before a justice of the Family Court on May 21 and 22, 2015. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', '-1-', 'A', 'The Testimony of Officer Juan Rodrigues', 'Officer Juan Rodrigues was the first witness to testify. He stated that, on March 1, 2015, he was working as a patrol officer in Providence and that, at approximately 7:00 p.m. on that date, he was dispatched to a reported armed robbery at a business that was both a gas station and a convenience store located at the corner of Manton Avenue and Sheridan Street in Providence (the Manton Avenue store). Officer Rodrigues testified that he and his partner responded first to the Manton Avenue store and then left to search for suspects along the bicycle path at the end of Sheridan Street, which path he entered on foot. He further testified that, while walking on the bicycle path, he was approached by a male, who was detained and searched. Officer Rodrigues further stated that he did not find any weapons on the suspect’s person, but he said that he followed the tracks of the suspect’s footprints in the snow (a blizzard then being in progress) to a point off the path, where the officer located a BB gun, gloves, and a ski mask approximately twenty feet from where the suspect was apprehended.', 'B', 'The Testimony of Officer Miguel Mena-Torres', 'Officer Miguel Mena-Torres testified next. He stated that, at approximately 7:00 p.m. on March 1, 2015, he was on duty as a patrol officer in Providence when he received a call about a robbery “at gun point;” he said that he responded to the scene of the reported robbery by driving to Glenbridge Avenue in Providence, near a bicycle path. He testified that, as he approached the bicycle path on foot, he saw two people running up a hill, one of whom would later identify', '-2- himself as D.M.1 Officer Mena-Torres stated that, after briefly giving chase, he ordered D.M. to “get down on the ground” and that D.M. complied. The officer testified that he then searched D.M. and found in his possession a BB gun and $36.00 in one dollar bills.', 'C', 'The Testimony of Detective Robert Melaragno', 'Detective Robert Melaragno testified that, at around 7:15 p.m. on March 1, 2015, he “monitored a call” about a robbery at the Manton Avenue store. He stated that he responded to the store and spoke with Mamuad Bekra2—the store clerk on duty at the time of the reported robbery; the detective added that, while at the store, he watched a portion of the store’s video surveillance footage.3', 'Detective Melaragno further testified that he returned to the police station from the Manton Avenue store and interviewed4 respondent who, in the presence of his mother, confessed to committing two acts which, if committed by an adult, would constitute the offenses of first- degree robbery and conspiracy. The detective added that respondent admitted that he had called a friend, one K.J., between 6:00 and 7:00 p.m. on the evening in question and that, in the detective’s words, respondent and K.J. “discussed committing the robbery.” It was Det. Melaragno’s further testimony that respondent said that he had gone to K.J.’s house and that, “when he arrived there[,] [D.M.] was also at [K.J.]’s house” and the three individuals “discussed 1', 'Recognizing their possible status as minors, we will refer to the individuals allegedly involved in the robbery at the Manton Avenue store by their initials only. 2', 'The record on appeal refers to the clerk on duty at the Manton Avenue store as both “Mohned Bekra” and “Mamuad Bekra;” we shall hereinafter refer to that person simply as Mr. Bekra. 3', 'The trial justice did not admit the surveillance video as a full exhibit, sustaining respondent’s objection on chain-of-custody grounds. 4', 'The detective testified that he informed respondent of his rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), and that respondent signed a form waiving those rights.', '-3- committing the robbery.” Detective Melaragno testified that respondent explained that the two BB guns used during the robbery “came from” two different neighbors and that the three individuals who had met at K.J.’s house went by cab to the Manton Avenue store. He testified that respondent stated that, when the cab arrived at the store, D.M. and K.J. “entered the store before [respondent]” carrying the BB guns and that D.M. and K.J. “told the [store] clerk to get on the floor and open the register.” Detective Melaragno added that respondent explained that he then “went around the counter” and “emptied the cash out of the register” and that the three individuals “fled from the store” and headed towards Merino Park, near the bicycle path. The detective stated that respondent admitted to dropping the BB gun, a pair of gloves, and a ski mask in the snow as the police approached. At trial, Det. Melaragno identified the BB gun, ski mask, and gloves which were recovered by Officer Rodrigues on the night of the robbery.', 'Detective Melaragno further stated that, during his interview of respondent, he showed him two photographs and that respondent identified the individuals depicted in those photographs as K.J. and D.M. and acknowledged that both of them had “accompanied him in the robbery.” The recording of Det. Melaragno’s interview with respondent was admitted into evidence as a full exhibit at trial.', 'D', 'The Testimony of Nameer Jajou', 'The next witness was Nameer Jajou, who stated that he was part-owner of the Manton Avenue store and that he had been working with Mr. Bekra on March 1, 2015 before leaving at approximately 7:20 or 7:30 p.m. Mr. Jajou testified that, shortly before he left the store, he observed that the cash register had between $400.00 and $500.00 in it. Mr. Jajou further testified that, approximately ten or fifteen minutes after leaving the store, he received a telephone call', '-4- from Mr. Bekra that caused him to return to the store; Mr. Jajou added that, when he arrived back at the store, the police were on the scene and that “the cash register [was] broken” and “[e]mpty.” It was Mr. Jajou’s testimony that the store had surveillance cameras, which recorded what occurred on March 1, 2015, and that a disk of the video surveillance footage was given to the police.', 'E', 'The Parties’ Arguments', 'During her closing argument, counsel for respondent contended that the trial justice was confronted with “a corpus delecti [sic] problem” which required dismissal of the charges because “[t]here [wa]s not enough evidence to be submitted as to a robbery taking place or a conspiracy taking place.”5 Counsel argued that there was not sufficient evidence for the court to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the Manton Avenue store had been robbed, contending that the state had shown neither that Mr. Bekra had been “put in fear” nor that he had had “anything * * * taken away from him.” Based on the purportedly insufficient evidence, counsel claimed that “[t]here [wa]s a serious corpus delecti [sic] issue,” which required the trial justice to exclude respondent’s confession from evidence. In response, the state argued that there was evidence establishing that a robbery had been committed, contending as follows:', '“[T]his robbery is fully [corroborated] both by the evidence on', 'scene with both the two particular suspects, this Respondent as', 'well as [D.M.], who were apprehended with evidence of the crime,', 'as well as the evidence that a crime was committed at the gas 5', 'On appeal, the state suggests that respondent has waived the corpus delicti argument because he raised said argument for the first time during his closing argument. In our view, the better practice would have been to raise the corpus delicti argument at the time the confession was offered into evidence. However, we note that this Court has never indicated just when a corpus delicti objection must be made; accordingly, we shall not, in the context of this case, address the argument as to possible waiver.', '-5-', 'station as told by the store owner who said between four hundred', 'and five hundred dollars was taken.” The state further argued that the corpus delicti relative to the conspiracy charge had been established on the basis of an inference “from both the conduct and the actions of three individuals robbing a gas station” and also on the basis of respondent’s confession at the police station.', 'F', 'The Trial Justice’s Decision', 'After the closing arguments were concluded, the trial justice ruled from the bench, finding that the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent had “commit[ed] a robbery” and had “conspired * * * to commit this crime of robbery.” The trial justice reviewed the testimony of each of the state’s witnesses, accepting their testimonies as true. She gave great weight to Det. Melaragno’s testimony and said that his testimony had “tied all the pieces together.” The trial justice further stated that she “couldn’t disagree more” with respondent’s argument that the corpus delicti as to the crimes charged had not been established. She cited respondent’s “own admission[s]” as well as other circumstantial evidence as support for her conclusion that the crimes of first-degree robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery of the Manton Avenue store had been committed.6 Accordingly, the trial justice found respondent delinquent on both charges. The respondent filed a timely notice of appeal. 6', 'In the course of her decision, the trial justice stated that Mr. Bekra had “positively identified” D.M. and respondent as two of the individuals who robbed the Manton Avenue store. We note that the record does not reflect that Mr. Bekra positively identified anyone; consequently, the trial justice erred in so stating. However, we conclude that this error was harmless; there is more than enough additional evidence in the record to sustain the trial justice’s finding as to respondent’s guilt.', '-6-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well established that, “[i]n reviewing findings of fact by a trial justice in a delinquency adjudication, we apply a deferential standard of review.” In re J.S., 91 A.3d 845, 850 (R.I. 2014); see also In re Richard A., 946 A.2d 204, 209 (R.I. 2008) (stating that, in view of our “substantial deference to the findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury, * * * [we] will not disturb those findings unless the trial justice has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.”). On appeal, we review the record “to determine therefrom whether legally competent evidence exists therein to support the findings made by the Family Court trial justice.” In re Malik D., 730 A.2d 1070, 1072 (R.I. 1999).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Issues Raised on Appeal', 'The only pertinent issue raised on appeal is whether the state has met its burden of establishing the corpus delicti of the crimes of robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery such that respondent’s confession was properly admitted into evidence. If the state met its burden in that regard, then respondent’s appeal is without merit and the trial justice’s adjudication of delinquency, which was based in large part on respondent’s confession, must be upheld.', 'The respondent contends that there was insufficient independent evidence that the charged crimes had actually occurred and that, therefore, the trial justice erred when she considered his confession in her decision. With respect to the robbery charge, respondent argues that the state failed to produce sufficient independent evidence to establish that “the ‘gist’ of the', '-7- robbery * * * had occurred.” He bases his argument on the fact that Mr. Bekra did not testify at trial and on the fact that the video surveillance footage was excluded from evidence; he further argues that, while reasonable inferences are allowed in a corpus delicti analysis, the “discovery of an empty, broken cash register cannot, on its own, lead one to infer a robbery * * *.” With respect to the conspiracy charge, respondent contends that, apart from his own confession, “there was no evidence that indicated that anyone knowingly engage[d] in a mutual plan to do a forbidden act.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) He argues that, other than his own confession, the record was completely devoid of “any independent evidence of an agreement, coordination, or planning by anyone on March first.” (Emphasis in original.) Additionally, respondent challenges the trial justice’s finding that Mr. Bekra “positively identified” respondent as one of the men who robbed him, arguing that there was no legally competent evidence in the record to support this finding and that, therefore, the trial justice misconceived material evidence.', 'B', 'Corpus Delicti7', 'The operative principles relative to the corpus delicti rule are summarized with admirable clarity and cogency in our opinion in the case of State v. Angell, 122 R.I. 160, 405 A.2d 10 (1979). We explicitly expressed therein our agreement with “the principle that the corpus delicti of a crime must be established before extrajudicial confessions or admissions connecting the accused with the crime are admissible into evidence.” Id. at 165, 405 A.2d at 13. We then 7', 'A valuable historical perspective on the corpus delicti rule can be found in the following comprehensive article: Note, Proof of the Corpus Delicti Aliunde the Defendant’s Confession, 103 U. Pa. L. Rev. 638 (1955). See also Thomas A. Mullen, Rule Without Reason: Requiring Independent Proof of the Corpus Delicti as a Condition of Admitting an Extrajudicial Confession, 27 U.S.F. L. Rev. 385 (1993). The corpus delicti rule is also thoroughly discussed in Wayne R. LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 1.4(b) (3d ed. 2018).', '-8- proceeded to elaborate as follows on just what the prosecution is required to establish for the confession of the accused to be admitted:', '“The prosecution is thus required to establish the corpus delicti', 'through the production of sufficient direct or circumstantial', 'evidence to establish that the crime charged was committed,', 'regardless of who may have committed it. * * * We are of the', 'opinion that only prima facie proof of corpus delicti must be', 'established prior to the introduction of defendant’s admissions [or]', 'confessions.” Id. (emphasis added). And we have specifically “emphasized that the so-called corpus delicti need not be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before the admission can be admitted into evidence.” State v. Wilbur, 115 R.I. 7, 14, 339 A.2d 730, 734 (1975). In Wilbur, we stated that there need only be “some corroborative evidence tending to prove the corpus delicti * * *.” Id. at 13, 339 A.2d at 734.', 'Once a defendant’s confession has been admitted into evidence, it “may be used to prove both the fact that the crime was committed and the defendant’s agency therein.” State v. Boswell, 73 R.I. 358, 363, 56 A.2d 196, 198 (1947); see also State v. Jacobs, 21 R.I. 259, 261, 43 A. 31, 32 (1899) (“The confession is evidence tending to prove both the fact that the crime was committed and the defendant’s agency therein.”).', '1. Robbery', 'It is our view that there was sufficient legally competent evidence to support the trial justice’s finding that there was a robbery of the Manton Avenue store. See In re Richard A., 946 A.2d at 209. Accordingly, respondent’s corpus delicti contention is unavailing.', 'As defined by our case law, robbery is “the felonious and forcible taking from the person of another of goods or money [of] any value by violence or [by] putting [the victim] in fear.” State v. Tully, 110 A.3d 1181, 1193 (R.I. 2015) (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The trial justice found that the state met its obligation relative to establishing that a', '-9- robbery had occurred; she noted that the state’s witnesses provided ample evidence, independent of respondent’s confession, that money was forcibly taken from the Manton Avenue store on March 1, 2015. She specifically highlighted the following evidence in her decision: (1) statements from Det. Melaragno, Officer Rodrigues, and Officer Mena-Torres that they each received a report of a robbery at the Manton Avenue store around 7:00 p.m. on that date; (2) statements from Officers Rodrigues and Mena-Torres that they apprehended two young men on the bicycle path near the Manton Avenue store and that they located firearms, a ski mask, and a pair of gloves on or near the young men at the time of their apprehensions; and (3) Mr. Jajou’s testimony that, when he returned to the store in response to Mr. Bekra’s phone call, the police were already on the scene, the cash register was “broken,” and $400.00 to $500.00 was missing.', 'We conclude that the trial justice’s factual findings constitute legally competent evidence upon which the trial justice could base her decision that the state established the corpus delicti of robbery. Angell, 122 R.I. at 165, 405 A.2d at 13. The record also reflects that several different officers in the Providence Police Department received reports of an “armed robbery” or a robbery “at gun point” at the Manton Avenue store on the evening of March 1, 2015. Accordingly, the trial justice did not err when she admitted respondent’s confession into evidence and then relied on the confession in her decision adjudicating him delinquent for having committed first-degree robbery. See Boswell, 73 R.I. at 363, 56 A.2d at 198.', '2. Conspiracy', 'It is further our view that the trial justice did not err in finding that there existed a conspiracy to commit a robbery of the Manton Avenue store and that respondent participated in that conspiracy. See In re Richard A., 946 A.2d at 209. It is well settled that “the gist of a conspiracy is the unlawful combination of two or more persons to do an unlawful act or a lawful', '- 10 - act for an unlawful purpose with the offense being complete once the agreement is made.” State v. Berroa, 6 A.3d 1095, 1103 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, “[b]ecause conspiracy rarely can be proven by direct evidence, illegal confederacy may be inferentially established by proof of the relation, conduct, circumstances and acts of the parties.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'The trial justice made the following findings of fact in this regard: (1) that the above- referenced police officers received reports of a robbery at the Manton Avenue store; (2) that both respondent and D.M. were apprehended on or near the bicycle path close to the Manton Avenue store within thirty minutes of the call reporting a robbery at that store; (3) that D.M. was carrying a BB gun and approximately $36.00 on his person at the time of his arrest; and (4) that respondent’s footprints in the snow led to another BB gun, a pair of black gloves, and a black ski mask, all located approximately twenty feet from where respondent was arrested. These facts constitute circumstantial evidence of the “conduct, circumstances and acts” of respondent and D.M. on the night of the robbery and provide a basis for an inference of the existence of a conspiracy to commit a robbery of the Manton Avenue store. Berroa, 6 A.3d at 1103 (internal quotation marks omitted). As a result, we conclude that the state produced sufficient independent evidence of the corpus delicti of the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery. Angell, 122 R.I. at 165, 405 A.2d at 13. Accordingly, the trial justice did not err in admitting respondent’s confession into evidence and, once admitted, the state was free to use the confession as evidence proving beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent “knowingly engage[d] in a mutual plan” to commit robbery. State v. Gilman, 110 R.I. 207, 218, 291 A.2d 425, 432 (1972).', '- 11 -', 'C', 'Confession', 'We conclude that the state established the corpus delicti of both first-degree robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery and, as a result, the trial justice did not err in admitting respondent’s confession. Once the confession was admitted, the trial justice was free to rely on that confession in her determination that respondent was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Boswell, 73 R.I. at 363, 56 A.2d at 198; see also Jacobs, 21 R.I. at 261, 43 A. at 32. Because the contents of respondent’s confession, coupled with the other circumstantial evidence admitted at trial, proved beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent conspired to, and did in fact, perpetrate a robbery of the Manton Avenue store on March 1, 2015, it is our view that the trial justice did not err when she adjudicated respondent delinquent.', 'Accordingly, having closely scrutinized the record and bearing in mind the well-settled principles that govern our review in this context, we perceive no reason to disturb the ruling of the Family Court.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court.

These consolidated cases come before the Supreme Court on an appeal and on a petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari to review a November 5, 2015 bench decision in Providence County Superior Court in favor of the plaintiff, John R. Grasso.1 The defendants, Gina Raimondo, Frank Karpinski, the Employees’ Retirement System 1', 'The first case before us (PC 13-3121) was commenced in Providence County Superior Court as a declaratory judgment action seeking a judgment that Mr. Grasso was not subject to the terms of G.L. 1956 §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24 with respect to his accidental disability pension. The defendants named in the complaint were as follows: Gina M. Raimondo, individually and in her capacity as chairperson of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island (the ERSRI); Frank J. Karpinski, individually and in his capacity as Executive Director of the ERSRI; the ERSRI; and the State of Rhode Island. Gina Raimondo (who is currently serving as Governor of the State of Rhode Island) and Frank Karpinski prevailed in Superior Court in their individual capacities, and that portion of the Superior Court judgment is not the subject of the appeal to this Court. Therefore, as to Governor Raimondo and Mr. Karpinski, we are concerned only with the claims against them in their representative capacities.', '-1- of Rhode Island (the ERSRI), and the State of Rhode Island, contend before this Court that the trial justice erred in determining that Mr. Grasso need not comply with G.L. 1956 §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24 in order to continue receiving his accidental disability pension because those sections were not applicable to his situation.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts in the instant case are relatively limited and are not in dispute. We rely on the complaints filed in PC 13-3121 and PC 14-4953 for our recitation of the pertinent facts.', 'Mr. Grasso was a member of the Cranston police force when, on June 18, 2000, he suffered a debilitating injury while performing his duties as a police officer. When he was unable to return to work as a police officer, he applied for an accidental disability pension pursuant to the terms of G.L. 1956 chapter 21.2 of title 45. On September 12, 2002, Mr. Grasso was granted an accidental disability pension. Over ten years later, on September 20, 2012, Mr. Grasso received a letter from the Retirement Board of the ERSRI advising him that his pension “had been overpaid.” The letter stated that, for that reason, his pension would be suspended on September 30, 2012. According to Mr. Grasso’s complaint in PC 13-3121, the September 20, 2012 letter requested that he provide copies of his tax returns for the years 2003 to 2009 as well as “medical progress notes” from his treating physician from 2003 through 2011. The letter', 'The second of the cases before us (PC 14-4953) came to the Superior Court, as an appeal by Mr. Grasso from a decision of the Retirement Board of the ERSRI finding that Mr. Grasso was subject to §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24. The sole adverse party in that case was the ERSRI.', 'The two cases, PC 13-3121 and PC 14-4953, were consolidated in Superior Court, and a single bench decision was issued. The defendants have appealed in PC 13-3121 and petitioned for the issuance of a writ of certiorari in PC 14-4953, which petition this Court granted on November 28, 2016. We have consolidated the cases for the purposes of this appeal.', '-2- further informed him that he might be required to undergo an independent medical examination (IME) pursuant to § 45-21-23(a). After providing what the complaint in PC 13-3121 refers to as “certain medical documentation” to the Retirement Board, Mr. Grasso was notified that he was to contact a particular doctor to schedule an IME. On May 9, 2013, Mr. Grasso’s counsel met with the Retirement Board’s counsel to detail Mr. Grasso’s belief that his pension was not governed by § 45-21-23, which states that the Retirement Board may require a disability annuitant to undergo an IME at least once a year, and § 45-21-24, which provides that the Retirement Board shall adjust the amount of a disability annuitant’s pension based upon the beneficiary being engaged in a “gainful occupation.”2 Subsequent to that meeting, on June 27, 2013, Mr. Grasso proceeded to file his declaratory judgment action in PC 13-3121.3', 'Also subsequent to that May 9, 2013 meeting, on May 28, 2013, the Executive Director of the ERSRI rendered an administrative decision wherein he rejected Mr. Grasso’s contention that the ERSRI was not entitled to require him to undergo an IME or to adjust the amount of his pension based on his gainful employment as an attorney. Consequently, Mr. Grasso requested a hearing before the Retirement Board of the ERSRI. The Retirement Board appointed a hearing officer to hear Mr. Grasso’s matter. On September 12, 2013, a hearing was conducted before the hearing officer; and, on August 1, 2014, the hearing officer issued a decision rejecting Mr. Grasso’s arguments.', 'On September 25, 2014, the Retirement Board rendered its decision upholding the hearing officer’s determination in the case. Subsequently, on October 8, 2014, Mr. Grasso appealed the ERSRI’s decision to affirm the hearing officer to the Superior Court in PC 14-4953. 2', 'As the trial justice noted in her bench decision, Mr. Grasso was gainfully employed as an attorney at the pertinent time. 3', 'On September 9, 2013, defendants in PC 13-3121 filed a motion to dismiss, which was subsequently denied.', '-3-', 'On December 1, 2014, the Superior Court consolidated the two cases—PC 13-3121 and PC 14-4953. Thereafter, on June 22, 2015, Mr. Grasso moved for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action (PC 13-3121) and, on August 28, 2015, a corresponding cross- motion for summary judgment was filed. Subsequently, on November 5, 2015, the trial justice rendered a bench decision in Mr. Grasso’s favor in the consolidated cases. The defendants subsequently filed a notice of appeal in PC 13-3121 and a petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari in PC 14-4953, which petition this Court granted.', 'II', 'Issues Presented', 'Before this Court, defendants contend that the trial justice erred in denying their motion to dismiss PC 13-3121. They further posit that the trial justice misinterpreted the effect that a 1980 amendment to G.L. 1956 § 45-21.2-10 had on Mr. Grasso’s accidental disability pension in reaching her decision in the case. Additionally, defendants aver the following: (1) that the trial justice did not give proper deference to the ERSRI’s interpretation of the relevant statutes; (2) that the ERSRI is entitled to administer the pension authorized by chapter 21.2 of title 45 in the same manner as it administers pensions pursuant to chapter 21 of title 45, including applying §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24; (3) that the trial justice reached an absurd result; (4) that the trial justice incorrectly found § 45-21.2-10 to be unambiguous; and (5) that the General Assembly should not “be presumed to have granted a special pension benefit solely to one class of retirees in violation of statute.”', '-4-', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'Due to the fact that these consolidated cases come before this Court in different procedural postures, we will detail the standard of review applicable to each action.', 'In PC 13-3121, the trial justice granted Mr. Grasso’s motion for summary judgment and issued a declaratory judgment.

We are concerned in the instant case with chapters 21 and 21.2 of title 45 of the Rhode Island General Laws. Chapter 21 of title 45 is entitled “Retirement of Municipal Employees,” whereas chapter 21.2 of title 45 is entitled “Optional Retirement for', '-7- Members of Police Force and Fire Fighters.” It is undisputed that § 45-21.2-10 is the principal statute at issue and that it applies to Mr. Grasso. What is to be decided is the applicability of §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24.', 'Section 45-21.2-10 is entitled “Accidental disability allowance” and currently reads as follows:', '“The amount of retirement allowance for accidental disability is', 'that as prescribed in § 45-21-22.”4', 'However, prior to being amended in 1980 by P.L. 1980, ch. 59, § 2, § 45-21.2-10 read in its entirety as follows:', '“Upon retirement for accidental disability, a member shall receive', 'a retirement allowance equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent', '(66 2/3%) of the rate of his compensation at the date of disability.', 'Any member retiring and receiving a disability allowance shall be', 'subject to the provisions of §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24.” Mr. Grasso argued before the Superior Court that the 1980 amendment to § 45-21.2-10 rendered §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24 inapplicable to an individual receiving an accidental disability pension pursuant to chapter 21.2 of title 45.', 'Section 45-21-23, in pertinent part, provides a mechanism to require annual IMEs:', '“(a) At least once each year the retirement board may, and upon', 'application shall, require any disability annuitant under the', 'minimum age for service retirement, whether in receipt of an', 'ordinary disability retirement allowance or an accidental disability', 'retirement allowance, to undergo a medical examination, the', 'examination to be made at the place of residence of the annuitant,', 'or other place mutually agreed upon, by a physician or physicians', 'engaged by the retirement board.” 4', 'Section 45-21-22 provides as follows:', '“Upon retirement for accidental disability, a member receives a', 'retirement allowance equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66', '2/3%) of the rate of the member’s compensation at the date of the', 'member’s retirement subject to the provisions of § 45-21-31.”', '-8- Section 45-21-24 reads as follows:', '“(a) Should the beneficiary be engaged in a gainful occupation or', 'should the beneficiary be offered service as a result of the placing', 'of his or her name on a list of candidates, the retirement board shall', 'adjust, and from time to time readjust, the amount of his or her', 'disability allowance to an amount which, when added to the', 'amount of compensation then earnable by the beneficiary, shall not', 'exceed the rate of earnable compensation currently in force for the', 'classification that the disability annuitant held prior to retirement.', '“(b) Should any disability annuitant under the minimum age of', 'retirement refuse to submit to a medical examination in any year', 'by a physician or physicians designated by the retirement board,', 'the annuitant’s retirement allowance may be discontinued until the', 'annuitant’s withdrawal of the refusal, and should the annuitant’s', 'refusal continue for one year after a request has been made, all the', 'annuitant’s rights in and to the retirement allowance may be', 'revoked by the retirement board. A disability annuitant, reinstated', 'to active service, shall be reinstated as a member and participate in', 'the benefits of the retirement system to the same extent as any', 'other member.” Accordingly, the issues before the Court are whether or not, under the post-1980 version of § 45- 21.2-10, the ERSRI can require an annuitant receiving an accidental disability pension pursuant to chapter 21.2 of title 45 to undergo annual IMEs—as provided for in § 45-21-23—and whether or not the ERSRI can consider the annuitant’s other earnings in determining the amount of his or her pension—as provided for in § 45-21-24.', 'The trial justice held that Mr. Grasso was not subject to §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24. She began by addressing the declaratory judgment action that was pending before her.', 'In her judgment, § 45-21.2-10 was “clear and unambiguous” and addressed “only the amount of the benefit,” without reference to §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24. She further found that § 45-21-22, to which § 45-21.2-10 refers, was also clear and unambiguous and required no “judicial interpretation.” The trial justice proceeded to reject defendants’ arguments that a ruling in Mr.', '-9- Grasso’s favor would produce an absurd result. She stated that “the Legislature knew what they were doing and made a decision to do it;” and she added the following:', '“Police officers and firefighters are subject to a variety of', 'very dangerous risks on a daily basis. The recognition of these', 'risks likely prompted the alternate retirement system in the first', 'place. The Legislature sought to retain the IME adjustment', 'provisions for those firefighters and police officers who suffered', 'from ordinary disability. But when it came time to look at it as it', 'related to on-the-job injuries, they chose to go in a different', 'direction.', '“It is not absurd to find that the Legislature intended to', 'provide those facing such risks with a more appealing retirement', 'plan in the event that those risks materialized into actual harms.” The trial justice also opined that “the General Assembly knew exactly what they were doing when they amended 45-21.2-10 and did so * * * to remove the obligations under 45-21-23 and 24 * * *. The Court finds no support for any argument that they did it other than by design.” In accord with that just-summarized reasoning, the trial justice then granted Mr. Grasso’s motion for summary judgment and denied the cross-motion for summary judgment.5', 'The trial justice then turned her attention to the administrative appeal. She stated that she was giving the Retirement Board’s interpretation a “lower level of deference,” as opposed to “broad deference,” because the issue was “one of pure statutory interpretation,” not requiring any “[t]echnical or specialized expertise.” The trial justice then referred back to her bench decision with respect to the declaratory judgment action and found the Retirement Board’s decision to be “erroneous;” she reversed that decision. 5', 'The trial justice denied the cross-motion for summary judgment except for “the individual nature of the claims against Raimondo and Karpinski;” as previously discussed (see footnote 1, supra), Governor Raimondo and Mr. Karpinski prevailed in Superior Court on the claims against them in their individual capacities. That portion of the Superior Court judgment is not contested on appeal before this Court.', '- 10 -', 'In conducting our de novo review in this case, we remain cognizant of Justice Felix Frankfurter’s statement that “[t]he search for significance in the silence of [the Legislature] is too often the pursuit of a mirage.”', 'Scripps-Howard Radio, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission, 316 U.S. 4, 11 (1942). We have struggled long and hard in pursuing that mirage in the instant case. In the end, it is our judgment that, while we admire the trial justice’s thoroughness and respect her perspective, we simply cannot agree with her conclusion. We do agree with the trial justice that granting an accidental disability pension which would continue with no requirement for submitting to IMEs or for the reporting of other gainful employment would not necessarily be absurd; the General Assembly may well have the residual right to provide for such a pension. However, the General Assembly would have to be pellucidly explicit if it should wish to do something so extraordinary. Statutory silence alone is quite inadequate to convey such an intent in a case of this nature.', 'We begin our analysis with the basic principle of statutory construction that, when a statutory section is clear and unambiguous, we apply the plain and ordinary meaning of the statute and we need not delve into any further statutory interpretation. State v. Diamante, 83 A.3d 546, 548 (R.I. 2014). “It is only when a statute is ambiguous that we apply the rules of statutory construction and examine the statute in its entirety to determine the intent and purpose of the Legislature.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Prior to 1980, § 45-21.2-10 contained an explicit reference to §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24. However, in 1980 the removal of the explicit reference to those statutory sections was not the only change made by the General Assembly. The entire then-existing section was removed and replaced by a simple cross-reference to § 45-21-22. It is unclear whether or not that reference to § 45-21-22 was meant to also encompass other sections of chapter 21, since those sections would', '- 11 - apply to any pensions provided by § 45-21-22. Moreover, §§ 45-21-23(a) and 45-21-24(b), by their blunt language, apply to “any disability annuitant.” (Emphasis added.) Creating further ambiguity, § 45-21.2-4 provides that the optional retirement system provided for in chapter 21.2 is to be “administered in the same manner provided in chapter 21”—while leaving the term “administered” utterly devoid of any clarifying definition.6 For these reasons, it is self-evident to us that there is substantial ambiguity as to which sections of chapter 21 apply to an accidental disability pension under chapter 21.2.', 'In attempting to resolve that ambiguity, we are mindful of the fact that, “[i]n matters of statutory interpretation our ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Alessi v. Bowen Court Condominium, 44 A.3d 736, 740 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of New England, Inc. v.

As such, it would be inappropriate for us to look at § 45- 21.2-10 in a vacuum; we must consider it in light of the entire statutory scheme. See State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 485 (R.I. 2013) (“[W]e must consider the entire statute as a whole; individual sections must be considered in the context of the entire statutory scheme, not as if each section were independent of all other sections.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); State v.

We consider the following venerable and perceptive maxim of statutory construction so felicitiously worded by the California Supreme Court to be an especially helpful guide in this matter:', '“Wherever possible, a statute is to be construed in a way', 'which will render it reasonable, fair and harmonious with its', 'manifest purpose, and which will conform with the spirit of the act.', '* * * Therefore, * * * when a suggested construction of a statute in', 'any given case necessarily involves a decided departure from what', 'may be fairly said to be the plain purpose of the enactment, such', 'construction will not be adopted to the exclusion of a possible,', 'plausible interpretation which will promote and put in operation', 'the legislative intent.” Los Angeles County v.

Its specific purpose is to provide for an accidental disability pension for a police officer or firefighter who is injured on the job and cannot work due to his or her disability. We simply cannot say, based on the statutory scheme with which we are confronted, that the intent and purpose of the statutes was to provide such a benefit for life regardless of whether or not the police officer or firefighter is still disabled or is able to earn from another source the same (or greater) income than he or she would have earned as a police officer or firefighter. Based on the purpose of the statute—to', '- 13 - provide a pension to a police officer or firefighter who is disabled and cannot work—it is our unblinking view that the most plausible interpretation of this ambiguous statutory scheme is that the General Assembly intended for an accidental disability pension under § 45-21.2-10 to be subject to the IME and income-reporting requirements of §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24.', 'See Frisbie, 122 P.2d at 532; see also Bailey, 610 A.2d at 119. Otherwise, this Court would be failing to follow the most reasonable, fair, and harmonious construction of the statutory scheme. See Frisbie, 122 P.2d at 532.', 'We are buoyed in our conclusion about the statutory issue before us by the oft-repeated metaphorical maxim relied upon by the United States Supreme Court to the effect that a legislature, in enacting statutes, is not wont to “hide elephants in mouseholes.” Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001); see also Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp., 137 S.Ct. 973, 984 (2017); Environmental Protection Agency v.

We have no reason to infer in the instant case that the General Assembly hid an elephant in a mousehole and intended an otherwise quite unlikely result in such an important context when no language in the statute clearly evinces such an intent. See, e.g., Czyzewski, 137 S.Ct. at 984 (“The importance of the priority system leads us to expect more than simple statutory silence if, and when, Congress were to intend a major departure.”); Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust, 136 S.Ct. 1938, 1947 (2016) (“Had Congress intended to alter th[is] fundamental detai[l] of municipal bankruptcy, we would expect the text of the amended definition to say so.”) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); Burwell v.

The General Assembly has not sounded a clarion call to that effect, but it has left us to grapple with the sounds of silence.', 'In conclusion, we acknowledge that the General Assembly may well have the residual right to provide for an accidental disability pension without the requirement of periodic IMEs or the reporting of other gainful employment. However, we reiterate that the General Assembly would have to be pellucidly explicit if it should wish to do something so extraordinary in such an important context; it would require much more tangible evidence of legislative intent than the stark statutory silence left after the 1980 amendment to § 45-21.2-10. Accordingly, we hold that Mr. Grasso is subject to §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24; and he may be required to undergo an IME from time to time at the direction of the Retirement Board and to submit such financial information as may be requested in accordance with § 45-21-24. 7', 'Although the United States Supreme Court’s opinion in Food and Drug Administration v.

We remand the record to that tribunal.', 'Chief Justice Suttell, dissenting.', 'The majority decries the lack of a clarion call signaling legislative intent and observes that it, therefore, must grapple with the sounds of silence. Yet it hears a veritable symphony within that statutory silence.', 'The first movement is a lively allegro of statutory references and cross-references in which the majority seeks to create dissonance and ambiguity. It reads into the post-1980 version of G.L. 1956 § 45-21.2-10 the pre-1980 references to G.L. 1956 §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24, references which the General Assembly conspicuously omitted in the 1980 amendment (P.L. 1980, ch. 59, § 2). The majority then looks to the cross-reference in the post-1980 version of § 45-21.2-10 to § 45-21-22 and opines that the General Assembly may have intended that one “simple cross-reference” to encompass other sections of chapter 21 of title 45—notwithstanding the fact that it removed the specific cross-references to §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24.', 'The majority also finds disharmony in § 45-21.2-10 by examining the “blunt language” of §§ 45-21-23(a) and 45-21-24(b) which provide that these latter sections apply to “any disability annuitant.” Finally, in a climactic crescendo, the majority notes that further ambiguity is created by § 45-21.2-4, which provides that the optional retirement system under chapter 45- 21.2 is to be “administered in the same manner provided in chapter 21.” Yet it turns a deaf ear to the second verse of § 45-21.2-4 that “where the provisions of [chapter 21] conflict with [chapter 21.2], then the provision of * * * chapter [21.2] control.”', '- 16 -', 'In the second movement, more of an adagio, the majority attempts to resolve the discord it has perceived by construing § 45-21.2-10 in a manner that is “reasonable, fair, and harmonious.” It does so by scoring back into § 45-21.2-10 the independent medical examination and income-reporting requirements of §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24. Finally, the concluding coda poses a rhetorical question involving an injured, but fully recovered, policeman with a multimillion-dollar baseball contract.', 'Although I applaud the compositional skills of the majority, I respectfully must depart from its analysis. In my view, § 45-21.2-10 does not result in an auditory void, nor does it create ambiguity. Rather, in very clear and crystalline notes it prescribes the amount of retirement allowance for accidental disability for police and firefighters under the optional retirement system created by chapter 21.2. Section 45-21.2-10 provides in its entirety: “The amount of retirement allowance for accidental disability is that as prescribed in § 45-21-22[,]” which section is itself clear and unambiguous.8 One need and ought to go no further. Neither §§ 45- 21.2-10 nor 45-21-22 reprise the requirements of §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24.', 'I might agree with my colleagues in the majority that, as a matter of policy, an accidental disability beneficiary under chapter 21.2 of title 45 should be subject to periodic medical examinations and a reduction of disability allowance if gainfully employed. The situation before us concerning Mr. Grasso is a prime example; and, a fortiori, the multimillion-dollar baseball player scenario approaches the absurd. Yet there are legitimate reasons for treating police and firefighters who receive an accidental disability retirement allowance differently from other 8', 'General Laws 1956 § 45-21-22 provides: “Upon retirement for accidental disability, a member receives a retirement allowance equal to sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66⅔%) of the rate of the member’s compensation at the date of the member’s retirement subject to the provisions of § 45-21-31.” Section 45-21-31 concerns an offset for workers’ compensation benefits or damages received in a personal injury action; it has no bearing on the issues raised in this appeal.', '- 17 - accidental disability beneficiaries. In my view, it is a question of policy properly assigned to the legislature. I am simply not prepared to attempt to divine what the General Assembly intended to mean when it spoke in such clear and comprehensible language. Consequently, I respectfully dissent.', 'Justice Flaherty, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority. I do so because G.L. 1956 § 45-21.2-10, clearly and unambiguously, states that “[t]he amount of retirement allowance for accidental disability is that as prescribed in § 45-21-22.” The question we have been asked to decide is whether the language of that statute subjects the plaintiff to the additional requirements that are set forth in G.L. 1956 §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24. It is readily apparent from the above-quoted language that § 45-21.2-10 is silent on that question. However, that silence does not in and of itself create ambiguity, as the majority concludes. Rather, I am of the opinion that the words of the statute are crystal clear, “[t]he amount of retirement allowance for accidental disability is that as prescribed in § 45-21-22”—nothing more. A commonsense reading of § 45-21.2-10’s plain language—language wholly devoid of any references to §§ 45- 21-23 and 45-21-24—compels me, therefore, to conclude that the plaintiff is not subject to the IME and income-reporting requirements set forth in §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24. I must therefore dissent.', '“Ambiguity exists only when a word or phrase in a statute is susceptible of more than one reasonable meaning.” Drs. Pass & Bertherman, Inc. v. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island, 31 A.3d 1263, 1269 (R.I. 2011). As we have explained on multiple occasions, “[b]ecause ambiguity lurks in every word, sentence, and paragraph in the eyes of a skilled advocate * * * the question is not whether there is an ambiguity in the metaphysical sense, but whether the language', '- 18 - has only one reasonable meaning when construed, not in a hypertechnical fashion, but in an ordinary, common sense manner.” In re Proposed Town of New Shoreham Project, 25 A.3d 482, 505 n.30 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Lazarus v. Sherman, 10 A.3d 456, 464 (R.I. 2011)). In my opinion, § 45-21.2-10 is not susceptible of more than one reasonable meaning, either in the metaphysical sense or through the application of common sense. The statute simply makes no mention of §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24; therefore, the requirements of those statutes should not be grafted onto the plain terms of § 45-21.2-10.', 'Respectfully, I cannot fathom where or how the majority perceives ambiguity. It is true that chapter 21.2 of title 45, on the whole, contains a number of express references to chapter 21 and that pursuant to § 45-21.2-4, chapter 21.2 is to be “administered in the same manner provided in chapter 21 * * *.” The majority correctly notes that there are a number of cross- references to chapter 21 in chapter 21.2. Importantly, § 45-21.2-10 is one of those sections, but it refers only to § 45-21-22 and to no other section in the chapter. The lack of further cross- references, particularly to §§ 45-21-23 or 45-21-24, in § 45-21.2-10 helps to render, in the view of the majority, this statutory scheme ambiguous. To be sure, the General Assembly included certain cross-references to chapter 21 throughout chapter 21.2. Yet it did not include any references to §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24 in § 45-21.2-10. Therefore, I am compelled to conclude that § 45-21.2-10 does not require plaintiff to undergo an IME pursuant to § 45-21-23 or to report income pursuant to § 45-21-24.', 'We have long adhered to the presumption “that the General Assembly knows the ‘state of existing relevant law when it enacts or amends a statute.’” Power Test Realty Co.

Germain, 503 U.S. 249, 253-54 (1992))). Thus, when the General Assembly amended chapter 21.2 in 1980 (P.L. 1980, ch. 59, § 2), we must presume that it knew exactly which provisions it deemed subject to chapter 21 and which it did not, and that it did not act through oversight, inadvertence, or neglect. With that in mind, I can conclude only that § 45-21.2-10 is deliberately silent on that point and that only § 45-21-22 applies to § 45-21.2-10 because that is the only section expressly mentioned. See Shine v. Moreau, 119 A.3d 1, 10 (R.I. 2015) (“[W]e adhere to ‘the maxim that the plain statutory language is the best indicator of legislative intent.’” (quoting Marques v. Pawtucket Mutual Insurance Co., 915 A.2d 745, 747 (R.I. 2007))). The statutory framework is not ambiguous and therefore should be construed as written.', 'Moreover, even if § 45-21.2-10 were ambiguous, as the majority has concluded, I would be persuaded nonetheless that its terms are not subject to §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24.', 'In grappling with the ambiguity it somehow discovers in the statute, the majority properly embarks on an examination of “the entire statute to ascertain the intent and purpose of the Legislature.” Prew v. Employee Retirement System of Providence, 139 A.3d 556, 560 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Trant v. Lucent Technologies, 896 A.2d 710, 712 (R.I. 2006)); see also Mancini v. City of Providence, 155 A.3d 159, 162-63 (R.I. 2017). Certainly, I do not quarrel with the majority’s conclusion that the overall purpose underlying chapter 21.2 is to provide a retirement system for municipal police officers and firefighters. I do, however, diverge from the majority’s illation', '- 20 - that interpreting § 45-21.2-10 in a manner that exempts plaintiff from the requirements set forth in §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24 would contravene legislative intent.', 'For me, to resolve any ambiguity which might lurk here, we need not look any further than the straightforward legislative history of § 45-21.2-10. To borrow a phrase from the venerable Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, “a page of history is worth a volume of logic.” New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U.S. 345, 349 (1921). As the majority succinctly explains, prior to 1980, § 45-21.2-10 contained express references to §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24. Significantly, though, the General Assembly amended § 45-21.2-10 in 1980, deleting any and all references to those sections. In their place, the General Assembly inserted a reference to § 45-21-22. Since 1980, § 45-21.2-10 has remained unchanged. I can reach only one conclusion from that history: The General Assembly decided, in its legislative wisdom, that pensions governed by § 45-21.2- 10 should not be subject to the requirements set forth in §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24.', 'Again, we have long operated under the presumption that “the General Assembly knows the ‘state of existing relevant law when it enacts or amends a statute.’” Power Test Realty Co. Limited Partnership, 134 A.3d at 1222 (quoting DiPrete, 845 A.2d at 287). And we ought to do so with the notion that the General Assembly does not do so unwittingly. Hamer, 138 S.Ct. at 20. When the General Assembly deleted the language that would have subjected pensioners in plaintiff’s position to §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24, the General Assembly made its intent known. See Nolan v. Representative Council of Newport, 73 R.I. 498, 501-02, 57 A.2d 730, 732 (1948) (explaining that this Court could not treat the General Assembly’s deletion of a word “as a legislative oversight and supply the omitted word”); see also Estate of Eglee, 119 R.I. 786, 789- 90, 383 A.2d 586, 588-89 (1978). The silence in § 45-21.2-10 was deliberate, and the meaning', '- 21 - of that deliberate silence is abundantly clear: Plaintiff is not subject to the requirements set forth in §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24.', 'This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the General Assembly has expressly informed us that pensions subject to chapter 21 and accidental disability pensions subject to chapter 21.2 are to be treated differently. Indeed, § 45-21.2-4 mandates, “where the provisions of [chapter 21] conflict with [chapter 21.2], then the provision[s] of [chapter 21.2] control.” It could not be clearer that, in amending § 45-21.2-10, the General Assembly opted to exempt pensioners governed by chapter 21.2 from the requirements of §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24.', 'According to § 45-21.2-10’s plain language, plaintiff is not subject to the requirements of §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24. It may be unpalatable that plaintiff is not subject to a yearly IME or to income-reporting requirements, but that is for the General Assembly to determine, not this Court.9 We should not rewrite the statute simply because we disagree with it.', 'Our holding today, adopting a rule that would require a clear, indeed “pellucid” statement by the General Assembly with respect to a municipal police officer’s accidental disability pension is anathema to our case law and to political realities.10 There are times when legislative silence speaks volumes. This is one of those times. As we have held, “[w]here the legislature in amending an act thus purposely omits words in the amended act the court has no authority to 9', 'Of note, the statute governing the disability pensions of members of the state police is also silent with respect to whether the members of that department are subject to IME’s or income- reporting requirements. See G.L. 1956 § 42-28-21(a). 10', 'In the view of the majority, to convey that pensions governed by G.L. 1956 § 45-21.2-10 are not subject to the requirements set forth in G.L. 1956 §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24, the General Assembly would have been required to amend § 45-21.2-10 to read something along the lines of, “The amount of retirement allowance for accidental disability is that as prescribed in § 45-21-22. The requirements set forth in §§ 45-21-23 and 45-21-24 do not apply.” Amendment by deletion is no longer an option. This is a remarkable statement by this Court.', '- 22 - supply the omitted words.” Nolan, 73 R.I. at 502, 57 A.2d at 732. I see no reason to depart from such sound reasoning now.

This appeal arises from a tragically fatal car accident in Providence caused by a juvenile after he stole a van from Nickerson’s premises. The plaintiffs subsequently brought a negligence action against Nickerson. After a summary judgment hearing, the hearing justice granted the defendant’s motion on the grounds that the defendant did not owe a duty to the plaintiffs. On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that genuine issues of material fact remain in dispute, and therefore the hearing justice erred in concluding that the defendant did not owe a duty to the plaintiffs. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'We will refer to Alexis Silva and Nevaeha Coelho by their first names to avoid any confusion.', '1', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On September 25, 2010, a fourteen-year-old boy stole a red transport van—emblazoned with “Nickerson Community Center” on its side—and took it for a joyride, hitting a car on Manton Avenue in Providence and fleeing the scene in the vehicle. Next, attempting to evade police, the juvenile sped onto Route 10 heading southbound, by way of Westminster Street. The juvenile drove faster, headed toward Union Avenue, striking a black Honda. The van then crossed over into the northbound side of the expressway, colliding with a silver Nissan.', 'Flynn was driving the silver Nissan, and three passengers were in the car, including her two minor daughters, Nevaeha and Alexis. After the vehicle was hit by the red van, Alexis sustained fatal injuries, and Flynn and Nevaeha were transported to the hospital with severe injuries.', 'Later that day, Providence police officers responded to a report of a breaking and entering at Nickerson, which is a nonprofit organization located in the Olneyville section of Providence. The organization provides social services to residents in the area, including day care, after-school programs, and services for veterans; the building also houses a food pantry and clothing donation center. At the time of the break-in, Nickerson was closed for the weekend.', 'When the police officers arrived at the property, a Nickerson employee, Kingray Rojas, met them. Rojas told the police that a rear window screen had been broken and an individual had entered the building. Rojas stated that the person had gone into an office and rummaged through a cabinet that had been left open. Additionally, Rojas told police, the thief had taken the keys to the van that were stored on a hook on a closet door and had stolen the van, later', '2 identified as the red van involved in the Route 10 accident. The juvenile was subsequently charged in the Family Court.', 'On September 18, 2013, plaintiffs filed a complaint alleging negligence in Providence County Superior Court against Nickerson and Aetna Bridge Company.2 The plaintiffs contended that Nickerson owed a duty of care to them and that it breached its duty by failing to secure the van’s keys. Nickerson filed a third-party complaint against the juvenile for indemnity.', 'On July 9, 2015, Nickerson filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that it did not owe a duty to plaintiffs because it did not have a special relationship either with plaintiffs or with the juvenile who stole the van and caused the accident. In support of its motion, Nickerson submitted, inter alia, an affidavit from Lisa D’Ambra, the then-President of Nickerson’s Board of Directors and acting Executive Director at the time of the 2010 incident. In the affidavit, D’Ambra stated that Nickerson had been closed during the September break-in and that the juvenile had gained access to the building by breaking a window screen and “forc[ing] open a window.” The affidavit also described Nickerson employees’ observations of the building after the break-in as “ransacked” in areas. Further, D’Ambra attested to the fact that the van keys were always kept in a closet in Nickerson’s reception area when they were not being used. She also stated that no Nickerson-owned vehicle had ever been stolen prior to this incident.3', 'In response, plaintiffs submitted their opposition to Nickerson’s motion for summary judgment, supporting it with various exhibits, including two conflicting statements from the juvenile: one statement that he had made to a Rhode Island State Police detective shortly after the accident, and one statement that he had made to a Department of Children, Youth and 2', 'The plaintiffs dismissed all claims against Aetna Bridge Company on May 28, 2014. 3', 'The plaintiffs provided evidence that at least one vehicle owned by other individuals had been stolen from Nickerson’s premises prior to the accident.', '3 Families (DCYF) social worker more than a month after the accident, neither of which was a sworn statement. In his interview with the detective, the juvenile said that an unidentified Nickerson employee had told him where the van keys were located inside the building. Then, when the juvenile was assessed by the social worker as part of a court evaluation, he contended that he had seen the keys in the van’s ignition, prompting him to steal it.', 'The plaintiffs also attached to their objection numerous police reports evidencing unrelated criminal activity at the Nickerson property.', 'The plaintiffs argued that this documentation of rampant crime, particularly break-ins at Nickerson and reports of vehicles broken into and stolen from Nickerson’s premises gave Nickerson notice that the theft of the van and subsequent fatal motor vehicle accident were possible. Additionally, plaintiffs submitted that the deposition of Mario Cabral, a Nickerson employee for sixteen years, revealed that, prior to this incident, Nickerson vans had been vandalized, including broken windows and stolen license plates.', 'Furthermore, plaintiffs provided evidence of Nickerson’s security protocols in an attempt to demonstrate that, had those policies been followed, there would have been no way for the juvenile to access the keys.', 'For example, in a witness statement to police, Betty Ann Palmisciano, a board member at Nickerson, explained that the van keys were stored in the reception area of the building in “a closet with a lock box.”4 In her deposition, D’Ambra also described this policy, stating that the reception area itself was also locked at the end of the night, in an effort to prevent the keys from ending up with the wrong person.', 'On February 23, 2016, the hearing justice heard arguments on defendant’s motion for summary judgment, and he ultimately granted the motion. The hearing justice highlighted the 4', 'However, Mario Cabral testified at his deposition that the keys were kept inside a locked closet, but he added that there was “not a lockbox” inside the closet.', '4 parties’ different versions of events that purportedly occurred on the day of the accident. The defendant, the hearing justice acknowledged, maintained that the building was locked on the day in question and that the juvenile broke in and stole the van keys from a closet located in an “employee’s [sic] only” area. Then, defendant averred, the juvenile used those keys to access the van parked in the parking lot, and he drove the van off the premises.', 'The plaintiffs countered defendant’s rendition of the events, asserting that there were at least three plausible scenarios5 that might have occurred before the juvenile caused the accident on Route 10. The three scenarios are as follows: (1) a Nickerson employee informed the juvenile where he could find the keys, which is what the juvenile told police after the accident; (2) Nickerson could have failed to follow its security protocols in the building, which would have allowed the juvenile easier access to the keys inside the building; or (3) a Nickerson employee could have left the keys in the van’s ignition.', 'Initially, the hearing justice recognized that a motion for summary judgment can only be based on admissible evidence. He first focused on determining whether defendant owed a legal duty to plaintiffs. The hearing justice concluded that there was no special relationship between Nickerson and plaintiffs or between Nickerson and the juvenile.6 The hearing justice also determined that there was no evidence that the keys were made available to the juvenile.', 'However, even assuming that the keys had been left in the van’s ignition, the hearing justice declined to expand the current duty that vehicle owners owe to the public, absent this Court’s extension of existing case law or the adoption of new legislation. Accordingly, the 5', 'The plaintiffs once again advance these three possible scenarios on appeal. 6', 'The hearing justice noted that the only evidence of any connection between Nickerson and the juvenile were the two statements by the juvenile after the theft. He determined that those two contradictory statements were inadmissible hearsay and not proper for consideration in deciding a motion for summary judgment.', '5 hearing justice ruled that, because there was no relationship between Nickerson and the juvenile, Nickerson had no duty to control the juvenile’s actions, and the theft “was an unforeseeable independent cause of [p]laintiff[s’] harm.”', 'Consequently, the hearing justice granted Nickerson’s motion for summary judgment.', 'The plaintiffs timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, plaintiffs first contend that there are a number of genuine issues of material fact that must be resolved by a jury. The plaintiffs posit three factual scenarios that arguably could have been catalysts for the van theft, and they argue that there are factual issues as to whether Nickerson violated its security policies and whether one of its employees informed the juvenile of the keys’ location. Additionally, plaintiffs maintain that the juvenile stated at one point that the keys were in the van’s ignition when he stole it. Therefore, plaintiffs urge this Court to adopt a test used in some other jurisdictions that imposes a duty on defendants who leave their keys in their vehicle’s ignition, eventually resulting in an accident, when other factors are at issue, such as location in a high-crime area.', 'The defendant counters that only one of the three factual scenarios proposed by plaintiffs is supported by admissible evidence: that the juvenile broke into Nickerson’s building through a back window, stole the van keys from inside a closet, and then stole the red van. Alternatively, defendant avers that, even if this Court considers plaintiffs’ other factual scenarios, Rhode Island law does not support the existence of a legal duty in those situations. Furthermore, defendant argues that Rhode Island’s negligence case law does not support the adoption of the “special circumstances” test used by other jurisdictions and promoted by plaintiffs in this appeal.', '6 Additionally, defendant contends that, even if there were a duty, there is no evidence that Nickerson proximately caused plaintiffs’ injuries.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', '“In reviewing the granting of a motion for summary judgment, this Court engages in a de novo review, ‘apply[ing] the same standards and rules as did the motion justice.’” Danforth v.

We believe both the statement to the social worker and the statement to the detective are too conjectural to be considered in a summary judgment analysis. First, in order for the “[s]tatement against interest” hearsay exception to apply pursuant to Rule 804(b)(3),8 the declarant must be unavailable. There is no evidence that 7', 'In addition to the three arguments which apply to both statements, plaintiffs also argue that the statement to the social worker is admissible under the “public records and reports” exception to the hearsay rule outlined in Rule 803(8) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, which provides, in relevant part:', '“Records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of', 'public offices or agencies, setting forth (A) the activities of the', 'office or agency, or (B) matters observed pursuant to duty imposed', 'by law as to which matters there was a duty to report, excluding,', 'however, in criminal cases matters observed by police officers and', 'other law enforcement personnel * * *.” The language in Rule 803(8) “substantially tracks the language of its federal counterpart,” Rule 803(8) of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and so we turn to federal case law for guidance. State v. Traficante, 636 A.2d 692, 695 (R.I. 1994).', 'Here, the social worker’s report contains a summary of what the juvenile told the social worker, making the statement double hearsay; and, accordingly, this exception does not apply. See United States v. Mackey, 117 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 1997) (“[H]earsay statements by third persons * * * are not admissible under this exception merely because they appear within public records.”); see also Goodman v.

Consequently, this exception does not apply. Second, to be considered nonhearsay under Rule 801(d)(2)(A), a statement must be “the party’s own statement” and “offered against a party.” Further, Rule 801(d)(2)(A) does not apply to statements of a party that are “not offered against” that party. See State v. Chum, 54 A.3d 455, 463 (R.I. 2012). Here, the statements were not offered against the juvenile as an adverse party because plaintiffs sought to introduce them against Nickerson rather than against the juvenile. Even though the juvenile is a third-party defendant in the action, he is not adverse to plaintiffs for purposes of their claims against Nickerson.

The plaintiffs contend that Nickerson may have failed to follow its security protocols, which would have allowed the juvenile easier access to the van keys inside the building. To establish a negligence claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate “a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.” Wells v.

Gitlow, 91 A.3d 805,', '815 (R.I. 2014). In addition, “[t]he ‘relationship between the parties’ * * * [is also a consideration] in our duty analysis.” Gushlaw, 42 A.3d at 1257 (quoting Selwyn v. Ward, 879 A.2d 882, 887 (R.I. 2005)).', '1', 'Rhode Island Case Law', 'Ordinarily in Rhode Island, no legal duty exists “to control a third party’s conduct to prevent harm to another individual.” Santana v. Rainbow Cleaners, Inc., 969 A.2d 653, 658', '12 (R.I. 2009). However, we have carved out an exception in circumstances where “a defendant has a special relationship with either the person whose conduct needs to be controlled or with the intended victim of the conduct.” Id.', 'For example, in Volpe v. Gallagher, 821 A.2d 699 (R.I. 2003), we determined that the defendant, who was both the landowner and the mother of a mentally-ill son who murdered a neighbor with a firearm, owed “a duty to exercise reasonable care so to control the conduct of [her son] as to prevent him from intentionally harming others or from so conducting himself as to create an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to them[.]” Id. at 702, 709 (quoting Restatement (Second) Torts § 318 at 126-27 (1965), entitled “Duty of Possessor of Land or Chattels to Control Conduct of Licensee”). There, the defendant’s son kept guns and ammunition in the basement of defendant’s house. Id. at 708. We held that a jury could reasonably conclude that the defendant either “knew or had reason to know that she had the ability to control her son with respect” to the storage of such weapons on her property. Id. at 707.', 'Additionally, in Martin v. Marciano, 871 A.2d 911, 913, 914 (R.I. 2005), we held that one of the defendants, who hosted a party where alcohol was available to underage attendees, owed a duty to an attendee who was assaulted with a baseball bat by another partygoer. We acknowledged that ordinarily landowners do not have a duty “to protect [others] from harm caused by the dangerous or illegal acts of a third party[,]” but recognized an exception where a special relationship exists between parties “who provide intoxicants and those whom they serve.” Id. at 915. We held that the defendant-host, by providing alcohol to underage guests, owed a duty “to take reasonable steps to protect * * * guests from injury[,]” reasoning that such a holding was in accordance with a public policy against underage drinking, as evidenced by various statutes aimed at addressing the issue. Id. at 916. Furthermore, we concluded that, in the', '13 context of that case, it was “generally foreseeable that one of * * * [the] underage guests could have been the victim of an attack” at the party, given the defendant-host’s expectation of a large turnout and the reality “that the use of intoxicants frequently unduly excites the tempers, emotions and actions of those who indulge in them.” Id. at 917 (quoting Fisher v. Robbins, 319 P.2d 116, 126 (Wyo. 1957)).', 'In contrast, in Ouch, 963 A.2d at 631-32, we were faced with deciding whether a defendant-driver owed a duty to his passengers where the passengers were hit by gunfire aimed at the defendant’s vehicle by rival gang members. There, considering the duty-triggering factors, we declined to recognize any special relationship between the defendant-driver, who was a gang member, and the third-party rival gang members responsible for the shooting. Id. at 634. We also concluded that the gun violence was neither foreseeable nor related to the defendant-driver’s operation of the vehicle. Id. (“[The] defendant had no control over the murderous conduct of the gunman; nor are we convinced that he could have predicted the events of that evening.”).', 'Moreover, in Santana, 969 A.2d at 666, we determined that the defendant-mental health center did not have a duty to control its mental health patient who attacked a dry-cleaning employee with a crowbar. We reasoned that, in the absence of evidence supporting the patient’s need for involuntary commitment, the defendant did not owe a duty to the plaintiff to prevent the attack by certifying him to “an appropriate facility[,]” because imposing such a duty would contravene the statutory preference to treat patients in the least restrictive manner. Id. at 661, 666-67 (“If we imposed a duty in this case, * * * then mental health professionals, faced with a choice between initiating certification proceedings and potential liability, certainly would feel pressure to choose the former option.”).', '14', 'In Gushlaw, 42, A.3d at 1247, 1249, we also declined to impose a duty on an underage drinker to prevent his intoxicated friend whom he transported to the friend’s vehicle from subsequently driving and injuring a third party. There, the plaintiff’s husband was killed when his vehicle was hit by an intoxicated person, who had been dropped off at his car by the defendant. Id. at 1248-49. The defendant knew his friend was drunk when he left him at his vehicle. Id. at 1248. We held that there was no special relationship between the parties because the defendant had neither served the underage driver alcohol, nor had the driver consumed alcohol on the defendant’s premises. Id. at 1257. We concluded that the defendant did not have control over the driver’s conduct that caused the plaintiff’s harm. Id.', '2', 'Special Relationship', 'We first examine whether Nickerson owed any duty on the basis of a purported special relationship between Nickerson and either the juvenile or plaintiffs. When property owners', '“allow one or more persons to use their land or personal property,', 'they are, if present, under a conditional duty to exercise reasonable', 'care to control the conduct of such users to prevent them from', 'intentionally harming others or from conducting themselves on the', 'possessors’ property in a manner that would create an', 'unreasonable risk of bodily harm to others.” Volpe, 821 A.2d at', '706 (citing Restatement (Second) Torts, § 318 at 126-27). It is important to note, however, that, in order for a duty to exist, landowners must “know or have reason to know that they have the ability to control the person(s) using their land,” and, also “know or should know of the necessity and opportunity for exercising such control.” Id.', 'The juvenile in the present matter was trespassing on defendant’s property during a weekend when the facility was closed. The plaintiffs seem to suggest that Nickerson’s duty arises based on its identity as a landowner. However, here, Nickerson never gave the juvenile', '15 permission to enter the building, nor were any Nickerson employees present at the time of the theft, nor was there anything to demonstrate that the juvenile was known to defendant. See Santana, 969 A.2d at 665-66 (declining to recognize any special relationship where the plaintiff had failed to provide evidence of her attacker’s mental health condition at the time of his last appointment at the defendant-mental health center approximately four months before he attacked the plaintiff). As such, under a premises liability theory, Nickerson could not be held liable for any actions of the juvenile who broke into its closed facility because, generally, landowners owe no duty to trespassers. But see Volpe, 821 A.2d at 706 (noting that a special relationship “may arise between the possessor of land and those allowed on the land because of the possessor’s power of control over those allowed to enter” (quoting Chavez v. Torres, 991 P.2d 1, 5 (N.M. Ct. App. 1999))).', 'The plaintiffs suggest that defendant’s proposition that the juvenile broke into the facility is impossible unless Nickerson breached its security policies. Even if Nickerson violated all of its own security rules by failing to properly secure its premises or to lock the closet where the van keys were kept, we cannot extend a duty based on premises liability. While a break-in very well may have been foreseeable if a Nickerson employee left the building unlocked, it is much less foreseeable, if it is at all, that a thief would break into the building, steal the van keys, steal the van, then drive the van negligently, resulting in harm to plaintiffs driving on a nearby highway. We decline to recognize a duty because it would amount to imposing a duty of care on victims of illegal entries to unknown plaintiffs.', '16', '3', 'Banks Factors', 'a', 'Foreseeability', 'Absent a special relationship between Nickerson and the juvenile or plaintiffs, we consider a number of other factors in determining whether to impose a duty on defendant. To start, foreseeability is “[t]he linchpin in the analysis of whether a duty flows from a defendant to a plaintiff * * *.” Selwyn, 879 A.2d at 887. We have explained the need to “limit[] the scope of a defendant’s duty according to risks he or she reasonably perceived,” and we have expressed “that a duty must be based on conduct ‘sufficiently likely to result in the kind of harm’ suffered by the plaintiff * * *.” Id. (quoting Volpe, 821 A.2d at 705). Similarly, “in order to temper foreseeability * * * an adequate nexus must exist between the foreseeability of [the plaintiff’s] harm and the actions of the defendant.” Id. (quoting Marchetti v. Parsons, 638 A.2d 1047, 1051 (R.I. 1994)). However, “foreseeability of injury does not, in and of itself, give rise to a duty.” Gushlaw, 42 A.3d at 1261 (quoting Ferreira v. Strack, 636 A.2d 682, 688 n.4 (R.I. 1994)). Accordingly, we “consider the foreseeability issue in tandem with all factors germane to the duty analysis.” Id. The foreseeability inquiry “plays a variety of roles in tort doctrine generally; in some contexts it is a question of fact for the jury, whereas in other contexts it is part of the calculus to which a court looks in defining the boundaries of ‘duty.’” Martin, 871 A.2d at 917 (quoting Banks, 522 A.2d at 1226).', 'As we stated earlier, while it may have been foreseeable that Nickerson might be the victim of a break-in if one of its employees violated the security procedures, it cannot be said that the juvenile’s break-in, theft of the keys and the van, and subsequent accident that caused', '17 plaintiffs’ injuries were a foreseeable sequence of events resulting from Nickerson’s failure to lock the building. See Krier v. Safeway Stores 46, Inc., 943 P.2d 405, 407, 415-16 (Wyo. 1997) (declining to impose a duty to a defendant-landlord where a store employee was injured inside the building after a burglar broke in through the roof and stabbed the employee to death because the injury was not foreseeable even though the store had been broken into five times in twenty- two years). Therefore, we hold that the harm in this case—a fatal car accident—was not a foreseeable consequence of a break-in of Nickerson’s premises.', 'The plaintiffs make much of defendant’s location in the high-crime area of Olneyville. However, we have never held that a property’s location in a high-crime area, in and of itself, is a determinative factor in considering whether an individual owes a duty to another, and we will not do so here. See Thanadabouth v. Kongmany, 712 A.2d 879, 879, 880 (R.I. 1998) (mem.) (holding that the defendant-landlord had no duty to tenants to install additional outdoor lighting on premises to protect tenants from third-party criminal conduct, despite the high-crime nature of the neighborhood, while also noting that “there had been no prior criminal activity on the premises concerning either party”).', 'b', 'Closeness of Connection', 'As part of the duty analysis, we look next to the closeness of the connection between Nickerson’s purported negligence in violating its security protocols and plaintiffs’ injuries. See Gushlaw, 42 A.3d at 1256 (listing “the closeness of connection between the defendant’s conduct and the injury suffered” as a factor for consideration in the duty analysis (quoting Ferreira v. Strack, 652 A.2d 965, 967 (R.I. 1995) (Ferreira II))). The juvenile’s breaking and entering into Nickerson’s facility and subsequent theft of the van was his voluntary decision, allegedly', '18 facilitated by Nickerson’s purported failure to have adequately secured its property. See id. at 1261-62 (finding any closeness of connection minimal where intoxicated driver independently and voluntarily chose to drive his vehicle after being dropped off at the vehicle by the defendant).', 'Further, in between the accident that caused plaintiffs’ injuries and the time of the theft, the juvenile hit a parked car and fled the scene of that crash while evading police, then hit a second car, and finally drove across the median divider into plaintiffs’ oncoming car. Moreover, the juvenile’s crash with plaintiffs occurred some distance away from Nickerson. As such, the timeline of events in this case distances plaintiffs’ injuries from any action of Nickerson. See id. at 1262 n.20 (noting that harm was caused to the plaintiff by the drunk driver about one hour after the defendant dropped the intoxicated friend at his car).', 'c', 'Extent of Burden & Public Policy Concerns', 'Finally, we turn to the policy considerations in a case such as this. Nickerson contends that, if we were to extend a duty in this instance, it would “open[] the door to victims of theft [being] exposed to an additional loss: that of a civil action from persons who may later be injured by a thief’s misuse of their stolen property.” We are of the opinion that the burden on the defendant in such cases would be unreasonable because it would require both adequate security on buildings and locking of vehicle keys within a building.', 'Additionally, “it is not the function of this Court to act as a super legislative body and rewrite or amend statutes already enacted by the General Assembly.” Willis, 954 A.2d at 132 (quoting Bandoni v. State, 715 A.2d 580, 585 (R.I. 1998)). While we recognize the public policy', '19 concerns surrounding accidents caused by the thieves of stolen vehicles, it is not our role to “creat[e] * * * new causes of action[,]” and we will not do so here. Ferreira II, 652 A.2d at 968.', 'Further, it is significant to note the dire consequences that could result from an imposition of a duty in this case based solely on the high-crime area in which Nickerson is located. A number of courts have recognized the policy implications in these types of negligence actions. See, e.g., Kim v. Budget Rent A Car Systems, Inc., 15 P.3d 1283, 1287 (Wash. 2001) (explaining that imposing a duty based on a high rate of crime in a location could have the undesired consequence of “the departure of businesses from urban core areas” (quoting Hutchins v. 1001 Fourth Avenue Associates, 802 P.2d 1360, 1370 (Wash. 1991) (en banc))). For instance, “[b]usinesses may react by moving from poorer areas where crime rates are often the highest.” Bass v. Gopal, Inc., 716 S.E.2d 910, 915 (S.C. 2011) (quoting McClung v. Delta Square Limited Partnership, 937 S.W.2d 891, 900 (Tenn. 1996)). As for those businesses that remain, they “may take the elaborate [security] precautions” promoted by those courts that have extended a duty in situations such as the present matter, “and will pass on the added costs to their customers in the form of higher prices[,] * * * thereby increasing the costs of goods and services for the people least able to afford the higher prices.” Delgado v. Trax Bar & Grill, 113 P.3d 1159, 1181 (Cal. 2005) (Kennard, J., dissenting). These two unappealing options are even more concerning when we consider nonprofit organizations like Nickerson that are needed most in areas that experience high-crime rates. The individuals who currently benefit from Nickerson’s services would suffer if Nickerson is either forced to move from the area or is compelled to pass on the added costs in some way, such as terminating some of its current programs.', 'As such, imposing a duty on defendant here would be akin to imposing a duty on every person who stores car keys in his or her home, fails to effectively secure the house, and is the', '20 victim of theft by a criminal who breaks into the dwelling to steal the keys, the car, and then injures a third party in a subsequent motor vehicle accident. We decline to do so.11', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'While we sympathize with the victims of the horrific event at issue in this case, “[w]e do what we must, for ‘it is the duty of all courts of justice to take care, for the general good of the community, that hard cases do not make bad law.’” Roy v. State, 139 A.3d 480, 482 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Burnham v. Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, 873 F.2d 486, 487 (1st Cir. 1989)). Tragedy alone will not make a defendant liable for purported negligence, “absent a recognized duty of care.” Gushlaw, 42 A.3d at 1252. Because we hold that there was no duty of care owed by Nickerson in this case, the plaintiffs’ negligence claims against Nickerson must fail as a matter of law. The hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment was proper.', 'For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiffs’ appeal is denied and dismissed, and the judgment appealed from is affirmed. The papers in the case are remanded to the Superior Court. Justice Goldberg did not participate. 11', '“‘[T]he cardinal principle of judicial restraint’ is that ‘if it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more[.]’” Tempest v. State, 141 A.3d 677, 687 n.15 (R.I. 2016) (quoting PDK Laboratories, Inc. v. Drug Enforcement Administration, 362 F.3d 786, 799 (C.A.D.C. 2004) (Roberts, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)).

65,"Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary : Education and University of Rhode Island v. : American Association of University : Professors, Part-Time Faculty United, a/k/a URI/AAUP, PTFU.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education1 and the University of Rhode Island (collectively URI) appeal from a Superior Court judgment denying their motion to vacate an arbitration award and confirming the award. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause as to why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in part and vacate it in part. 1', 'The Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education is the successor corporation to the board of regents for education concerning postsecondary education and the board of governors for higher education. See G.L. 1956 § 16-59-1, as amended by P.L. 2014, ch. 145, art. 20, § 5.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'A', 'Grievance', 'Kenneth Jolicoeur, the grievant, was a long-term part-time faculty member at URI and a member of the American Association of University Professors, Part-Time Faculty United (the union). Jolicoeur had routinely taught two courses per semester and served as a coordinator in the Special Programs Office since the early 1990s. Jolicoeur was assigned two courses to teach during the fall 2013 semester. In addition, he received a “Special Programs Contract” from URI by letter dated August 21, 2013, informing him that he had “been tentatively assigned to teach the following: Course and Selection: Coordinate Special Programs Information Services.” Shortly thereafter, Jolicoeur received the following email from Associate Dean Kathryn Quina (Dean Quina):', '“As we noted previously, we cannot give you an additional', 'contract for coordinating if you are teaching two courses. We', 'worked out an arrangement with everyone this year to allow you to', 'coordinate plus teach one course, but we are limited to two', 'contracts. Do you wish to continue with both courses, and perhaps', 'pick up the coordinating role in the spring * * *.” Dean Quina later explained during the grievance process that, “in compliance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement and Labor Board decision, [Jolicoeur had] been provided with the maximum of two courses for the [f]all 2013 semester * * *.” Jolicoeur chose to give up the “Special Programs Contract,” but he did so “under protest.” Consequently, the union filed a grievance on Jolicoeur’s behalf based on the rescission of his “Special Programs Contract.” The', '-2- grievance proceeded through step four2 of the grievance procedure set out in Article XIII of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), but the dispute was left unresolved.', 'On December 23, 2010, the board of governors for higher education3 and the union had executed a CBA effective July 1, 2010, through June 30, 2012.', 'The CBA was set to automatically renew every year if neither party gave notice of a modification of the CBA. The record does not indicate that either party ever gave notice. The final language contained in the CBA is the result of an interest arbitration4 between the parties. During the interest arbitration, the union proposed the following provision to be included in the “Assignments” section of the CBA: “[a] part-time faculty assignment is normally two (2) courses per semester.” URI, on the other hand, did not submit any proposed language related to either a minimum or maximum number of assignments for part-time faculty. Ultimately, the interest arbitrator rejected the union’s proposed language because he found that data from URI on part-time faculty course assignments for the spring 2010 semester did not corroborate that norm. 2', 'Step four of the CBA’s grievance procedure provides:', '“If the grievance is not resolved in Step 3, it shall be submitted', 'within five (5) working days of the President’s decision to the', 'Commissioner of Higher Education or his/her designee, as agent', 'for the Board of Governors, who shall grant a hearing to the', 'aggrieved and a representative of the [union] within ten (10)', 'working days of the receipt of the written grievance. The', 'Commissioner or his/her designee shall render written decision', 'including reasons within ten (10) working days of the conclusion', 'of the hearing.” 3', 'As previously mentioned, the Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education succeeded the board of governors for higher education. See § 16-59-1. 4', 'When seeking to reach an agreement, interest arbitration is an alternative method to collective bargaining through which an employer and a union can submit unresolved disputes to an arbitrator.

Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc., 67 F.3d 1054, 1062 (2d Cir. 1995).', '-3-', 'B', 'Arbitration', 'The union filed a demand for arbitration on behalf of Jolicoeur on January 2, 2014, in accordance with the arbitration provision contained in Article XIII of the CBA. Section 13.4 of the arbitration provision provides that “grievances arising out of the provisions of [the CBA] relating to the application or interpretation or violation thereof may be submitted to arbitration.” The union’s demand for arbitration alleged that URI violated several articles of the CBA, including Article X concerning course assignments to part-time faculty members. The union sought compensation for Jolicoeur to make him whole after URI’s rescission of his “Special Programs Contract” and a “rejection” of URI’s imposition of a two-course part-time faculty assignment maximum.', 'Before the arbitrator, the union averred that the dispute was arbitrable because the CBA encompassed the rights that Jolicoeur alleged URI had infringed. The union further argued that URI’s imposition of the part-time faculty assignment limitation violated the CBA. In addition, the union contended that URI violated Article III’s nondiscrimination clause of the CBA when it rescinded the “Special Programs Contract.” For relief, the union, on Jolicoeur’s behalf, sought the salary for the rescinded “Special Programs Contract,” “an order that [URI] refrain from discriminating against the grievant for his [u]nion activity,” and an order that URI “cease and desist from so unilaterally imposing” such a limitation. In response, URI countered that the dispute was not substantively arbitrable because the CBA did not cover administrative assignments, such as the “Special Programs Contract.” Additionally, URI argued that it did not violate the CBA when it rescinded Jolicoeur’s “Special Programs Contract” nor did the union prove that it discriminated against Jolicoeur for his union activity.', '-4-', 'On October 14, 2014, the arbitrator issued an award. Therein, the arbitrator made several findings, including: (1) Jolicoeur was not discriminated against based on his union activity; (2) the dispute was arbitrable because the parties agreed to arbitrate disputes regarding the interpretation or application of Article X, and resolution of this dispute depended on interpretation of the CBA; and (3) URI violated the CBA by limiting Jolicoeur to two assignments for the fall 2013 semester. With respect to his third finding, the arbitrator reviewed the CBA to determine whether it contained the two-course limitation imposed by URI. Specifically, he examined Article X and concluded that it set forth the criteria for URI to assign courses to part-time faculty.', 'In addition, he found that Article I outlined the minimum requirements for part-time faculty to maintain bargaining-unit status with the union.', 'The arbitrator also considered the union’s proposal during the prior interest arbitration, which was ultimately rejected, to include language that part-time faculty are “normally” assigned two courses per semester.', 'After his review, the arbitrator concluded that neither Article X nor any other CBA provision imposed any limitation on part-time faculty assignments. Thus, he determined that URI’s rescission of Jolicoeur’s “Special Programs Contract” violated the CBA. The arbitration award required URI to pay Jolicoeur $6,500 in salary for the rescinded “Special Programs Contract” and to “cease and desist from unilaterally imposing a two (2) course per semester limit on bargaining unit employees.”', '-5-', 'C', 'Superior Court Review', 'On November 13, 2014, URI filed motions in the Superior Court to vacate the arbitration award and to stay the implementation of the award.5 Before the hearing justice, URI contested the substantive and procedural arbitrability of the dispute, the award’s merits, and the arbitrator’s finding that the CBA did not include a two-course limitation. In challenging the award’s merits, URI contended that the arbitrator’s decision was “irrational” and “exceed[ed] the [a]rbitrator’s authority.” It further contended that the remedy was “half-baked” and went beyond the scope of the dispute set forth before the arbitrator. Moreover, URI contended that the CBA imposed a two-course-per-semester limitation that was implicitly incorporated within the term “part-time” and based on established past practices. URI’s arbitrability challenge was premised upon the notion that the CBA did not cover the “Special Programs Contract” assignment because it was not a course and the CBA only contemplated courses.', 'The union objected to URI’s motion to vacate and moved to confirm the arbitration award. A hearing was held before a Superior Court justice on URI’s motion to vacate and the union’s motion to confirm on September 14, 2015.6 On October 1, 2015, the hearing justice rendered a decision that denied URI’s motion to vacate the arbitration award and granted the 5', 'On August 26, 2015, a consent order was entered by the Superior Court to stay the award’s implementation pending the decision on the motion to vacate or upon further order of the Superior Court. Several conditions were imposed, including that URI make course assignments pursuant to the CBA and in accordance with Article X. 6', 'We note that no transcript was ordered of this hearing.', '-6- union’s motion to confirm the award.7 The hearing justice found the dispute arbitrable because it centered on the interpretation of the CBA’s provisions. The hearing justice further determined that the arbitrator’s finding that the CBA did not contain any limitation on part-time faculty assignments properly “[drew] its essence from the contract and [was] based upon a passably plausible interpretation of the contract.” Additionally, the hearing justice found that URI’s general argument that past practices established a two-course limitation on part-time faculty lacked merit because, in order for past practices to be considered, the CBA must contain a past- practice provision.', 'The hearing justice’s decision also included a footnote, which provided in its entirety:', '“Although the Court is affirming the holding of the Award, it notes', 'that the arbitrator may have overreached by ordering [URI]', 'generally to cease and desist from unilaterally imposing the two', 'courses per semester limit on bargaining unit employees.', 'However, the issue is not before the Court, and may not be subject', 'to such review.” Due to confusion surrounding the footnote, URI objected to the union’s proposed form of judgment, and a hearing on the objection was heard before the same justice. URI had mistakenly interpreted the footnote to mean that it had not raised the cease-and-desist issue before the hearing justice. Thus, it argued that the issue had indeed been properly raised. However, the 7', 'Under these facts, the union moved for confirmation only in response to URI’s filing of a motion to vacate the award. In Rhode Island,', '“[a]t any time within one year after the award, is made, any party', 'to the arbitration may apply to the court for an order confirming', 'the award, and thereupon the court must grant the order confirming', 'the award unless the award is vacated, modified or corrected, as', 'prescribed in §§ 10-3-12 — 10-3-14.” G.L. 1956 § 10-3-11. An order confirming an arbitration award “has the same force and effect in all respects as, and is subject to all the provisions of law relating to a judgment in an action; and it may be enforced as if it had been rendered in an action in the court in which it is entered.” G.L. 1956 § 28-9-24.', '-7- hearing justice explained that he did not intend to imply that URI failed to raise the issue. Rather, the footnote was intended to convey his conclusion that, although the arbitrator “went a little wide” with his remedy, he would not disturb that remedy based on the level of deference owed to the arbitrator.', 'The hearing justice further clarified his intentions by noting that “[p]ersonally, I think the arbitrator may have gone a little broad, but it’s not up to me to determine whether or not the arbitrator was right or wrong, only whether or not they’re in compliance with the confines of the statute, the contract, and the like.” In light of the hearing justice’s explanation of the footnote, URI conceded and retracted its objection to the entry of judgment.

Section 13.4 of Article XIII provides that “[o]nly grievances arising out of the provisions of this contract relating to the application or interpretation or violation thereof may be submitted to arbitration.”', 'The CBA defines a “[g]rievance” as “any difference or dispute with respect to the interpretation, application, or violation of any of the provisions of this [a]greement * * *.”', 'We look to the CBA’s specific language to determine whether this dispute involves the “interpretation, application, or violation” of one or more of the CBA provisions. This dispute involves the interpretation of the provisions contained in Article X of the CBA,8 which sets forth the agreed-upon criteria for assigning work to part-time faculty. Article X provides that “[part- time faculty] members who have taught satisfactorily shall have the expectation of being assigned courses according to availability, qualifications and time in service.” Article X further 8', 'Article X of the CBA provides, in pertinent part:', '“Part-time faculty are hired and assigned courses based', 'upon their qualifications including academic credentials,', 'professional and life experience (including specialty credentials),', 'and previous teaching experience.', '“At the University, [part-time faculty] members who have', 'taught satisfactorily shall have the expectation of being assigned', 'courses according to availability, qualifications and time in service.', 'Courses shall be assigned to part-time faculty by the department', 'chair, with the approval of the Dean * * *.', '“The department chair will consider [part-time faculty', 'members’] course sections request[s], available course offerings,', 'qualifications, and satisfactory past performance * * *.”', '- 11 - provides that courses will be assigned to part-time faculty by the department chair, with the Dean’s approval, after considering a part-time faculty member’s course request in light of the availability of courses for that semester and the part-time faculty member’s qualifications, time in service, and past performance. Additionally, Article I, entitled “Recognition,” provides that part-time faculty must “teach[ ] a total of six (6) credits during two (2) academic years” to maintain bargaining-unit status.', '“[A] court shall rule in favor of submitting the dispute to arbitration unless the arbitration clause of the collective bargaining agreement cannot be interpreted to include the asserted dispute, and * * * all doubts should be resolved in favor of arbitration.” School Committee of Pawtucket v. Pawtucket Teachers Alliance AFT Local 930, 120 R.I. 810, 815, 390 A.2d 386, 389 (1978). Our review of the CBA convinces us that the grievance was indeed arbitrable because it concerned the criteria and procedures that governed the assignment of work to part-time faculty members and thus related to the “interpretation, application, or violation” of the CBA.', 'B', 'Violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement', 'URI argues that “[w]hat the [hearing justice] and the [a]rbitrator failed to recognize is that the entire CBA is premised on the explicit, overriding, controlling and incorporated CBA concept that bargaining unit members are part-time.” URI further contends that “[i]f the CBA does not, explicitly or implicitly, limit the number of courses that can be taught, it is not a CBA representing part-time faculty.” Unlike this Court’s de novo review of arbitrability, our review of an arbitrator’s award “is statutorily prescribed and is limited in nature.” Buttie, 995 A.2d at 549 (quoting North Providence School Committee, 945 A.2d at 344). An arbitrator exceeds his or her authority “if the arbitration award fails to ‘draw its essence from the agreement.’” Nappa', '- 12 - Construction Management, LLC, 152 A.3d at 1132 (quoting Rhode Island Employment Security Alliance Local 401, SEIU, AFL-CIO, 840 A.2d at 1096).', 'In determining whether the CBA included such a limitation, the arbitrator examined specific provisions of the CBA.9 He noted that Article X of the CBA “define[s] the part-time faculty assignment criteria for available courses, including ‘qualifications and prior teaching experience.’” In addition, the arbitrator pointed to Article I’s requirement that part-time faculty teach a total of six credits over two academic years to maintain their bargaining-unit status. The arbitrator determined that the requirements outlined in Article I “do not define minimum or maximum work load assignments.” The arbitrator further found that the assignment criteria for courses laid out in Article X only included “‘available course offerings’ (without limit), ‘academic credentials,’ ‘previous teaching experience,’ ‘time in service,’ and ‘satisfactory past performance,’” without reference to a limitation on assignments.', 'The arbitrator ultimately found that URI rescinded Jolicoeur’s “Special Programs Contract” solely because it “unilaterally imposed [a] two (2) course per semester cap” that was unsupported by Article X or the CBA as a whole. We consider the arbitrator’s conclusion to be a “passably plausible” interpretation of the CBA; thus, we affirm the Superior Court judgment in its confirmation of the portion of the arbitral award that found the rescission of Jolicoeur’s “Special Programs Contract” in violation of the CBA and required URI to pay Jolicoeur the $6,500 salary. See Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC, 91 A.3d at 835. 9', 'In its written submissions to this Court, URI concedes that the CBA is silent on the maximum number of course assignments.', '- 13 -', 'C', 'Cease-and-Desist Remedy', 'URI also takes issue with the remedy imposed by the arbitrator. It argues that the cease- and-desist order “goes beyond what is reasonably necessary to remedy the substantive dispute in this matter.” The arbitrator framed the issue before him as: “Is the grievance substantively arbitrable? If so, did [URI] violate the collective bargaining agreement when it rescinded the grievant’s Special Programs Contract in September, 2013 as the result of its two (2) course per semester limit? If so, what shall be the remedy?” He further explained that “[t]he essential inquiry is whether the grievant was entitled to a Special Programs Contract * * * in addition to teaching two (2) courses in the [f]all, 2013 semester.” The arbitrator then resolved the matter by reviewing the CBA and finding that it did not “contain a minimum or maximum assignment or teaching load per semester.” He ultimately concluded that “[t]he rescission of the grievant’s Special Programs Contract was a breach of Article X, because [URI] officials erroneously imposed a two (2) course per semester limit on the grievant.”', 'Although we have concluded that the grievance was substantively arbitrable because its resolution required the interpretation of the CBA, we recognize that the heart of the dispute, as framed by the arbitrator, concerned the rescission of Jolicoeur’s “Special Programs Contract,” which governed his administrative assignment and not his separate course assignments. In fashioning his award, therefore, the arbitrator was required to consider a unique factual situation which is unlikely to pertain to all union members. By issuing a cease-and-desist order, however, the arbitrator potentially provided for prospective relief which might permit the union to bypass the grievance procedures set forth in the CBA and enforce the instant arbitral award in future disputes by filing contempt proceedings directly in court. See Massachusetts Nurses Association', '- 14 - v. North Adams Regional Hospital, 467 F.3d 27, 28-30 (1st Cir. 2006) (considering an arbitration award that contained a cease-and-desist order and noting that only in exceptional cases will an arbitral award be enforced as a means of resolving a subsequent dispute thereby “bypassing the normal grievance procedures”).', 'While it is true that arbitrators need flexibility to address issues that parties to a contract may never have anticipated, see United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel and Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 597 (1960), “an arbitrator’s broad authority to * * * fashion an appropriate remedy is not unbridled.” Rhode Island Council 94, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v. State, 714 A.2d 584, 588 (R.I. 1998). Under the circumstances of this case, we are of the opinion that the cease-and- desist order remedy does not “draw its essence” from the CBA because it pertains not only to courses, but also administrative assignments not covered by the CBA. Nappa Construction Management, LLC, 152 A.3d at 1132 (quoting Rhode Island Employment Security Alliance, Local 401, SEIU, AFL-CIO, 840 A.2d at 1096). Therefore the arbitrator exceeded his authority by imposing such a broad remedy. See id.

66,(dissent begins on page 7) North Kingstown School Committee : v. : Ken Wagner et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court.', 'The respondent James Viner appeals from a Superior Court judgment that granted in part and denied in part a petition to quash three subpoenas, which petition was brought by North Kingstown School Committee (the school committee or petitioner). This matter came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised on this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the judgment insofar as it relates to the quashed subpoenas directed to the two attorneys for the school committee, affirm the judgment in all other respects, and remand this case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent herewith.', '-1-', 'I1', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Viner was a North Kingstown High School chemistry teacher. It is undisputed that, during the summer following the 2014-2015 school year, one of Viner’s female students complained to her mother, who informed the school administration, about alleged inappropriate behavior by Viner. In an affidavit submitted to the Superior Court, Attorney Mary Ann Carroll, as legal counsel to the school committee, explained, that upon learning of the allegations, her law firm launched an investigation. She further explained that Attorney Aubrey Lombardo assisted in the investigation by interviewing five high school students and preparing a report based on those interviews, which was submitted to the superintendent of the North Kingstown School Department and the principal of North Kingstown High School.', 'In a letter dated August 27, 2015, from the Chairperson of the North Kingstown School Committee to Viner, the Chairperson noted that a “pre-depr[i]vation hearing” was held on August 24, 2015, at which Viner, his union representative, the superintendent, the principal, and the school committee’s legal counsel were present. The letter further indicated that, on August 25, 2015, following the “pre-depr[i]vation hearing,” a “pre-suspension hearing” was conducted before the school committee in executive session. During the “pre-suspension hearing,” the superintendent made a presentation and recommended that the school committee suspend Viner without pay for the 2015-2016 school year and terminate his employment at the conclusion of the school year “for good and just cause.” Additionally, the letter to Viner noted that at the close 1', 'Because the only matter filed in Superior Court was the school committee’s petition seeking to quash the three subpoenas, the record of the administrative proceedings available to that court was sparse. Consequently, our recitation of the facts relies primarily on the representations of the parties. It does not appear as though there is any disagreement as to the factual predicate of the appeal.', '-2- of the “pre-suspension hearing,” the school committee voted to accept the superintendent’s recommendation.', 'In response, Viner requested a full evidentiary hearing before the school committee, which took place on December 7, 2015. At the conclusion of the full evidentiary hearing, the school committee again voted to suspend Viner without pay for the remainder of the school year and then terminate his employment at the close of the year. In turn, Viner appealed the school committee’s decision to the commissioner of elementary and secondary education within the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (RIDE). At Viner’s request, the RIDE hearing officer issued three subpoenas pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 16-39-82: witness subpoenas addressed to Attorneys Carroll and Lombardo and a subpoena duces tecum to the North Kingstown School Department.', 'Subsequently, in Superior Court, the school committee filed a miscellaneous petition to quash the three subpoenas issued by the RIDE hearing officer. The hearing justice granted in part and denied in part the school committee’s motion to quash the subpoenas, and final judgment entered on May 23, 2016. Shortly thereafter, Viner timely appealed. The parties 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 16-39-8 provides:', '“In any hearing conducted within the department of', 'elementary and secondary education, the commissioner of', 'elementary and secondary education or the hearing officer shall', 'have the power to issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of', 'witnesses and the production of documents or other material.', 'Subpoenas shall also be issued by the commissioner or hearing', 'officer at the request of any party participating in any hearing.

The school committee indicates that on May 9, 2017, the RIDE hearing officer issued a final decision and order that upheld the school committee’s decision to suspend and ultimately terminate Viner. The school committee further indicates that on June 1, 2017, Viner appealed the hearing officer’s final decision and order to the council on elementary and secondary education (the council). At oral argument, the parties informed this Court that the matter is still pending before the council and has yet to be heard.3', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[I]ssues of privilege are subject to a three-part standard of review, depending on which question is presented * * *.” United States v. Bisanti, 414 F.3d 168, 170, 170-71 (1st Cir. 2005) (concluding that “[f]actual determinations are reviewed for clear error, legal determinations are reviewed de novo, and evidentiary determinations are reviewed for abuse of discretion”). An 3', 'We note that pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 16-39-4, judicial review of controversies in school matters may be obtained through the Rhode Island Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Under the APA, “[a]ny preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency act or ruling is immediately reviewable in any case in which review of the final agency order would not provide an adequate remedy.” G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15(a). This matter’s unique posture, however—where the RIDE hearing officer proceeded to hear and decide this case before a decision on the subpoenas had been finally rendered by this Court, and while an appeal is pending before the council on elementary and secondary education—suggests that the school committee’s petition to quash may not have been ripe for review. Judicial review of interlocutory rulings of administrative agencies must be “sparingly exercise[d] * * * in order to avoid inundation by preliminary issues that may ultimately be resolved or become moot in the course of litigation at the administrative level.” La Petite Auberge, Inc. v.

Lead Industries Association, Inc., 64 A.3d 1183, 1191 (R.I. 2013).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Viner contends that the hearing justice applied the attorney-client privilege to the attorneys’ anticipated testimony in an overly broad manner when he failed to make question- by-question privilege determinations. The school committee counters averring that the hearing justice was justified in quashing the subpoenas because Viner did not indicate “any viable, nonprivileged areas of inquiry” that could have been posed to the attorneys if required to testify. Ultimately, the hearing justice concluded:', '“It’s unclear to the Court what, if any, information would be', 'derived from requiring the attorneys to testify if the interviews', 'themselves had been turned over. The only thing that would be', 'left to inquire of the attorneys would be their communications with', 'their client [and] any opinions that they may have had * * *.” Because this is a question regarding the hearing justice’s understanding and construction of the privilege’s scope, and not his application of the privilege to the facts at hand, this is a legal question that requires a de novo review. See United States v. Mejia, 655 F.3d 126, 131 (2d Cir. 2011) (noting that, “[a]lthough the applicability of a privilege is a factual question, determining the scope of a privilege is a question of law, subject to plenary review” (quoting United States v. Int’l Bhd. Of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, AFL-CIO, 119 F.3d 210, 214 (2d Cir. 1997))); United States v. Ruehle, 583 F.3d 600, 606 (9th Cir. 2009) (reviewing a trial court’s ruling on “the scope of the attorney-client privilege” de novo); Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., 412 F.3d 215, 225 (1st', '-5- Cir. 2005) (explaining that the “formulation” of an attorney-client privilege doctrine is reviewed de novo, whereas “[t]he application of properly formulated doctrine to the facts remains a matter of discretion for the district court”).', '“We have held that the attorney-client privilege ‘must be narrowly construed because it limits the full disclosure of the truth.’” Pastore v.

Thus, “blanket assertion[s] of [the] privilege [are] generally insufficient.” See In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Mr. S.), 662 F.3d 65, 71 (1st Cir. 2011). In the case before us, we conclude that the hearing justice erred by broadly ruling that the attorneys could not be compelled to testify because other sources of information may have already provided the information sought by Viner. Rather, to ensure that the privilege remains strictly confined, the attorneys should testify either in person or by deposition and the school committee can assert a claim of privilege on a question-by-question basis. United States v. Lawless, 709 F.2d 485, 487 (7th Cir. 1983). The hearing justice would then be able to make a separate determination for each privilege claim. See id.', 'Based on the foregoing, therefore, we remand this case to the Superior Court to follow the procedure described above. At the discretion of the hearing justice, the two attorneys may either be deposed or testify at a hearing. The hearing justice may then make an attorney-client privilege determination on a question-by-question basis, bearing in mind that the burden of persuasion rests upon the party seeking to assert the privilege. See State v. von Bulow, 475 A.2d 995, 1005 (R.I. 1984). We expect that the council on elementary and secondary education will refrain from proceeding further on this matter until the issue is resolved by the hearing justice. Following the hearing justice’s privilege determination, any party in interest may request the RIDE hearing officer to reopen the evidence to receive any testimony from the attorneys that has', '-6- been deemed to be nonprivileged by the hearing justice. In the event that the administrative proceedings result in a final judgment under the APA, an aggrieved party may claim the hearing justice’s decision on the attorney-client privilege as error in a petition for a writ of certiorari under G.L. 1956 § 42-35-16.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the Superior Court judgment granting the school committee’s motion to quash the attorneys’ subpoenas, affirm the judgment in all other respects, and remand this case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent herewith.', 'Justice Robinson, dissenting.

Indeed, the majority itself concedes that “the school committee’s petition to quash may not have been ripe for review” and that review of such interlocutory rulings of administrative agencies should be “sparingly exercise[d] * * *.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The defendants asserted that the testimony was conflicting and that, therefore, reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome of the case. Specifically, defendants referenced plaintiff’s trial testimony that Kali left the lane in which she was traveling and crashed into him, whereas Kali testified that she had a green light, was in the right of way, and that plaintiff pulled in front of her without using a turn signal.', 'The trial justice then rendered his decision. He first articulated the standard for deciding a motion for a new trial. He noted that he had instructed the jury on the burden of proof, duty of care, and comparative negligence, and had provided instructions related to the specifics of the case, such as the degree of care to be exercised when entering an intersection and the violation of motor-vehicle laws as evidence of negligence. The trial justice found plaintiff’s and Kali’s accounts of the accident incompatible and observed that neither the photographs nor the testimony about the photographs tended to support either account of the accident. Because the trial justice determined that reasonable minds could differ on the outcome of the case, he denied plaintiff’s motion for a new trial.

68,,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The petitioner, Joseph A. J. Paiva, seeks review of a decision of the respondent, Christopher J. Parella, the Chief of Police for the City of East Providence, denying Paiva’s application for a permit or license to carry a concealed weapon. Paiva filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari, which we granted on October 25, 2016. This matter came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this petition should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ arguments and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this petition may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons discussed herein, we quash Chief Parella’s decision denying Paiva’s application and direct Chief Parella to issue, within ninety days of the date of this opinion, a new decision setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law in conformity with this Court’s holding in Gadomski v. Tavares, 113 A.3d 387 (R.I. 2015).', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'For purposes of resolving the issues presently before the Court, we need discuss only the following facts. In October 2015, Paiva, a resident of the Town of Lincoln, applied to Parella, East Providence’s chief of police, for a permit to carry a concealed weapon pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-47-11. 1 In a letter accompanying his application, Paiva explained that he required a concealed-carry permit because, as both a firearms collector and an operator of an import/export business, he was regularly exposed to large sums of cash. In his application, Paiva also declared that he already had obtained concealed-carry permits in two other states. It is significant that, when responding to questions set forth in the application, Paiva said that he had never been treated for mental illness. Similarly, when inquiry was made as to whether he had ever been arrested, Paiva responded, “No.” 2 When prompted on the application as to whether he had previously applied for a concealed-carry permit from either the Attorney General or another city 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-47-11 provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“The licensing authorities of any city or town shall, upon', 'application of any person twenty-one (21) years of age or over', 'having a bona fide residence or place of business within the city or', 'town, or of any person twenty-one (21) years of age or over having', 'a bona fide residence within the United States and a license or', 'permit to carry a pistol or revolver concealed upon his or her', 'person issued by the authorities of any other state or subdivision of', 'the United States, issue a license or permit to the person to carry', 'concealed upon his or her person a pistol or revolver everywhere', 'within this state for four (4) years from date of issue, if it appears', 'that the applicant has good reason to fear an injury to his or her', 'person or property or has any other proper reason for carrying a', 'pistol or revolver, and that he or she is a suitable person to be so', 'licensed.” Section 11-47-11(a). 2', 'Paiva then qualified his answer: “Never been arrested pursuant to [G.L. 1956 §] 12-1.3-4.” Section 12-1.3-4 relates to the effect of the expungement of records of conviction.', '-2- or town, Paiva answered that he had been granted a permit from the Attorney General but that it had expired and that his application to the Town of North Smithfield had been denied.', 'In a letter dated January 25, 2016, Parella informed Paiva that his application had been denied.

In seeking that remedy, Paiva first argues that Parella applied the wrong statutory standard when he denied Paiva’s application. According to Paiva, Parella’s reference to the requirement that Paiva demonstrate “a proper and true need” for a permit sounds in the language of § 11-47-18, which applies to the Attorney General, not § 11-47-11, which applies to municipalities, including the City of East Providence. Paiva also takes issue with the nature of Parella’s decision letter, characterizing it as mere boilerplate and lacking the findings of fact and conclusions of law required pursuant to this Court’s holding in Gadomski. Additionally, Paiva alleges that Parella erroneously supplemented the record before this Court with documents—including police reports from the Town of Lincoln, one of which was prompted by an alert from a mental health professional—that reveal unfavorable information about him. Because Parella issued his denial letter nearly eleven months prior to receiving those documents, Paiva contends that they are not properly before this Court and should not be used to supplement Parella’s decision letter. 3 3', 'We denied Paiva’s motion to strike those documents from the record before us on March 6, 2017.', '-4- According to Paiva, the only adequate remedy here is outright reversal of Parella’s decision and the issuance of a permit.', 'We agree that Parella’s decision letter falls woefully short of our clear directive in Gadomski. As we explained in that case, “[a] local licensing authority need not write a decision rivaling War and Peace * * * in length, but its decision must still address the salient reasoning for the denial of a license.” Gadomski, 113 A.3d at 391. Parella’s cursory letter, which contains only “bare, rote conclusions[,]” falls well short of that standard. 4 Id.', 'However, we are of the opinion that a remand, not a reversal, is the appropriate remedy here. Especially in light of the information contained in the documents that Parella submitted to this Court, a new decision is warranted. As alluded to in our order granting Paiva’s petition for certiorari, the reports from the Lincoln Police Department reveal that the applicant has a history of “past assaultive behavior requiring the intervention of Lincoln Police * * *.” That behavior was brought to our attention by the documents that Parella attached to a filing in this Court. Although it seems clear that Parella did not have those documents when he issued his decision letter, and thus could not have relied on them, we cannot, in good faith, ignore what they disclose. Our review of those documents reveals a troubling history of events that, at the very least, call into question Paiva’s suitability to carry a concealed weapon.', 'In addition to an arguable pattern of “assaultive behavior,” the documents also unveil that Paiva was, at best, evasive in answering the questions posed to him on his concealed-carry application.', 'As noted above, on his application, Paiva indicated that his permit from the 4', 'We reiterate that there is a distinction between the requirements of § 11-47-18, which apply to the Attorney General, and those of § 11-47-11, which apply to cities and towns—including the City of East Providence: “[d]emonstration of a proper showing of need, which is a requirement under § 11-47-18, is not a component of § 11-47-11.” Gadomski v. Tavares, 113 A.3d 387, 392 (R.I. 2015.', '-5- Attorney General to carry a concealed weapon had “expired.” Yet, contrary to that assertion, Paiva’s permit was revoked by the Attorney General in October 2013. 5 Paiva provided an equally evasive response to a question regarding whether he had ever been arrested. Paiva’s less-than-candid answers on his application, coupled with his past behavior, certainly raise doubt as to his suitability to obtain a permit to carry a concealed weapon in this state. Nonetheless, a determination as to his suitability requires findings of fact, best left to the licensing authority— here, Chief Parella—and not this Court.6 See State v.

Chief Parella is directed to issue a new decision setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law consistent with our holding in Gadomski within ninety days of the date of this opinion. Although the focus of our opinion today is on the inadequacy of Chief Parella’s decision letter, we emphasize that the new facts brought to light on certiorari may be considered in rendering a new decision. Moreover, as we held in Gadomski, if Paiva “is aggrieved by the new decision, he may file an amended petition for writ of certiorari 5', 'Although Paiva appealed that revocation, this Court dismissed that appeal as procedurally improper on October 24, 2016. 6', 'We pause to note that the language set forth in § 11-47-11 places the burden of determining suitability on the licensing authorities of the cities and towns: usually, police chiefs.

See § 11-47-11.

69,The Gerald P. Zarrella Trust et al. : v. : Town of Exeter et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This appeal involves a man, Gerald Zarrella, his land, Gerald’s Farm, and a local government, the Town of Exeter, Rhode Island. The plaintiffs, the Gerald P. Zarrella Trust, Gerald P. Zarrella, in his capacity as trustee, and Gerald’s Farm, LLC (collectively, Zarrella), seek review of a Superior Court judgment denying their request for declaratory relief. This matter came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral arguments, and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. At issue is whether subsection 4(a) of Rhode Island’s Right to Farm Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 23 of title 2, permits Zarrella to host commercial events, such as weddings for a fee, on his farmland in Exeter. For the reasons discussed below, we hold that it does not; therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This is not the first time that Zarrella and the Town of Exeter have been entangled in litigation over Zarrella’s right to host commercial events on his farmland. In 2011, after the town sued Zarrella to prevent him from doing exactly that, the town and Zarrella entered into an amended consent judgment that permanently enjoined Zarrella from “using and/or renting the property located at 270 Narrow Lane, Exeter, Rhode Island, known as Gerald’s Farm * * * for weddings for a fee or other commercial events.” 1 There was one caveat: the injunction would run with Zarrella’s land “until such time as and to the extent that the terms of this permanent injunction are superseded by statute * * *.” According to Zarrella, that time came in 2014.', 'In 2014, the General Assembly amended the second sentence of § 2-23-4(a) to read as follows:', '“The mixed-use of farms and farmlands for other forms of', 'enterprise including, but not limited to, the display of antique', 'vehicles and equipment, retail sales, tours, classes, petting, feeding', 'and viewing of animals, hay rides, crop mazes, festivals and other', 'special events are hereby recognized as a valuable and viable', 'means of contributing to the preservation of agriculture.” 2 Concluding that this amendment superseded the 2011 injunction, Zarrella attempted to obtain a zoning certificate from the town that would allow him to host a commercial fundraising event on his farmland. But, as it did in 2011, the town rebuffed Zarrella’s attempt to do so, informing him 1', 'At oral argument, Zarrella’s counsel agreed that hosting weddings for a fee is barred by Exeter’s zoning ordinance. As § 2.3.2 of the Exeter zoning ordinance provides, “[a]ny use not listed is specifically prohibited.” Exeter’s zoning table does not list the hosting of weddings for a fee as a permissible use of Zarrella’s farmland. 2', 'Prior to 2014, the second sentence of G.L. 1956 § 2-23-4(a) provided only that “[t]he mixed- use of farms and farmlands for other forms of enterprise is hereby recognized as a valuable and viable means of contributing to the preservation of agriculture.”', '-2- that he was still bound by the terms of the 2011 injunction. This prompted Zarrella to file suit against the town and the members of the Town Council, in their official capacities, in 2015.', 'In a verified complaint, Zarrella sought a number of declarations pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9. Zarrella asserted that hosting commercial events—including hosting weddings for a fee—is the sort of “other special event[]” that the General Assembly “recognized * * * as a valuable and viable means of contributing to the preservation of agriculture” when it amended § 2-23-4(a) in 2014. The thrust of Zarrella’s complaint was that the 2014 amendment to § 2-23-4(a) rendered the 2011 permanent injunction a nullity, green-lighting his ability to host weddings for a fee on his farmland.', 'After he filed his lawsuit, Zarrella obtained a temporary restraining order that vacated the 2011 injunction. 3 But that temporary order was short-lived. After a nonjury trial, 4 a second trial justice denied Zarrella’s request for declaratory relief, ruling that the General Assembly’s 2014 amendment to § 2-23-4(a) did not supersede the 2011 injunction. In his decision, the trial justice concluded that the second sentence of § 2-23-4(a) merely set forth a list of encouraged uses of farms and farmland, which did not preempt the town’s authority to restrict nonagricultural operations such as hosting commercial events, including weddings for a fee. It is from the judgment embodying that decision that Zarrella appeals. 3', 'In granting Zarrella’s temporary restraining order, the hearing justice ordered that the 2011 injunction was “superseded by the amendments to § 2-23-4 * * *, known as the ‘Right to Farm Act,’ and accordingly the Town of Exeter [could not] prohibit weddings or other commercial events at the subject property located at 270 Narrow Lane, Exeter, Rhode Island.” 4', 'It appears from the record that, in lieu of a fact-finding hearing, the parties submitted proposed statements of undisputed facts for the trial justice to consider in rendering his decision.', '-3-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled that, ‘with respect to the ultimate decision by a trial justice to grant or deny declaratory relief, our standard of review is deferential.’” Bruce Brayman Builders, Inc. v.

As a threshold matter, we agree with the parties that § 2-23-4(a) is clear and unambiguous. Thus, “we are bound to ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning of the words of the statute and our inquiry is at an end.” Town of Warren, 159 A.3d at 1039 (quoting Bucci, 68 A.3d at 1078).', 'In full, § 2-23-4(a) provides:', '“As used in this chapter, ‘agricultural operations’ includes any', 'commercial enterprise that has as its primary purpose horticulture,', 'viticulture, viniculture, floriculture, forestry, stabling of horses,', 'dairy farming, or aquaculture, or the raising of livestock, including', 'for the production of fiber, furbearing animals, poultry, or bees,', 'and all such other operations, uses, and activities as the director, in', 'consultation with the chief of division of agriculture, may', 'determine to be agriculture, or an agricultural activity, use or', 'operation.

There is no dispute that the hosting of a wedding for a fee is a commercial activity that does not fall under the enterprises set forth in the first sentence of § 2-23-4(a). Therefore, the question before us is whether hosting a wedding for a fee is an “agricultural operation” by virtue of the language contained in the second sentence of § 2-23-4(a).', '-5-', 'Because he reads that sentence as part of the definition of “agricultural operations” contained in the first sentence, Zarrella contends that the hosting of weddings for a fee is a mixed-use that serves “as a valuable and viable means of contributing to the preservation of agriculture.” Zarrella argues that, although the second sentence is separate from the first, it is still included in the definitional section of the statute. And, he reasons, by including the “mixed- use” language in the definitional section of the Right to Farm Act, the General Assembly meant to include those mixed-uses within the ambit of the definition of “agricultural operations.” To support his argument on that point, Zarrella relies on the rule against surplusage, a canon of statutory construction that provides:', '“In giving construction to a statute, the court is bound, if it be', 'possible, to give effect to all its several parts. No sentence, clause', 'or word should be construed as unmeaning and surplusage, if a', 'construction can be legitimately found which will give force to and', 'preserve all the words of the statute.” St. Clare Home v. Donnelly,', '117 R.I. 464, 470, 368 A.2d 1214, 1217-18 (1977). In sum, Zarrella’s argument is that the 2014 amendment to § 2-23-4(a) expanded the definition of “agricultural operations,” freeing him from the constraints of the 2011 injunction and allowing him to host weddings on his farmland.', 'The town, on the other hand, interprets the second sentence of § 2-23-4(a) not as an expansion of the definition of “agricultural operations,” but as a statement of policy. According to the town, in the first sentence, the General Assembly set forth the definition of “agricultural operations”—a definition that the parties agree does not include the type of commercial endeavor in which Zarrella wishes to engage. In the second sentence, the town argues, the General Assembly then provided a statement of policy, including a list of activities that contribute to the preservation of agriculture. The town argues that that language, amended in 2014, does not expand the definition of “agricultural operations.” According to the town’s interpretation of the', '-6- statute, § 2-23-4(a) does not supersede the 2011 injunction, and Zarrella remains prohibited from using his land as a wedding venue.', 'After careful consideration of this issue, we agree with the town. It is our view that the second sentence of § 2-23-4(a) provides only a clear and unambiguous list of mixed-uses that the General Assembly has “recognized as a valuable and viable means of contributing to the preservation of agriculture.” That list does not include weddings, but it is our opinion that, even if the activity of hosting weddings for a fee fell within the ambit of § 2-23-4(a)’s second sentence, that sentence would not and could not expand the definition of “agricultural operations.”', 'The two sentences in § 2-23-4(a) serve two distinct purposes: the first is definitional, the second is aspirational. The second sentence is not devoid of meaning; it sets forth a list of encouraged activities that the General Assembly has deemed “valuable and viable” with respect to “contributing to the preservation of agriculture.” However, that statement of policy preference does not, merely by its location in the statutory framework, transform a nonagricultural mixed-use of farmland into an “agricultural operation” as defined by § 2-23-4(a).', 'Moreover, an examination of § 2-23-4 in its entirety reveals that the statute breaks down “operations” into two categories: “agricultural operations,” as defined in the first sentence of subsection (a); and, “nonagricultural operations,” as referred to in subsection (b). Under § 2-23- 4(b), those activities that are “nonagricultural” are subject to local control. 5 Because hosting weddings for a fee is an activity that falls outside the statutory definition of “agricultural operations,” it is a “nonagricultural” activity that is subject to the town’s control. 5', 'Section 2-23-4(b) provides that:', '-7-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'We hold that the second sentence of § 2-23-4(a) is a statement of policy, not an expansion of the definition of “agricultural operations.” Based on the clear and unambiguous language of § 2-23-4(a), the plaintiffs remain bound by the 2011 injunction that enjoins them from using the farmland “for weddings for a fee or other commercial events.” The amendment to § 2-23-4(a) offers the plaintiffs no refuge from that injunction. For those reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

70,Paul E. Pontarelli : v. : Rhode Island Department of Elementary : and Secondary Education et al.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court.', 'The plaintiff, Paul E. Pontarelli, appeals from a Superior Court order granting the motion to dismiss of the defendants, the Rhode Island Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (RIDE) and Ken Wagner, in his capacity as the commissioner of RIDE. Pontarelli sought access to records in RIDE’s possession pursuant to the Access to Public Records Act (APRA), G.L. 1956 chapter 2 of title 38. The catch, however, was that those purportedly public records were not related to the statutory mission of RIDE, but to the “private law practice” of one of RIDE’s employees. The agency rejected Pontarelli’s request, prompting him to seek declaratory relief in the Superior Court. That relief was denied, and Pontarelli timely appealed to this Court. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On April 13, 2015, Pontarelli sent the following request for public records to RIDE:', '“All records related to the private law practice of [a RIDE', 'employee], which have been created, produced, printed, scanned,', 'faxed, emailed, maintained or stored at or on the property of the', 'Rhode Island Department of Education, the Rhode Island Council', 'on Elementary and Secondary Education or the Rhode Island', 'Board of Education including, but not limited to, computers,', 'copiers, servers, computer storage systems and/or networks.” On April 21, 2015, the public information officer at RIDE denied Pontarelli’s request:', '“Should there be any such records maintained or stored at or on the', 'property of the Rhode Island Department of Education, the Rhode', 'Island Council on Elementary and Secondary Education, or the', 'Rhode Island Board of Education, such records would not be', 'public records under the definition of ‘public records’ within the', 'Access to Public Records Act, RIGL 38-2-2(4), as such records', 'would not be made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in', 'connection with the transaction of official business by this', 'agency.”', 'Pontarelli appealed that denial to then-Commissioner Deborah A. Gist. He asserted that, under § 38-2-3(a), all records maintained or kept on file by a public body are public records. Nevertheless, Gist, too, rejected Pontarelli’s request. She reasoned that the very section of APRA cited by Pontarelli provides that records maintained or kept on file by a public body are public records “[e]xcept as provided in § 38-2-2(4),” which defines public records as only those “made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by any agency.”', 'Accordingly, the commissioner reasoned, the requested records pertaining to the private law practice of the RIDE employee were not subject to disclosure. Gist further informed Pontarelli that APRA “does not go so far as to state that all records maintained or stored on the property of an agency are public records”; rather, she stated, they must be', '-2- maintained or stored there by the agency. Thus, Gist concluded, records that were related to the employee’s private law practice “would not become public records based solely [on] the place of their storage.”', 'Subsequently, Gist left her position, and Wagner became the commissioner of RIDE. Also around that time, Pontarelli learned of RIDE’s network policy, which provides that “[t]ransactions resulting from network usage are the property of the [s]tate and are thus subject to open records laws.” The policy also advises that email messages are considered public records pursuant to APRA and that RIDE records are open to public inspection.', 'Pontarelli then asked Wagner to reconsider Gist’s decision of his appeal of RIDE’s denial of his public-records request. Wagner did not dispute the contents of RIDE’s network policy; however, he informed Pontarelli that a violation of that policy by an employee would be handled simply as a personnel matter. And Wagner, like Gist before him, notified Pontarelli that the requested records “related to the private law practice” of the RIDE employee were, by definition, not public records. Therefore, he declined to disturb the earlier denial.', 'Pontarelli then filed a complaint for declaratory relief in the Superior Court. He alleged, in essence, that he had filed a public-records request with RIDE; that that request had been denied by RIDE; and that he had thereafter pursued administrative appeals by petitioning Gist, and later Wagner, for review, to no avail. Pontarelli asserted that the requested records were public records, subject to disclosure, under APRA, and he asked the Superior Court to so declare. 1 1', 'Pontarelli first filed a complaint requesting a writ of mandamus; however, the Superior Court granted Pontarelli leave to amend, and his first amended complaint instead sought a declaratory judgment.', '-3-', 'RIDE moved, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, to dismiss the complaint. During the hearing on the motion to dismiss, the motion justice first discussed a procedural issue. He noted that the complaint, while setting forth Pontarelli’s claim that he had requested and had been denied access to what he believed to be public documents, did not describe or identify the documents about which he requested declaratory relief. The motion justice recognized that, in ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), he was restricted to the four corners of the complaint. At the same time, the motion justice reasoned that it would be an exercise in futility to rule on the motion without first knowing what documents had been sought. 2 Therefore, the justice determined that he would review the request.', 'Turning to the merits, the motion justice first clarified that he was charged with enforcing APRA, not RIDE’s network policy. He then found that, under the definition of “public records” set forth in § 38-2-2(4), the requested records, related as they were to the private law practice of a RIDE employee, were not connected to the transaction of official business by RIDE. The motion justice also noted that the first exception to the definition of public records is records that relate to a client/attorney relationship.', 'He concluded that construing APRA as requiring disclosure of the employee’s attorney files relating to his private clients, but not those relating to his legal work at RIDE, would reach an absurd result. For all those reasons, the motion justice found that the requested documents were not public records, and he granted RIDE’s motion to dismiss Pontarelli’s complaint.', 'The Appeal', 'Before this Court, Pontarelli argues that the requested records indeed constitute public records under this Court’s APRA precedent. He asserts that RIDE is cloaked with the burden of 2', 'It is not in dispute that the relevant document request was attached to RIDE’s memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss.', '-4- proving otherwise and that, in attempting to do so, RIDE cannot rely on any exception that is enumerated in § 38-2-2(4) because it did not raise such in its initial denial of his request and thus has waived any such reliance. Pontarelli also stresses that RIDE’s position in this case is directly contrary to its own network policy. Finally, Pontarelli claims that RIDE’s motion to dismiss should have been converted to a motion for summary judgment because the motion justice relied on a document that was not part of the complaint.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]he sole function of a motion to dismiss is to test the sufficiency of the complaint.” Narragansett Electric Co. v. Minardi, 21 A.3d 274, 277 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Laurence v. Sollitto, 788 A.2d 455, 456 (R.I. 2002)). For that reason, “[w]hen ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion [to dismiss], the trial justice must look no further than the complaint, assume that all allegations in the complaint are true, and resolve any doubts in a plaintiff’s favor.” Multi-State Restoration, Inc. v. DWS Properties, LLC, 61 A.3d 414, 416 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Laurence, 788 A.2d at 456). “The motion may then only be granted if it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that a plaintiff would not be entitled to relief under any conceivable set of facts * * *.” Id. at 417 (quoting Laurence, 788 A.2d at 456). Generally, however, “when the motion justice receives evidentiary matters outside the complaint and does not expressly exclude them in passing on the motion, then Rule 12(b)(6) specifically requires the motion to be considered as one for summary judgment.” Id. (quoting Martin v. Howard, 784 A.2d 291, 298 (R.I. 2001)). “In passing on a Rule 12(b) dismissal, this Court applies the same standard as the trial justice.” DiLibero v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 108 A.3d 1013, 1015 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Minardi, 21 A.3d at 278).', '-5-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(6)', '“A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) allows a court to dispose of a proceeding at an early stage if the complaint fails to set forth provable facts under which relief could be granted.” Leone v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, 101 A.3d 869, 873 (R.I. 2014). Of course, in testing the sufficiency of a complaint, “[w]e thus are confined to [its] four corners * * * and must assume all allegations are true, resolving any doubts in plaintiff’s favor.” Minardi, 21 A.3d at 278.', 'The factual assertions in Pontarelli’s complaint are nothing more than allegations that he had requested access to records pursuant to APRA, that those records were public records as defined in APRA, and that RIDE denied his request in violation of APRA. There was no copy of the request attached to the complaint, and it was neither quoted nor even described therein. In the absence of Pontarelli’s public-records request, it was impossible for the motion justice to test the sufficiency of the complaint when RIDE moved to dismiss it pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)—a crucial juncture in our rules of civil procedure.', 'Recognizing this snag, RIDE submitted Pontarelli’s APRA request to the motion justice as an attachment to its memorandum in support of its motion to dismiss; and, realizing that he needed to refer to it in passing on RIDE’s motion, the motion justice considered the language therein. 3', 'Nevertheless, the motion justice elected not to convert RIDE’s motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment. This was despite his acknowledgment of Rule 12(b)’s mandate 3', 'We observe that Pontarelli’s memorandum in support of his objection to the motion to dismiss was also accompanied by attachments.', '-6- that “[i]f * * * matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion [to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)] shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56 * * * ”; and further, if such a conversion happens, that “all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to present all material made pertinent to such motion by Rule 56.” See also Bowen Court Associates v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 818 A.2d 721, 726 (R.I. 2003). The motion justice articulated the following reasoning for his decision:', '“[S]o if all the complaint ever said is [‘]I made an open records', 'request, it was denied, the records are public, I’m entitled to them,', 'give them to me,[’] no agency could ever make a 12(b)(6). They’d', 'have to go through the whole expense of doing discovery, writing', 'summary judgment motions and everything else because you’re', 'saying I can’t look, on that complaint, I have to take everything as', 'true so, therefore, it’s true that you filed it, it’s true that it was', 'denied, and it’s true that it’s a public record and, therefore, I can’t', 'dismiss it, and I put the agency through having to file a motion for', 'summary judgment, maybe have to file affidavits, and everything', 'else. Where this letter, and it’s not like we are looking for a lot of', 'documents. It’s one document—', '“***', '“—and it’s rather brief. And forget its length, it’s integral', 'to your complaint. You say they violated the open records law for', 'failing to comply with something but, yet, you want to say, Judge,', 'you can’t look at it. So, therefore, let’s get onto the next thing.', '“If you’re correct on that, then I don’t have to get to the', 'substance. I just have to wait until you come back on summary', 'judgment, and I’m not sure that that is efficient.', '“I could see if I start to dig into the records and say I’ve', 'looked at them, and that’s something totally different. I’m only', 'questioning whether I can look at one document, and you don’t', 'think I can, for this motion.” Moreover, he said, “To convert this to a Rule 56 motion would not serve anything or add anything to the record, and it would not in any way assist the [c]ourt because this motion can be resolved as a matter of law.” In response, Pontarelli reiterated his argument that, because he did not incorporate the request in the complaint, the motion justice was precluded from referring to its contents.', '-7-', 'This Court has had occasion to visit this issue in the past. In Bowen Court Associates, we said that a complaint’s merely “mention[ing] or refer[ring] to” documents does not cause them to be incorporated in the complaint. Bowen Court Associates, 818 A.2d at 726. Thus, when the motion justice in that case received documents mentioned or referred to, but not incorporated, in the complaint sounding in negligence, and did not explicitly exclude them from her consideration, the motion to dismiss was automatically converted to a motion for summary judgment. Id. In Bellevue-Ochre Point Neighborhood Association v. Preservation Society of Newport County, 151 A.3d 1223 (R.I. 2017), where the hearing justice considered outside materials and “issued a thorough decision that considered the issues raised in [the] plaintiff’s complaint,” the motion to dismiss the declaratory-judgment action was converted to a motion for summary judgment. Bellevue-Ochre Point, 151 A.3d at 1228-29. In Leone, where both parties submitted to the motion justice documents outside the complaint for declaratory relief, we said that he properly converted the motion to dismiss to one for summary judgment, and neither party could claim to be aggrieved by lack of notice. Leone, 101 A.3d at 873. And, in Tucker Estates Charlestown, LLC v. Town of Charlestown, 964 A.2d 1138 (R.I. 2009), we held that “[a] dismissal of a declaratory-judgment action before a hearing on the merits, under Rule 12(b)(6), is proper only when the pleadings demonstrate that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the declaration prayed for is an impossibility.” Tucker Estates, 964 A.2d at 1140.', 'Although we do not depart from the holdings or reasoning of those cases, in the somewhat unusual posture of this case, we agree with the rationale of the motion justice. Pontarelli’s complaint sought a declaratory judgment that he was entitled to access the records that he had requested from RIDE pursuant to APRA. However, at the motion-to-dismiss stage, the motion justice did not yet know what records Pontarelli had requested. Without looking to', '-8- Pontarelli’s public-records request, RIDE’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion would have been rendered a nullity, and RIDE would have been unfairly deprived of the use of this important procedural tool. Furthermore, absent any need for factual development, this was a case prime for preliminary review as to the sufficiency of the complaint—and, as a matter of law, whether Pontarelli’s request sought “public records” as that term is defined in APRA. Even a period of limited discovery would have yielded no necessary or relevant information, and a subsequent motion for summary judgment would have been decided as a matter of law based on the public-records request alone. Unless the motion justice found that Pontarelli’s complaint stated a valid claim for relief in that he was potentially entitled to those records, nothing more could have been accomplished. And that finding would have been impossible for the motion justice to make without considering the public-records request, a document so intertwined with the complaint as to become part of it, even without appending the request thereto or incorporating it by reference therein. See Beddall v. State Street Bank & Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 16, 17 (1st Cir. 1998) (adopting a “practical, commonsense approach” and stating that when “a complaint’s factual allegations are expressly linked to—and admittedly dependent upon—a document (the authenticity of which is not challenged), that document effectively merges into the pleadings and the trial court can review it in deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6)”). Accordingly, we hold that, under the narrow circumstances of this case, the motion justice did not err when he considered the language of Pontarelli’s APRA request in ruling on RIDE’s motion to dismiss.', 'B', 'The Merits', 'With the procedural posture resolved, we now examine whether it was “clear beyond a reasonable doubt that [Pontarelli] would not be entitled to relief * * * under any set of facts that', '-9- could be proven in support of [his] claim.” Chhun v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 84 A.3d 419, 422 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144, 149-50 (R.I. 2008)). That determination hinges on whether “records related to the private law practice of [a RIDE employee], which have been created, produced, printed, scanned, faxed, emailed, maintained or stored at or on the property of [RIDE],” are “public records” under APRA.', 'Section 38-2-2 defines “public records” as “all documents, papers, * * * computer stored data (including electronic mail messages * * * ), or other material regardless of physical form or characteristics made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by any agency.” Section 38-2-2(4) (emphasis added). That section goes on to enumerate certain exceptions which, “[f]or the purposes of [APRA], * * * shall not be deemed public[.]” Id. In turn, § 38-2-3 states, “[e]xcept as provided in § 38-2-2(4), all records maintained or kept on file by any public body, whether or not those records are required by any law or by any rule or regulation, shall be public records and every person or entity shall have the right to inspect and/or copy those records * * *.” Section 38-2-3(a) (emphasis added).', 'Pontarelli asserts that the requested records related to the “private law practice” of the employee are public records as defined in APRA because, under § 38-2-3(a), those records are “maintained or kept on file by” RIDE and because they do not fall within an exception enumerated in § 38-2-2(4). 4 However, such an interpretation completely reads the definitional language of § 38-2-2(4)—that public records are those “made or received pursuant to law or 4', 'On this point, Pontarelli contends that RIDE has waived any argument that the requested records fall within an exception enumerated in G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2(4) because RIDE failed to specify that reason for nondisclosure when it initially denied Pontarelli access. See § 38-2-7(a) (“Except for good cause shown, any reason not specifically set forth in the denial shall be deemed waived by the public body.”). This issue will be addressed infra.', '- 10 - ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by any agency”—out of the statute.', 'In previous opinions, this Court has clearly read §§ 38-2-2(4) and 38-2-3(a) in conjunction with one another in defining what constitutes a public record for the purposes of APRA. See Providence Journal Co. v. Sundlun, 616 A.2d 1131, 1134 (R.I. 1992) (“Read consecutively, §§ 38-2-2[(4)] and 38-2-3 set forth the definition of a public record for the purposes of disclosure under the act * * *.”); Hydron Laboratories, Inc. v. Department of Attorney General, 492 A.2d 135, 137 (R.I. 1985) (“Although § 38-2-3 of APRA states that ‘all records maintained or kept on file by any public body * * * shall be public records and every person shall have the right to inspect and/or copy such records,’ certain definitional limitations were included in respect to which documents would constitute ‘public records’ and would therefore be readily disclosed.”). It is true, as Pontarelli argues, that we have also said that “records are subject to public disclosure unless they fall within one of the enumerated exceptions contained in APRA.” The Providence Journal Co. v. Convention Center Authority, 774 A.2d 40, 46 (R.I. 2001); see also Pawtucket Teachers Alliance Local No. 920, AFT, AFL-CIO v. Brady, 556 A.2d 556, 557 (R.I. 1989) (“Section 38-2-3 * * * of APRA grants every individual the right to inspect and copy all records maintained by public entities subject to * * * express exceptions contained in § 38-2-2 * * *.”). However, it is our opinion that that proclamation rests squarely on the assumption that the records are subject to public disclosure ab initio because they satisfy the fundamental requirement that they were “made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by any agency.” Section 38-2-2(4). Only records that meet that definition must fall under an enumerated exception to be exempted from public disclosure. After all, the language of § 38-2-2(4) that, “[f]or the purposes of [APRA],” records that qualify for an exception “shall not be deemed public” necessarily implies that they', '- 11 - first meet the basic definition of “public records.” Accordingly, we take this opportunity to clarify that records must satisfy the underlying definition of “public records” to be subject to disclosure under APRA.', 'Viewing the matter through that prism, we hold without hesitation that the records Pontarelli requested are not public records for the purposes of APRA. In no way are records related to the private law practice of a RIDE employee “made or received pursuant to law or ordinance or in connection with the transaction of official business by [RIDE].” Section 38-2- 2(4). Indeed, the very language of Pontarelli’s public-records request and the nature of the requested documents undermine his claim.', 'As such, his complaint in the Superior Court “fail[ed] to set forth provable facts under which relief could be granted[,]” and the motion justice properly disposed of it on RIDE’s motion to dismiss. Leone, 101 A.3d at 873.', 'As a last salvo, Pontarelli falls back on an argument that RIDE failed to satisfy its burden of proving that the requested records should not be accessible to the public. He is correct that, generally, an agency bears the burden of showing that records requested pursuant to APRA are not subject to disclosure. See § 38-2-10 (“In all actions brought under this chapter, the burden shall be on the public body to demonstrate that the record in dispute can be properly withheld from public inspection * * *.”). However, it must first be the case that the records sought meet the definition of “public records.” Again, the language of Pontarelli’s own request revealed that the records could “be properly withheld from public inspection under [APRA].” Id. RIDE therefore had no obligation to affirmatively make such a demonstration. Furthermore, for that same reason, RIDE had no need to rely on the applicability of one of the exceptions enumerated in § 38-2-2(4). Consequently, we need not consider Pontarelli’s waiver argument. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n.4 (R.I. 2009) (referring to “our usual policy of not', '- 12 - opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”). Finally, we pause to note that RIDE’s own network policy—even if it were to characterize the requested records as accessible via APRA—has no bearing on the outcome of this case. See State v. Rhode Island Alliance of Social Services Employees, Local 580, SEIU, 747 A.2d 465, 469 (R.I. 2000) (stating the “fundamental proposition” that “applicable state * * * law trumps * * * contrary practices of the parties”).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.

Her mother told her that defendant had simply been drunk and had gone into the wrong room.', 'At that time, her mother was pregnant with defendant’s child.', 'Before Anna’s half-sister was born on August 22, 1988, defendant imposed himself on Anna once again. That day, Anna was home alone with defendant. She was sitting on the couch, curled up in the fetal position, in her pajamas watching cartoons. The defendant approached her and asked if she wanted to do something fun; as an eight- or nine-year old, Anna believed that defendant was referring to a game and answered affirmatively. At that point, defendant pulled her legs down and laid her flat on the couch. He proceeded to climb on top of her, straddled over her with his legs on either side of her body. As he removed her pants, Anna told him that she did not like what was happening. Undeterred, defendant took off his pants. He then rubbed his penis against her vagina. Anna testified that, during this encounter, defendant put his penis inside her “labia.”5 She did not tell anyone because she was scared, and she did not think her mother would believe her this time, just as she had not believed her previously.', 'The next incident occurred mere months after Anna’s half-sister was born, just before Christmas of 1988. The defendant brought Anna, then nine years old, to the mall so she could buy a Christmas gift for her mother. Upon arriving in the mall parking lot, defendant told Anna he would give her money to purchase her mother’s gift if she would first do something for him. The defendant then unzipped his pants, grabbed Anna’s head, and placed her mouth on his penis, all the while directing her actions. After ejaculating in her mouth, defendant gave Anna the 4', 'This evidence was admitted pursuant to Rule 404(b), and it is not contested on appeal. 5', 'This testimony formed the basis for count 1, which we shall refer to as the Manton Avenue incident.', '-3- money he had promised her, and she went into the mall and bought a gift for her mother.6 Again, Anna told no one what had happened. Her self-described “awkward” relationship with defendant persisted, although she “didn’t know what was happening was wrong.”', 'In the spring of 1989, defendant and Anna’s mother moved Anna and her infant half- sister to Kentucky, where defendant had accepted a job. Shortly thereafter, the four of them moved to Chicago for the same reason. By that point, the drinking by defendant and Anna’s mother had become “excessive,” according to Anna. One evening, when Anna’s mother was passed out—“inebriated to the point where [she couldn’t] function”—defendant said to Anna, “I want you to watch what I’m going to do to your mom.” He then made Anna hide behind a chair and watch him have sex with her mother.7 By this point, Anna thought of defendant as “a very scary guy.”', 'Eventually, Anna’s mother decided to leave defendant, and she, Anna, and Anna’s half- sister moved back to Rhode Island without him. They stayed with Anna’s grandparents in Warwick until just after Christmas of 1989. In the beginning of 1990, they moved to Sterling Avenue in Providence. There, Anna learned that her mother was pregnant with defendant’s child yet again. Shortly before Anna’s second half-sister was born on May 21, 1990, defendant came back into their lives, moving into the Sterling Avenue home. However, his return was short- lived; he left soon after the baby’s birth.', 'Despite his abbreviated return, yet another incident occurred during the short time defendant lived with Anna. On a day when Anna’s mother was out of the house, after Anna’s eleventh birthday, defendant again molested her. In defendant and her mother’s bedroom, defendant forcefully pushed Anna onto the bed. After completely undressing her and removing 6', 'This evidence was admitted pursuant to Rule 404(b), and it is not contested on appeal. 7', 'This evidence was admitted pursuant to Rule 404(b), and it is not contested on appeal.', '-4- his own clothes, defendant lay “[f]ully on top of [Anna], between [her] legs.” Anna testified that “[h]e proceeded to put his penis into [her] vagina again” and then ejaculated on her stomach.8 When he got up, according to Anna, defendant threatened to “beat the hell out of [her] mother” if Anna ever told anyone what he had done.', 'For reasons unrelated to the abuse, Anna’s mother kicked defendant out of the house a few months later.', 'In 1992, defendant expressed his desire to spend a weekend with his daughters, Anna’s half-sisters. Anna’s mother made Anna, who was then thirteen years old, go and “keep an eye on the girls.” Anna’s grandfather dropped her and her half-sisters off at a parking lot, where defendant was waiting to pick them up. Anna fastened her half-sisters into the back seat of the car before climbing in through the rear driver’s side door. The defendant, standing at the open driver’s door, reached back and grabbed Anna’s breast.9 He told her that she was “filling out very nicely.” Anna testified that, by this point, she was no longer afraid of defendant, so she slapped his hand away and told him never to touch her again.', 'When Anna was sixteen years old, a high-school health class discussion about sexual harassment motivated her to finally reveal to her mother defendant’s repeated abuse. After telling her mother, Anna was met by her mother’s blank stare, followed by her mother telling her that she had heard defendant had moved out of state, so there was nothing they could do about the abuse. Anna felt that her mother did not believe her.', 'In 2011, Anna reported the abuse to the Providence police. Prompting Anna’s disclosure was her half-sister’s Facebook post, from which Anna learned that defendant had been arrested 8', 'This testimony formed the basis for count 2, which we shall refer to as the Sterling Avenue incident. 9', 'This testimony formed the basis for count 3.', '-5- for similar crimes. Anna testified that, had she not received that information, she would not have come forward with her own allegations against defendant.', 'In the case Anna learned about on Facebook, the alleged victim was defendant’s biological daughter (by a woman other than Anna’s mother), Beth.10 However, those charges against defendant had been dropped because of Beth’s unwillingness to testify when she was sixteen years old. Two years later, Beth expressed interest in Anna’s case because of Beth’s relationship to defendant. She texted the prosecutor on the eve of defendant’s trial, which was set to start on May 30, 2013, to check on its progress. Apparently emboldened by the time that had passed since she was reluctant to testify as to her own allegations, Beth agreed to testify in Anna’s case as a witness for the state. Due to the last-minute discovery revealed to defense counsel on Thursday, May 30, 2013—last-minute as to both the existence of Beth as an expected witness and the anticipated contents of her testimony—the trial justice directed the state to wait until the following Monday, June 3, 2013, to call Beth to the stand, thereby giving defense counsel the weekend to prepare.', 'On that Monday, Beth testified to a sexual assault that defendant, her biological father, attempted on her in 2003, when she was eight years old. Beth recounted that she went to visit her father at his single-room apartment in Cumberland for the first time since he had moved there. The defendant was angry for reasons unknown to Beth and asked her to sit on the bed. She did so, and he walked over to her yelling and calling her names. As Beth sat on the edge of the bed, defendant pushed her back on the bed with one hand and began taking his and her clothes off; Beth struggled to get up, but was unable to do so. The defendant climbed on top of her, and, because she was trying to push him away, he wrapped her arms in his belt and put them 10', 'We again use a fictitious name in the interest of anonymity.', '-6- above her head. He then grounded his arms and legs on either side of Beth, straddling her. The defendant called her names, while simultaneously claiming to be trying to help her. Beth testified that defendant “tried to put [his penis] in [her].” She continued to explain that his penis actually touched her vagina, but, because of her struggling, he was unsuccessful in penetrating her. The defendant eventually gave up and walked away. He got dressed and went outside; she untied her hands, got dressed, called her mother to pick her up, and waited inside. Beth and defendant said nothing to one another before she left, and she told no one what had happened for approximately six years.', 'Like Anna, it took Beth years to reveal what defendant had done to her. She did not disclose the assault until she was fourteen years old, after which defendant was charged. While Beth was hesitant to testify against her father regarding her own allegations, leading to their dismissal, she did testify at the trial in this case. The defendant was found guilty on all three counts of molesting Anna.', 'The crux of defendant’s appeal is that the trial justice should not have allowed Beth to testify. In support of this contention, defendant argues: (1) that the trial justice abused his discretion by failing to exclude Beth’s testimony as a result of the state’s violation of Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure; (2) that the trial justice erred by admitting her testimony pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence; and (3) that, even if Beth’s testimony was admissible under Rule 404(b), the trial justice should have excluded it under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Additionally, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he denied his motions for judgment of acquittal and for a new trial.', '-7-', 'II', 'Discussion', 'A. Rule 16', '1. Standard of Review', 'In reviewing whether a Rule 16 violation occurred, “[t]his Court affords great deference to a trial justice’s decision * * *, and it ‘will not disturb that ruling on appeal unless he or she has committed clear error.’” State v. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d 12, 23 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 229 (R.I. 2008)). The standard of review in determining whether there has been a Rule 16 violation is “extremely narrow.” State v. Espinal, 943 A.2d 1052, 1062 (R.I. 2008). Moreover, in analyzing whether the trial justice fashioned an appropriate remedy for a Rule 16 violation, we “will overturn a trial justice’s ruling only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion.” State v. Ramos, 553 A.2d 1059, 1068 (R.I. 1989).', '2. Analysis', 'When a defendant requests discovery from the state, Rule 16(a)(7),(8) obligates the state to provide a list of witnesses it expects to call, as well as summaries of their expected testimony. “The overarching purpose of Rule 16 is ‘to ensure that criminal trials are fundamentally fair.’” State v. Briggs, 886 A.2d 735, 754 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Gordon, 880 A.2d 825, 832 (R.I. 2005)). After all, “[i]n our adversary system, based as it is upon a single trial held on a single occasion, it is imperative that the defense come to trial as well equipped as possible to raise reasonable doubt in the minds of one or more of the jurors.” State v. Concannon, 457 A.2d 1350, 1352-53 (R.I. 1983). In that sense, then, the rule serves “to eliminate surprise at trial and to ensure that both parties receive the fullest possible presentation of the facts prior to trial.” State v. Langstaff, 994 A.2d 1216, 1219 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Garcia, 643 A.2d 180, 186', '-8- (R.I. 1994)); see also Concannon, 457 A.2d at 1353. Therefore, “[f]ailure to cooperate with the spirit and letter of Rule 16 undermines the judicial process and subjects the noncompliant party to possible sanctioning.” State v. Stravato, 935 A.2d 948, 951 (R.I. 2007) (quoting Ramos, 553 A.2d at 1067). In considering the proper sanction for such a failure to comply, “the trial justice should take into account: (1) the reason for nondisclosure, (2) the extent of prejudice to the opposing party, (3) the feasibility of rectifying that prejudice by a continuance, and (4) any other relevant factors.” State v. Coelho, 454 A.2d 241, 245 (R.I. 1982).', 'In the present case, it was not until the morning of May 30, 2013, after a jury had already been chosen and was about to be sworn, that the state supplemented its response to defendant’s request for discovery. The state then moved to introduce evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b) in the form of Beth’s testimony. The state explained that it had not listed Beth in discovery because she had been unwilling to testify against her father before unexpectedly expressing a desire to do so, and thus the state had not intended to call her as a witness. The trial justice accepted the state’s reason and agreed that this did not appear to be an instance of intentional withholding.11', 'Understandably surprised by the eleventh-hour disclosure, defense counsel strenuously objected to Beth’s testimony. He cited his lack of time to prepare for her testimony and asked that she be excluded as a witness. In response, the trial justice forbade the state from calling Beth to the stand before Monday, June 3, 2013, giving defense counsel the weekend to review 11', 'We decline to accept defendant’s submission at oral argument that the prosecution’s undeniably late disclosure could fairly be characterized as intentional. We glean no evidence from the record to suggest that the prosecution withheld the testimony intentionally, especially in light of the state’s insistence that, when Beth agreed to testify, it informed the court and the defense the next morning. But see State v. Stravato, 935 A.2d 948, 955 (R.I. 2007) (holding that the trial justice committed clear error in determining that, although the state intentionally withheld the victim-impact statement, its good-faith basis for doing so made the nondisclosure unintentional).', '-9- the material as related to her. Nevertheless, the trial justice indicated that he would allow Beth to testify on that date.', 'The state argues that there was no Rule 16 violation because that rule only “mandates disclosure of statements made by those persons whom the State expects to call as witnesses,” and here the prosecution did not expect to call Beth until she agreed in the final moments before trial to testify. We briefly address this argument only to say that we reject the state’s characterization of Rule 16. If this Court adopted the state’s purported interpretation of Rule 16, its intended purpose of “eliminat[ing] surprise at trial and * * * ensur[ing] that both parties receive the fullest possible presentation of the facts prior to trial,” Langstaff, 994 A.2d at 1219 (quoting Garcia, 643 A.2d at 186), would be eviscerated and its protection rendered ineffective because parties could simply wait until the eve of trial to contact witnesses, framing their testimony as “unexpected.” With that said, we hold that the trial justice did not clearly err in determining that there was indeed a Rule 16 violation here.12', 'We next address the remedy that the trial justice adopted to cure this violation. Notably, after objecting to the trial justice’s ruling allowing Beth’s surprise testimony, defense counsel never objected to the remedy fashioned by the trial justice—that is, the trial justice’s decision to allow her to testify on June 3, giving defense counsel three days to prepare.13 Even more 12', 'While the trial justice did not explicitly say that the state had committed a violation of Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, we infer that, because he issued a Rule 16 remedy, he determined that one had occurred. 13', 'The trial justice, after ruling on the admissibility of Beth’s testimony and determining that it must wait until Monday, told defense counsel, “I’ll note your exception.” That statement does not change our determination that defense counsel failed to object to the remedy. Defense counsel’s initial objection related only to the admissibility of Beth’s testimony under Rule 404(b), not to the remedy that the trial justice made to cure the Rule 16 violation, leading us to the conclusion that, even if the exception applied to the trial justice’s remedy, counsel failed to tailor an objection specific enough to preserve the record. See State v. Lyons, 725 A.2d 271, 273 (R.I. 1999) (reiterating that under the “raise-or-waive” rule, “issues that were not preserved by a', '- 10 - importantly, defense counsel made no indication on the day Beth was to testify that he was not prepared. He never expressed any reluctance in proceeding after either his initial objection or after he received the material the following day.', 'We have recognized scenarios where, based on the clear adverse disposition of the trial justice, we do not fault counsel for failing to press the issue further. This is not such a scenario. But see State v. Mead, 544 A.2d 1146, 1150 (R.I. 1988) (holding that a request for a cautionary instruction would have been futile where the trial justice had twice “summarily overruled defendant’s objections”). The trial justice had accommodated defense counsel, and counsel’s failure to raise the issue again did not stem from any failure of the trial justice. Therefore, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in failing to craft an alternative remedy when there was no notice given to him that his original remedy might be inadequate.', 'Still, defendant maintains on appeal that Beth’s testimony should have been excluded altogether. At the outset, we remark “that the sanction of excluding testimony is an extreme and drastic remedy which should be exercised with caution and restraint.” Ramos, 553 A.2d at 1067. The defendant analogizes this case to Langstaff, 994 A.2d at 1220, wherein we held that the trial justice incorrectly allowed the prosecution to introduce Rule 404(b) evidence that it presented to the defense and the court on the morning of the second day of trial. There, we agreed with the prosecution that there was no proof that it deliberately withheld the evidence, but nevertheless determined that it was improper “for the trial justice to have permitted the introduction of this specific objection at trial, sufficiently focused so as to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis for said objection, may not be considered on appeal.” (quoting State v. Toole, 640 A.2d 965, 972- 73 (R.I. 1994) (emphasis added))).', 'Moreover, after “not[ing] [his] exception,” the trial justice gave both counsel the opportunity to put “anything else [on] the record,” an invitation each declined. As such, defense counsel could not rely on the trial justice’s given “exception” to preserve his objection to the trial justice’s chosen remedy for the state’s Rule 16 violation.', '- 11 - evidence for any purpose just a few short hours after [the] defendant was apprised of it.” Langstaff, 994 A.2d at 1220.', 'However, Langstaff is distinguishable. Rather than permitting the evidence “a few short hours” after it came to light, the trial justice gave defense counsel until June 3 to prepare for Beth’s testimony. See Langstaff, 994 A.2d at 1220. We have previously stated that “[i]n light of * * * unexpected and crucial piece[s] of evidence, * * * the court should * * * impose[] a remedy that might at least * * * place[] the defendant in as favorable a position as he would have been had the information been furnished in [a] timely fashion.” State v. Darcy, 442 A.2d 900, 903 (R.I. 1982). As evidence of the prejudice he suffered, defendant emphasized that “there was no mention of [Beth] during his opening statement * * *, only a brief reference during closing argument * * *, and his cross-examination of [Beth] did nothing to probe her truthfulness or her potential bias or motive to lie.” And yet, defense counsel chose not to request a continuance; and, while “acceptance or rejection of a continuance is not the standard to determine if Rule 16 is violated,” it is relevant as to whether defendant was prejudiced, which is the “primary factor” we consider in determining the appropriate remedy for a Rule 16 violation. State v. Olsen, 610 A.2d 1099, 1103 (R.I. 1992) (“[the] defendant undercuts his argument that he was prejudiced by the state’s nondisclosure” in his decision to reject the trial justice’s offer of a continuance); see also Espinal, 943 A.2d at 1063 n.16 (“We note that defense counsel chose not to move for a continuance after he became aware of the information * * *. Such a motion, if granted, would have afforded counsel an opportunity to alter his trial strategy in light of the apology.”).', 'Defense counsel asks us to infer that, where his “cross-examination of [Beth] was noticeably meager,” the allowable suggestion is that he “did not, in fact, have sufficient time to prepare,” and thus was prejudiced. We decline to take such a leap. We are hesitant to make', '- 12 - inferences from what very well might have been a strategic decision of counsel;14 and, because we decline to make such an inference of prejudice, we cannot say that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial justice to give defense counsel three days to “adequately prepare for trial and to plan trial strategy with his or her client.” State v. Small, 735 A.2d 216, 218 (R.I. 1999) (mem.).', '“[W]e have acknowledged that the trial justice is in the best position to fashion a proper remedy for noncompliance with the discovery rule,” and we are satisfied that the trial justice here did just that.

Therefore, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in giving defense counsel the weekend to prepare for Beth’s impending testimony.', 'B. Rule 404(b)', '1.

Both the similarity and contemporaneousness of the', '- 14 - acts are required for a common purpose:', 'to “establish[] a close relationship between the evidence of other bad acts and the crime charged * * *.” State v. Brigham, 638 A.2d 1043, 1045 (R.I. 1994).', 'Our case law does not consider “nonremote” and “similar” to be distinct requirements, and instead the two are born from the same concept and proven in the same manner; that is, “[o]ffenses will be considered sufficiently ‘nonremote’ and ‘similar’ when they are ‘closely related in time, place, age, family relationships of the victims, and the form of the sexual acts.’” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806 (quoting Brigham, 638 A.2d at 1045).', 'We are satisfied here that defendant’s offenses against Anna and Beth fall within this spectrum and are “nonremote” and “similar.” To start, each of defendant’s indiscretions were directed against, for all intents and purposes, daughters in his life: in Anna’s case, the daughter of a girlfriend who called him “Dad,” and in Beth’s case, his biological daughter. Each victim was around eight years old when the abuse first occurred, and away from their mother’s supervision. Although the exact locations differed, the majority of the abuse occurred in what was at the time defendant’s residence, where he had direct access to the victims: in Anna’s case, the home he shared with her mother (with only two exceptions), and with Beth, an apartment in which he lived alone. Moreover, the manner of abuse was similar with each victim in that both cases involved penetration, successful or otherwise. See State v. Hopkins, 698 A.2d 183, 185 n.2, 186 n.4 (R.I. 1997) (affirming trial justice’s decision that probative value outweighed unfair prejudice where the victims were abused in generally the same location, in the same manner, and at the same age by the defendant, with whom they had a similar relationship).', 'The defendant contends that the manner of abuse varies between the victims because Beth’s abuse involved attempted penetration, while Anna’s involved actual penetration. Further, Beth testified that defendant bound her, while Anna did not. As such, defendant asserts that', '- 15 - “[t]he incidents were not alleged to take place under the same circumstances, in the same location, or in the same pattern; nor did they contain uncannily similar facts.” However, in reviewing a trial justice’s admittance of Rule 404(b) evidence, “this Court is ‘disinclined to perceive an abuse of discretion so long as the record contains some grounds for supporting the trial justice’s decision * * *.’” Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d at 279 (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 838). Thus, we are not concerned with whether the incidents were exactly the same, nor with whether they contained “uncannily similar facts.” That said, based on the aforementioned numerous chilling similarities between the indiscretions the two victims alleged, we cannot say that the trial justice abused his discretion in determining that they were sufficiently similar. See State v. Coningford, 901 A.2d 623, 628 (R.I. 2006) (upholding the trial justice’s decision that “remoteness of the prior acts was outweighed by the probative value of the evidence” to show a common scheme, plan, or modus operandi to molest young boys).', 'Additionally, the length of time that spans between defendant’s alleged abuse against Beth and Anna does not alter our holding. Beth testified that the assault on her took place in 2003, which was approximately eleven years after the last incident to which Anna testified. Moreover, the first assault on Anna occurred approximately fifteen years before Beth’s alleged assault. Thus, the time frame between the two acts is between eleven and fifteen years. The defendant acknowledges that we have previously held that spans ranging from seven to eleven years, Coningford, 901 A.2d at 628; State v. Toole, 640 A.2d 965, 969, 971 (R.I. 1994), and ten years, Hopkins, 698 A.2d at 186, were permissible in a Rule 404(b) analysis. When compared to the durations we have previously upheld, the trial justice’s determination that the eleven to fifteen years here was permissible was not an abuse of discretion.', '- 16 -', 'What is more, we emphasize that “[r]emoteness is relative, depending upon the circumstances and the conduct in question.” State v. Pignolet, 465 A.2d 176, 181 (R.I. 1983). When we consider the circumstances of the abuse alleged—that each victim was around eight years old the first time defendant molested, or attempted to molest, them—in light of the length of time between the acts, the eleven to fifteen years appears neither remote nor dissimilar. See id. at 181-82 (“[W]here the similar acts involved sexual abuse of young girls * * * the incident that occurred three years before the trial date is not remote, rather it is a part of a continuing practice of sexually abusing these girls.”). Instead, mindful that remoteness is relative depending upon defendant’s conduct, that eleven to fifteen years does not appear so vast where the second alleged victim was another eight-year-old girl, over whom he also exercised supervision and with whom he had a familial relationship.', 'Accordingly, the trial justice’s finding that Beth’s testimony was nonremote and similar was not an abuse of his discretion.15 15', 'State v. Pereira, 973 A.2d 19 (R.I. 2009), is also instructive here. In that case, we addressed Rule 8(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, which allows the state to charge a defendant with numerous offenses in one indictment where the offenses are “of the same or similar character or are based on the same act or transaction or on two (2) or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.” Pereira, 973 A.2d at 25 (quoting Rule 8(a)). “When analyzing whether offenses charged are properly joined under Rule 8(a), as a ‘same or similar character’ offense, we examine the base offenses charged, the location and time of the offenses, whether the offenses occurred within a close time span, the similarity of the victims, and the modus operandi of the offenses.” Pereira, 973 A.2d at 25. The time span is a particularly important consideration, but is not, in and of itself, determinative. Id. at 25-26.', 'The joined sexual assault charges in Pereira, 973 A.2d at 26, 27, were “separated by a very considerable length of time,”—sixteen to twenty-one years—which certainly troubled the Court. Nevertheless, we held that, balancing all the factors, “the similarities in the statutory offenses, the similarities of the victims both in age and blood relationship to the defendant, and the similarities in the manner of operation of defendant’s actions overc[a]me the undeniable temporal remoteness.” Id. at 27. Analogizing that case to the one before us now, it reinforces our holding today that the eleven-to-fifteen-year time span, when balanced against the similarity of the offenses, was not too damning where “remoteness” is only one factor to consider.', '- 17 -', 'b. Rule 404(b) Exceptions', 'Having been satisfied with the trial justice’s determination that Beth’s testimony was nonremote and similar, we next must examine the appropriateness of the Rule 404(b) exception under which he allowed the state to admit Beth’s testimony. In allowing Beth’s testimony, the trial justice explained that “[a]lthough the words ‘modus operandi’ don’t pertain to this rule, in this particular case the Court finds this is enormously relevant in light of the nature of these crimes of child molestation, sexual assault.” In his limiting instruction to the jury, the trial justice told it to consider the evidence only pertaining to defendant’s “motive, his opportunity, his intent, preparation, his plan as it relates to the testimony given * * * by [Anna].”16', 'Beth’s testimony fits comfortably within a Rule 404(b) exception to show plan to abuse young girls of a similar age with whom he had a similar relationship.17 State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228 (R.I. 2008), then, is helpful. In Merida, 960 A.2d at 232, we held that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding that the Rule 404(b) evidence was “part of a common scheme or plan and * * * relevant to show motive, intent, and plan to abuse children of similar age in a somewhat similar manner.” In so finding, the trial justice in that case considered the following: “both * * * [girls] * * * alleged digital penetration; * * * the ages of both girls at the time [of] the alleged [abuse] * * * were similar (both being young girls above toddler age and below adolescence); * * * both girls had a family relationship with [the] defendant; * * * and * * * both had had unsupervised contact with [the] defendant in his * * * residence.” Id. 16', 'While the trial justice instructed the jury on motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, and plan, we focus only on what we perceive to be the most pertinent exception—plan. See Sobanski v. Donahue, 792 A.2d 57, 58-59 (R.I. 2002) (“Although on appeal this Court will consider only those issues that have been raised before the trial court, in rendering our decisions we are free to decide the case on grounds other than those relied upon by the lower-court judge.”). 17', 'We appreciate that Beth’s testimony is not admissible under the Rule 404(b) exception of “lewd disposition” because Beth is not the complaining witness in the case. See State v. Dubois, 36 A.3d 191, 201 (R.I. 2012).', '- 18 - Moreover, the Rule 404(b) witness there testified to abuse that occurred between 1994 and 1998 (eight to twelve years prior to trial), while the complaining witness testified to abuse between 2001 and 2004 (two to five years prior to trial). Merida, 960 A.2d at 230, 231, 232.', 'The similarities between that case and the present one lead us to determine that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding the “common scheme or plan” exception applicable here.18 See Merida, 960 A.2d at 232. Both Anna and Beth allege that defendant attempted to penetrate them, although he was unsuccessful with Beth due to her resistance. Moreover, Anna and Beth were approximately the same age when the abuse began, each viewed defendant as a father figure (whether biological or otherwise), and both were left alone with defendant. Considered together, Anna’s and Beth’s testimony have at least the same amount of similarities as the accounts in Merida. Id.; see also Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 808 (holding that the trial justice acted within his discretion by admitting evidence as Rule 404(b) “common scheme or plan” exception where defendant sexually assaulted two family friends in a similar manner); see also State v. Cardoza, 465 A.2d 200, 203 (R.I. 1983) (affirming the trial justice’s finding that the Rule 404(b) evidence “was part of [the] defendant’s continuing behavioral pattern of sexually abusing his stepdaughters within the same time period”).', 'Furthermore, it is of no consequence that Beth’s alleged abuse occurred fifteen years after the charged crime.', 'Rule 404(b) and its exceptions refer only to “other” crimes, without distinguishing between previous and subsequent crimes, and we will not read such language into that rule today. 18', 'While the trial justice did not specifically reference “common scheme or plan,” he did acknowledge the “plan” exception, and we remark that “common scheme or plan” and “plan” have been used interchangeably. See State v. Hopkins, 698 A.2d 183, 186 (R.I. 1997).', '- 19 -', 'Therefore, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in determining that the evidence fit within a Rule 404(b) exception.', 'c. Relevance and Reasonable Necessity', 'Next, to be admissible under Rule 404(b), “the evidence must [also] be ‘relevant’ to the crime charged and ‘reasonably necessary.’” Coningford, 901 A.2d at 628-29 (quoting Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627, 382 A.2d at 533).', '1. Relevance', 'We have previously articulated that “Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence defines ‘relevant evidence’ as ‘evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.’”', 'State v. Perez, 161 A.3d 487, 497 (R.I. 2017).', 'Also significant to our analysis, “Rule 402 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence indicates that ‘[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible.’” Perez, 161 A.3d at 497. Thus, “the relevancy bar * * * is quite low.” Id.', 'Beth’s testimony “was indicative of ‘[the] defendant’s lecherous conduct toward’ * * * [girls] ‘over whom he exercised discipline, control, and supervision.’” Perez, 161 A.3d at 497 (quoting Pignolet, 465 A.2d at 182). Despite defendant’s urging otherwise, we do not quibble with the trial justice’s declaration that “[t]he [c]ourt finds that this is relevant in light of the high burden of proof to the [s]tate and in light of the fact that the only witness’s testimony in this particular case with regard to what happened is [Anna] herself * * *.” The trial justice did not allow Beth’s testimony to bolster Anna’s testimony, as defendant suggests, but rather to show a larger pattern of behavior adverse to young girls, demonstrating a plan. See id. Thus, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in concluding that Beth’s testimony was in fact relevant.', '- 20 -', '2. Reasonable Necessity', 'As for whether Beth’s testimony was “reasonably necessary,” “[w]hen charges of sexual abuse hinge upon a credibility contest between [the] defendant and child complainant, relevant evidence of prior sexual misconduct is reasonably necessary to support the complainant’s testimony.” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 808. Although Anna alleges abuse that occurred when she was a child, she testified when she was thirty-four years old. Therefore, we will not extend to Anna the same latitude we do to child complainants. Still, even without such latitude, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in determining that Beth’s testimony was “reasonably necessary” under Rule 404(b).', 'In Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d at 280, we addressed the reasonable necessity of Rule 404(b) testimony of a sexual assault other than the one for which the defendant was on trial. There, we analogized Mohapatra, recalling how we recognized in that case “that prior incidents of sexual assault are reasonably necessary to the state’s case when the victim’s credibility is placed at issue.” Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d at 280. We continued that:', '“We are cognizant that this is a case in which the evidence', 'revealed a crime committed in private with a significant lapse of', 'time between the sexual assaults and the prosecution. The', 'credibility of the complainant was placed at center stage. We', 'therefore are persuaded that this evidence meets the test of', 'relevancy and necessity to the state’s case. It is not cumulative.”', 'Id. (emphasis added). Such a sentiment is applicable to the present case. The abuse of Anna occurred more than two decades ago. See Perez, 161 A.3d at 497 (“In this case, there was no physical evidence or third- party eyewitness testimony presented at trial.”). The trial justice recognized that “the only witness’s testimony in this particular case with regard to what happened is [Anna] herself.” Because it is defendant’s contention that no abuse occurred, there is in effect a “credibility', '- 21 - contest” between the two. See, e.g., id. (holding that Rule 404(b) testimony was reasonably necessary where it turned on the complainant’s testimony, which the defendant attacked).', 'Anna’s credibility, then, is at “center stage,” and Beth’s testimony corroborates Anna’s rendition that defendant engaged in a pattern of sexual abuse of girls to whom he was a father figure.', 'See Hopkins, 698 A.2d at 187 (concluding that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion where he held Rule 404(b) was “reasonably necessary” to “prove the prosecution’s case, which largely turned on a credibility battle”). The reasonable necessity of Beth’s testimony was further heightened by the length of time that had passed since defendant was alleged to have assaulted Anna. We conclude, therefore, that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in determining that Beth’s testimony was reasonably necessary to the state’s case. But see State v. Haslam, 663 A.2d 902, 912 (R.I. 1995) (determining that the trial justice improperly instructed the jury that Rule 404(b) evidence was relevant solely on the issue of credibility).19', 'd. Limiting Instruction', 'We briefly address the final requirement under a Rule 404(b) analysis: that “when such evidence is admitted, the trial justice must instruct the jury on the limited purpose for which the evidence may be considered.” Merida, 960 A.2d at 239. The trial justice acknowledged that he must give a limiting instruction; and, in relaying that instruction to the jury, he said: 19', 'The defendant emphasizes that it only “dawned on” the prosecution the night before trial to call Beth to the stand. Conversely, before the trial justice, the state characterized Beth as “not a last-minute witness, but a witness the [s]tate felt was not prepared to go to any type of hearing against [defendant] * * * it is not a last-minute issue that has come up in the factual outline of this case.” Based on the state’s submission that it did not proceed to trial without Beth’s testimony by its own choosing, defendant’s characterization of Beth’s testimony does not convince us that it was not of reasonable necessity. Had Beth offered to testify at trial and the state declined, our determination today might be different. But because that is not the situation presented before us now, we do not disturb the trial justice’s finding that Beth’s testimony was reasonably necessary to the state’s case.', '- 22 -', '“Ladies and gentlemen, you’re about to hear some testimony about', 'some conduct [with] which * * * [d]efendant is not charged. He is', 'not on trial for this conduct in this particular trial, and if you', 'consider this testimony at all - - and the decision to consider the', 'testimony is solely one of the jurors’ prerogative - - but you may', 'consider the testimony only as it relates to * * * [d]efendant’s', 'motive, his opportunity, his intent, preparation, his plan as it relates', 'to the testimony given to you by [Anna] last week. You may', 'consider this testimony for no other purpose other than that limited', 'ability to consider it for the reasons I just gave you. The', '[d]efendant is not on trial at this time in this case for this particular', 'conduct.” Because the trial justice used language derived directly from Rule 404(b) to instruct the jury, and because we presume that the jury heeded that instruction, we believe his limiting instruction was sufficient. See Mazzaro v. Narragansett Improvement Co., 109 R.I. 244, 250, 283 A.2d 887, 891 (1971) (acknowledging the assumption that a jury follows instructions given by the trial justice).', 'Therefore, having reviewed all of the Rule 404(b) requirements and being satisfied that each was met, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in allowing Beth’s testimony.', 'C. Rule 403', '1. Standard of Review', 'Before addressing defendant’s argument concerning Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, we repeat that “[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is apparent.” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 805 (quoting State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 504 (R.I. 2004)).', '2. Analysis', 'A trial justice’s analysis of Rule 403 “requires [him or her] to not only examine the evidence in the context of the case on trial, but to balance the evidence to determine whether its', '- 23 - probative force ‘is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * * *.’” Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d at 281 (quoting State v. Patel, 949 A.2d 401, 413 (R.I. 2008) and Rule 403). The defendant argues that the unfair prejudice of Beth’s testimony clearly outweighs any probative value, especially because it involves a victim other than the complaining witness in the case.', 'He submits that Beth’s testimony was cumulative, as well as irrelevant, because it described attempted penetration (as opposed to successful penetration) and also elucidated his attempt to bind her, which Anna did not allege occurred with her. The trial justice acknowledged that there was “cumulative effect,” but nonetheless concluded that Beth’s testimony goes to “motive, intent, opportunity, and plan.”', 'In ruling, the trial justice emphasized that he “understand[s] there is a large segment of prejudice, but [Beth’s testimony] is enormously relevant.”', 'The defendant relies on State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140 (R.I. 2009), to support his argument that the trial justice should have excluded Beth’s testimony under Rule 403, but that case is distinguishable. In Gaspar, the trial justice allowed testimony of a prior consensual sexual relationship with the defendant involving rough or aggressive, but nonetheless largely consensual, sex, under Rule 404(b). Gaspar, 982 A.2d at 149. We held that the introduction of that defendant’s “consensual and alleged nonconsensual sexual encounters * * * was very likely to confuse the jury and invite an emotional response.” Id. While we agree that Beth’s testimony was sure to invoke an emotional response where she alleged sexual abuse by defendant, her biological father, we nonetheless agree with the trial justice that the emotional response did not amount to unfair prejudice outweighing its probative value. Unfair prejudice does not arise solely because defendant is Beth’s biological father; in fact, defendant’s relationship to Beth makes her testimony only more relevant in that the familial relationship falls within his pattern of', '- 24 - abuse. See Hopkins, 698 A.2d at 186 (holding that the alleged remoteness of Rule 404(b) evidence was outweighed by potential probative value of victims of a similar age and relationship to the defendant, constituting “a modus operandi that bore [the defendant’s] signature” (quoting State v. Lamoureux, 623 A.2d 9, 13 (R.I. 1993))).', 'Moreover, in Hopkins, 698 A.2d at 186, we acknowledged that the remoteness of evidence is a proper consideration for its potential probative value.', 'In so weighing the remoteness of Beth’s testimony under Rule 403, we believe that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in determining that it did not diminish the testimony’s probative value in comparison to its unfair prejudice. As we accepted above, Beth’s testimony describes a sexual assault against a victim of the same age and gender, a similar familial relationship, and in largely the same manner as the sexual assault against Anna. The age of Anna and Beth is particularly relevant because both girls were approximately the same age when the alleged abuse occurred; the implication that defendant had a predilection for girls of this age—evidenced by Beth’s testimony that defendant abused her at the same age as he did Anna—is enormously relevant to his common scheme or plan of abusing young girls. Thus, we agree that the length of time that separates the two assaults is substantially outweighed by the probative value exemplified through the similarities between Anna and Beth’s accounts.', 'Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting this evidence under Rule 403.', 'D. Motion for New Trial', '1. Standard of Review', 'A motion for new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the trial justice to place “himself or herself in the role of a ‘thirteenth juror’', '- 25 - and then exercise[] his or her independent judgment as to the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence.” State v. Grantley, 149 A.3d 124, 131 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Matthews, 111 A.3d 390, 398 (R.I. 2015)). In doing so, the trial justice then “must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and * * * (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id.

In our review of a trial justice’s decision as to a motion for new trial “[w]e accord great deference * * * ‘because a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.’” State v.

Analysis', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for new trial where the trial justice overlooked inconsistencies pertaining to Anna’s trial testimony and her grand jury testimony, her testimony at defendant’s bail hearing, and her statements to the police. The defendant points to numerous examples.', 'Regarding the Manton Avenue incident, he cites Anna’s inconsistencies as to (1) the clothing she wore at the time of the abuse; (2) her exchange of words with defendant during the incident; (3) its duration; (4) whether defendant ejaculated during the abuse; and (5) the dynamic of her and defendant’s relationship after the abuse. In relation to the Sterling Avenue incident, defendant discusses Anna’s inconsistences as to (1) how it began; (2) her statements during it; and (3) defendant’s statements during the encounter. The', '- 26 - defendant specifically takes issue with Anna’s inconsistent statement as to whether defendant ejaculated during the Manton Avenue incident, arguing that “[e]jaculation is not the type of minor detail that a complaining witness might waver on; this was integral to the sexual assault itself.” Finally, defendant raises concern with the trial justice’s acceptance of Anna’s reason for her delayed disclosure of the abuse, as well as the trial justice’s characterization of Beth’s testimony.', 'In denying defendant’s motion for new trial, the trial justice commented that the defense’s cross-examination of Anna “was excellent with regard to every inconsistency.” Acknowledging Anna’s inconsistencies, the trial justice explained that “[t]here were a number of inconsistencies, and every single one, the defense counsel was able to bring out. * * * For the most part, not a hundred percent, but for the most part [Anna] didn’t even attempt to offer an explanation, except one time * * *.”', 'He determined that Anna was “a credible witness, notwithstanding all the inconsistencies. The main thrust of her testimony, that she was molested on the occasions as described in the indictment, [was] consistent.”', 'We have stated that “inconsistencies in a witness’s testimony do not ‘preclude a determination that the witness[] w[as] credible.’” State v. Diaz, 159 A.3d 1053, 1064 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Lopez, 129 A.3d 77, 85 (R.I. 2016)). Moreover, while Anna’s testimony did contain disparities, “they reflect no more than minor details.” State v.

Further, we reject defendant’s contention that Anna’s inconsistent statements regarding defendant’s ejaculation during the Manton Avenue incident concerns a detail “integral', '- 27 - to the sexual assault itself.” Ejaculation is not required for a conviction of first-degree child molestation. See State v. Pablo, 925 A.2d 894, 901 (R.I. 2007) (“absence of seminal fluid certainly is not mutually exclusive with an act of penetration”). As such, the trial justice was well within his discretion to deny defendant’s motion for new trial.', 'The defendant next argues that Anna’s delayed disclosure substantially undermined her credibility and that the trial justice was clearly wrong in accepting her reason for the delay. At the motion for new-trial hearing, the trial justice recounted that:', '“This was a young lady, * * * eight-years old at the time this', 'happened. And the dynamics of what occurred between [Anna]', 'and her mother * * * was such that the only person - - the Court', 'draws an inference, the only individual that [Anna] could have', 'relied on for safety and protection failed to live up to that role as a', 'mother in the case. The Court is reasonably satisfied that [Anna]', 'may have been reluctant to go to her grandfather to make these', 'kinds of disclosures.” Giving the trial justice his due “great deference,” we cannot say that he was clearly wrong in accepting Anna’s reasoning for her reluctance to disclose defendant’s abuse. See Whitaker, 79 A.3d at 804.', 'Last, defendant argues that the trial justice improperly considered Beth’s testimony as evidence of defendant’s bad character. The defendant points to two statements the trial justice made regarding Beth’s testimony:', '“The [c]ourt also had an opportunity to consider [defense', 'counsel’s] motion to suppress all references to any other', 'convictions for which [defendant] had been convicted of. * * *', 'Those convictions pale in comparison.

At the motion for new-trial hearing, the trial justice explicitly stated the purpose for which he allowed Beth’s testimony—“as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity[,] or the absence of mistake or accident.” The statements that defendant isolates do not show that the trial justice considered Beth’s testimony for any purpose other than those on which he instructed the jury.', 'Therefore, we conclude that the trial justice neither clearly erred, nor did he overlook or misconceive material evidence in analyzing defendant’s motion for new trial.', 'E. Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', '1.

The motion “may be granted only if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, is insufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Lynch, 19 A.3d 51, 56 (R.I. 2011).', '2. Analysis', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to the first two counts of the indictment, each charging first-degree child molestation. Specifically, count 1 charged that defendant engaged in penile/vaginal penetration with Anna sometime between October 1, 1987, and August 22, 1988; and count 2 charged that he engaged', '- 29 - in penile/vaginal penetration with Anna on a date between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1990. The defendant maintains that the conduct he engaged in did not amount to penetration as defined by statute.', '“A person is guilty of first[-]degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” Section 11-37-8.1. “Sexual penetration” is defined as “sexual intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, and anal intercourse, or any other intrusion, however slight, by any part of a person’s body or by any object into the genital or anal openings of another person’s body, or the victim’s own body upon the accused’s instruction, but emission of semen is not required.” Section 11-37-1(8) (emphasis added). In light of this definition, we analyze defendant’s argument as to each count.', '1. Count 1', 'The Manton Avenue incident formed the basis for count 1. At trial, Anna testified that, as she sat on the couch and watched television, defendant asked her if she wanted to do something fun. She recalled agreeing, resulting in defendant laying her on the couch and moving on top of her. Removing both of their pants, he straddled her.

Was any part of his body touching your body?', '“A: His penis was rubbing up against my vagina.', '***', '“Q: So when you say his penis was rubbing up against you, did it', 'at some point go inside of you?', '“A: Technically, yes.', '“Q: When you say, ‘technically, yes,’ what do you mean?', '“A: It was explained to me that even if it was on my labia it was', 'still ——', '“[Defense Counsel]: Objection.', '“THE COURT: Sustained.', '- 30 -', '“Q: Did you feel his penis inside of you?', '“A: Yes.', '***', '“Q: When you say inside of you, what part of your body was his', 'penis in?', '“A: My labia.', '“Q: Which is what part of your body?', '“A: Vagina.', '“Q: Do you know how long it lasted?', '“A: About thirty seconds.', '***', '“Q: But for that [thirty] seconds, you felt his penis in your vagina?', '“A: Yes.', '***', '“Q: The act of penetration happened for about [thirty] seconds.', 'How long do you think the entire act happened?', '“A: Total, about two minutes.” The defendant’s contention that Anna’s testimony was tainted by her statement that “technically” defendant’s penis was in her “labia,” which she thereafter testified meant her vagina, is unconvincing.', 'In his brief, defendant concedes that “had [Anna’s] testimony been clear regarding intrusion into the labia, it would have been sufficient to establish intrusion into a genital area, and thus, sexual penetration.” Based on the entire colloquy between Anna and the prosecutor, we are satisfied that Anna’s testimony as to the Manton Avenue incident shows that defendant vaginally penetrated her. Even if initially unclear, Anna affirmatively agreed with the prosecutor three times when questioned about when defendant was “inside” her. But see In the Matter of B.H., 138 A.3d 774, 782 (R.I. 2016) (holding that the use of the word “butt” was too imprecise and vague to convey whether there was an intrusion, however slight, into the anal opening of each complainant).', '- 31 -', 'Anna’s testimony, in light of her clarification, was sufficiently “precise” and “specific” to prove penetration beyond a reasonable doubt.20 See State v.

Accordingly, viewing Anna’s testimony in the light most favorable to the prosecution, there was sufficient evidence of defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt as to count 1. See Lynch, 19 A.3d at 56.', '2. Count 2', 'The defendant also alleges that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to the Sterling Avenue incident, which formed the basis for count 2.

She testified that, when she visited defendant at his apartment, defendant pushed her onto the bed, undressed her, and took off his pants before lying on top of her. Anna testified as follows:', '“Q: When he is on top of you, what does he do next?', '“A: He attempts to have intercourse with me.', '“Q: When you say ‘attempts to have intercourse’ with you, what', 'do you mean?', '“A: He proceeded to put his penis into my vagina again.', '“Q: And you felt his penis in your vagina?', '“A: Yes.', '***', '“Q: So his penis goes into your vagina, how long do you think that', 'lasts?', '“A: I can’t —— I can’t answer.', '“Q: But you felt it inside of you?', '“A: Yes.', '“Q: And this time you have no clothes on, he has no clothes on? 20', 'Because we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence in light of our conclusion that Anna’s statement that “technically” defendant was inside her did not taint the remainder of her testimony, we need not address defendant’s assertion that “touching of external female genitalia—‘on’ the labia, as [Anna] initially testified—is not sexual intercourse or an intrusion, however slight, into a genital opening.”', '- 32 -', '“A: Correct.', '“Q: What happens after —— strike that. Does he eventually take', 'his penis out of your vagina?', '“A: Yes.” The defendant takes issue with Anna’s assertion that defendant “attempt[ed] to have intercourse” with her, which he argues does not sufficiently prove penetration. If her testimony had stopped there, we would be inclined to agree. However, after making that statement, Anna immediately clarified that, by “attempt to have intercourse,” she meant that he “proceeded to put his penis into [her] vagina again.” Anna’s subsequent clarification was “precise” and “specific” as to vaginal penetration; and, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, it was adequate to prove penetration beyond a reasonable doubt.

But it is my opinion that, in this case, the elasticity of the rule has been stretched beyond the breaking point.', 'We have in this jurisdiction a well-established body of case law with respect to the admissibility of 404(b) evidence of a defendant’s sexual offenses against a person other than the complaining witness. For such evidence to be properly admitted, we have said, time and time again, that it must be (1) nonremote and similar to the charged conduct; (2) admitted only to prove a Rule 404(b) exception that is relevant to proving the crime charged; and (3) reasonably necessary to prove the crime charged. See State v. Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d 268, 280 (R.I. 2017); State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 28-29 (R.I. 2013); State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 237, 239 (R.I. 2008); State v.

Jalette, 119 R.I. 614, 627, 382 A.2d 526, 533 (1978).1 In my opinion, Beth’s testimony falls short in all three respects. I will address each in turn. 1', 'To be clear, these cases do not include those relying on the so-called “lewd-disposition” exception to Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. See State v. Jalette, 119 R.I. 614, 627, 382 A.2d 526, 533 (1978) (adopting the holding that “evidence of other not too remote sex crimes with the particular person concerned in the crime on trial may be introduced to show the accused’s ‘lewd disposition or * * * intent’ towards the person”). It is important to note that the lewd-disposition exception is applicable to 404(b) evidence of uncharged sexual acts against only the complainant, not another victim. See State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 29 n.8 (R.I. 2013); State v. Coningford, 901 A.2d 623, 627 n.5 (R.I. 2006); State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 806 n.4 (R.I. 2005). In State v. Pignolet, 465 A.2d 176 (R.I. 1983), this Court extended the lewd- disposition exception solely to admit the “testimony of siblings of tender years” where the “similar but uncharged sexual conduct [was] closely related in time, place, age, and family relationships of victims [and] where it was relevant, material, and highly probative of an accused’s lecherous conduct toward the victims over whom the defendant exercised discipline, control, and supervision.” State v. Bernier, 491 A.2d 1000, 1004-05 (R.I. 1985) (clarifying the “very narrow” holding in Pignolet); see Pignolet, 465 A.2d at 181-82. In fact, we later said that', '- 34 -', '1', 'Nonremote and Similar', 'It is well-settled law that, for purposes of Rule 404(b), sexual “[o]ffenses will be considered sufficiently ‘nonremote’ and ‘similar’ when they are ‘closely related in time, place, age, family relationships of the victims, and the form of the sexual acts.’” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806 (quoting State v. Brigham, 638 A.2d 1043, 1045 (R.I. 1994)). My quarrel here is with the temporal factor.2 I cannot agree that the incidents to which Anna and Beth testified are “closely related in time” whatsoever. Id. (quoting Brigham, 638 A.2d at 1045).', '“Pignolet represented the extreme beyond which we are unwilling', 'to extend the other-crimes (or bad-acts) exception because of its', 'overwhelming prejudice to defendant and its tendency to be', 'viewed by the trier of fact as evidence that defendant is a bad man,', 'and that he has a propensity toward sexual offenses and, therefore,', 'probably committed the offense with which he is charged.” State', 'v. Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d 879, 886 (R.I. 1996). I find it noteworthy that the author of the Jalette opinion vigorously dissented in Pignolet, decrying, “the rationale that led to Jalette has been laid to its eternal rest without benefit of so much as a eulogy.” Pignolet, 465 A.2d at 184 (Kelleher, J., joined by Bevilacqua, C.J., dissenting); see also Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d at 886 (stating that “[t]here is no question that Pignolet expanded the Jalette doctrine insofar as it related to two stepdaughters in the same household but went beyond the narrow exceptions set forth in Jalette”).', 'Nonetheless, the majority has seemingly relied on the lewd-disposition exception in explaining how Beth’s testimony was relevant to proving the crime that defendant was charged with committing against Anna. The majority, quoting prior case law, writes in its opinion that Beth’s testimony “was indicative of ‘[the] defendant’s lecherous conduct toward’ * * * [girls] ‘over whom he exercised discipline, control, and supervision.’” State v. Perez, 161 A.3d 487, 497 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Pignolet, 465 A.2d at 182). Again, the “very narrow” (Bernier, 491 A.2d at 1004) holding in Pignolet only “expanded the Jalette doctrine insofar as it related to two stepdaughters in the same household[,]” and it “represented the extreme beyond which we are unwilling to extend the other-crimes (or bad-acts) exception * * *.” Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d at 886. 2', 'I do not disagree that the Manton Avenue and Sterling Avenue incidents involving Anna and the incident that Beth described are similar. But I am of the opinion that nonremoteness and similarity are distinct inquiries, as discussed infra.', '- 35 -', 'To be sure, this Court previously has approved the admission of evidence of uncharged sexual offenses against victims other than the complainants, even though the misdeeds were several years removed from the charged crimes. See Merida, 960 A.2d at 230-31, 232, 239 (six years at shortest interval, ten years at longest); Coningford, 901 A.2d at 628 (seven and eleven years, respectively, for two victims); Hopkins, 698 A.2d at 186 (ten years); Davis, 670 A.2d at 790 (nine years).3 “However, there is a point beyond which such remoteness may not go.” State v. Schlak, 111 N.W.2d 289, 292 (Iowa 1961) (holding five years too remote). I believe this case has passed that point, and I believe, respectfully, that with this holding, the Court has written the temporal aspect of Rule 404(b) jurisprudence out of the law.', 'Count 1 charged defendant with first-degree child molestation that occurred sometime at the end of 1987 or the beginning of 1988. That charge involved defendant’s laying eight-year- old Anna, his girlfriend’s daughter with whom he lived, flat on the couch; climbing on top of her; straddling her; removing her pants and underwear; rubbing his penis against her vagina; and penetrating her labia. Count 2 charged defendant with first-degree child molestation at some point in 1990.', 'That charge alleged that defendant forcefully pushed Anna onto his bed, completely undressed her, lay fully on top of her, with his legs between hers, and penetrated her vagina. Count 3 charged defendant with second-degree child molestation sometime between April 1, 1992 and August 30, 1992. That charge alleged that defendant grabbed Anna’s breast. 3', 'Again, I cite no cases relying on the lewd-disposition exception. This is so because, in a given case where the Rule 404(b) testimony concerns the complaining witness, I may feel it appropriate to analyze the remoteness factor differently than I do in this case. For instance, in State v. Toole, 640 A.2d 965 (R.I. 1994), the defendant challenged the admission of the child complainant’s testimony of uncharged offenses committed against her by the defendant seven to eleven years prior to the charged offenses. Id. at 969. There, because the evidence that the defendant had molested his biological daughter beginning when she was four years old was permitted for the purpose of showing his lewd disposition toward that particular girl throughout her childhood, id. at 971, I would agree that its admission was proper in that case notwithstanding that, at first blush, eleven years seems remote in the plainest sense of the word.', '- 36 -', 'As evidence that defendant committed these crimes against Anna, Beth was permitted to testify to a sexual assault that defendant, her biological father whom she rarely saw, attempted in 2003, when she was eight years old. Beth said that, as she sat on the edge of defendant’s bed in his single-room apartment, defendant pushed her back on the bed and began taking his and her clothes off; all the while, Beth was struggling to get up. According to Beth, defendant climbed on top of her, and, because she was trying to push him away, he wrapped her arms in his belt and put them above her head. He then put his arms and legs on either side of Beth, straddling her. Beth testified that defendant tried to put his penis in her vagina. According to Beth, his penis actually touched her vagina, but because of her kicking him away as she struggled to get up, he was unsuccessful in his efforts to penetrate her.', 'Beth’s testimony alleging prior acts by defendant could be considered similar to the charges set out in counts 1 and 2, which predate the 404(b) evidence by fifteen years and thirteen years, respectively.4', 'Whether we use fifteen or thirteen years as the operative period for analyzing the remoteness of the 404(b) evidence in this case, the amount of time that passed here is simply too great to be considered nonremote under any commonsense definition of the word. There was no indication that the charges involving Anna and the incident about which Beth testified were part of some continuing course of conduct by defendant; rather, as they appeared at trial, they were completely isolated incidents. See Tyson v. State, 503 S.E.2d 640, 641 (Ga. Ct. App. 1998); State v. Ray, 882 P.2d 1013, 1015-16 (Mont. 1994); State v. Jones, 369 S.E.2d 822, 824 (N.C. 1988); State v. Chapman, 168 N.E.2d 14, 16 (Ohio Ct. App. 1959); see also Commonwealth v. Hanlon, 694 N.E.2d 358, 367 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998) (allowing subsequent 4', 'Count 3, which bears no resemblance at all to the incident Beth described, involved an incident which occurred eleven years earlier. I acknowledge that the interval between count 3 and the 404(b) evidence is one this Court has affirmed in the past.

Pignolet, 465 A.2d 176, 181 (R.I. 1983). Therefore, I by no means suggest imposing a bright-line temporal cutoff when it comes to analyzing remoteness for purposes of Rule 404(b). See Ray, 882 P.2d at 1016 (declining to set arbitrary time limits for admitting prior-acts evidence). “It is, however, never to be lost sight of that the defendant is entitled to be tried upon competent evidence and only for the offense charged * * *.” Hall v. United States, 235 F. 869, 870 (9th Cir. 1916) (emphasis added); see also id. at 871 (holding that evidence of assault on another victim three years earlier was too remote); State v. Nicks, 332 P.2d 904, 904, 906 (Mont. 1958) (holding that similar crimes in another state four years earlier were too remote); State v. Moubray, 81 S.E.2d 117, 122 (W. Va. 1954) (holding that the last prior bad act which “occurred more than three years before the commission of the specific offense charged” was too remote). In my opinion, the event Beth described was simply too far removed in time to be used as evidence against defendant in this trial on these charges, and it should have been excluded.', 'The Court today recasts the rule to the extent that, as long as the 404(b) evidence is sufficiently similar to the charged conduct, it need not be sufficiently nonremote. The majority rationalizes this conclusion by saying that temporal relation is but one of many factors to be considered. See Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806 (holding that, for purposes of Rule 404(b), sexual “[o]ffenses will be considered sufficiently ‘nonremote’ and ‘similar’ when they are ‘closely related in time, place, age, family relationships of the victims, and the form of the sexual acts’” (quoting Brigham, 638 A.2d at 1045)). It is my view, however, that the nonremoteness and', '- 38 - similarity inquiries should not be conflated. Of the five factors set forth in Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806, four address similarities and one squarely addresses temporal proximity. I fail to see how satisfaction of some of those factors obviates the need for satisfaction of the others. If the majority’s reasoning is correct, then we have effectively eliminated the requirement that 404(b) evidence of sexual offenses must be “closely related in time,” id. (quoting Brigham, 638 A.2d at 1045), as that language now has been rendered utterly meaningless.', '2', 'Relevant Rule 404(b) Exception', 'Rule 404(b) permits evidence of a defendant’s other crimes, wrongs, or acts to be admitted for the purpose of proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.5', 'Although there has been flexibility in the interpretation of the rule, it is beyond dispute that the rule bars such evidence when offered to prove the defendant’s character in order to show that he acted in conformity therewith.6 Accordingly, “[i]n molestation or sexual assault cases, evidence of a defendant’s prior sexual misconduct cannot be admitted to prove that ‘defendant is a bad man, and that he has a propensity toward sexual offenses and, therefore, probably committed the offenses with which he is charged.’” Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 806 (quoting State v. Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d 879, 886 (R.I. 1996)). Thus, for Beth’s testimony to have been properly admitted, it must have been 5', 'Although we have recognized that the list of exceptions set forth in the second sentence of Rule 404(b) is not exhaustive, see State v. Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d 268, 280 (R.I. 2017), none of the other exceptions which have been developed through our case law could possibly apply in this case. See, e.g., State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 950 (R.I. 2008) (evidence also admissible when other crimes, wrongs, or acts “are interwoven or in instances when introduction is necessary for ‘a trier of fact to hear a complete and, it is to be hoped, coherent story so as to make an accurate determination of guilt or innocence’” (quoting State v. Gomes, 690 A.2d 310, 316 (R.I. 1997))); Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627, 382 A.2d at 533 (adopting the lewd-disposition exception). 6', 'This is precisely the reason why those permissible purposes outlined in Rule 404(b) are widely recognized as “exceptions” to the character evidence rule.', '- 39 - offered to prove one of the aforementioned permissible Rule 404(b) exceptions, and that exception must also have been relevant to proving the charges against defendant.', 'And, importantly, it remains our law that “any doubt as to the relevancy of such evidence should be resolved in favor of the accused.” Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627, 382 A.2d at 533.', 'The majority shoehorns Beth’s testimony into the plan exception under Rule 404(b). I cannot agree. As I have addressed earlier in this dissent, the earlier charges concerning Anna and the later incident that involved Beth were separated by well over a decade and were completely unconnected incidents in the context of the evidence presented at trial. There was no demonstration by the state that the later sexual misconduct was “part and parcel” of a common scheme or plan by defendant, or that the subsequent act and the charges were “linked as integral components of * * * defendant’s common purpose or plan to commit the current charge[s,]” State v. Aakre, 46 P.3d 648, 655 (Mont. 2002), so I can reach no other conclusion than that the plan exception under Rule 404(b) is wholly inapplicable to Beth’s testimony. “Th[is] random and remote act[] [in 2003 was] not relevant in establishing that [defendant] acted according to an explicit and premeditated plan in [1988 and 1990].” Commonwealth v. Bradley, 364 A.2d 944, 946-47 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1976) (other bad acts occurred almost three years after the crime charged).', 'Yet, the majority reasons that evidence of defendant’s molestation of Beth was admissible to prove his “plan,” thirteen to fifteen years earlier, to commit first-degree child molestation against Anna. Ironically, the plan exception under Rule 404(b) is the one most closely related to the threshold remoteness inquiry. See Aakre, 46 P.3d at 654 (“Indeed, for Rule 404(b) purposes we conclude that proof of mere similarity of crimes is insufficient, on a stand alone basis, to demonstrate a ‘common purpose or plan that results in the repeated commission of', '- 40 - the same offense.’', 'Rather, application of this definition of common scheme also requires showing that the crimes occurred within a time frame that supports the conclusion that the similar offenses were committed to achieve a common purpose or plan related to the commission of the current charge.”); State v. Winter, 648 A.2d 624, 629 (Vt. 1994) (“[T]emporal proximity is a prerequisite to admission in plan or scheme cases.”). In that sense, the majority now approves of a thirteen- to fifteen-year interval as both nonremote and part of a common plan. I am unable to concur with such a holding.', 'In essence, the Court’s holding today “allow[s] a common scheme to be proven by the simple expedient of aggregating similar criminal acts without regard to the time frame within which those acts occurred and without regard to whether those acts were actually part of a common purpose or plan to commit the offense at issue.” Aakre, 46 P.3d at 654. The majority plainly writes that “Anna’s and Beth’s testimony have at least the same amount of similarities as the accounts in Merida[,]” 960 A.2d at 232, to be admitted as proof of a plan. But it is fundamental that “[e]vidence of other crimes must be connected by point of time and circumstance. Through this commonality, proof of one act may reasonably prove a second. However, the passage of time between the commission of the two acts slowly erodes the commonality between them.” Jones, 369 S.E.2d at 824. Despite this erosion, the majority declares that “the length of time that spans between defendant’s alleged abuse against Beth and Anna does not alter our holding.” By aggregating the incidents concerning Anna and Beth without considering the decade-plus interval separating them, “the limited purpose for allowing common scheme evidence under Rule 404(b) [is] effectively nullified.” Aakre, 46 P.3d at 654. After all, logic dictates that both similarity and proximity in time are prerequisites to inferring the existence of a plan because “admission of uncharged misconduct evidence to show a plan', '- 41 - ‘comes perilously close’ to using such evidence to show propensity * * *.” Winter, 648 A.2d at 629 (quoting State v. Catsam, 534 A.2d 184, 194 (Vt. 1987)). Accordingly, I firmly believe that “[t]he period of [thirteen to fifteen] years ‘substantially negate[s] the plausibility of the existence of an ongoing and continuous plan to engage persistently in such deviant activities[,]’” and, “[a]s such, the reasoning that gave birth to Rule 404(b) exceptions is lost.” Jones, 369 S.E.2d at 824 (quoting State v. Shane, 285 S.E.2d 813, 821 (N.C. 1982)).', 'Additionally, when giving the jury the requisite limiting instruction, see State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 1052 (R.I. 2000), the trial justice is required to specify the particular Rule 404(b) exception for which the evidence is being introduced. See State v. Sorel, 746 A.2d 704, 707 (R.I. 2000); State v. Gomes, 690 A.2d 310, 317 (R.I. 1997); State v. Brown, 626 A.2d 228, 234 (R.I. 1993); Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627, 382 A.2d at 533. The Seventh Circuit has cogently explained the reason for this necessity:', '“Because other-act evidence can serve several purposes at once,', 'evidentiary disputes under Rule 404(b) often raise the following', 'question: Does a permissible ultimate purpose (say, proof of the', 'defendant’s knowledge or intent) cleanse an impermissible', 'subsidiary purpose (propensity)? On the surface the rule seems to', 'permit this. But if * * * the rule allows the admission of other bad', 'acts whenever they can be connected to the defendant’s', 'knowledge, intent, or identity (or some other plausible non-', 'propensity purpose), then the bar against propensity evidence', 'would be virtually meaningless.” United States v. Gomez, 763', 'F.3d 845, 855 (7th Cir. 2014); accord United States v. Miller, 673', 'F.3d 688, 696-97 (7th Cir. 2012) (explaining that the “list of', 'exceptions in Rule 404(b), if applied mechanically, would', 'overwhelm the central principle” of the rule because “[a]lmost any', 'bad act evidence simultaneously condemns by besmirching', 'character and by showing one or more of” the permissible purposes', '(quoting United States v. Beasley, 809 F.2d 1273, 1279 (7th Cir.', '1987))). In an effort “[t]o resolve this inherent tension in the rule,” the trial justice is called upon to examine “the chain of reasoning that supports the non-propensity purpose for admitting the', '- 42 - evidence.” Gomez, 763 F.3d at 856; see also Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627, 382 A.2d at 533 (“In seeking to attain this particular goal [that the applicable exception is relevant to proving the charge lodged against the defendant], the trial court may insist that the prosecutor point to the specific exception on which he relies and show how that exception relates to the pending charge.”). The evidence should be excluded under Rule 404(b) “if its relevance to ‘another purpose’ is established only through the forbidden propensity inference.” Gomez, 763 F.3d at 856. To that end, the trial justice “should not just ask whether the proposed other-act evidence is relevant to a non-propensity purpose but how exactly the evidence is relevant to that purpose—or more specifically, how the evidence is relevant without relying on a propensity inference.” Id.', 'Here, the trial justice listed the following exceptions when he instructed the jury as to the limited purposes for Beth’s testimony: motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, and plan. The majority now designates but one of those exceptions (plan) as the permissible basis for admitting Beth’s testimony. I do not believe that any of these exceptions applies, let alone all of them. It seems obvious that neither motive nor intent was “at issue” in this case, and therefore, Beth’s testimony could not have been admitted to shed light on those issues. Quattrocchi, 681 A.2d at 886; see also United States v. Lee, 724 F.3d 968, 976 (7th Cir. 2013) (“Simply because a subject like intent is formally at issue when the defendant has claimed innocence and the government is obliged to prove his intent as an element of his guilt [it] does not automatically open the door to proof of the defendant’s other wrongful acts for purposes of establishing his intent.”); Freeman v. State, 486 P.2d 967, 977 (Alaska 1971) (“Manifestly, where there is no dispute as to the issue of the accused’s intent, evidence going merely to intent will be superfluous, and its only possible effect will be a deleterious one.”). Notwithstanding the irrelevance, and thus inapplicability, of these exceptions, I also fail to fathom how the motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, or plan to', '- 43 - commit the charged acts could be demonstrated by alleged misconduct that did not occur until a decade and a half later. In other words, how could something that defendant did in 2003 have any tendency to prove his motive, intent, etc., in 1988?7', 'But, even assuming there were a single permissible Rule 404(b) exception, I believe that the trial justice’s instruction did not specify the particular, limited purpose for which the jury could use Beth’s testimony.8 See Jalette, 119 R.I. at 627-28, 382 A.2d at 533 (“In its charge the trial court should not take a scatter-shot approach and list all of the exceptions to the exclusionary rule. Rather, it shall designate with particularity the specific exceptions to which the ‘other crimes’ evidence is relevant and delete from its charge the remaining exceptions.”). Instead, the trial justice broadly listed multiple grounds for the admission of Beth’s testimony, and this Court has now selected the one that it believes best fits the facts of the case (even though it does not). In my opinion, this is not a sufficient basis for the admission of this testimony. After all, “the grounds for admission specified in Rule 404(b) are not magic words, the utterance of which automatically admits all uncharged misconduct evidence.” Winter, 648 A.2d at 627. Yet this Court now sanctions a situation where the trial justice can simply list all Rule 404(b) exceptions when he imparts a “limiting” instruction to the jury. On appeal, this Court (if it hews 7', 'I do not suggest that none of the Rule 404(b) exceptions could ever apply to a subsequent bad act, but it seems clear to me that only very limited and unusual facts and circumstances would allow for the use of such evidence. For example, a subsequent act that is part of a continuing course of conduct or larger plan or scheme might be admitted as tending to prove the commission of the earlier crime charged. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hanlon, 694 N.E.2d 358, 367 (Mass. App. Ct. 1998) (“Although the last witness claimed to have been abused in 1990 and 1991, nine years after the last charged act, this testimony was not too remote, given the continuing nature of the pattern, and the striking similarity of each incident to the charged acts.” (Emphasis added.)). Of course, as in the instance of prior acts, if “subsequent acts are too remotely related to the act upon which the prosecution is based, in point of time, to be without probative force, such evidence should not be admitted.” Harrison v.

By this decision, the trial justice is now relieved of the burden to examine the “chain of reasoning” to discern whether the evidence’s “relevance to ‘another purpose’ is established only through the forbidden propensity inference.” Gomez, 763 F.3d at 856.', 'In this case, none of the purposes listed by the trial justice were even “genuinely in issue.” Winter, 648 A.2d at 627. And again, even taking the enunciated exceptions at face value, the fact that the 404(b) evidence consisted of an incident so many years after the crimes charged simply precludes its use for those purposes. This conclusion is buttressed by examining “how exactly the evidence [was] relevant to [those] purpose[s]—or more specifically, how the evidence [was] relevant without relying on a propensity inference.” Gomez, 763 F.3d at 856. It seems clear to me that defendant’s later sexual abuse of Beth “was relevant to his motive, intent, [and] plan * * * with respect to the acts for which he was tried only insofar as the [subsequent] sexual abuse tended to show a propensity to commit such acts. Rule 404(b) flatly proscribes the admission of other act evidence for this purpose.” United States v. Fawbush, 634 F.3d 420, 422 (8th Cir. 2011); see also State v. Kirsch, 662 A.2d 937, 943 (N.H. 1995) (“Whether nominally labeled motive, intent or common plan, the ostensible purpose for which the prosecution sought to admit evidence of a multitude of other uncharged sexual assaults was to show the defendant’s predilection for molesting young females * * *. At most, this is evidence of the defendant’s disposition to commit the offenses with which he was charged, impermissible under Rule 404(b). Because it was not relevant for a permissible purpose, the evidence should have been excluded, and its introduction was an abuse of discretion.”).', 'To quote the articulate admonitory words of the late Chief Justice Weisberger: “In sum the only purpose of this testimony was to show propensity. * * * This result Rule 404(b) will not', '- 45 - permit by its express terms. * * * I fear that the opinion of the majority would cause the exceptions set forth in Rule 404(b) * * * to swallow the rule and render it a nullity.” Hopkins, 698 A.2d at 190-91 (Weisberger, C.J., dissenting). Although “[t]he line between Rule 404(b) evidence presented for the impermissible purpose of demonstrating propensity and Rule 404(b) evidence presented for one of the specific non-propensity exceptions is ‘both a fine one to draw and an even more difficult one for judges and juries to follow[,]’” State v. Brown, 900 A.2d 1155, 1160 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Garcia, 743 A.2d at 1052), we must draw the line somewhere so as not to eviscerate the rule.', '3', 'Reasonably Necessary', 'Even assuming that the 404(b) evidence were nonremote and similar, and further assuming it was admitted only to prove a relevant Rule 404(b) exception, it would have been admissible only if it were reasonably necessary to prove the crimes charged. “In determining whether evidence is necessary to establish the state’s prima facie case, ‘the test we must apply is what appeared to be reasonably necessary to the trial justice at the time [the testimony is offered].’” Brigham, 638 A.2d at 1046 (quoting Pignolet, 465 A.2d at 182). As a preliminary matter, I do find it significant that the state did not find Beth’s testimony to be necessary to prove its case until the eve of trial—when Beth texted the prosecutor, and not the other way around. In other words, the state was fully prepared to go to trial without her. Thus, at the time the testimony was offered, see id., I believe the trial justice should have taken this lack of need into account.', 'I agree with the statement of the majority that, because she was an adult when she testified, Anna should not have been afforded the same latitude as child complainants. See', '- 46 - Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 808 (“When charges of sexual abuse hinge upon a credibility contest between defendant and child complainant, relevant evidence of prior sexual misconduct is reasonably necessary to support the complainant’s testimony.” (Emphasis added.)). But, in my opinion, the Court is now extending that latitude to her anyway. The majority reasons that Beth’s testimony was necessary because the case was entirely a credibility contest between defendant and Anna.9 This is precisely the rationale that underlies the child complainant cases cited by the majority. See State v. Perez, 161 A.3d 487, 497 (R.I. 2017); Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 808; Hopkins, 698 A.2d at 187. But see Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d at 281 (involving a late disclosure by an adult complaining witness and quoting Mohapatra, 880 A.2d at 808, for the proposition that “[w]hen charges of sexual abuse hinge upon a credibility contest between [a] defendant and [child] complainant, relevant evidence of prior sexual misconduct is reasonably necessary to support the complainant’s testimony”).', 'As the majority sees it, any case prompted by a late disclosure or without physical evidence (be it a sexual assault or molestation case or otherwise) is nothing more than a credibility contest in which evidence of a defendant’s other bad acts can be admitted to bolster the complainant’s testimony. There is no longer any regard for whether the complaining witness is a child, who may be unable to handle the pressures of testifying and accurately recount traumatic events, or an adult. In fact, a defendant need not even testify to render a trial a credibility contest; the sole fact that the defendant goes to trial is apparently enough. Mere cross-examination of a complaining witness to test the veracity of his or her testimony transforms a trial on only those crimes charged into a free-for-all whereby the state can show that the defendant is a bad person who should be convicted. 9', 'It is noteworthy that defendant did not testify.', '- 47 -', '“Mere weakness of the prosecution’s case is insufficient reason to admit irrelevant and prejudicial evidence.” State v. Lamoureux, 623 A.2d 9, 13 (R.I. 1993). Yet the majority approves of the trial justice’s allowing Beth to testify simply because the state had the burden of proof and had no evidence other than the testimony of Anna. I do not agree that those reasons make Beth’s testimony reasonably necessary to prove the charges against defendant.', 'Conclusion', 'Even a defendant charged with the most despicable of acts is entitled to be tried with evidence that is relevant and which does not highlight his propensity for criminal acts. Because I believe that the testimony of Beth was improperly admitted, I most respectfully dissent from the Court’s holding in this case and would vacate the conviction and remand the matter to the Superior Court for a new trial.', 'Justice Robinson, dissenting. While I join in Justice Flaherty’s thoughtful dissent, which is predicated on Rule 404(b) considerations, it is my further view that, even if Rule 404(b) did not require exclusion of the evidence relative to defendant’s purported actions vis-à-vis Beth, that evidence should definitely have been excluded pursuant to Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.

Pacheco, 161 A.3d 1166, 1177 (R.I. 2017). Less than a year ago in that case, we “deem[ed] it unnecessary to decide whether collateral estoppel is applicable to issues determined in the [Rhode Island] Traffic Tribunal when all of the elements of the doctrine are met.” Id. With that issue once again before us, we conclude that the time has come to decide it.', 'Benjamin D. Minior (Minior or defendant) was cited with the civil violation of reasonable and prudent speeds1 in the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal (Traffic Tribunal) and charged criminally in Superior Court with the driving-related counts of driving under the influence, serious bodily injury resulting2 and reckless driving.3', 'Before a Superior Court magistrate, defendant sought to dismiss his criminal charges, arguing that the Traffic Tribunal magistrate determined that he was not operating the vehicle and thus the issue could not be relitigated based on collateral estoppel.

A Superior Court justice reversed the dismissal. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to dismiss based on collateral estoppel. The state counters that the present appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss is not properly before us.', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts in this case are straightforward and largely undisputed. On February 17, 2014 at 1:24 a.m., the Town of Bristol (the town) police were dispatched to a motor vehicle accident near 85 Broad Common Road. The vehicle—a 2004 Volvo—had veered off the road and severed a telephone pole, then continued until it hit a tree approximately fifteen feet away. A front-seat passenger suffered injuries to his head and legs, while the suspected operator— identified by the passenger as Minior—had a head laceration. Minior was arrested and taken to Rhode Island Hospital on suspicion of driving under the influence, where a blood test revealed a blood-alcohol content of 0.153 mg/dl.', 'That night, Bristol police cited him with the civil violation of reasonable and prudent speeds. He was also issued a summons to appear at an arraignment for a driving under the influence, serious bodily injury resulting charge, to which he entered no plea and was released on bail.', 'The defendant appeared before the Traffic Tribunal to answer his civil violation on April 28, 2014. There, Bristol Officer Kevin Kitchen, who was dispatched to the accident, testified as to his observations at the scene. After Officer Kitchen concluded his testimony, Bristol Officer Timothy Gallison, who was also dispatched to the scene, testified as well. Officer Gallison recalled that upon approaching the vehicle, he witnessed a male sitting in the driver’s seat.', '-2-', 'After both officers testified, defendant’s attorney moved to dismiss the violation. The defendant asserted that, based on a lack of evidence as to both the posted speed limit and defendant’s operation of the vehicle, the town failed to satisfy the requisite clear and convincing standard. Significant to Minior’s argument before us is the magistrate’s admonition to one of the officers that “there was no testimony as to observation of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident, as to who was driving it. You’re indicating and coming to the presumption as to who was operating the vehicle.” In conclusion, the magistrate said “there was no observation of who was operating the vehicle * * *, so the [c]ourt finds that the [t]own has not sustained the violation for reasonable and prudent speed[s].”', 'On December 5, 2014, the state filed a criminal information charging defendant with two driving-related counts: (1) driving under the influence, serious bodily injury resulting; and (2) reckless driving. On August 4, 2015, Minior moved pursuant to Rule 9.1 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure to dismiss the criminal charges, arguing that the Traffic Tribunal’s dismissal collaterally estopped the criminal charges from proceeding. The motion to dismiss was heard by a Superior Court magistrate on September 14, 2015. The Superior Court magistrate granted the motion based primarily on a decision he had rendered in a previous case.', 'Soon after, the state appealed the Superior Court magistrate’s decision per G.L. 1956 § 8- 2-11.1(d) and a Superior Court justice heard the matter on December 15, 2015. The justice reversed the Superior Court magistrate’s decision, emphasizing the distinction between “what the Traffic Tribunal [magistrate] did and [what he] did not do when he rendered his decision.” Continuing, she noted that “a careful review of the transcript” revealed that the Traffic Tribunal magistrate did not make a specific finding about whether defendant was operating the vehicle at the time of the accident. Instead, the Traffic Tribunal magistrate “merely found that the [t]own', '-3- had not sustained the violation,” and did not decide whether defendant was operating the vehicle. “[The Traffic Tribunal magistrate] merely commented on the absence of evidence and found only that the [t]own had not sustained its burden.” The justice ultimately determined that collateral estoppel did not apply, reversed the Superior Court magistrate’s decision, and reinstated the charges. The defendant appealed the following day, bringing the case before us.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The determination of whether collateral estoppel should be applied presents a question of law[.]” Kenlin Properties, LLC v. City of East Providence, 139 A.3d 491, 497 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Casco Indemnity Co. v. O’Connor, 755 A.2d 779, 782 (R.I. 2000)). Accordingly, “[w]e conduct a de novo review when confronted with a motion to dismiss on collateral[-]estoppel grounds.” Pacheco, 161 A.3d at 1174.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A. Interlocutory Appeal', 'We begin by addressing the state’s argument that this appeal is not properly before us because it is interlocutory and thus unreviewable. “It is well settled in this jurisdiction that appeals from interlocutory orders are not permitted unless they fall within certain well-defined exceptions.” Boranian v. Richer, 983 A.2d 834, 837 (R.I. 2009). “Ordinarily a denial of a motion to dismiss a criminal action is not a final judgment from which an appeal may be taken. However, when the motion to dismiss is based upon double-jeopardy and collateral-estoppel grounds, we allow an immediate appeal.” State v. Wiggs, 635 A.2d 272, 275 (R.I. 1993), abrogated on other grounds by State v. Gautier, 871 A.2d 347 (R.I. 2005); see also State v.', '-4- Godette, 751 A.2d 742, 745 (R.I. 2000). Because the sole issue is whether collateral estoppel bars the state from prosecuting defendant based on a finding that he was not operating the vehicle, we hold that the appeal is properly before us based on the aforementioned exception.4 See Wiggs, 635 A.2d at 275.', 'B. Collateral Estoppel', 'We now turn to defendant’s claim that the state is estopped from prosecuting him based on the Traffic Tribunal’s resolution of his civil violation. At the outset, we pause to recall that in Pacheco, 161 A.3d at 1176, we distinguished a Traffic Tribunal proceeding from a criminal trial. There, a defendant sought to dismiss a criminal charge of chemical refusal second offense based on collateral estoppel after the Traffic Tribunal had dismissed his civil violation for refusing to submit to a preliminary breath test. Id. at 1169-70. We held that there was not an identity of issues as required for collateral estoppel, and the Traffic Tribunal’s dismissal therefore did not prevent the state from prosecuting the criminal charge. Id. at 1175. In dicta, we also addressed the state’s argument that collateral estoppel should not apply to Traffic Tribunal decisions; specifically, we remarked that the standard of prosecution, the discovery mechanisms, and right- to-counsel guarantees differ in the Traffic Tribunal as compared to criminal trials. Id. at 1176, 1177. Nevertheless, we ultimately reserved decision on whether collateral estoppel should apply to such proceedings. Id. at 1177.', 'The Pacheco majority was met by a dissent, which declared that “[a]lthough what transpires in the Traffic Tribunal is in some respects less formal than what usually occurs in the 4', 'The defendant argues that the state’s appeal of the Superior Court magistrate’s order was improper because it should have been appealed not to the Superior Court, but instead directly to this Court pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 8-2-39(f). Because defendant failed to raise this argument below, we do not address its merits and instead consider it waived. See State v. Barros, 148 A.3d 168, 172 (R.I. 2016).', '-5- Superior Court, it is, nonetheless, a legislatively created court of competent jurisdiction. * * * The hearings are recorded and presided over by a full-time magistrate, and the decisions are binding upon the parties.” Pacheco, 161 A.3d at 1182 (Flaherty, J., dissenting). With that context in mind, we begin our analysis.', '“The doctrine of collateral estoppel provides that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.” Pacheco, 161 A.3d at 1172 (quoting Gautier, 871 A.2d at 358). Collateral estoppel applies where there exists “(1) an identity of issues, (2) the previous proceeding must have resulted in a final judgment on the merits, and (3) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted must be the same or in privity with a party in the previous proceeding.” Id. (quoting Gautier, 871 A.2d at 358). Since we deem the time ripe for a determination of the issue left hanging in Pacheco, we will assume without deciding that the necessary elements for collateral estoppel exist.5', '1. Inequitable Results', 'With these collateral estoppel factors assumed, we address an overarching principle that loosens our fixed analysis in the interest of equity. We remember that “we will not apply the doctrine mechanically in situations in which it would lead to inequitable results.” Pacheco, 161 A.3d at 1172 (quoting Gautier, 871 A.2d at 358). “The United States Supreme Court has noted that ‘collateral estoppel in criminal cases is not to be applied with the hypertechnical and archaic approach of a 19th century pleading book, but with realism and rationality.’ * * * ‘The inquiry 5', 'The Superior Court justice, emphasizing that the Traffic Tribunal magistrate only determined the issue based on the lack of evidence, found that the Traffic Tribunal magistrate did not make a final judgment on the merits. We decide our opinion on a different basis. See Sobanski v.

Hie, 688 A.2d 283, 284-85 (R.I. 1996) (quoting Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 444 (1970)). “To avoid unfairness, courts have declined to apply collateral estoppel” where its application would be inequitable. Casco Indemnity Co., 755 A.2d at 782; see also Foster-Glocester Regional School Committee v. Board of Review, 854 A.2d 1008, 1017 (R.I. 2004).', 'We have had occasion to apply this principle before. In Gautier, we held that collateral estoppel did not apply to a probation-violation hearing because “further application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel to bar relitigation of a criminal charge, following a determination during a [civil] probation-revocation hearing that is adverse to the state, inequitably overlooks and misconceives the inherent and important differences between those proceedings and criminal trials.” Gautier, 871 A.2d at 358. One of the referenced differences in that case was the applicable due-process standard, which we articulated as “considerably less * * * than that to which they are constitutionally entitled in a full-blown criminal trial” “[d]ue to the less formal nature of such proceedings.” Id. at 359. We also noted the differing evidentiary rules, where the rules are applied “less stringently” in a probation-revocation hearing. Id. Moreover, “[b]ecause the state need not prove a probation violation beyond a reasonable doubt, but only by reasonably satisfactory evidence, * * * probation-violation hearings are frequently held without the benefit of preparation that precedes a criminal trial, * * * and thus are properly conducted in a more informal manner than a trial * * *.” Id. Ultimately, we determined that “it is neither the purpose nor the intended function of probation-revocation hearings to ‘serve as a final arbiter of an individual’s guilt or innocence of criminal charges’” and it would therefore be inequitable to estop the state from pursuing a criminal charge based on an unfavorable probation-revocation', '-7- decision. Id. at 360 (quoting Commonwealth v. Cosgrove, 629 A.2d 1007, 1011 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1993)).', 'We perceive several similarities between Gautier and this case. As we prophetically delineated in Pacheco, 161 A.3d at 1176, there are numerous differences between a Traffic Tribunal proceeding and a criminal trial.', 'For instance, those appearing before the Traffic Tribunal are not guaranteed the right to counsel. Id. Neither are they afforded the same latitude in conducting discovery. Id. Though the distinctions are plentiful, perhaps the most persuasive is the overall formality of a Traffic Tribunal proceeding versus a criminal trial. Like probation- violation hearings, which are “more informal * * * than a trial” because of the lower standard required to prove a violation, Traffic Tribunal proceedings are similarly informal where the burden of proof on the prosecution is one of “clear and convincing evidence.” Gautier, 871 A.2d at 359; Rule 17(a) of the Traffic Tribunal Rules of Procedure. The defendant argues that our holding in Gautier rested on reasoning that a probation-revocation hearing is less formal than a trial on the merits, whereas a Traffic Tribunal proceeding is formal. We respond that in Gautier, 871 A.2d at 359, we focused not on a superficial distinction between trials and probation- revocation hearings, but instead remained “[m]indful of the critical differences in both the purposes of and procedures employed during probation-revocation hearings and criminal trials.” With an eye to such “critical differences” between criminal trials and Traffic Tribunal proceedings, our reasoning today is in accordance with Gautier. Id.', 'Moreover, the following resonates:', '“‘[T]he government is not statutorily or constitutionally obligated', 'to put forth all its evidence at a probation[-]revocation hearing', '* * *.’ However, application of collateral estoppel to probation-', 'revocation hearings inevitably thwarts this principle of criminal', 'jurisprudence by forcing the state to expedite discovery and', 'present any and all of its evidence and witnesses well in advance of', '-8-', 'trial. This is especially problematic when, as in some complicated', 'cases, the charges raised at a revocation hearing are only a small', 'part of a larger, ongoing criminal investigation.” Gautier, 871', 'A.2d at 360 (quoting United States v. Miller, 797 F.2d 336, 342', '(6th Cir. 1986)) (emphasis added). We believe that the same can be said of the Traffic Tribunal. The present case is an example of a traffic violation that is “only a small part of a larger, ongoing criminal investigation.” Id. To require the state to “complete its entire investigation” before resolving the violation “can effectively hinder its ability to carefully strategize the prosecution of criminal suspects and, consequently, provide for public safety.” Id. Estopping the state from pursuing criminal charges against defendant, or anyone accused similarly, based on the resolve of a non-criminal traffic citation would compromise public safety and undeniably be an inequity to the community. See id.', 'In Pacheco, 161 A.3d at 1176-77, we also acknowledged that various jurisdictions have decided the issue as we do today. For example, in State v. Walker, 768 P.2d 668 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1989), the Court of Appeals in Arizona recognized that “[c]ollateral estoppel effect is generally denied to traffic convictions and minor offenses under accepted common law principles * * *[,] [therefore,] because of the relative insignificance of the charges, [the] defendants have no constitutional right to a jury trial in traffic cases, as they would in a true criminal prosecution, and cannot reasonably be expected to defend with the same vigor.” Id. at 671; cf. Briggeman v. Albert, 586 A.2d 15, 18 (Md. 1991) (considering whether to admit a traffic violation in a subsequent criminal proceeding, noting that “it is common experience that people plead guilty to traffic charges for reasons of expediency even though they may believe themselves innocent”).', 'In the Traffic Tribunal, there is a lesser level of formality with which cases are both tried and defended, which is one reason of many convincing us that applying collateral estoppel to the', '-9- present situation would be inequitable. See Walker, 768 P.2d at 672-73 (holding that collateral estoppel is not available to a criminal defendant for a judgment of acquittal following a civil traffic hearing). We are careful to stress, however, that we are not “attempt[ing] to discredit the validity of the Traffic Tribunal judgment,” Pacheco, 161 A.3d at 1182 (Flaherty, J., dissenting), and rather only say that in matters that are “only a small part of a larger, ongoing criminal investigation,” the Traffic Tribunal’s process is insufficient to estop a later criminal proceeding.

Pacheco, 161 A.3d 1166 (R.I. 2017), I am of the opinion that privity—the third element of collateral estoppel—has been established in this case. In my view, there was a sufficient mutuality of interest between the town of Bristol and the state when the town prosecuted defendant for exceeding reasonable and prudent speeds, a violation of a state statute, G.L. 1956 § 31-14-1. See Duffy v. Milder, 896 A.2d 27, 36 (R.I. 2006) (“Parties are', '- 10 - collateral estoppel to the facts of this case would be inequitable. In my opinion, the balance of equities tilts decidedly in the defendant’s favor. Where, as here, collateral estoppel is tinged by double jeopardy, equity demands its application.2', 'In this case, after hearing testimony from two Bristol police officers, a magistrate of the Traffic Tribunal dismissed the charge of exceeding reasonable and prudent speeds that had been brought against defendant. In doing so, the magistrate found as a fact that there was insufficient evidence to prove that defendant had been driving. In my view, it is significant that the state had prior notice of the hearing that was to take place on that charge. 3 It is also significant to me that there was no appeal of the magistrate’s finding that there was insufficient evidence that defendant had been operating a motor vehicle—an essential element of both speeding and driving under the influence, serious bodily injury resulting. I can reach no other conclusion than in privity when ‘there is a commonality of interest between the two entities’ and when they ‘sufficiently represent’ each other’s interests.” (quoting Commercial Union Insurance Co. v. Pelchat, 727 A.2d 676, 680 (R.I. 1999)); see also Black’s Law Dictionary 1394 (10th ed. 2014) (defining privity as “[t]he connection or relationship between two parties, each having a legally recognized interest in the same subject matter (such as a transaction, proceeding, or piece of property); mutuality of interest”). 2', '“It is * * * apparent that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is a subdoctrine of double jeopardy but would apply in both civil and criminal cases. When a court of competent jurisdiction has decided an issue of ultimate fact, that fact may not be relitigated between the same parties.” State v. Pineda, 712 A.2d 858, 864 (R.I. 1998) (Weisberger, C.J., dissenting). 3', 'The record reveals that the state had notice that defendant had been charged with exceeding reasonable and prudent speeds. In an exchange at a pretrial hearing with a police detective from Bristol—one of the police officers who later prosecuted defendant for the traffic offense—the hearing magistrate—the Traffic Tribunal’s chief magistrate—said: “Detective, this matter involves a reasonable and prudent speed, and there was an accident, and I am under the understanding that there may be a felony attached to it and so the [Attorney General] might be involved.” The detective responded: “That’s correct.” Indeed, in addition to that colloquy, the chief magistrate, after hearing of the severity of the accident and confirming that the state planned to charge defendant with a felony, directed that a telephone call be placed to a representative of the Attorney General’s office. The fact that the state had notice of the traffic offense and intended to charge defendant with the more serious offense of driving under the influence, serious bodily injury resulting, further cements my view that collateral estoppel should be applied as a bar against further litigation of the same facts.', '- 11 - that, at that point, a judgment had been rendered that defendant was not driving on the night of February 14, 2014, and that the preclusive effect of collateral estoppel had attached.', 'According to the majority, even assuming that collateral estoppel applies, the application of the doctrine in this scenario would create an inequitable result. Respectfully, I cannot agree. There may be cases where the application of collateral estoppel to a judgment of the Traffic Tribunal may create an inequitable result, but this is not that case. Indeed, it seems to me to be far more inequitable to require a defendant to defend twice for essentially the same conduct than to apply collateral estoppel to a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. For those reasons, it is my opinion that the state’s opportunity to contest whether defendant was operating the motor vehicle had closed.

73,"Stacia Aptt : v. : Cedarz Medical and Cosmedics, Inc. et al. :",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court.', 'The defendants, Michael Y. Baaklini, M.D. (Dr. Baaklini or defendant) and Cedarz Medical and Cosmedics, Inc. (Cedarz), appeal a Superior Court trial justice’s grant of a motion for new trial in favor of the plaintiff, Stacia Aptt (Aptt), following a Providence County jury verdict in favor of the defendants. This matter came before the Supreme Court on December 7, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, the Superior Court’s judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to reinstate the jury’s verdict.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiff’s alleged injury arose during her visit to Dr. Baaklini on May 29, 2012. Aptt had been his patient since 2010, generally seeing him in his North Providence satellite office, although she had visited him a few times at his main office in Bristol as well. Each', '-1- month, she scheduled an appointment with him to reassess her neck and back pain, for which he prescribed pain medication. Prior to May 29, she had no complaints about him.', 'On that day, Aptt visited Dr. Baaklini at his North Providence office for her monthly appointment.', 'Aptt had called to schedule an appointment for later in the week, but the receptionist informed her that Dr. Baaklini could see her that day. Aptt arrived at the scheduled time, and Dr. Baaklini led her to his office. There, she alleged that Dr. Baaklini told her, relying on the results of a blood test in her file, “I don’t know what to tell you[,] but your kidneys are gone, not one but two.” At trial, Aptt testified that she had never had any problems with her kidneys, so she asked him repeatedly—“about ten times”—whether he was sure.', 'She recalled that he was “kind of like getting upset with me because I kept on [asking if he was sure]. He said, blood work don’t lie, blood work don’t lie, that’s what your blood results say * * *.” He handed her tissues, because she had started crying, telling her that while she could live without one, she could not live without two kidneys. She testified that “right away * * * [she began] thinking [she was] going to die.” She questioned how her kidneys could be damaged, and he attributed it to her having taken medication for an extended period of time. She responded that she thought the medication was safe, in response to which Dr. Baaklini looked at her, shrugged his shoulders, and got up with his folder. Aptt’s daughter, who had accompanied Aptt to the appointment, testified that her mother was crying when she left Dr. Baaklini’s office.', 'Doctor Baaklini instructed Aptt to make an ultrasound appointment in a different office in the building, which he testified was not part of Cedarz, and also requested additional blood work. Still crying, Aptt made the appointment for the following morning, and the receptionist provided her with accompanying paperwork. Without reviewing them, Aptt stored the papers in the visor of her car.', '-2-', 'Aptt testified that she cried on the way home, having a self-described “nervous breakdown.” Aptt’s daughter similarly recalled that her mother would not speak in the car. Aptt remembered that her stomach was “in knots” and she “couldn’t talk,” nor could she eat or sleep that night; in sum, her night “was misery.”1 The next morning, Aptt felt “a tiny bit better.” She looked at the paperwork to check the time of her appointment, and she realized that it bore someone else’s name. She questioned, then, whether the office gave her the wrong paperwork.', 'Aptt called Cedarz’s Bristol office. After giving her name, Aptt asked the receptionist to review her blood work. The receptionist obliged, concluding that all was normal. Aptt relayed what Dr. Baaklini had told her the previous day regarding her kidneys, including her belief that she was going to die, to which the receptionist laughed. Aptt hung up, and, although she was relieved, she “thought about it for days.” Following her realization that Dr. Baaklini was mistaken, she “couldn’t really talk.” Aptt testified that neither Dr. Baaklini nor anyone else in his office ever contacted her to apologize. She never again returned to his office because she “didn’t trust him.”', 'When he testified, Dr. Baaklini painted a vastly different picture of Aptt’s May 29 appointment. At the outset, he explained that patient files were not kept in the North Providence office, but, instead, were transported from Bristol to North Providence when a patient was to be seen there. He further testified that, when a walk-in patient, such as Aptt, came to the North Providence office, a temporary chart was created for that person. 1', 'On cross-examination, defense counsel brought to light that Aptt had previously had an issue with insomnia, for which she had received medical attention. Moreover, Dr. Baaklini testified that he had prescribed a medication for her that is used primarily for sleeping issues, although he conceded that he was not sure what caused her not to sleep that particular night. He also testified that he had previously thought that Aptt may have suffered from anxiety or depression.', '-3-', 'Doctor Baaklini testified that, on that day, he examined Aptt as a walk-in patient after she told him that she was in pain. Although he admitted to having read to Aptt the blood test of another patient,2 Dr. Baaklini said that he did not tell her that she had a kidney problem. Instead, Dr. Baaklini said that the blood test results revealed only a minor abnormality; the abnormality did not warrant her belief that she had a terminal condition, nor did it concern him. He opined to her that she might have a kidney stone. Doctor Baaklini testified that, during the appointment, Aptt became upset only when she realized that he would not prescribe her pain medication that day.', 'Doctor Baaklini denied the accuracy of Aptt’s testimony that she never had a kidney infection and that she had asked him whether he was sure about the results. He also testified that he spoke with her over the phone on May 30, apologizing and admitting that he had mistakenly read to her someone else’s lab results. He remembered that she was not upset about the results during their phone call, and instead was upset that she was without pain medication. In an office note authored by Dr. Baaklini on May 30, he wrote that he had apologized to Aptt, telling her that the inclusion of the lab results in her file was not intentional, and that she had accepted his apology.', 'Aptt filed an action in Rhode Island District Court alleging, albeit indirectly, that Dr. Baaklini negligently inflicted emotional distress upon her based on his misdiagnosis. A District Court judge granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment, a decision Aptt then appealed to Superior Court. A Superior Court justice denied defendants’ motion for summary judgment, and the case proceeded to trial. At the close of all evidence, defendants moved for a “directed 2', 'Doctor Baaklini recalled that he did not realize that the blood report contained the name of a patient other than Aptt because the report was attached to Aptt’s temporary file in a way that covered the other patient’s name.', '-4- verdict,” now referred to as a motion for judgment as a matter of law, but the Superior Court trial justice denied the motion.', 'After deliberating, the jury returned a verdict for defendants, concluding that, while Dr. Baaklini was negligent, his negligence was not the proximate cause of Aptt’s injury. Because the jury concluded that there was no proximate cause, it did not reach the issue of damages.3', 'Following the jury’s verdict, plaintiff moved for a new trial solely on the issue of damages. The trial justice considered the evidence, commenting that, while Aptt was “hysterical in her testimony,” he found her credible. The trial justice also relayed that he had “some concern” as to Dr. Baaklini’s testimony, finding that it “made no sense * * * that this was just a simple mistake.” He said there was “no way” that there would be a blood test in a temporary file, and questioned Dr. Baaklini’s failure to ask why it was included. Continuing, the trial justice also found Dr. Baaklini incredible as to his testimony that, while he apologized to Aptt the next day, she was not upset. Stating that “[i]t doesn’t make sense[,] [e]specially judging her emotional state as a witness,” the trial justice speculated that the jury may have disliked her due to her hyperemotional antics during trial. Nevertheless, he determined that “that doesn’t go towards her credibility, that goes towards her personality.”', 'The trial justice ultimately concluded that the jury’s verdict was wrong, reasoning that it failed to respond to the merits of the controversy and to administer substantial justice. The trial justice offered defendants either a new trial on damages and on proximate cause, or an additur in the amount of $1,800. The defendants appealed pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-24-7, bringing the case properly before us. 3', 'The jury’s verdict sheet informed the jury that, if it answered in the affirmative on the question of Dr. Baaklini’s negligence, it should move to the second question of whether his negligence was the proximate cause of Aptt’s injury. Because it answered negatively as to proximate cause, it was instructed not to move on to the damages question.', '-5-', 'II', 'Discussion', 'A. Motion for New Trial', '1.

Heong’s Market, Inc., 152 A.3d 1137, 1143 (R.I. 2017). “A trial justice’s role in considering a motion for * * * new trial is that of a superjuror, who must weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” Id. (quoting Gomes v. Rosario, 79 A.3d 1262, 1265 (R.I. 2013)).

Narragansett Bay Commission, 131 A.3d 1102, 1109 (R.I. 2016)).', 'Alternatively, “when [the trial justice’s] judgment tells him that the verdict is wrong, because it fails to respond truly to the real merits of the controversy and to administer substantial justice, and is against the fair preponderance of the evidence, then his duty is to set aside the verdict.” Humes v. Schaller, 39 R.I. 519, 522, 99 A. 55, 57 (1916). Accordingly, “unless the moving party demonstrates that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong,” we will not disturb the ruling. Bates- Bridgmon, 152 A.3d at 1144 (quoting Free & Clear Co., 131 A.3d at 1109).', '2.

Beauregard, 110 R.I. 197, 199, 291 A.2d 413, 414 (1972). However, “it is the prerogative of the fact-finder to ‘pick and choose’ which testimony it deems to be believable, [and] * * * [t]he trial justice is not free to disregard the decision of the jurors simply because he would find different portions of the * * * testimony to be credible.” King v.

Lipet, 103 R.I. 461, 464, 238 A.2d 369, 371 (1968)).', 'In granting plaintiff’s motion for new trial, the trial justice explained that he did so because he found Aptt credible and Dr. Baaklini incredible. He outlined Aptt’s alleged damages, including lost sleep, lost appetite, and a “miserable night,” during which she felt that she “suffered an incredible amount.” He took issue with Dr. Baaklini’s testimony that his reading of these blood results was a “simple mistake.” Moreover, he questioned how Dr. Baaklini could have apologized to Aptt without acknowledging that she was upset. The defendants counter that it was reasonable for the jury to find Aptt incredible, and thus the trial justice should not have disturbed the verdict.4 We agree.', 'Our review of the record reveals that, in issuing his decision, the trial justice spoke solely of his discernment of the witnesses’ credibility.', 'While we have previously upheld a trial justice’s decision granting a motion for new trial where he unequivocally and emphatically “ma[de] it quite clear in his decision that he was firmly convinced the evidence was gravely lacking in any support * * *,” Kasegian v. Mottram, 95 R.I. 183, 185, 185 A.2d 450, 452 (1962), 4', 'While defendants did not argue this point in their papers, the record reveals that the trial justice ruled sua sponte in granting plaintiff a new trial on the issue of proximate cause where plaintiff only so moved on the issue of damages. However, because defendants did not raise this argument, we do not address it. See Bowen Court Associates v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 818 A.2d 721, 728 (R.I. 2003) (“We have repeatedly held, consistent with Article I, Rule 16(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, that a party’s failure to include a particular issue in his, her, or its brief on appeal results in a waiver of that issue.”).', '-7- the trial justice here did not ground his decision in “gravely lacking” evidence. Instead, he only expressed his own disagreement with the jury’s credibility determination. Id.; but see Pawtucket Redevelopment Agency v. Brown, 106 A.3d 893, 901 (R.I. 2014) (upholding the trial justice’s grant of new trial where the trial justice determined “that the jury award on [the] defendant’s counterclaim had ‘no rational basis in the evidence whatsoever’”). As such, we cannot fairly say that reasonable minds could not have differed as to the disposition of this case.5 Kasegian, 95 R.I. at 185, 185 A.2d at 452 (“When the evidence is such ‘that different minds would naturally and fairly come to different conclusions thereon, [the trial justice] has no right to disturb the findings of the jury, although his own judgment might incline him the other way[.]’” (quoting Humes, 39 R.I. at 522, 99 A. at 57)).', 'Moreover, although not decisive, we highlight that, in denying defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all evidence, the trial justice stated the following: “I believe [this] is a classic case of two people who have a different memory of what transpired on a particular day * * * I think [the jury] * * * understand[s] what transpired is really a question of who they believe, not who I believe, it’s who they believe.” There, the trial justice fairly summarized the nub of the evidence presented in this case—diametrically opposed testimony of the parties. Based on our examination of the record, we conclude that reasonable minds could differ as to the credibility of those parties. 5', 'The trial justice ended his motion for new trial determination by stating that Aptt’s inappropriate behavior during trial does not reflect her credibility, and instead was only a reflection of her personality. As an aside, we remind that a jury’s consideration of a witness’s perceived personality traits is proper in weighing that witness’s credibility. See State v. Whitfield, 93 A.3d 1011, 1021, 1021 n. 7 (R.I. 2014) (noting it is common for trial justices to tell the jury that it may consider the appearance, conduct, and demeanor of a testifying witness when assessing his or her credibility).', '-8-', 'A trial justice cannot “merely substitute[] his judgment for that of the jury which was equally reasonable,” and, if he does so, that decision must be set aside. Kasegian, 95 R.I. at 185, 185 A.2d at 452. Thus, we conclude that the trial justice clearly erred by replacing the jury’s determination with his own, despite the fact that either conclusion was reasonable.

74,Joseph Caffey et al. : v. : Christopher Lees. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. Christopher Lees (Lees) appeals from the entry of judgment vacating an arbitration award in his favor, and instead, finding for Joseph Caffey1 (Caffey) and Omni Development Corporation.2 This matter came before the Supreme Court on December 7, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Although Lees is the injured party, Joseph Caffey and Omni Development Corporation filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award in the Superior Court, and are therefore listed first in the case caption. 2', 'Since Caffey was the operator of a vehicle owned by Omni Development Corporation, for the sake of clarity, we will refer to them collectively as Caffey.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 28, 2011, Caffey3 lost consciousness while operating his vehicle due to health complications, causing an automobile accident in Seekonk, Massachusetts.', 'Lees was a passenger in the car that Caffey rear-ended. Lees alleged that he suffered constant back issues that ultimately required surgery as a result of that accident. The parties attempted to resolve the matter through arbitration.', 'On February 4, 2014, the parties executed a binding arbitration agreement that stipulated to a high/low award starting at $9,000 and capped at $160,000 with no interest.4 The parties agreed to waive their rights to a jury trial and “any appeals of the * * * arbitration hearing to the extent permitted by Rhode Island law * * *.”', 'The agreement provided that it would be “governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State [sic] of Massachusetts,” and contemplated that any petitions relating to the arbitration would be filed in accordance with the Rhode Island Arbitration Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 3 of title 10.', 'Each side presented evidence to an arbitrator, who had been agreed upon by the parties, at a two-day arbitration hearing on November 25, 2014 and February 4, 2015. During the arbitration, Caffey contested both liability and damages. Caffey argued that the accident was not the proximate cause of Lees’ back injury for which he required surgery because Lees initially suffered a back injury ten years prior to the accident. Doctor Mark Palumbo had performed back surgery on Lees in both 2001 and 2009. Lees stated that he saw Dr. Palumbo seventeen days before the accident and, at that time, Dr. Palumbo noted that he saw no indication that Lees 3', 'At oral argument it was brought to our attention that Caffey is now deceased. 4', 'Pursuant to the arbitration agreement, the parties did not disclose the high/low agreement to the arbitrator.', '-2- needed further surgery. After returning to work following the accident, Lees claimed that he started to feel pain in his lower back and left leg. Palumbo performed another back surgery on Lees on September 19, 2011, nearly four months after the accident.', 'At the November 25, 2014 hearing, Lees presented an affidavit from Dr. Palumbo pursuant to Rhode Island law that was dated November 7, 2013, which stated that the accident “exacerbated and/or worsened” Lees’ “condition” and the “services rendered” were “proximately caused” by the accident. In response, Caffey sought to depose Dr. Palumbo. Lees then withdrew the affidavit. Subsequently, Lees offered a second affidavit to replace the first one, this time pursuant to Massachusetts law, signed on August 4, 2014, in which Dr. Palumbo also asserted that a causal relationship existed between the accident and the surgery. Caffey’s objection to this affidavit was sustained.5', 'On January 2, 2015, Lees’ attorney sent a third affidavit to the arbitrator, 6 which Dr. Palumbo had signed on December 30, 2014, again concluding that there was a causal relationship between the injury that required surgery and the collision. Caffey’s attorney was not informed of this third affidavit submitted to the arbitrator until the February 4, 2015 arbitration hearing.', 'In response to the third affidavit, Dr. Palumbo was deposed in June 2015. It was at this deposition that Caffey first learned of a January 24, 2012 letter from Dr. Palumbo to Lees’ counsel indicating that he did not connect Lees’ surgery to the accident. Specifically, he wrote 5', 'Caffey contends that Lees chose to withdraw the first affidavit of Dr. Palumbo and file a second affidavit according to Massachusetts law in order to avoid the requirement of Dr. Palumbo submitting to a deposition. See Gerstein v. Scotti, 626 A.2d 236, 238 (R.I. 1993) (“A physician who has given his or her opinion in the form of an affidavit has voluntarily expressed such an opinion and would, therefore, impliedly agree to submit to cross-examination on that opinion as well as on any factual underpinnings of that opinion.”). 6', 'The affidavit did not specify whether it was subject to Massachusetts or Rhode Island law.', '-3- that he was “not able to causally relate [Lees’] * * * recently performed operation to the incident as of 05/28/11.” This statement was not disclosed to Caffey at either of the arbitration hearings.', 'Following the June 2015 deposition, both parties filed closing memoranda with the arbitrator. On December 2, 2015, the arbitrator issued his decision, finding that Lees was not contributorily negligent and awarding Lees damages of $190,860, plus interest and costs.', 'On December 29, 2015, following the arbitration decision, Caffey filed a petition to vacate the arbitration award in Providence County Superior Court, to which Lees objected; Lees also filed a petition to confirm the award. The hearing justice conducted a hearing on April 21, 2016. In support of his petition to vacate the award, Caffey argued that: (1) it was procured by fraud, corruption, or undue means; (2) the arbitrator was partial to Lees; (3) the arbitrator failed to consider evidence offered at the arbitration hearing; (4) the arbitrator applied an incorrect standard for evidence; and (5) the arbitrator “so imperfectly executed his powers that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.” Lees countered that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to hear arguments on the motion because, pursuant to the arbitration agreement, Massachusetts law governed.7', 'On June 3, 2016, the hearing justice issued a written decision vacating the arbitration award. In the decision, the hearing justice determined that the court had jurisdiction, and he ultimately concluded that the arbitration award had been procured by undue means. Specifically, the hearing justice found that the failure of Lees’ counsel to disclose Dr. Palumbo’s prior, contrary finding of no causal relationship was “pertinent and material evidence” that was “concealed until months after the arbitration hearing,” which constituted undue means. 7', 'While Lees contested whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction below, he does not raise that issue on appeal.', '-4-', 'Therefore, the Superior Court entered judgment on June 7, 2016, vacating the award, from which Lees timely appealed. Lees also filed a motion for reconsideration on June 15, 2016. The motion for reconsideration was heard on June 30, 2016, and denied on July 6, 2016. Lees appealed from that order as well, and this Court consolidated both appeals.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that “[p]ublic policy favors the finality of arbitration awards, and such awards enjoy a presumption of validity.” Lemerise v.

(quoting § 10-3-19).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Lees argues that the hearing justice erred in concluding that the arbitration award was procured by undue means. We have not revisited “undue means” with respect to the vacation of an arbitration award since our ruling in Cleland v. Hedly, 5 R.I. 163 (1858), where we suggested that an award attained through “undue means” would be one “arrived at by a departure from natural justice.” Id. at 169, 170 (noting that undue means may exist in a case “where the arbitrator has received evidence from witnesses, of which the party had no notice, and no opportunity to be heard in reply”). More recently, the First Circuit interpreted “undue means” as referring to “underhanded or conniving ways of procuring an award that are similar to corruption or fraud, but do not precisely constitute either.” National Casualty Co. v. First State Insurance Group, 430 F.3d 492, 499 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Doctor’s Associates, Inc. v. Windham, 81 A.3d 230, 237 (Conn.

McCollough, 967 F.2d 1401, 1403 (9th Cir. 1992))).', 'In his decision, the hearing justice expressed concern that Caffey “did not have the opportunity to rebut [the third] affidavit and argue that it was inconsistent with the conclusion Dr. Palumbo first communicated to * * * Lees’ counsel in January 2012, until the June 2015 deposition, during which [Caffey] first became aware of Dr. Palumbo’s earlier conclusion.” The hearing justice reasoned that Caffey did not have the benefit of “challeng[ing] the conclusions of', '-6- Dr. Palumbo when such challenge would have been most effective, which would have been at the hearing.” In conclusion, the hearing justice stated that the “failure to disclose the expert’s prior, contrary findings taints the resultant proceedings and constitute[s] undue means.”', 'Lees argues that the initial opinion letter should not have been considered because that opinion was not based on all of the information in Lees’ medical file. Further, he argues that, when Dr. Palumbo did have all of the information in the file available to him, he “provided an accurate causal relationship opinion based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty.” Caffey, on the other hand, characterizes the actions of Lees’ counsel as attempts to hide information, especially given that he withdrew the first affidavit after Caffey requested to depose Dr. Palumbo and also failed to disclose Dr. Palumbo’s initial conflicting opinion. Caffey maintains that an earlier disclosure of Dr. Palumbo’s initial contrary opinion would have changed the entire arbitration proceeding.', 'While we recognize that Caffey may have proceeded differently in the arbitration hearings had he obtained all the relevant materials in a more timely fashion, he did not submit his closing memorandum to the arbitrator until August 20, 2015, two months after he deposed Dr. Palumbo and learned of his initial conflicting opinion that Lees’ surgery was not causally related to the accident. In fact, after Caffey had the opportunity to question Dr. Palumbo at the June 2015 deposition, Caffey referenced the inconsistencies in Dr. Palumbo’s opinions in his closing memorandum, placing the issue squarely before the arbitrator in advance of the arbitrator’s issuance of the award four months later in December 2015.', 'Moreover, at the deposition, Dr. Palumbo testified that his more recent opinion about Lees’ injury was not based on new evidence, but rather on a medical record that he had not', '-7- reviewed as closely in the first instance. In response to Caffey’s counsel’s question as to what caused Dr. Palumbo to alter his opinion, the doctor stated as follows:', '“I think then the only - - it’s in the record. I suppose I should have', 'known it. I’m not sure I had it at the top of my conscious level at', 'the time without reviewing the records, but it was there for me to', 'know if I chose to review these records in the same detail that I did', 'as of my letter of December 29, 2014, so it would be primarily the', 'fact that he had made an appointment to see me for pre-existing', 'pain prior to the August incident.”', 'Based on this testimony, it appears that Dr. Palumbo’s change of opinion was due to his oversight of what Lees’ medical record reflected rather than alleged underhanded behavior of Lees’ counsel. Therefore, while we admonish Lees’ counsel for his failure to disclose those documents revealing Dr. Palumbo’s initial opinion on the causation element and subsequent failure to provide Caffey with the third affidavit until the February 2015 arbitration hearing, we nevertheless cannot agree with the hearing justice’s conclusion that his actions were so “underhanded” or “conniving” as to amount to “undue means” in accordance with both Rhode Island and Massachusetts law.8 See National Casualty Co., 430 F.3d at 499; cf. McGinity v. Pawtucket Mutual Insurance Co., 899 A.2d 504, 507 (R.I. 2006) (“[A] plaintiff arguing for the vacating of an arbitration award due to evident partiality must demonstrate not only an improper interest, but also a ‘causal nexus between the [party-appointed arbitrator’s conduct] and the arbitration award.’” (quoting V.S. Haseotes & Sons, L.P. v. Haseotes, 819 A.2d 1281, 1285 (R.I. 8', 'Caffey argues that there were additional grounds upon which to find “undue means” beyond those that the hearing justice relied upon in vacating the award. Specifically, Caffey references Lees’ counsel’s ex parte communications with the arbitrator, citing our admonishment in Pierce v. Rhode Island Hospital, 875 A.2d 424, 427 n. 2 (R.I. 2005). However, Lees’ counsel only contacted the arbitrator after the award had already been issued, when the matter was pending before the Superior Court. See id. at 426, 427 n. 2 (ultimately upholding the arbitration award even where the attorneys had ex parte communications with the arbitrator after the original award was issued but before an amended award was drafted). Accordingly, while we unequivocally discourage such communication, we do not conclude that Lees’ counsel’s ex parte discussion with the arbitrator had any bearing on the award.', '-8- 2003))); see also Prudential Property & Casualty Insurance Co., 687 A.2d at 441 (“Only in cases in which an award is so tainted by impropriety or irrationality that the integrity of the process is compromised should courts intervene.”). As such, we decline to hold that the award was procured by “undue means.” Based on our determination, we need not address Lees’ remaining arguments.9', 'Furthermore, we decline to entertain Lees’ contention that the arbitrator’s award of $190,860, plus interest and costs, should be affirmed because Caffey failed to accept the arbitration agreement by filing the petition to vacate in the Superior Court. Both parties agreed to the high/low arbitration agreement, and permitting Lees to recover any amount higher than that which was agreed upon would penalize Caffey for exercising his statutory right to challenge an arbitration award.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. We remand the record to that tribunal for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 9', 'Lees also presents a choice-of-law argument, suggesting that Massachusetts law applies pursuant to the arbitration agreement. However, this argument holds little weight because, in vacating the award, the hearing justice referenced both Rhode Island and Massachusetts law, suggesting that the outcome would have been the same under either jurisdiction’s laws. See Avco Corp. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 679 A.2d 323, 330 (R.I. 1996) (finding the choice- of-law argument “feckless” where the hearing justice determined that his finding would have been the same under New York, Connecticut, or Rhode Island law). We conclude that our review on appeal also remains the same whether we apply Massachusetts or Rhode Island law. See, e.g., Superadio Limited Partnership v.

75,v. : Walter Simpson. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Walter Simpson (Simpson or defendant), appeals from a Superior Court judgment adjudging him to have violated the terms and conditions of his probation and executing eighteen years of a twenty-year suspended sentence. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the decision of the hearing justice.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In 1985, Simpson was convicted of one count of first-degree sexual assault, which this Court affirmed on appeal. See State v. Simpson, 520 A.2d 1281, 1282 (R.I. 1987). Simpson was sentenced to fifty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions with thirty years to serve and twenty years suspended with probation. On December 17, 2015, the state filed a notice of probation violation pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. A', '-1- three-day violation hearing was held in February 2016. Below, we summarize the evidence adduced at the hearing.', 'The complaining witness, whom we shall refer to as Valerie,1 testified that, on December 14, 2015, she traveled to Woonsocket for a medical appointment. After the appointment, she crossed the street to a bus stop to take a bus home. There, she met a man named “Reggie,”2 who, as Valerie testified, asked her if she “wanted to get high with him.” She answered in the affirmative, and the two proceeded to a nearby park. After about fifteen minutes in the park, they headed to Diamond Hill Road, where Simpson lived, because Simpson “didn’t want to get high in the park.” About ten to fifteen minutes after leaving the park, they arrived at Simpson’s house, where they went into an unfinished basement with a dirt floor and a couple of mattresses in the corner.', 'Valerie testified that Simpson “laid one of the mattresses down on the ground” and then, when she “tried to turn and walk away, * * * he grabbed [her] and threw [her] * * * face down[] on the mattress.” Simpson then put Valerie’s hands behind her back; and, when she tried to leave, he told her “that he was a member of the police force.” He then “pulled [her] pants down and put his penis into [her] vagina.” Valerie testified that she “struggled” but could not get away. She said that Simpson then “put his penis into [her] mouth” but that she “kind of like threw up on him a little bit” so he “inserted his penis” into her vagina again. Valerie further testified that, “when [they] went to switch positions, * * * [she] pretended [she] was going to * * * put his penis in [her] mouth, but * * * instead [she] leaned over him and grabbed [her] bag * * * and started to run * * *.” When Simpson caught her, she screamed for help. Then “he 1', 'We use a pseudonym to refer to the complaining witness. 2', 'She identified “Reggie” as Simpson at the violation hearing.', '-2- pushed [her] and he said, ‘Fine, go,’ and [she] started to run * * * out of the basement.” She then “called the police because [Simpson] was following [her] down the street.”', 'Valerie testified that she told the 911 operator that she “had been raped and that somebody was chasing [her] down the street.” When the police arrived, they drove her around to visually identify Simpson’s house. The police officers then searched the location she identified and drove her to Landmark Hospital.', 'The state then introduced as an exhibit a photo array that the Woonsocket Police Department showed to Valerie on December 14, 2015.', 'Valerie identified Simpson as her attacker and marked the photo with a statement that she was 75 percent sure that the photo she identified was accurate.', 'The state also introduced a recording of Valerie’s 911 call. Additionally, the state introduced into evidence photographs taken by the police of Simpson’s basement, which depicted a basement with two mattresses within it.', 'Patrolman Justin Mowry of the Woonsocket Police Department testified that he responded to a phone call the police department had received from an unknown female who was screaming and running down the roadway in the area of Diamond Hill Road and Wood Avenue. Upon his arrival in the area, Valerie waved him down and told him she had been assaulted by a man she referred to only as “Reggie.” Officer Mowry testified that Valerie directed him to the location of the assault, 594 Diamond Hill Road. He also stated that the police were able to determine that a Walter Simpson, who used “Reggie” as an alias, resided on the third floor of that address. Officer Mowry proceeded to investigate the multifamily dwelling. He observed a dirty basement with two mattresses in the corner leaned against a pole. He then went up to the third floor, where Simpson resided, and spoke to Simpson’s girlfriend, who informed him that Simpson was at school.', '-3-', 'Simpson testified on his own behalf. He stated that he lived at 592 Diamond Hill Road in Woonsocket.3 At around 3:50 p.m. on December 14, 2015, he left his apartment and went to the bus stop to catch a bus because he had class at the Community College of Rhode Island. At the bus stop, Valerie “was soliciting gentlemen”; one man went with her to the park across the street, and then he returned to the bus stop. Valerie then gave Simpson a napkin with her phone number written thereon.', 'He later discovered that the phone number was incorrect.', 'The defendant testified that Valerie began asking about drugs. “She * * * was interested in crack,” and Simpson told her that he did not smoke crack.', 'Simpson testified that he and Valerie went across the street to the park and Valerie “attempted to perform oral sex” on him, but it started raining; so she asked if they could go to his house. Simpson “told her no” because “[his] girl [wa]s at [his] house.” Simpson testified that Valerie decided “it would be best” if they went to his house and that she “was under the impression that [he] was a drug dealer.” They then walked to Diamond Hill Road and went to the basement of Simpson’s house. Simpson testified that Valerie “went to perform oral sex” on him and then they began to have sexual intercourse. He further testified that, “[i]n the process of having sexual intercourse, [he] came to realize that” he was cheating on his girlfriend and “pushed her away a little bit” and told her to “just leave.” Valerie “cussed [him] out and stormed up the stairs,” and that was the last Simpson saw of her.', 'At the conclusion of the evidence, the hearing justice found that Simpson had violated his probation and executed eighteen years of Simpson’s twenty-year suspended sentence. The hearing justice explained, 3', 'Officer Mowry testified that 592 and 594 Diamond Hill Road are in the same building with a common entryway.', '-4-', '“the evidence in this probation violation hearing suggests by the', 'overwhelming weight of evidence that on December 14th, 2015 he', 'enticed a young woman to his apartment with promises of smoking', 'crack. Once in the cellar or basement of his apartment, he placed a', 'mattress that had been leaning against the wall onto the floor and', 'proceeded to overpower her and sexually assault her.” The hearing justice accepted Valerie’s version of events, explaining that Valerie “was a good witness on her own behalf” and that “[h]er description of the events surrounding the sexual assault [was] credible.” On the other hand, the hearing justice found Simpson’s testimony not credible.', 'The hearing justice went on to explain: “Although the standard of proof in a probation violation proceeding is reasonably satisfactory evidence, I have decided this case by a higher standard, fair preponderance of the evidence.” She found,', '“the [s]tate proved [that Simpson] violated his probation by a fair', 'preponderance of the evidence.

Valerie’s testimony, which the hearing justice accepted as true, bespoke of behavior by defendant that clearly can be described as a sexual assault whereas defendant’s testimony, even if given credence, amounted to an admission that he solicited a prostitute, conduct that would also support a violation adjudication. By crediting Valerie’s testimony, the hearing justice was necessarily subscribing to the sexual-assault version as the basis for the violation finding.', '-7-', 'To the extent that defendant ascribes error to the hearing justice’s employment of the preponderance of the evidence standard, we need not ponder long. The defendant did not object to this at the hearing and, in fact, conceded at oral argument that he was not challenging the burden of proof standard that the hearing justice applied.', 'Finally, defendant asserts that the hearing justice abused her discretion in sentencing him to serve eighteen years of his previously suspended sentence. He argues that the “invocation of 18 years to serve suggests that the sentence is motivated by a decision to punish Mr. Simpson for a criminal offense for which he is presumed innocent and has yet to be tried.', 'It is well established, however, “that a hearing justice has ‘wide discretion to determine whether to execute any or all of a defendant’s previously suspended sentence.’” State v.

(quoting McKinnon-Conneally, 101 A.3d at 879).', 'In imposing the sentence, the hearing justice considered the severity of defendant’s initial offense, the nature of the conduct underlying the probation violation, and the fact that he had been “on the street for six and a half years.” She found that he lied to the police, lied under oath, and that his conduct was “heinous.” She concluded that he was “not a good candidate for rehabilitation” and that he needed to be incarcerated for the safety of the community.', 'The behavior that provided the basis for the probation violation involved the same type of violent, assaultive conduct for which defendant was originally convicted. Clearly, this pattern of conduct demonstrates an inability of defendant to conform his conduct to the mores of society and suggests that he is not amenable to rehabilitation. We have often stated that rehabilitation is a “factor to be considered in sentencing.” Fairweather, 138 A.3d at 829.', '-8-', 'Therefore, we are of the opinion that, by executing eighteen years of his original suspended sentence, the hearing justice was acting well within the ambit of her discretionary authority.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

These consolidated appeals arise from a decision of the Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of the City of Providence (the board or city board) to reduce the pension benefits of Frank E. Corrente (Corrente) following multiple federal convictions.1 Specifically, pursuant to the Honorable Service Ordinance (HSO), Chapter 17, Article VI, Sec. 17-189.1 of the City of Providence Code of Ordinances (as enacted in 1999),2 the board revoked a portion of Corrente’s pension benefits and ordered him to return a portion of the benefits that he had received.', 'The matters now before this Court are: (1) Corrente’s appeal from a Superior Court judgment denying his request for a tax credit on pension benefits that he had received but was required to return to the board; (2) the appeal of the Mayor of the City of Providence (the mayor) 1', 'On October 31, 2016, this Court consolidated the three appeals: No. 2015-243-A., No. 2015- 244-A., and No. 2015-246-A. 2', '“The HSO was enacted in 1999 and amended in 2011.” Retirement Board of Employees’ Retirement System of Providence v.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'Procedural Background', 'The facts underlying this case are set forth in detail in Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of Providence v. Corrente, 111 A.3d 301, 303-05 (R.I. 2015) (Corrente I), where this Court vacated the Superior Court’s judgment for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and remanded it to the Superior Court for further proceedings. Below, we outline the facts pertinent to the present appeal.', 'Corrente had two terms of city employment. His first term of employment commenced on June 26, 1967, when Corrente began working in the controller’s office, and continued until he retired from his position as the city controller on April 12, 1987. Corrente received pension benefits for his first term of employment until he returned to work for the city on December 31, 1990, for his second term of employment, as the director of administration under then-Mayor Vincent A. Cianci, Jr. Corrente retired from this position on July 4, 1999, and received an increased monthly pension based on a higher gross salary for his second term of employment.', 'On June 24, 2002, Corrente was convicted of six felony counts in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. On October 23, 2002, the board suspended', '-2- Corrente’s pension benefits, pending a hearing, pursuant to the HSO, which provided in pertinent part:', '“Whenever any employee is convicted of or pleads guilty or nolo', 'contendere to any crime related to his or her public employment,', 'the retirement board shall conduct a meeting, with the employee', 'having the opportunity to be heard, to determine if a', 'recommendation of revocation or reduction of any retirement', 'allowance or annuity or other benefit or payment to which the', 'employee is otherwise entitled to under this chapter is warranted.”', 'Chapter 17, Article VI, Sec. 17-189.1(a)(5).', 'On April 23, 2003, the board appointed Larry Ritchie, a professor at Roger Williams University School of Law, as an “independent hearing officer.” On December 27, 2007, after Corrente’s release from prison, a hearing was held; and on March 12, 2008, Prof. Ritchie issued a report and recommendation to the board. He determined that all of the crimes that Corrente committed occurred during his second term of employment with the city as the director of administration; and accordingly, he recommended that the board: (1) revoke the retirement benefits that derived from Corrente’s second term of employment; (2) pay him a reduced pension based on his first term of employment; (3) return the contributions that Corrente paid into the retirement system during his second term of employment; and (4) offset any retirement benefits and interest due that were suspended in October 2002 with the retirement benefits paid to Corrente following his retirement from his second term of employment.', 'On July 30, 2008, the board met, and both Corrente and Prof. Ritchie were present. Professor Ritchie discussed the issue of taxes, stating, “[T]he one thing that * * * didn’t come up at the hearing and I did not include at all in the recommendation had to do with taxation. * * * I would agree * * * that ought to be included in with the calculations.” Following Prof. Ritchie’s comments, a member of the board asked him if the board should add an additional item to his recommendation, about the tax issue, to which Prof. Ritchie responded affirmatively. Another', '-3- member of the board clarified Prof. Ritchie’s recommendation regarding the tax credit. He explained that Corrente would pay back to the city the amount of pension benefits from his second term of employment that he had received and that the board had since revoked, less the taxes that Corrente paid on that amount. On August 13, 2008, the board voted to adopt Prof. Ritchie’s report and recommendation;3 however, it did not adopt the recommendation concerning the tax credit.', 'On October 10, 2008, the board initiated an action in the Superior Court, fashioned as a miscellaneous petition, to confirm its decision pursuant to Sec. 17-189.1(a)(5) of the HSO. Section 17-189.1(a)(5) of the HSO provided that the board “shall initiate a civil action in the [S]uperior [C]ourt for the revocation or reduction of any retirement allowance or annuity or other benefit or payment to which the employee is otherwise entitled to under chapter 17.” Corrente also sought confirmation of the board’s decision and filed a counterclaim for three “additional requests,” including: (1) a lump-sum payment, with interest, for the benefits deriving from his first term of employment that were suspended, from the date of suspension through the date of resumption; (2) a tax credit for any taxes he paid on the revoked amount of pension benefits, deducted from the total amount that he owed to the board; and (3) that Corrente not have to reimburse the city for the amount of pension benefits that were paid to him from the date of his second retirement through the date that his benefits were suspended. 3', 'Seven board members voted in favor of adopting Prof. Ritchie’s recommendations; five members voted against it; and one member was absent.', '-4-', 'B', 'Intervention', 'On January 29, 2009, the mayor and the city moved to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.4 They asserted that intervention was appropriate because the interests of the city and its taxpayers were not adequately represented by the existing parties. The board objected to the motion. On March 13, 2009, the trial justice held a hearing on the motion to intervene. The mayor and the city maintained that the interests of the existing parties—the board and Corrente—were “perfectly aligned.” They argued for intervention to protect the public interest and to assert their position that a de novo review was the appropriate standard of review in civil actions brought by the board in the Superior Court pursuant to the HSO. The board maintained that the interests of the mayor and the city were adequately represented through the two mayoral appointments to the board. The board also disagreed with the assertion that its interests were aligned with Corrente’s and insisted that “there’s adversity between the existing parties.”', 'In deciding the motion, the trial justice noted the four requirements of Rule 24: (1) the applicant must file a timely application to intervene; (2) the applicant must claim an interest relating to the property or transaction that forms the basis of the action; (3) disposition of the action may impair or impede the applicant’s interest; and (4) the current parties to the action do not adequately represent the applicant’s interest. See Hines Road, LLC v. Hall, 113 A.3d 924, 927 (R.I. 2015). The trial justice determined that the mayor and the city had satisfied the first requirement of Rule 24(a). The trial justice found that the intervenors also met the second 4', 'The mayor of the city of Providence at the time was David Cicilline.

Specifically, he found that the intervenors’ position would not otherwise be raised by the existing parties because the positions of the board and Corrente were “essentially the same with respect to a substantial portion of the recommendation.”', 'Lastly, the trial justice found that neither of the existing parties to the action would adequately represent the interest of the mayor and the city. He first determined that Corrente would not adequately represent the interest of the mayor and the city because they held different positions in the case. With respect to the board, the trial justice deemed it “absurd” to find that it would adequately represent the interest of the mayor and the city because “there is a vast gulf between the position of the [r]etirement [b]oard and the position espoused by the [c]ity and the [m]ayor.” Thus, the trial justice granted the motion to intervene.', 'C', 'Prior Appeals', 'On April 13, 2009, the trial justice consolidated five related cases involving the board and different plaintiffs, including the action between the board and Corrente, to address three issues related to the HSO: (1) whether a criminal conviction was necessary for the board to take action to reduce or revoke pension benefits pursuant to the HSO; (2) whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction to review civil actions brought by the board pursuant to the HSO; and (3) what standard of review applied in the Superior Court when reviewing civil actions brought by the board.', '-6-', 'On September 8, 2009, the trial justice issued a decision in the consolidated cases finding that: (1) a conviction was not a prerequisite to the board taking action to revoke or reduce benefits; (2) its jurisdiction over equity actions along with its declaratory-judgment powers gave the Superior Court jurisdiction; and (3) the appropriate standard of review was that used for administrative appeals, as articulated in G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15 of the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). One of the plaintiffs in the consolidated cases appealed to this Court in Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 70 (R.I. 2011). In Ryan, we vacated the Superior Court’s judgment and held that a criminal conviction was necessary before the board could take action to reduce or revoke pension benefits. Id. at 76. We did not reach the issue of the standard of review for civil actions brought by the board pursuant to the HSO. Id.', 'After our ruling in Ryan, the board again moved to confirm its decision to reduce Corrente’s pension benefits. In response, the intervenors objected to the board’s motion and moved for summary judgment. On June 23, 2011, there was a hearing on the motions. At the hearing, the intervenors explained that their motion requested that the Superior Court deny the board’s motion to confirm and either enter an order that revoked Corrente’s pension entirely or remand the matter to the board for further proceedings. On September 28, 2011, the trial justice issued a decision that denied the intervenors’ motion for summary judgment and confirmed the board’s decision to reduce Corrente’s pension.5', 'In his written decision, the trial justice addressed the standard of review to apply to actions brought by the board pursuant to the HSO.', 'He cited to his previous opinion in Retirement Board of the Employees Retirement System of Providence v.

Specifically, the trial justice likened the city board’s two-tiered procedure to the state retirement board’s two- tiered review process under the APA. He therefore adopted the APA standard of review set forth in § 42-35-15(g). Under the APA’s deferential standard of review, the trial justice determined that the board’s decision was supported by substantial evidence, not arbitrary and capricious, not unlawful or unconstitutional, and not in excess of its authority. The trial justice also addressed Corrente’s three additional requests that he set forth in his answer and counterclaim to the board’s motion to confirm. He found that “Professor Ritchie’s Report & Recommendation, and the Retirement Board’s adoption thereof, specifically contemplated and appropriately dealt with the first and last prong of Mr. Corrente’s ‘Additional Relief,’” and he therefore declined to modify the adopted recommendation with respect to the first and last requests. The trial justice, however, remanded the tax-credit issue to the board “for a proper determination.”', 'On October 18, 2011, the trial justice entered a judgment that reflected his written decision; he denied the intervenors’ motion for summary judgment, confirmed the board’s decision, and remanded the tax-credit matter to the board.6', 'On November 4, 2011, the intervenors appealed to this Court.

At the latter meeting, the board voted to deny Corrente’s request for a tax credit.9 On July 31, 2012, Corrente moved in the Superior Court to overrule the board’s decision to deny his request for a tax credit.', 'On January 31, 2013, the same trial justice heard the parties on Corrente’s motion. Corrente asserted that the board’s decision to deny him a tax credit was “unreasonable.” The board maintained that it was not required to grant Corrente a tax credit; rather, it had discretion to decide whether or not to adopt Prof. Ritchie’s recommendation to grant a tax credit. The board also distinguished Prof. Ritchie’s “off-the-cuff” recommendation regarding the tax credit 8', 'General Laws 1956 § 36-10.1-5 provides, “[t]he [S]uperior [C]ourt shall have jurisdiction to review any decisions, appeals, or other proceedings initiated pursuant to any municipal ordinance providing for the revocation or reduction of the pension of any municipal employee for circumstances constituting dishonorable service as defined by municipal ordinances.” 9', 'Five members of the board voted in favor of denying Corrente’s request for a tax credit; two members abstained; and six members were absent.', '-9- from the recommendation of “a hearing officer who deliberates on it and has a well-reasoned decision.” The trial justice reviewed the board’s decision and found that it was not an abuse of discretion.

Rather, it appears that the trial justice was referring to his 2011 decision, wherein he denied two of Corrente’s requests for additional relief set forth in his counterclaim.', '-10- because of “mere philosophical differences.” Accordingly, he asserts that the trial justice should not have confirmed the board’s decision with respect to the tax credit.', 'On appeal, the intervenors argue that the trial justice erred in applying the APA standard of review to the board’s action.

He determined that: (1) the motion to intervene was timely; (2) the transaction that was the subject matter of the action—namely the board’s decision to reduce Corrente’s pension benefits—was “of high significance to the City of Providence”; (3) disposition of the action would impair or impede the interest of the mayor and the city because it would deprive them of the opportunity to assert their position and argue for a de novo review; and (4) the interest of the mayor and the city would not be adequately represented given the significant divide between their position and those of Corrente and the board.', 'This Court notes that, on appeal, the board does not raise any specific arguments regarding the trial justice’s findings with respect to the first, second, and third requirements of Rule 24(a)(2).', 'The board appears to challenge the trial justice’s finding on the fourth requirement that the board would not adequately represent the interest of the mayor and the city. Specifically, it cites to federal jurisprudence to support its assertion that a presumption of adequate representation exists when a governmental entity is a party. See, e.g., Maine v. Director, United States Fish & Wildlife Service, 262 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 2001) (“Generally, our decisions have proceeded on the assumption, subject to evidence to the contrary, that the government will adequately defend its actions, at least where its interests appear to be aligned with those of the proposed intervenor.”).', 'Because “Rhode Island precedent on this point is sparse,” this Court “may properly look to the federal courts for guidance.” Tonetti Enterprises, LLC, 943 A.2d at 1073.

As the trial justice found, “a vast gulf” exists between the position of the board and that of the intervenors.

In light of the deference we accord to the trial justice on review, we are satisfied that he did not err or abuse his discretion in finding that the intervenors satisfied Rule 24(a)(2)’s fourth requirement.', 'The additional argument that the board presses on appeal focuses on the powers of the mayor, as set forth in Article III, § 302 of the City of Providence Home Rule Charter (city', '-14- charter), and those of the board as delineated in Article IX, § 908 of the city charter.12 The board asserts that Article I, § 104 of the city charter requires the mayor to first obtain authorization from the city council if he or she seeks to challenge the board. Article I, § 104 of the city charter provides that “[a]ll powers of the city shall be exercised in the manner prescribed by this Charter or, if not so prescribed, then in such manner as shall be provided by ordinance or resolution of the city council.” Because the charter does not authorize the mayor to bring action against the board, the board maintains that the mayor must do so through resolution of the city council, which he did not do.', 'Although this is a cogent argument, our review of the record reveals that the board did not raise this argument below, and therefore it is waived.', 'Below, in its memorandum in objection to the motion to intervene, the board merely asserted that “[t]he [m]ayor does not cite any provision in the Providence Home Rule Charter that confers upon him standing to institute a civil action to oppose the decision of his own [b]oard * * * .” Again at the hearing on the motion to intervene, the board did not reference Article I, § 104 of the city charter to support its 12', 'Article III, § 302 of the City of Providence Home Rule Charter provides, in part:', '“The powers and duties of the mayor shall include, without', 'limitation, the following:', '“(a) To supervise, direct and control the activities of all', 'departments and agencies of city government to the extent', 'and in the manner provided by this Charter and by the', 'ordinances of the city, and the laws of the state.” Article IX, § 908(b) of the city charter provides, in part:', '“The powers and duties of the retirement board shall be, without', 'limitation, the following:', '“(1) To establish rules and regulations for and be', 'responsible for the administration and operation of the city', 'employee retirement systems under its jurisdiction * * * .”', '-15- argument that the city council needed to pass a resolution in order for the mayor to challenge the board’s decision, although it referenced generally the powers of the mayor and the board.

The trial justice likened the city board’s two-tiered review process to that of the state retirement board, which is an “agency” subject to the APA pursuant to § 42-35-1. The state retirement board has regulations that set forth the procedures to follow when hearing “contested cases.”14 See generally 120 RICR 10-00 Sec. 1.4(A) (Rhode Island Code of Regulations). For the first tier, the regulations provide for a formal hearing presided over by a hearing officer, during which parties can examine witnesses and present evidence. 120 RICR 10-00 Sec. 1.4(F). After the hearing officer reaches a decision, “[e]ach party to the proceeding shall be given the right to make exceptions, to file briefs and to make oral arguments before the Retirement Board.” 120 RICR 10-00 Sec. 1.4(J). The state retirement board, as the second tier, considers the hearing officer’s decision and “such other argument as shall be presented by any party to the proceeding,” and it then votes on the hearing officer’s recommendation. Id. The regulations do not provide for an appeal to the Superior Court; however, an employee could appeal pursuant to the APA. See § 42-35-15(a) (“Any person * * * who has exhausted all administrative remedies available to him or her within the agency, and who is aggrieved by a final order in a contested case is entitled to judicial review under this chapter.”).', 'The trial justice correctly noted significant similarities between the two boards’ processes. Although the city board was not a state agency subject to the APA like the state retirement board, it nevertheless employed a two-tiered review process.15', 'After the board 14', 'A “contested case” is defined as “a matter for which a member requests a hearing because he or she is aggrieved by an administrative action other than a Disability decision.” 120 RICR 10-00 §1.4(B)(1)(a). 15', 'The HSO also did not require the board to employ a two-tiered review process, it merely provided that: (1) the board must conduct a meeting, where the employee has the opportunity to be heard, to determine if revocation or reduction of pension benefits was warranted and (2) if the board determined that revocation or reduction was warranted, it must initiate a civil action in the', '-19- suspended Corrente’s benefits, it appointed Prof. Ritchie as the “independent hearing officer.” Following the hearing, Prof. Ritchie issued a report and recommendation to the board. The board then voted to adopt the recommendation, and it subsequently brought suit in the Superior Court to confirm its decision. In summary, both the state retirement board and the city board: (1) conduct a hearing before a hearing officer who issues a recommendation to the retirement board, and (2) the retirement board then votes on said recommendation.', 'The intervenors, however, maintain that the HSO is more similar to PEPRRA. PEPRRA, like the HSO, provides a mechanism for the state retirement board to revoke or reduce the pension benefits of a public official or state employee who “is convicted of or pleads guilty or nolo contendere to any crime related to his or her public office or public employment * * * .” Section 36-10.1-3(b). PEPRRA also requires the state retirement board to initiate a civil action in the Superior Court, just like the HSO. Section 36-10.1-3(b)(1). PEPRRA, however, provides the Superior Court with multiple factors to consider when deciding whether the employee’s benefits should be revoked or reduced, including the honorable-service presumption and requirement, the severity of the crime, the financial loss caused by the crime, the degree of public trust placed in that employee, and other factors that justice may require. Section 36-10.1- 3(c)(2). Then, the Superior Court decides whether the employee’s benefits should be reduced or revoked. Section 36-10.1-3(c)(1). Because PEPRRA cases are not administrative appeals, the APA standard of review does not apply.', 'Although similarities exist between PEPRRA and the HSO, the two differ in many regards. Notably, PEPRRA does not require the state retirement board to conduct a hearing prior Superior Court for the revocation or reduction of said benefits. Providence, Code, Ch. 17, Art. VI, Sec. 17-189.1(a)(5). Thus, the city board could have satisfied the HSO’s requirements by conducting an informal meeting, with only the board and Corrente present, during which Corrente had an opportunity to be heard.', '-20- to initiating an action in the Superior Court. This is a key distinction because, under PEPRRA, absent a de novo review in the Superior Court, the employee would not have an opportunity to be heard. In contrast, under the HSO, the employee has an opportunity to be heard prior to the board’s determination of revocation or reduction. Consequently, although both PEPRRA and the HSO require their respective retirement boards to “initiate a civil action in the [S]uperior [C]ourt,” this is the first and only opportunity for the employee to be heard under PEPRRA, whereas under the HSO the employee has already been heard before the board prior to the Superior Court action. Compare § 36-10.1-3 (instructing the state retirement board to commence an action in the Superior Court where the employee will “appear and show cause”) with Sec. 17- 189.1(a)(5) (instructing the city retirement board to first hold a meeting where the employee will have an opportunity to be heard and to then initiate an action in the Superior Court). Therefore, despite the fact that the language of the HSO closely mirrors that of PEPRRA, the actual processes employed by the city retirement board differ from those under PEPRRA.', 'Consequently, it is our opinion that the HSO is more closely comparable to the two-tiered review process utilized by the state retirement board than to proceedings conducted pursuant to PEPRRA. The trial justice correctly construed the language in the HSO mandating that the board “initiate a civil action in the [S]uperior [C]ourt” as akin to an administrative appeal and appropriately applied the standard of review set forth in the APA.', 'C', 'Merits', 'Having concluded that the trial justice correctly employed the APA standard of review to the board’s decision, this Court will review his decision using the standard of review for decisions rendered pursuant to the APA. “When this Court reviews the judgment of the Superior', '-21- Court in administrative proceedings, our review is limited to questions of law.” Iselin v.

As noted in the report, Corrente had two terms of city employment, and his convictions arose out of acts committed during his second term of employment as the director of administration. Professor Ritchie considered the nearly four-year break between Corrente’s first term of employment and his second term as the director of administration and determined that “[t]he break between the two terms of [c]ity employment, the drawing of retirement benefits before taking on the second term, and the confinement of any', '-23- alleged dishonorable service to the second term of employment with the [c]ity suggest a division that should be recognized under the [HSO].”', 'Professor Ritchie further found that, while “[s]ome might argue that [Corrente] deserves more punishment,” the HSO is not penal; rather, “[i]t is the breach of employment contract that is the province of the HSO.”', 'Accordingly, Prof. Ritchie framed the issue “as whether [Corrente’s] dishonorable acts during his second term of employment as [d]irector of [a]dministration breached his earlier and severable contract of employment in the Controller’s Office.” He concluded that the answer was “logically” no. Professor Ritchie recommended that the board revoke all benefits attributable to Corrente’s second term of employment and reinstate the benefits relating to his first term. Our review of the report and recommendation adopted by the board reveals that the board’s decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or affected by other errors or law. The HSO provides for either reduction or revocation of pension benefits, and the report clearly explains the rationale behind the decision to reduce, rather than revoke, Corrente’s pension.', 'The intervenors point to the board’s previous decisions to revoke the pension benefits of four other former employees who violated the HSO. They argue that, under the APA standard of review, once a rule or precedent is established by an entity, such as the board, the entity cannot deviate from that rule or precedent without offering an adequate explanation. The intervenors rely on Town of Burrillville v. Pascoag Apartment Associates, LLC, 950 A.2d 435 (R.I. 2008), where this Court held that under general administrative law principles for adjudicative rulemaking, “a presumption exists that an agency will adhere to its settled rule, and the agency must explain a departure from its prior norms.” Id. at 451. “The grounds for departure from the settled rule ‘must be clearly set forth so that the reviewing court may understand the basis of the', '-24- agency’s action and so may judge the consistency of that action with the agency’s mandate.’” Id.

In Town of Burrillville, we concluded that the State Housing Appeals Board’s failure to adhere to its own definition of a term at issue was arbitrary and capricious because it provided no reason or explanation for its departure from its previously-adopted definition. Id.', 'The present matter differs from the circumstances present in Town of Burrillville because, unlike the State Housing Appeals Board, here, the board provided an adequate explanation for its departure from the “settled rule.” Corrente was the only city employee before the board who had two distinct terms of employment with the city.', 'Professor Ritchie, in his report and recommendation adopted by the board, considered Corrente’s two terms of employment pertinent, especially because “there [was] no allegation of any dishonorable service during Mr. Corrente’s first term of employment with the [c]ity.” He found that “[t]he break between the two terms of [c]ity employment, the drawing of retirement benefits before taking on the second term, and the confinement of any alleged dishonorable service to the second term of employment with the [c]ity suggest a division that should be recognized under the ordinance.” See Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co., 412 U.S. at 808 (holding that an agency may depart from prior norms because “although the rule in general serves useful purposes, peculiarities of the case before it suggest that the rule not be applied in that case”).', 'In our opinion, the board’s decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or affected by other errors or law. The HSO contemplates reduction or revocation of pension benefits, and the report clearly explains the rationale behind the decision to reduce, rather than revoke, Corrente’s pension benefits.

Specifically, Corrente maintains that the trial justice failed to apply the standard set forth in Environmental Scientific Corp. v. Durfee, 621 A.2d 200 (R.I. 1993), to the effect that the board, as the second tier of the administrative process, needed adequate rationale to reject Prof. Ritchie’s recommendation that the board provide Corrente with a tax credit. Corrente asserts that this is an error of law which this Court must review de novo.', 'In reviewing the board’s decision to deny Corrente a tax credit, this Court employs the same standard that we applied above when we reviewed the board’s decision to reduce Corrente’s pension benefits. We will not weigh the evidence; rather, our review is limited to “the record as a whole to determine whether any legally competent evidence exists therein to support the trial court’s decision or whether the trial court committed error of law in reaching its decision.” Beagan, 162 A.3d at 626 (quoting Rhode Island Temps, Inc., 749 A.2d at 1124).', 'We are of the opinion that the board’s decision to deny Corrente’s request for a tax credit is supported by legally competent evidence. The board discussed the tax credit issue at two different meetings and heard from counsel for the board and for Corrente before it ultimately voted to deny Corrente’s request. Members of the board raised various concerns about the tax credit. In particular, some members were troubled by the lack of a quantifiable number for the amount of taxes that Corrente allegedly paid on the pension amount and the lack of any documentation to substantiate his assertion that he paid taxes on the pension benefits. Members of the board also expressed concern with taking money from the city’s retirement fund to give', '-26- Corrente a tax credit. Additionally, there was uncertainty regarding whether the board was authorized to grant a tax credit.', 'Corrente failed to assuage the board’s concerns; he did not provide any documentation to show that he did in fact pay taxes on the pension benefits nor did he reference any legal authority that sets forth the board’s power to grant a tax credit. Looking to the HSO, the pertinent ordinance under which the board reduced Corrente’s pension benefits, there is no language that indicates that the board had authority to grant a tax credit. We are confident that the board’s decision to deny Corrente’s request for a tax credit was supported by legally competent evidence.', 'Additionally, we reject Corrente’s assertion that the trial justice failed to apply the correct standard when reviewing the board’s decision regarding the tax credit. Corrente asserts that the trial justice “inexplicably did not use” the standard set forth in Environmental Scientific Corp. 621 A.2d at 206. “As we noted in Environmental Scientific, in a two-tiered administrative process, the ultimate decision-maker owes deference to the recommendations of the first-tier decision-maker only if those recommendations were based on determinations of witness credibility.” Johnston Ambulatory Surgical Associates, Ltd. v. Nolan, 755 A.2d 799, 807 (R.I. 2000). “If the recommendations were not based on credibility determinations, the ultimate decision-maker may review the recommendations on a de novo basis.” Id. Here, because Prof. Ritchie’s recommendation of a tax credit was not based on the credibility of witnesses, the board did not owe his recommendation deference. Accordingly, the trial justice appropriately reviewed the board’s decision under the APA standard of review, determined that the board did not abuse its discretion, and denied Corrente’s motion to overrule the board’s decision.', 'For the aforementioned reasons, we will not disturb the trial justice’s denial of Corrente’s motion to overrule the board’s decision to deny him a tax credit.', '-27-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the papers thereto.', '-28- STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET', 'Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement', 'System of the City of Providence v.

The plaintiff, Juan Pimentel (Pimentel or plaintiff), appeals from the Superior Court’s entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (Deutsche Bank as Trustee or defendant). This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on November 7, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This Court has previously considered circumstances similar to the facts giving rise to Pimentel’s appeal regarding residential mortgages in the wake of the 2008 foreclosure crisis.1 On February 4, 2005, Pimentel executed a promissory note for $255,850 in favor of Novelle 1', 'See, e.g., Mruk v.

The note was secured by a mortgage to Novelle on certain property located at 158-160 Briggs Street in Providence. The mortgage contained a power-of- sale clause. Four days later, Novelle assigned the mortgage to Deutsche Bank as Trustee for the Holders of Ixis Real Estate Capital Trust 2005-HE3 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2005-HE3. The assignment was notarized on February 8, 2005, and recorded on February 9, 2005.', 'Three years later, in February 2008, Pimentel defaulted on the mortgage and he has made no further payments on the note. On December 31, 2009, Novelle issued a correction to the 2005 mortgage assignment to revise a faulty acknowledgement.', 'The corrective assignment was recorded in December 2010. Bank of America, N.A.2 serviced Pimentel’s loan until Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (SPS) began servicing it on July 16, 2012. According to defendant, the note was endorsed in blank3 on an allonge4 by IMPAC Funding Corporation (Impac) d/b/a Novelle.

Pimentel’s complaint alleged that Deutsche Bank as Trustee was unable to foreclose on the mortgage because it did not hold Pimentel’s note. On the same day, the Superior Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the foreclosure sale.', 'On June 23, 2015, defendant filed a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The defendant attached three affidavits in support of its motion. One affidavit was from Mark Syphus, a document-control officer for SPS, who attested that he had access to Pimentel’s loan records. The affidavit provided that Deutsche Bank as Trustee held the note, and a copy of the note was attached to the affidavit. In addition to the note, the following four documents were attached to Syphus’s affidavit: a copy of the mortgage, a copy of the assignment of the mortgage, a copy of the corrective assignment, and a copy of the loan’s payment history, evidencing Pimentel’s default. The defendant also provided an affidavit from its attorney, to which plaintiff’s more responsive answers to interrogatories were attached.', 'Pimentel objected to the motion, arguing that genuine issues of material fact existed to support his argument that Deutsche Bank as Trustee did not own the note or the mortgage, and, in fact, was a nonexistent entity. In support of his objection, Pimentel filed a number of exhibits with the Superior Court, including four copies of the note that were given to him at different times and were purportedly not endorsed. Pimentel also filed a number of online records demonstrating the dates that Novelle and Impac were terminated as entities, as well as information regarding the Ixis Real Estate Capital Trust 2005-HE3.', 'On January 25, 2016, a Superior Court justice heard arguments on defendant’s motion for summary judgment and ultimately granted it. The hearing justice determined that defendant', '-3- need be only the mortgagee in order to foreclose on a mortgage in Rhode Island, and that it need not be the note holder as well. However, the hearing justice did remark that Deutsche Bank as Trustee had provided an endorsed copy of the note, supported by an affidavit attesting to the fact that defendant held the note. The hearing justice then determined that the 2009 corrective assignment was valid, relying on a Massachusetts Superior Court decision5 holding that a corrective assignment is valid and binding, and also referencing defendant’s “competent evidence of a valid assignment.” Finally, the hearing justice concluded that defendant was in fact the mortgagee and was entitled to foreclose on the mortgage, and he granted the motion for summary judgment.

Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248 (1986)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Pimentel raises a number of arguments on appeal. First, he contends that summary judgment was not warranted because there is a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether Deutsche Bank as Trustee actually existed under that name and whether it possessed the note. Pimentel also maintains that the hearing justice erred in granting summary judgment for defendant because the note was not endorsed by Novelle.', 'Furthermore, he avers that the assignment was invalid because it was assigned to Deutsche Bank as Trustee, a nonexistent entity. In addition, Pimentel argues that the assignment was invalid because Novelle had no ownership interest in the mortgage when it assigned it to Deutsche Bank as Trustee. Finally, plaintiff avers that judicial estoppel precluded defendant from presenting a version of the note in these proceedings that differs from the version presented in bankruptcy court.', 'The defendant maintains that plaintiff’s arguments regarding the validity of the 2005 assignment are irrelevant because the 2009 assignment is the basis for Deutsche Bank as Trustee’s attempted foreclosure and a foreclosing entity need only be the mortgagee under our case law. The defendant also argues that Pimentel lacks standing to argue that the mortgage was assigned to an entity that did not exist or that the assignment from Novelle to Deutsche Bank as', '-5- Trustee was a violation of the trust’s pooling and servicing agreement.6 In the alternative, defendant contends that it has demonstrated that it does indeed hold the note and plaintiff has not supported his protestations with any sufficient evidence to the contrary. Finally, defendant maintains that plaintiff’s argument regarding judicial estoppel fails because, in supporting his claims, plaintiff relies on documents he received outside of the present litigation.', 'B', 'Validity of the Foreclosure Sale', 'The defendant contends that we need not reach plaintiff’s arguments regarding whether the note was endorsed because, under Rhode Island case law, a mortgagee may foreclose even if it does not hold the note. As we have repeatedly said in a long line of cases stemming from Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069 (R.I. 2013), a mortgagee need not hold the note in order to foreclose on a property. See Leone v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, 101 A.3d 869, 874 (R.I. 2014) (citing Mruk, 82 A.3d at 537). Based on the facts of this case, we see no reason not to extend to non-MERS cases the principles that we have espoused in MERS cases. See Bucci, 68 A.3d at 1085-87. Accordingly, so long as Deutsche Bank as Trustee is the mortgagee, it can foreclose on Pimentel’s property, regardless of whether it holds the note. See Leone, 101 A.3d at 874.', 'A corrective assignment is an accepted means of remedying errors in an assignment. See Genao, 108 A.3d at 1019 n. 3 (acknowledging that a corrective assignment of a mortgage made more than two years after the original assignment was to address a scrivener’s error “regarding 6', 'While we have said in the past that residential home mortgagors have standing to challenge “‘invalid, ineffective, or void’ assignment[s] of [a] mortgage,” here, plaintiff has not provided any evidence that would establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the assignment of his mortgage was void as opposed to “merely voidable.” Mruk, 82 A.3d at 536 (quoting Culhane v. Aurora Loan Services of Nebraska, 708 F.3d 282, 291 (1st Cir. 2015)).', '-6- the notary date” in the first assignment). Here, plaintiff has failed to provide any sufficient evidence beyond investigations that were conducted on the Internet to challenge the validity of the corrective assignment that assigns the mortgage from Novelle to Deutsche Bank as Trustee. He has provided evidence that Novelle forfeited its corporate charter in Delaware on June 6, 2010, and that its Rhode Island status as a corporation was revoked on June 25, 2010. However, the corrective assignment was executed on December 31, 2009, in advance of Novelle’s dissolution. See Juárez v. Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc., 708 F.3d 269, 278 (1st Cir. 2013) (“[A] valid assignment of a mortgage gives the holder of that mortgage the statutory power to sell after a default regardless [of] whether the assignment has been recorded.” (quoting U.S. Bank National Association v. Ibanez, 941 N.E.2d 40, 55 (Mass. 2011))). As such, given that Pimentel has not satisfied his burden of demonstrating that there is a genuine issue of material fact; and, based on the evidence of record, Deutsche Bank as Trustee is the mortgagee. See Genao, 108 A.3d at 1021; see also Leone, 101 A.3d at 874.', 'Even assuming, arguendo, that Deutsche Bank as Trustee must be the holder of the note in order to foreclose, defendant has provided a copy of the note with an allonge that demonstrates that the note was endorsed, along with an affidavit attesting that it holds the note. The plaintiff’s submissions of previous copies of the unendorsed notes are insufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact because he has failed to “fulfill his ‘burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact * * *.’” Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. for Registered Holders of Ameriquest Mortgage Securities, Inc. v. McDonough, 160 A.3d 306, 312 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Plainfield Pike Gas & Convenience, LLC v. 1889 Plainfield Pike Realty Corp., 994 A.2d 54, 57 (R.I. 2010)) (noting that “[b]eyond appending two allegedly unendorsed copies of the note, [the] defendant has not set forth a', '-7- scintilla of competent evidence to rebut [the] plaintiff’s showing that there is no genuine issue of fact with respect to whether the note was endorsed”).', 'Moreover, the plaintiff has lived at the Briggs Street property since 2008 without making a mortgage payment.

Doctor Carcieri stitched the incision along with its lengthened extension and returned the uterus.', 'Nevertheless, the extension continued bleeding. Doctor Hawwa, who had since joined Dr. Carcieri in the operating room, “scrubbed in” to help stop the bleeding.', 'They soon discovered that the bleeding derived from the retroperitoneum,8 which is where the ovarian vein is located. Doctor Carcieri testified that Dr. Hawwa “proceeded to open the retroperitoneum * * * and clean out all that clot and clean out all that irregular blood” and that it was then that the bleeding intensified. Doctor Carcieri described the bleeding as like “cranberry sauce * * * it just came pouring out.” Doctor Hawwa recalled that the blood “clotted and it looked like it had been there for a while. It almost looked like * * * jello.” Doctor Hawwa estimated based on the blood’s appearance and consistency that it had been there for “a while. Between 45, 30 minutes to an hour.”', 'Doctor Carcieri and Dr. Hawwa testified that they soon discovered the source of the massive bleeding: the ovarian vein had separated into two pieces, referred to in the medical records as an ovarian vein laceration.

C-Section Aftermath', 'Following her surgery, Ms. Cappuccilli was transferred to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit at Rhode Island Hospital, where she required two more surgeries and remained in a medically-induced coma for a short time. After the procedure, Ms. Cappuccilli was “terribly traumatized by [the] whole thing.” When released from the hospital, she experienced severe abdominal pains and swelling in her limbs. She continues to receive treatments for what she testified was diagnosed as lymphedema, a condition that causes swelling in her abdomen, legs, and upper body.10', 'She also testified that she began seeing a psychiatrist—Dr. Carmen Monzon—for treatment of depression, anxiety, and nightmares, and started taking medication at Dr. Monzon’s direction.

Timing and Nature of Lacerated Ovarian Vein', 'At trial, Ms. Cappuccilli and defendants disputed the condition of her ovarian vein, as well as the timing of its opening. Doctor Carcieri testified that he believed that the vein was abnormal. Based on this belief, he testified that the vein ruptured by itself prior to the C-section. Further, he thought that the bleeding from the vein rupture caused the fetal distress that necessitated the emergency C-section. Doctor Carcieri testified that neither he nor Dr. Hawwa were able to tie the vein off because “it was not a normal vein.” Doctor Carcieri described that the vein felt “like tissue paper when [he] touched it,” unlike any other vein he had encountered.', 'Ms. Cappuccilli disputed Dr. Carcieri’s characterization of the vein as abnormal in part because Dr. Carcieri did not notify either Ms. Cappuccilli or Women & Infants about the alleged abnormality, nor did he reference it in his operative note.12 Ms. Cappuccilli instead believed that the vein injury occurred during the C-section at the hands of Dr. Carcieri. She pointed to numerous records kept at Women & Infants and Rhode Island Hospital to support that claim.13 Doctor Carcieri disputed the reliability of this evidence, testifying that often the person dictating 12', 'An operative note is created by a surgeon after surgery to describe the operation, including what was seen during the operation. 13', 'For example, Dr. Moore explained in his operative report that “[o]n entering the room, [Dr. Carcieri and Dr. Hawwa] indicated to me that a large vein had been lacerated.” Doctor Carcieri’s operative report described that “[i]n the area of the hematoma, there was noted to be a laceration in the ovarian vein.” Doctor Hawwa’s operative report included that “[d]issection revealed a laceration to the ovarian vein.” Doctor Charles Adams, who performed a subsequent operation on Ms. Cappuccilli, noted in his operative report that “[d]uring this emergent section, the patient had an ovarian vein injury.” A Women & Infants Discharge Summary specified that Ms. Cappuccilli experienced “an ovarian vein tear” during her procedure. A Rhode Island Hospital Discharge Summary mentioned that “[c]esar[e]an section complications included the ovarian vein being inadvertently torn.” A Rhode Island Hospital coding sheet described an “accidental cut/puncture/perforation/hemorrhage during surgical operation.”', '-5- these records is the “low man on the totem pole” and is not someone intimately involved in the case. In addition, Dr. Moore testified that “there are many records made in the medical records that are not fact.” He further described some of the records as “medical record notes that were cut and paste, whether they were done by an intern or medical assistant * * *.”', 'In line with Dr. Carcieri and Dr. Hawwa’s testimony, Dr. Moore testified that, based on the injury’s location, he did not believe a scalpel lacerated the vein, stating: “I don’t see how you get to that area in the span of doing a C-section.” He believed that the “bleeding had been happening in that retroperitoneum space long before [Dr. Carcieri and Dr. Hawwa] opened it,” based on the large collection of blood already in the area. Doctor Moore also reiterated that “[t]his was a vein that was like tissue paper. In fact, it was like wet tissue paper * * *. This was an abnormal vein.” He continued, “the difficulty of ligating that vein off was because it was friable, it was venous complex, it was torturous and it was very abnormal and very difficult to tie off. I have tied up thousands of infundibulum ligaments, ovarian veins and this is not a normal vein that I have tied off before.” Similarly, Dr. Hawwa testified that, after he had trouble tying the vein, he determined that “this vein is not a normal vein. I have never seen anything like it before and I have never seen anything like it since then. It is, it is a tough vein. * * * [W]e were discussing that something must be wrong with this vein, otherwise it would have taken the tie. A vein should take a tie and hold steady.”', 'D. Expert Testimony at Trial', 'On March 20, 2009, Ms. Cappuccilli filed a medical malpractice action against defendants alleging that they negligently cut or tore her ovarian vein during the C-section. Over the course of a three-and-a-half-week trial, each side presented expert testimony, and a total of fifteen witnesses testified: eleven on behalf of plaintiff and four on behalf of defendants. The', '-6- plaintiff presented Dr. Fred Duboe, an obstetrician gynecologist, who gave his opinion that the injury occurred during the C-section and is not an injury that would occur absent negligence. Doctor Duboe further noted that “the most likely mechanism for the injury was through forceful manipulation of the uterus exteriorizing it or placing it back into the incision upon repair of the uterine incision.”', 'Alternatively, Dr. Duboe also maintained that the laceration could have occurred during dissection into the retroperitoneal area and, contrary to Dr. Carcieri’s contention, said that such an injury is not anatomically impossible. In addition, plaintiff presented vascular expert Dr. Paul Collier to support her theory that the vein was injured during the C-section. Doctor Collier offered the opinion that the vein did not rupture spontaneously prior to the C-section because, if it had, Ms. Cappuccilli’s medical condition would have destabilized more than it had. Doctor Collier also gave the opinion that plaintiff’s veins were not abnormal and, instead, the tissue-paper-like quality is “to be expected.”', 'The defendants presented Dr. Michael Arnold, also a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology, who testified to his belief that the bleeding began prior to the procedure and “wasn’t something that had happened immediately at the time of the surgery.” Rather, basing his opinion on the amount of blood, changes in Ms. Cappuccilli’s anesthesia record, and her uterus’s Couvelaire appearance, Dr. Arnold believed that Ms. Cappuccilli’s ovarian vein spontaneously ruptured around 12:15 p.m.', 'Doctor Arnold also rejected Dr. Duboe’s testimony that exteriorizing the uterus can damage the ovarian vein, commenting that it “anatomically and physically * * * doesn’t make sense.” Finally, defendants presented Dr. Robert Higgins, who opined that Ms. Cappuccilli was not diagnosed with lymphedema, but rather with edema and swelling of the limbs.', '-7-', 'E.

On October 29, 2014, the jury returned a verdict for defendants. The plaintiff moved for a new trial, and the trial justice heard arguments on November 25, 2014.', 'During the motion hearing, plaintiff claimed the jury “bought” the story that the vein ruptured spontaneously despite overwhelming circumstantial evidence that the injury occurred during the C-section rather than before it. The plaintiff alleged that the defense’s theory that the vein ruptured spontaneously was “manufactured” and stemmed solely from Dr. Carcieri, Dr. Hawwa, and Dr. Moore’s testimony, which plaintiff believed was not credible due to contradicting evidence. She urged the trial justice to “make a finding that those three doctors are not worthy of belief.”', 'In a bench decision, the trial justice denied the motion for new trial. In his ruling, he explained that his “independent review of the evidence * * * leads to the conclusion that reasonable minds could differ on this critical issue.” The trial justice continued that “one assigned expert was [not] substantially better qualified or more credible and more worthy of belief than the others. The battle of the experts in this case can best be described as a draw.” He concluded: “Simply put, the evidence relating to negligence on the part of Dr. Carcieri was equivocal.” The plaintiff timely appealed on December 12, 2014.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When “plaintiffs raise multiple issues on appeal, our standard of review differs with respect to each issue.” Bates-Bridgmon v.

We discuss each claim of error in turn.', 'A. Credibility of Testimony as to the “Vein Laceration”', 'The plaintiff’s first argument calls our attention to the trial justice’s determination that reasonable minds could differ as to whether Dr. Carcieri complied with the standard of care. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that the trial justice erred in failing to “resolve the credibility gap between what the contemporaneous medical records document and what the defendants told the jury eight years later.” On appeal, we are careful not to stray from the applicable standard. “‘If the trial justice concludes that reasonable minds could differ as to the result or if the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury did * * *,’ the motion for * * * new trial should be denied.” State v.

However, in light of our', '- 10 - precedent that a trial justice “need not engage in an exhaustive review,” we are satisfied that his concise overview of the evidence that motivated his decision was sufficient.14 Hough, 101 A.3d at 856 (quoting Bourdon’s, 704 A.2d at 758); see also Bitgood v. Greene, 108 A.3d 1023, 1029 (R.I. 2015) (holding that, after the trial justice cited the standard of review, summarized the facts, and determined that “[t]he credible evidence presented was so evenly balanced and such that different minds can naturally and fairly come to different conclusions,” the Court was “well satisfied that the trial justice engaged in the appropriate analysis”); Kwarciak v. Star Market, 506 A.2d 545, 547 (R.I. 1986) (“Such a review and advertence to the salient elements of the case should be sufficient to enable the reviewing court to determine whether the trial justice was warranted in reaching such conclusions.”).', 'The crux of plaintiff’s argument centers on the cause and the timing of the “laceration” of the ovarian vein. Each side offered experts to refute the opinions of the other; and, as the trial justice noted, “one assigned expert was [not] substantially better qualified or more credible and more worthy of belief than the others.” Apart from expert testimony, plaintiff also presented evidence to show that defendants did not document plaintiff’s abnormal vein in her medical records, nor did defendants inform plaintiff that she had an abnormal vein.', 'The plaintiff contended that defendants “manufactured” their theory only after litigation commenced, arguing that defendants’ “theory of the case is improbable, unbelievable, and made up.” 14', 'We also remark that, prior to the hearing on the motion for new trial, the trial justice had “received memoranda from both sides * * * and * * * reviewed them both,” noting further that he “always like[s] to afford the attorneys an opportunity to argue in addition to filing the memos if they wish to further elaborate or embellish on the papers they have provided with me previously.” After hearing argument, but before explaining the basis for his ruling, he told the parties that “the [c]ourt’s analysis will primarily focus on witnesses who testified regarding the obstetric gynecological standard of care.” He then proceeded to synopsize the evidence he considered in making his ruling, including the expert testimony, before revealing his ultimate conclusion denying the motion after “carefully review[ing]” and “assess[ing]” the evidence.', '- 11 -', 'Yet, for each piece of evidence that plaintiff proffered, defendants tendered evidence to refute it. For example, plaintiff argues on appeal that the trial justice failed to reconcile the “wealth of documentary evidence from plaintiff’s medical records” with his determination that reasonable minds could differ as to Dr. Carcieri’s alleged negligence. However, although the trial justice remarked that plaintiff’s medical records “describe an injury to the plaintiff’s ovarian vein as a ‘lacerated ovarian vein’ or as an ‘inadvertently torn ovarian vein,’” he also highlighted Dr. Moore’s testimony that “‘lacerated’ in medical terminology could also mean blunt[] trauma, or physiologic changes causing the vein to bleed rather than refer to a cut made by a sharp instrument.” In doing so, he followed the standard required of a trial justice when ruling on a motion for a new trial: “In setting forth the rationale for a decision, ‘the trial justice need not refer to all the evidence supporting the decision, rather he need only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the justice has applied the appropriate standards.’” State v.

The plaintiff fails to recognize, though, that defendants presented expert testimony to support their theory that the vein ruptured prior to surgery, rather than during surgery as plaintiff’s experts asserted; and, as the trial justice aptly put it, “[t]he battle of the experts in this case can best be described as a draw.” Contrary to plaintiff’s argument, we believe that the trial justice addressed the conflicting evidence and resolved it by determining that the evidence, when compared, ends in “a draw.” He found that each expert was well-qualified, similarly credible, and “gave plausible medically supported opinions and views of what they believed occurred during the plaintiff’s surgery.”', 'He determined that “[s]imply put, the evidence relating to negligence on the part of Dr. Carcieri was equivocal.” (Emphasis added.)

Photograph and Medical Record of Ms. Cappuccilli’s Son', 'Next, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred by relying on Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence to exclude the photograph depicting a wound to her newborn son’s face, as well as a medical record referencing that wound. We discuss each argument in turn.', '1. Photograph of Ms. Cappuccilli’s Son', 'The trial justice heard arguments regarding the photograph during defendants’ motion in limine. The plaintiff argued that the photograph should be admitted because it related to the central issue in the case—“whether or not Dr. Carcieri was a skilled[,] prudent practitioner that day.” The plaintiff admitted that her experts did not consider the baby’s laceration in forming their opinion. The trial justice questioned the jury’s need to see “a photograph of a beautiful little baby with a large scar on the side of his head[.] * * * They see a cut on this beautiful little baby’s face or side of his head, that is pretty powerful.” The trial justice ultimately concluded “[t]he picture is out.”15', 'A “limit on the general rule favoring the admission of relevant evidence provides that relevant evidence ‘may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * * *.’” Accetta, 962 A.2d at 60 (quoting Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence). This determination is “confided to the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Id. Still, “[t]his Court has repeatedly warned that ‘the discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be exercised sparingly.’” State v. Husband, 162 A.3d 646, 655 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Shelton, 990 A.2d 191, 202 (R.I. 2010)). “Accordingly, ‘[i]t is only evidence 15', 'Although counsel did not press the issue at oral argument, we address it in any case.', '- 14 - that is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that must be excluded.’” Id. (quoting State v. Hak, 963 A.2d 921, 928 (R.I. 2009)).', 'The plaintiff gives two grounds for her argument that the photograph is highly probative and should survive a Rule 403 analysis: (1) the photograph would have assisted the jury in resolving the meaning of “laceration”; and (2) the photograph is relevant to Dr. Carcieri’s credibility and overall skill level during the course of her C-section. Despite plaintiff’s attempts to persuade him otherwise, the trial justice held that the probative value of the photograph was substantially outweighed by its unfair prejudice. We believe he did not abuse his discretion in so ruling.', 'i. Meaning of “Laceration” at Women & Infants', 'First, plaintiff argues that the photograph is probative of Women & Infants’ definition of “laceration” at the time of her C-section because a medical record described her son’s injury as a “laceration.” The plaintiff urges this Court, then, to make the inference that because “laceration” in this photograph referred to a wound caused by a surgical instrument, when “laceration” is referenced in other records it should be similarly interpreted.', 'We note that plaintiff did not raise the argument that the photograph would help resolve the meaning of “laceration” at either the motion in limine hearing or at trial. As we have repeatedly reiterated, “the ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes a litigant from arguing an issue on appeal that has not been articulated at trial.” Thornley v. Community College of Rhode Island, 107 A.3d 296, 302 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Ford, 56 A.3d 463, 470 (R.I. 2012)).', 'Despite plaintiff’s failure to preserve this argument, we nonetheless pause to consider its merit. At trial, the defense presented witnesses who attested that “laceration” has a distinct medical meaning different from a layperson’s interpretation of the term. Doctor Moore testified:', '- 15 -', '“When we talk about laceration in medical terms, not only in lay', 'person terms * * * we think of laceration like a cut from a knife or', 'something sharp. Laceration can come from blunt trauma, it can', 'come from physiologic changes. * * * Even though there wasn’t', 'something sharp that cut it, it was laceration. If you get hit with a', 'baseball bat, a cut in your skin is a laceration. So laceration', 'doesn’t necessarily mean medically that it is done by a sharp', 'instrument.” The photograph would not be meaningfully probative of Women & Infants’ interpretation of “laceration,” but rather would only be minimally probative of one of many possible interpretations. In other words, Dr. Moore’s testimony illustrates that “laceration” has many meanings in the medical context, so the mere fact that the photograph depicts what is described as a “laceration” is not dispositive of Women & Infants’ interpretation of the term. Instead, it only reflects one possible use. In weighing that minimal probative value against the significant prejudice that the trial justice recognized, we cannot agree that the trial justice abused his considerable discretion in excluding the evidence. We will not disturb the trial justice’s ruling.', 'ii. Doctor Carcieri’s Skill During the C-Section', 'Alternatively, plaintiff alleges that the photograph is probative of the skill Dr. Carcieri used during the procedure. On the contrary, we believe that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in determining that the photograph has little probative value because it is not relevant to the issue in the case, which is whether Dr. Carcieri failed to adhere to the standard of care he owed to plaintiff during her emergency C-section. As defendants highlight, the issues with plaintiff’s care began after Dr. Carcieri successfully delivered her son. Hence, any alleged injury to plaintiff’s son at the time of his birth is not correlated to this action.', 'The plaintiff’s argument that the photograph is evidence of Dr. Carcieri’s skill is too attenuated to survive where her civil action asserts solely a breach of the standard of care owed to her, not to her son. With only that limited probative value, the substantial prejudice of the', '- 16 - photograph easily outweighs its relevance. Accordingly, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in excluding the evidence because “[t]his is indeed a situation where the evidence was marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial.” Husband, 162 A.3d at 658.', '2. Medical Record of Ms. Cappuccilli’s Son', 'During defendants’ motion in limine, the trial justice also considered the proposed introduction of Ms. Cappuccilli’s son’s medical record referencing his injury. During that motion, defendants expressed concern that plaintiff would “improperly draw conclusions” from the record without expert testimony, noting that “[plaintiff] already told this [c]ourt that [she] intend[s] to try to raise the specter to say because the baby has got a cut, * * * there might have been a cut somewhere else, when not one of [plaintiff’s] experts said that there was a cut.” While the trial justice explicitly excluded the photograph, he reserved ruling on the record until he saw “in more detail how some of these doctors testify” and “how things develop.”16', 'At trial, plaintiff sought to introduce the record again, but defendants objected on the basis of relevance. The defendants reiterated that the baby had no claim in the case and plaintiff did not have an expert to connect the baby’s injury to that of plaintiff. The defendants asserted that the sole purpose was to inflame the jury. The plaintiff, on the other hand, argued that it went to credibility because Dr. Carcieri did not mention either a lacerated vein or a laceration to the baby’s face in his operative note. As plaintiff put it, “[i]t is not as if * * * we have a completely unrelated injury in this case. We have a laceration and now we have another.” After noting that it was a “simple [Rule] 403” analysis, the trial justice concluded as follows:', '“I don’t know enough about the issue * * * if the mere fact is he is', 'a sloppy doctor who cut the baby’s head along with all of the other 16', 'We note also that the trial justice reminded counsel, “just alert me ahead of time and I will make a definitive ruling at that time[,] but I feel better if some of the record is developed prior to that time.”', '- 17 -', 'things that he did to * * * [p]laintiff, I don’t think that is really, in', 'my opinion, an apples and oranges argument simply because it is', 'so prejudicial, and it is really designed to evoke sympathy and', 'dislike of the doctor as opposed to them objecting or assessing', 'what he did to the mother, if anything. So, I’m not ruling out that', 'there could be some facts and circumstances demonstrated that', 'make whatever happened to that child * * * probative * * *. But', 'I’m not a mind-reader. * * * I just can’t make the call right now.” Later in the trial, plaintiff argued that “since [Dr. Carcieri] has now said that * * * he doesn’t have any knowledge of any other inadvertent injury in this C-section, I have the right to confront him with a record that establishes that there was.” The trial justice responded that he was “still reluctant with where the testimony is at letting [plaintiff] pursue the laceration to baby [sic] head.” He indicated that he “want[s] to know what the doctor performing a surgery typically does or is required to do in terms [sic] documenting and records [sic] whatever happens whatever he sees, whatever occurs during that surgery I would like more.” The plaintiff continued to question Dr. Carcieri, but soon concluded the questioning without another reference to the baby’s record.', 'We glean no further attempt by plaintiff to introduce the medical record she now argues the trial judge erred by excluding. Each time the trial justice considered plaintiff’s introduction of the record, he expressed that her purported use was inappropriate. Yet, he never gave a definitive ruling, instead reserving his ruling pending additional information, but plaintiff failed to preserve the issue and appeared to abandon the argument. Where the applicable standard confines us to consider only the trial justice’s decision, absent a definitive ruling it is improper for this Court to consider plaintiff’s argument. See Berman, 101 A.3d at 1259 (citing Morel, 64 A.3d at 1179). Because “[t]his Court will not reverse a decision of a trial justice admitting or excluding evidence in the absence of an abuse of discretion[,]” it follows that, where the trial', '- 18 - justice neither admitted nor excluded the evidence, we will not address the issue. Dawkins v. Siwicki, 22 A.3d 1142, 1154 (R.I. 2011).', 'C. Record Referencing Risk Management', 'Last, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in excluding a record showing that Women & Infants’ risk-management department paid for her prescription for Zoloft following the procedure. The medical record memorializes a phone message left for Dr. Monzon regarding risk-management’s payment of plaintiff’s Zoloft prescription. The trial justice excluded the record, ruling it inadmissible pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-19-35, which excludes evidence of a medical provider’s failure to bill in medical malpractice cases.17 Alternatively, he excluded the record based on its unfairly prejudicial nature in accordance with Rule 403. We agree with the trial justice in each respect.', '1. Section 9-19-35', 'The plaintiff first argues that the trial justice erred in excluding the document because § 9-19-35 excludes only evidence introduced to prove liability, not to prove bias or prejudice, as allowed by other provisions.18 In accordance with the statute, plaintiff persists that she sought to introduce this evidence not to prove liability, but instead to prove defendants’ bias and prejudice. The plaintiff contends she sought “to show not only that [the doctors] may have been influenced by [Women & Infants’] risk-management department early on in the case but that risk 17', 'The full statute, titled “Failure to bill inadmissible in medical malpractice cases,” reads: “The failure of a health care provider to bill a patient for services rendered shall not be construed as an admission of liability and shall not be admissible in evidence as to liability in any hearing or trial of an action of tort or breach of contract for malpractice, error, or mistake against a health care provider.” General Laws 1956 § 9-19-35(b). 18', 'The plaintiff specifically addresses Rule 411 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, which prohibits evidence of liability insurance to prove liability, but permits such evidence to prove “agency, ownership, or control, bias or prejudice of a witness, or when the court determines that in the interests of justice evidence of insurance or lack of insurance should be permitted.” Id. (emphasis added).', '- 19 - management itself concluded that the plaintiff had post-incident depression.” She continues “it is fair for [the jury] to know that at the time that the treatment was taking place, [the doctors] were or may have been influenced by [r]isk [m]anagement.”', 'The trial justice, however, disagreed, explaining that “‘risk management’ * * * gives rise to [an] inference of some acceptance of responsibility by * * * defendant[s].” He further expressed that it could be “construed by the jury as an admission of liability in the sense that early on after this woman’s treatment at the hospital, they are paying for medication to treat a symptom that she is now going to argue * * * was proximately caused by what the doctor in the hospital did to her.” In light of the trial justice’s discretion, we do not disturb his ruling that the jury would likely view the document as an admission of liability. His stated reason for excluding the evidence—that the jury might misconstrue it as an admission—certainly indicates that there are “some grounds to support the decision.” Berman, 101 A.3d at 1263 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Dalo v. Thalmann, 878 A.2d 194, 200 (R.I. 2005)). As such, “under the abuse of discretion lens,” we find no error in his ruling. Id. at 1264.', '2. Rule 403', 'Even if the evidence were admissible pursuant to the aforementioned statute, it is inadmissible under Rule 403. As noted, “Rule 403 * * * provides that relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” State v. Fry, 130 A.3d 812, 830 (R.I. 2016). The trial justice believed that the evidence was unduly prejudicial because it mimicked inadmissible liability insurance evidence prohibited under Rule 411 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', 'The plaintiff argues that the evidence is probative for three reasons: (1) to show the defendants’ bias; (2) to rebut the defendants’ dispute about the extent of her psychological', '- 20 - injuries; and (3) to support her claim that the vein did not spontaneously rupture and, instead, the defendants met with risk management because they realized their actions could expose them to litigation. Although plentiful, the plaintiff’s proffered reasons are of little assistance when weighed against the unfair prejudice the trial justice feared. “It is well settled that the purpose of Rule 411 is ‘to discourage inquiry into a defendant’s indemnity in a manner calculated to influence the jury. It is applicable only where, in all the circumstances, it cannot be reasonably concluded that the jury could ignore or disregard such references to an insurer.’” Oden v. Schwartz, 71 A.3d 438, 454-55 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Cochran v. Dube, 114 R.I. 149, 152, 330 A.2d 76, 78 (1975)). The spirit of inadmissible liability insurance and the risk-management evidence here is the same: Each triggers a connotation of remedial relief and admission of liability. That connotation invites unfair prejudice, which is what concerned the trial justice: that there could be “an extreme[], if not, incurable prejudice that would flow from that document” that would “really taint the juror’s deliberations.” The plaintiff’s argument that “risk management is a very sophisticated department within the hospital that most people don’t understand * * * a lay jury is not going to understand that risk management means insurance” both overstates the department’s complexity and underestimates the jury’s intelligence. As we have previously held, “[i]t is within the trial justice’s discretion to determine the effect of evidence submitted.” Miller v. Rhode Island Hospital, 625 A.2d 778, 780 (R.I. 1993) (citing State v. Grundy, 582 A.2d 1166, 1172 (R.I. 1990)). The trial justice’s concern that the evidence too closely resembles liability insurance was sound, and we decipher no error in his ruling that “risk management is tantamount to saying insurance to a jury even if it is not tantamount to insurance.” See Berman, 101 A.3d at 1263 (“we will not conclude that a trial justice abused his', '- 21 - or her discretion as long as some grounds to support the decision appear in the record” (quoting Dalo, 878 A.2d at 200) (emphasis added)).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be returned to that tribunal.', 'Justice Goldberg, concurring and dissenting. I concur in the majority’s opinion that affirms the trial justice’s evidentiary rulings in this case. However, we part company with respect to the holding that affirms the denial of the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial. It is my opinion that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived the critical issue raised by the plaintiff and failed to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. Despite presiding over a sixteen-day jury trial, after summarizing the testimony of the witnesses, the decision denying the motion for a new trial consisted of two paragraphs:', '“This Court has carefully reviewed the material testimony', 'in evidence offered on the critical issue of whether Sevan', 'Cappuccilli’s right ovarian vein was injured by a surgical', 'instrument or by force or [exteriorization] of her uterus during her', '[cesarean] section surgery.

See State v. Luanglath, 749 A.2d 1, 4 (R.I. 2000); see also Hefner v. Distel, 813 A.2d 66, 70 (R.I. 2003) (trial justice must analyze the evidence and pass upon the credibility of the witnesses; his questions to counsel did not serve to establish the basis of trial justice’s decision granting a new trial or additur). A deferential standard of appellate review is not without limitation. The trial justice is required to review the evidence in light of his or her charge to the jury; and must then independently analyze the evidence and its weight and pass upon the credibility of the witnesses. Luanglath, 749 A.2d at 4; see also Hefner, 813 A.2d at 69 (“If a trial justice properly reviews the evidence—commenting on its weight and on the credibility of the witnesses and uses independent judgment in doing so, his or her decision will not be overturned * * *.”) (emphasis added); Kurczy v. St. Joseph Veterans Association, Inc., 713 A.2d 766, 770 (R.I. 1998).

The trial justice’s task in passing on a witness’s credibility can include a finding that, in light of other evidence presented at trial, the witness’s testimony is or is not worthy of belief, State v. Dame, 560 A.2d 330, 333 (R.I. 1989), or, that the testimony was inherently improbable, Beauchemin v. Sweeten, 471 A.2d 624, 627 (R.I. 1984), or unworthy of belief because it was contradicted by other direct or circumstantial evidence, Evangelista v. Antonio De Cubellis, Inc., 79 R.I. 142, 149, 85 A.2d 69, 72 (1951). Additionally in some cases, the reliability of a witness may also be a factor to consider in passing on his or her credibility. Luanglath, 749 A.2d at 5. In the case at bar, the trial justice simply did not address the arguments presented by plaintiff, nor did he pass on the credibility of the witnesses. This case should be remanded for a rehearing on plaintiff’s motion for a new trial.', 'The majority opinion acknowledges that, in light of the extensive evidence in this case, the trial justice “could have articulated the basis for his decision that reasonable minds could differ as to Dr. Carcieri’s negligence more expansively.”', 'Nonetheless, citing Hough v.

However, we have never excused a failure to reference any facts that motivated the ruling or affirmed a decision that overlooked the important duty of the “super juror” to make an independent appraisal of the evidence in light of the charge to the jury, or that failed to assess the credibility of the witnesses. See Hefner, 813 A.2d at 70-71 (this Court vacated a decision granting a motion for a new trial based on the trial justice’s failure to analyze the evidence or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses). In Hefner, this Court rejected the trial court’s decision and, in doing so, noted that the trial justice’s “questions to counsel [were] the primary source for inferring the basis of his decision[.]” Id. It is noteworthy that in 1', 'The majority opinion also references the fact that before the hearing, the trial justice had received and reviewed the parties’ memoranda and declared that he was affording counsel a further opportunity to “elaborate or embellish on the papers” previously filed. The plaintiff’s memorandum however, was laser-focused on the medical records presented to the jury which, plaintiff contended, established that the injury occurred during and not before the cesarean- section surgery. The plaintiff pointed to eleven references to this injury in the hospital medical records as well as numerous post-surgery treatment notes compiled by Dr. Moore spanning three years—evidence that, if believed by the jury, could have led to a different result. None of this evidence was even mentioned in the decision.', '- 25 - Golembewski, 808 A.2d at 626, this Court remanded the case to the Superior Court for a rehearing on the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'In my opinion, the trial justice provided this Court with an appropriate review of the testimony in this case; it is his decision that is lacking because he overlooked the medical records evidence upon which the new-trial motion rested; nor did he pass upon the credibility of the witnesses particularly as juxtaposed against the medical records.', 'This Court has never declared that a trial justice, in deciding a motion for a new trial, is free to overlook the credibility of the witnesses or to fail to independently analyze the evidence.', 'Because the trial justice misconceived the central issues before him, failed to point to the evidence upon which his decision rested, and overlooked the credibility of the witnesses, this Court should remand this case for a rehearing. In Hefner, 813 A.2d at 70, we vacated the grant of a new trial because “the trial justice did not analyze the evidence or pass upon the credibility of the witnesses.”2 Here, the trial justice limited his analysis to “the testimony of the expert physicians offered to establish the standard of care applicable to plaintiff’s surgical procedures.” In this case, the standard of care in a medical negligence trial was not the basis of plaintiff’s new-trial motion. The critical issue before the trial justice was factual and temporal. Did the injury occur before the baby was born, as defendants contended or was that defense manufactured after this lawsuit was filed, as plaintiff argued; and was the evidence sufficient to establish that the injury occurred during the surgery. 2', 'In Hefner v. Distel, 813 A.2d 66, 70 (R.I. 2003), this Court applied the appellate rule based on the trial justice’s failure to make a specific appraisal of the evidence.

It is my opinion that he overlooked and misconceived this evidence and the issue upon which the motion for a new trial rested.', 'Critically, before he summarized the testimony, the trial justice stated:', '“The Court’s analysis will primarily focus on witnesses who', 'testified regarding the obstetric gynecological standard of care', '- 27 -', 'applicable to the plaintiff’s [cesarean] section surgery on March', '15, 2006, and whether the injury to the plaintiff’s ovarian vein', 'occurred during this surgery.” As noted, the obstetric gynecological standard of care for a cesarean section was not the basis for the new-trial motion.', 'The trial justice did not address the dispute concerning the term “laceration” in the medical records context, nor did he reference what motivated his decision or whether he agreed with the verdict.

After a trial in the Tiverton Municipal Court, defendants were found liable for manufacturing compost in an R-80 zone in violation of Article IV, Section 13(a) of the zoning ordinance, resulting in a $2,000 fine. The order declared that defendants were engaged in the mixing together of organic materials for the purpose of manufacturing compost in an R-80 zone in violation of Article IV, Section 13(a) of the ordinance.', 'The defendants appealed the Municipal Court Order in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 45- 2-343 and were afforded a trial de novo in Superior Court.

At trial, Lawton identified photographs of piles of organic materials situated on the property: “This is what I observed and believed to be screened compost * * * [t]his is what I observed and believed to be a pile of soil mixed with compost.” Mr. Pelletier informed Lawton that he was starting a tree nursery on the property.

He made about 100 site visits to the property between 2005 and 2010. As a result of these visits and his communications with DEM, he issued two notices of violation of Article IV, Section 13(a), on January 23, 2009, and February 18, 2009.

Mr. Eames stated that Pelletier had said: “I’m making compost.” Furthermore, in 2010, Eames saw trees in the nursey section of the property—which comprised approximately one acre of the thirty acre tract—but there was no compost at the base of the trees. Mr. Eames acknowledged that because the zoning ordinance does not define “compost,” he looked to Webster’s Dictionary before determining that defendants were in violation of the ordinance.6', 'Finally, Mello testified that he resides approximately 300 feet from the property and was repeatedly disturbed by construction noise from the property which he described as, “[t]he humming of heavy equipment, industrial equipment constantly in the background in the neighborhood, and then the increased volume of tractor trailers coming up and down the street,” entering and exiting defendants’ property.

Mr. Mello also witnessed the trommel in operation on numerous occasions and saw Pelletier mixing the material with his equipment and also observed steam developing from the mass of material on the property. In order to document defendants’ activities, Mello took a series of photographs depicting the piles of compost material and industrial equipment on the property, which photographs were introduced into evidence at trial.', 'At the close of the town’s evidence, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint in accordance with Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.7 The trial justice denied defendants’ motion, and the defense case proceeded on July 23, 2013. Over the course of four trial days on various dates, defendants presented two witnesses: Pelletier and Joseph Lombardo, an expert in the field of land-use planning. Mr. Pelletier testified about the various organic materials that were stockpiled on the property, and he admitted that materials such as the grass clippings, yard waste, and horse manure were also shipped from off-site for the purpose of composting. However, he disagreed that he was “manufacturing” compost because he indicated that, once the materials are mixed together, “nature takes over” and compost develops naturally when certain organic materials are combined in a heap. Mr. Lombardo testified that he visited the property for two hours in April 2010. In his opinion, defendants’ actions could not be categorized as an industrial use, and he stated that no manufacturing process was taking place on the property because defendants’ compost was not being packaged and sold as a product off-site.', 'On September 27, 2013, the trial court issued a written decision finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants violated the Tiverton Zoning Ordinance by manufacturing 7', 'Rule 29(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:', '“In a case tried without a jury, a motion to dismiss may be filed at', 'the close of the State’s case to challenge the legal sufficiency of', 'the State’s trial evidence.”', '-5- compost on the property.8 The defendants appealed to this Court and raised seven issues on appeal: (1) whether composting is permitted in an R-80 zone; (2) whether the “manufacturing of compost” is permitted in an R-80 zone; (3) whether the town has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that defendants were “industrially manufacturing compost” within the intent of Article IV, Section 13(a) of the zoning ordinance; (4) whether the zoning code is unconstitutionally vague and fails to provide defendants with the requisite notice that manufacturing compost is not permitted in an R-80 zone; (5) whether defendants’ composting activities are protected by the Rhode Island Right to Farm Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 23 of title 29; (6) whether the town is 8', 'Although the town sought to assess a fine in excess of $1.7 million, the court imposed a nominal fine of $1. 9', 'General Laws 1956 § 2-23-4, the Rhode Island Right to Farm Act, provides:', '“(a) As used in this chapter, “agricultural operations”', 'includes any commercial enterprise that has as its primary purpose', 'horticulture, viticulture, viniculture, floriculture, forestry, stabling', 'of horses, dairy farming, or aquaculture, or the raising of livestock,', 'including for the production of fiber, furbearing animals, poultry or', 'bees, and all such other operations, uses, and activities as the', 'director, in consultation with the chief of [the] division of', 'agriculture, may determine to be agriculture, or an agricultural', 'activity, use or operation.

When passing on a Rule 29 motion to dismiss, it is incumbent on a trial justice sitting without a jury to determine whether the state has proven the charge beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, the trial justice undertook a thorough analysis of the trial testimony and the objective evidence before her and determined that defendants violated the ordinance beyond a reasonable doubt:', '“[T]he uncontradicted and credible evidence overwhelmingly', 'establishe[d] that raw materials, most pointedly, manure, were', 'trucked in from off-site (no animals were ever observed on site).', 'The intensity of heavy equipment use and the volume of the', 'various materials, which could be utilized [with] the ‘compost', 'recipe,’ compel the conclusion, beyond a reasonable doubt, that', '[d]efendant was engaged in the ‘manufacturing of compost’ in', 'violation of the applicable ordinances.” This Court has consistently held that the factual findings of a trial justice, sitting without a jury, are reviewed with extreme deference. See Gianquitti, 22 A.3d at 1165 (“This Court consistently has held that factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are granted an extremely deferential standard of review.”); see also State v. Fuller-Balletta, 996 A.2d 133, 140 (R.I. 2010) (“We shall not disturb the findings of the trial justice unless it is established that he or she misconceived or overlooked relevant and material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” (quoting Cerilli v.

This decision was well-reasoned and addressed the testimony of defendants’ expert witness and defendant Pelletier. After a careful review of the record, we decline to disturb the trial justice’s factual findings that organic materials were trucked onto defendants’ property from off-site, that large industrial, earth-', '-9- moving equipment was used to combine these materials to manufacture compost, and that the large quantity of processed compost was in excess of what defendants’ one-acre nursery required.', 'We note that “processing” is also prohibited under Article IV, Section 13(a) of the zoning ordinance. The terms “processing” and “manufacturing” are homologous. “Manufacturing has been defined as ‘the production of articles for use from raw or prepared materials by giving the materials new forms, qualities, properties or combination whether by hand labor or machines.’” Murdock v. City of Norwood, 67 N.E.2d 867, 869 (Ohio Ct. Com. Pl. 1946) (quoting American Sumatra Tobacco Corp. v. Tone, 15 A.2d 80, 82 (Conn. 1940)). On the other hand, “processing” has been defined as “effectuat[ing] change in form, contour, chemical-combination, physical appearance or otherwise by artificial or natural means and, in its more complicated form, involves progressive action in performing, producing or making something.” Corn Products Refining Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 144 F.2d 211, 219 (7th Cir. 1944).', 'It is undisputed that defendants utilized industrial heavy equipment in order to produce the large quantities of compost for their operation. We contrast defendants’ actions with that of the average landowner who makes compost in his or her backyard by combining plant waste, food waste, and other organic materials in such a manner that natural fermentation occurs, resulting in a nutrient-rich material that one uses in gardening. Although this Court has not defined the term “composting,” other courts have defined composting as the “controlled, biological decomposition of selected solid organic waste materials under aerobic conditions resulting in an innocuous final product.” Organic Technologies Corp. v. State Ex rel Iowa Department of Natural Resources, 609 N.W.2d 809, 818 (Iowa 2000) (quoting Iowa Admin. Code r. 567-100.2 (455B, 455D)).', '- 10 -', 'The sine qua non of distinguishing between defendants’ prohibited activities and those of the average homeowner who engages in composting are the elements of manufacturing and processing through the use of industrial equipment and the extent to which defendants manufactured and produced the finished compost in violation of the ordinance. The average composter does not bring heavy, noise-emitting industrial equipment coupled with delivery of truckloads of organic material onto his or her property on a daily basis. Here, it is clear from the evidence in the record that defendants procured truckloads of waste materials to be transported to the property, actively combined these materials with industrial equipment, and produced finished compost that was used off-site.', 'In reaching our conclusion, we are impressed by the fact that on one site visit in 2010, the Tiverton building and zoning official observed that there was no compost around the base of the trees, yet the amount of compost on the site had been reduced. We also deem persuasive the fact that Mello, defendants’ neighbor, saw Mr. Pelletier mixing materials and observed steam emanating from the pile of materials. We also note that Pelletier admitted to the building official that some of the compost was shipped off-site in conjunction with his landscaping business, Tiger Tree Landscaping, stating that “[t]he compost goes off site with the plants.”', 'Conversely, defendants’ expert testified that defendants could not be found guilty of violating the zoning ordinance because the compost was not “packaged, shipped, and sold as a product either at wholesale or retail.” However, whether or not defendants were selling their compost for profit is immaterial to our analysis in this case. The zoning ordinance at issue here, Article IV, Section 13(a), entitled “Industrial uses,” is devoid of a requirement that the manufactured products must be “packaged, shipped, and sold for profit.” We need not engage in a lengthy discussion of statutory interpretation, however, because we are of the opinion that the', '- 11 - plain meaning of the terms “manufacturing” and “industrial” do not necessarily involve retail activity. The United States Supreme Court has defined the term “manufacture” as, “transformation—the fashioning of raw materials into a change of form for use. The functions of commerce are different.” Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 299 (1936) (quoting Kidd v. Pearson, 128 U.S. 1, 20 (1936)); see also American Fruit Growers v. Brogdex Co., 283 U.S. 1, 11 (1931) (“Manufacture, as well defined by the Century Dictionary, is ‘the production of articles for use from raw or prepared materials by giving to these materials new forms, qualities, properties, or combinations, whether by hand labor or by machinery’; also ‘anything made for use from raw or prepared materials.’”) Similarly, the term “industrial” has been defined as, “of or pertaining to industry or labor; denoting the processes or products of manufacture or commercial production in general.” In re Ginsburg, 255 F.2d 358, 362 (3rd Cir. 1958) (emphasis added). Neither the term “manufacture” nor the term “industry” has a requisite element of merchandising.', 'It is evident from the record that the trial justice carefully weighed the evidence and passed on the credibility of the witnesses. There is nothing in the record before us to suggest that the trial justice misapplied the law, for which there was no precedent,12 misconceived or overlooked material evidence, or made factual findings that were clearly wrong. See Lamarque, 22 A.3d at 1139-40. Additionally, the trial justice carefully considered the evidence and the credibility of Eames, Lombardo, Lawton, Mello, and Pelletier in making her decision. As this Court has stated, “it is the trial justice who has [had] the opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testify and therefore is in a better position to weigh the evidence and to pass upon the 12', 'The trial justice relied on Clout, Inc. v. Clinton County Zoning Hearing Board, 657 A.2d 111, 114 (Pa. Commw.

Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 903 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Luanglath, 749 A.2d 1, 5-6 (R.I. 2000)). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice was not clearly wrong when she found that defendants violated the zoning ordinance beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'Accessory Use', 'The defendants next contend that processing compost on the property is a permitted accessory use because compost is used in the nursery, which is permitted in an R-80 zone. The Tiverton zoning ordinance defines accessory use as:', '“A use of land or of a building, or portion thereof, customarily', 'incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the land or', 'building, and located on the same lot as the principal use. An', 'accessory use shall not be permitted without the principal use to', 'which it is related.” Article 11C. (3). Although we are satisfied that the incidental use of compost in connection with that which is grown in the nursery is an accessory use under Article IV, Section 3(a), the industrial manufacturing of compost is not allowed under Section 13(a) of the ordinance. “[W]hen the language of a statute or a zoning ordinance is clear and certain, there is nothing left for interpretation and the ordinance must be interpreted literally.” Cohen v. Duncan, 970 A.2d 550, 562 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Mongony, 432 A.2d at 663). The ordinance before us unequivocally states that manufacturing, storing, processing, and fabricating activities are prohibited in an R-80 zone. Although operating a nursery is a permitted accessory use under Section 3(a) of the ordinance, the manufacturing, storing, and processing of compost, an activity in which defendants engaged on a large scale, is explicitly prohibited under the ordinance. Accordingly, we hold that manufacturing compost on the property is not a permitted accessory use.', '- 13 -', 'Constitutional Vagueness', 'The defendants also argue that the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague and therefore should be declared void because it does not contain a definition of the terms “manufacturing” or “compost.” This argument is not properly before the Court because defendants failed to mount a constitutional-vagueness challenge at trial. See In re Shy C., 126 A.3d at 435 (“[A]n issue that has not been raised and articulated previously at trial is not properly preserved for appellate review.” (quoting Gomez, 848 A.2d at 237)). Although defendants did assert that the terms “manufacture” and “compost” are not defined in the ordinance at trial, they did not articulate with any specificity a constitutional vagueness claim. See id.; see also Pona, 66 A.3d at 468.', 'Nonetheless, we pause to note that, even if the defendants’ vagueness argument was properly before the Court, we are satisfied that Section 13(a) of the ordinance is not unduly vague.', 'This Court has held consistently that, when a statute or ordinance is “clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Drs. Pass and Bertherman, Inc. v. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island, 31 A.3d 1263, 1269 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 71 (R.I. 2011)).

Johnston Partners, 866 A.2d 1222, 1224 (R.I. 2005)). Here, we agree with the approach adopted by the trial justice that the ordinance should be construed according to the plain and common sense meaning of the terms “manufacture” and “compost.”', 'Accordingly, we conclude that the ordinance is not void for vagueness and that the defendants’ argument is without merit.', '- 14 -', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

80,In re A.S.,non-criminal,not affirm,"['PER CURIAM. The applicant, A.S. (A.S. or applicant),1 is before the Supreme Court of this state on a petition seeking admission to the Rhode Island Bar (the bar). This Court’s Committee on Character and Fitness (committee) recommended that A.S. be denied admission to the Rhode Island Bar based on the committee’s conclusion that the applicant failed to demonstrate that he was of good moral character and fitness to practice law. Before this Court, the applicant argued that: (1) the committee’s findings were erroneous; (2) the committee erred in concluding that he had failed to satisfy his burden of establishing good moral character and fitness to practice law; and (3) the committee abused its discretion in declining to reconsider its recommendation that applicant be denied admission to the Rhode Island Bar. Oral argument before the Supreme Court was held on June 7, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the applicant to appear and show cause why the recommendation of the committee should not be adopted. For the reasons set forth herein, we adopt the recommendation of the committee. 1', 'Because the Court has not foreclosed applicant from reapplying for admission to the bar, we have elected to refer to applicant by initials in the anticipation that applicant may seek to gain admission to the Rhode Island Bar at some point in the future.', '-1-', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The applicant graduated from Roger Williams University School of Law in 2015.

The application consists of a comprehensive document with relevant attachments that is carefully reviewed by the committee during its consideration of the character and fitness of each person seeking admission to the bar; an applicant is required to answer the questions in a candid and forthright manner consistent with the expected character traits of an officer of the court.', 'In due course and consistent with routine practice, a member of the committee reviewed applicant’s responses to the questions set forth in the application and concluded that several of his answers warranted further explanation. In particular, applicant’s responses to questions regarding academic discipline, identification of court-related matters and litigation, and a reported arrest were of concern to the committee member.', 'At the time applicant made substantive responses to the questionnaire, applicant refused to provide court documents pertaining to two Family Court child custody and support matters in which he was a named party, as well as documents from an arrest that occurred in 2009. The committee member notified applicant that he was required to supplement the application with detailed explanations regarding the Family Court proceedings and the 2009 arrest in addition to submitting the court documents relative to these matters.', 'With respect to the 2009 arrest, applicant submitted an amendment in which he disclaimed any specific recollections of the events surrounding the arrest.

On June 7, 2016, a preliminary hearing was held, during which applicant appeared with counsel.4 At the outset, applicant was informed that it was his burden to establish by clear and convincing evidence that he possessed the requisite character and fitness to practice law in the state of Rhode Island. The committee expressed concern with respect to applicant’s reluctance to produce the court records associated with the Family Court proceedings, his lack of candor, and his failure to explain adequately the circumstances and procedural history of his arrest and subsequent criminal charge. The applicant provided the committee with an explanation of the facts surrounding his arrest at T.F. Green Airport for possession of throwing knives. However, applicant insisted that he could not recall whether he had in his possession one knife or multiple knives, notwithstanding that in his original answer, applicant stated that he was found to be in possession of several knives. 4', 'The applicant’s counsel consisted of his father, who is a member of the bar of this state, and an associate in his father’s law office.', '-4-', 'On July 5, 2016, applicant appeared before the committee for a second hearing. During this hearing, applicant was asked to explain his responses to questions on the application regarding academic discipline.5', 'On September 14, 2016, the committee invited applicant to attend the committee’s upcoming meeting on October 3, 2016.

According to the chairman, he “felt the majority had applied the correct legal standard * * * but that [he] had simply come to a different factual conclusion,” believing instead “that [applicant] would benefit from conditional admission under the supervision of an experienced attorney.” Significantly, and notwithstanding the chairman’s conclusion that applicant should be conditionally admitted to practice law, the chairman “did not believe that [applicant] had established, by clear and convincing evidence, his moral character and fitness.” Notably, the conclusion that applicant failed to sustain his burden of proving that he was of good moral character and fitness to practice law was unanimous.', '-7-', 'Before this Court, applicant argues that he presented clear and convincing evidence of his good moral character and fitness and points to his diligence and success as a student in support of that position. Further, applicant argues that the committee’s findings that he is hostile to authority and that he has “displayed a persistent pattern of resisting authority” are erroneous and should not preclude his admission to the bar. The applicant also disputes the committee’s finding that he “displayed an intentional lack of candor.” Finally, applicant claims that the committee abused its discretion in declining to reopen that proceeding and reconsider its recommendation that applicant be denied admission to the Rhode Island Bar.', 'It is uncontested that applicant’s educational credentials are meritorious. He was a member of the Roger Williams University School of Law Honors Program, President of the Student Bar Association, and active in the community. These accomplishments are commendable. However, this Court has recognized that educational achievements, while “praiseworthy, * * * are largely irrelevant in establishing [an applicant’s] moral fitness and good character to practice as a member of [the Rhode Island Bar].” In re Roots, 762 A.2d at 1166-67. Indeed, “mere intelligence and academic achievement do not necessarily equate to moral fitness and good character, both of which are preconditions to becoming a member of our bar.” Id. at 1167.', 'Moral fitness and good character are judged on the basis of the totality of the circumstances, with particular emphasis placed on the applicant’s honesty, candor, veracity, and demeanor. See In re Vose, 93 A.3d 33, 39-40 (R.I. 2014) (concluding that the evidence of the applicant’s hostility, contempt, and manner of disclosure supported the committee’s finding that the applicant lacked the requisite moral character and fitness to practice law); In re Testa, 489 A.2d 331, 334 (R.I. 1985) (examining the applicant’s integrity and veracity in considering the', '-8- applicant’s requisite moral character and fitness to practice law). These traits are demonstrated through the bar application process, as demonstrated by an applicant’s candor and forthrightness in responding to questions, conscientious attention to any deficiencies in the application, his or her willingness to comply with the necessary prerequisites, including an interview, full disclosures, and response to document requests. See In re Roots, 762 A.2d at 1168 (“safeguard[ing] the administration of justice from those who might subvert it through misrepresentations, falsehoods, or incomplete disclosures when full disclosure is necessary.”) (citing Donald T. Weckstein, Recent Developments in the Character and Fitness Qualifications for the Practice of Law: The Law School Role; The Political Dissident, 40 Bar Exam. 17, 23 (1971)). Thus, while applicant’s academic success is “praiseworthy,” id. at 1166, it was incumbent on applicant to establish his moral fitness and good character by means other than a recitation of his academic achievements.', 'Commendably, the committee conducted an exhaustive investigation of applicant’s character and fitness, which included extensive correspondence about the deficiencies in his application, several hearings, and a review of applicant’s supporting letters of recommendation.8 The committee raised legitimate concerns with respect to three responses applicant provided in his original bar application: (1) applicant’s response to question twenty-seven and his refusal to provide copies of documents relating to child support litigation in the Family Court; (2) applicant’s response to question twenty-eight and his failure to provide records regarding an arrest that was expunged; and (3) applicant’s response to question twenty and an academic penalty consisting of a grade-reduction imposed while applicant was in law school. The 8', 'We note that applicant submitted a plethora of letters of recommendation filed after the committee issued its decision. These letters were provided to the members of the committee in advance of its decision declining to reconsider its recommendation to this Court.', '-9- committee found applicant to be reticent, and even hostile, in responding to requests for information, and found that he displayed an attitude that was disdainful of the committee’s authority and responsibility. We agree with these findings and the conclusions made by the committee.', 'Moreover, applicant failed to come forward with the documents requested by the committee—documents that are relevant and critical to the assessment of an applicant’s character and fitness. His reasoning in support of his refusal to provide such documents as the Family Court complaints and his answers likewise is troubling. At the June 7, 2016, hearing, applicant explained that he declined to provide the documents relating to his Family Court proceedings because “[he] didn’t think it was * * * anyone’s [sic] business * * *.” The applicant expressed his belief that the request for those documents “was out of line, to say the least.” The applicant claimed that he was concerned with the confidential nature of the documents and that he wanted to avoid violating the privacy of his son’s mother. However, instead of promptly providing a redacted copy of the requested material or seeking to file the material under seal, he simply failed to produce the documents for a significant period of time.9', 'The applicant demonstrated hostility toward the committee, consistently expressing his disdain for the application process on more than one occasion.10 Although applicant contends 9', 'We pause to note that the records A.S. refused to produce consisted of a Family Court Complaint for child support filed by the state of Rhode Island on behalf of the child’s mother and a pro se motion seeking to substitute the applicant’s health insurance policy in lieu of monetary payments for health insurance. 10', 'Applicant’s response to an inquiry from a committee member as to why applicant failed to provide Family Court records is indicative of his distressing lack of respect for the application process:', '“[A.S.]: I understand that, but as far as, because you really want it,', 'the choice wasn’t because you really want it. It was, you do it, or', '- 10 - that he presented clear and convincing evidence of his good moral character, the record demonstrates that he was argumentative and defensive in his appearance before the committee on June 7, 2016. For example, applicant set forth in his answer to question twenty-seven: “I have no intention of attaching the complaint or any other document relating to my son’s mother.” When a committee member raised applicant’s response as a significant concern and read applicant’s response aloud to him, in lieu of any explanation, applicant declared, “[t]hat’s absolutely correct.” In addition, at the July 5, 2016, hearing, applicant expressed his opinion about the application process, which he described as “invasive, unlawful * * * [and] the process that I see as not right, either morally or lawfully * * *.” (Emphasis added.) Additionally, at the June 7, 2016, hearing, applicant declared:', '“As compared to Massachusetts, what I had to go through, or I', 'should say what I didn’t have to go through, it’s very different, in a', 'good way, in their state. I wish it was more like that here, although', 'I understand there are probably plenty of reasons why we are', 'different * * *.” The applicant’s failure to appreciate his burden of proving his fitness and good moral character is further buttressed by the fact that he returned to Family Court in order to obtain a routine modification of the Order mandating health coverage before he complied with the committee’s repeated requests to produce the documents.', 'Finally, the record before us evinces a lack of candor on the part of the applicant. Although he truthfully disclosed the fact of his arrest and the Family Court litigation, applicant', 'you don’t get to become a lawyer. So, I didn’t really have much of', 'a choice.', '“But I can assure you—obviously, you can choose to', 'believe me or not—but no, my stance was not, no, because I said', 'so, I don’t want to give it to you. If that was the case, I would have', 'done that for a lot more questions, a lot more, like my credit report,', 'and countless other things, but I didn’t.”', '- 11 - failed to provide the factual details or court files surrounding those events. Indeed, with respect to the arrest, applicant referred the committee to his attorney should the committee desire any further information about that incident. As to the Family Court litigation, applicant flatly refused to produce any records and characterized one case as a custody matter. This response was not accurate. The Family Court Complaint was brought by the state seeking child support for the child whose mother may have been receiving public assistance, and did not relate to child custody.', 'The transcript from the June 7, 2016, hearing reflects the concern of a committee member about applicant’s “failure at the outset to be forthcoming with respect to the facts about [the arrest],” to which concern applicant responded that his failure to provide a detailed explanation was because “[his] attorney told [him] not to.” However, documents to clarify this incident ultimately were located in storage at his father’s office and could have been provided had there been a good-faith effort to comply with the committee’s request. There was no evidence suggesting that applicant made any effort to locate the file in a timely manner. The applicant’s failure to respond in a timely and forthright manner also demonstrates a lack of respect for the committee’s process. Furthermore, the delay in producing the Family Court records—several months after his interview with the committee member responsible for scrutinizing his application—is telling. Rather than produce materials when requested, the record discloses that applicant first returned to Family Court, pro se, in order to substitute his employer-provided medical insurance for his son.', 'After reviewing the transcripts from the hearings, as well as applicant’s responses to the committee’s requests for documents, we are of the opinion that the findings of the committee are supported by the record and are not erroneous. Therefore, the Court accepts the findings of the', '- 12 - committee. It is apparent to this Court that applicant has demonstrated a lack of insight into the importance of the bar application process and the significance of the mandate that it is an applicant who bears the burden of demonstrating good moral character and fitness to practice law. Additionally, we are satisfied that the committee did not abuse its discretion in declining to reconsider its recommendation that applicant be denied admission. During argument it was revealed that each committee member was in possession of all of the material submitted by the applicant, including the numerous letters of support. The committee declined to take up the motion to reconsider. There is no procedural rule providing for reconsideration, nor is there any suggestion that the facts relied upon by the committee were erroneous.', 'Accordingly, we conclude that applicant has not satisfied his burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, his fitness to practice law in this state.', 'However, the Court also is satisfied that applicant should not forfeit an opportunity to seek admission to the bar of this state in the future. We reach this conclusion based on his statements before this Court in which he acknowledged that he was responsible for the position in which he found himself; and that his “misguided decisions during the bar application process” meant that he was unable to serve people who needed legal representation. The applicant also recognized the time this Court has expended on this matter because he “was too thickheaded to handle the bar application process properly.” We agree with these remarks and are impressed by his humility. We do not seek to dissuade applicant from reapplying for admission to the bar of this state at some later date.', 'We are mindful that applicant is a member of the Massachusetts Bar and is authorized to practice law in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. We deem it prudent, however, to remind the applicant that he is not authorized to practice law in this state for any client with any matter.', '- 13 - See G.L. 1956 § 11-27-5; see also Article V, Rule 5.5 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, the applicant’s petition for admission to the bar of this state is denied. This decision shall not preclude the applicant from reapplying for admission to the bar at some later time by filing a written request for consideration with the committee. The written request for consideration shall be filed no sooner than two years from the date of the oral argument on June 7, 2017, and shall include an updated response to the Petition/Questionnaire for Admission to the Rhode Island Bar, and a sworn affidavit that the application has complied with the Court’s admonishments in this opinion. The applicant shall detail with particularity his activities and employment during the intervening period, including any public service or volunteer work the applicant has performed. If the applicant reapplies for admission to the bar within three years from June 7, 2017, he shall not be required to retake the bar examination.', 'Justice Indeglia, with whom Justice Flaherty joins, dissenting. With all due respect to the members of the committee on Character and Fitness (the committee), as well as our colleagues on the Court, we cannot accept the recommendation that A.S. (the applicant) be denied admission to the Rhode Island bar at this time. Rather, we agree with the two committee members who instead suggested that the applicant be conditionally admitted pursuant to Article II, Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules of Admission of Attorneys and Others to Practice Law. As one of those members wrote to this Court, “[the applicant] would benefit from conditional admission under the supervision of an experienced attorney * * * other than his father or another member of his firm.” Conditional admission would give the applicant the opportunity to address', '- 14 - and adjust the aspects of his character that were of concern to the committee and, should the committee have reason to believe that he breached any of the conditions, it would have the authority to petition this Court “for an order to show cause why the conditional license should not be immediately terminated.” Rule 3(o)(1).

81,"v. : David Quinn, in his capacity as Tax Assessor : of the City of Providence, Rhode Island.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. It is said that the only things of which we can be certain are death and taxes,1 neither one of which is embraced with great enthusiasm. But whereas the former is an immutable law of nature, the latter is most decidedly a human creation. Although most persons accept the necessity of paying taxes, no one relishes paying more than his or her fair share, much less paying taxes for which he or she has been erroneously assessed. Such is the situation in which the plaintiff, Lehigh Cement Co. (Lehigh or plaintiff) finds itself. Lehigh filed suit against the City of Providence (the city), seeking to recover approximately $500,000 in real-estate taxes billed and collected by the city from 2006 to 2009. The matter presently before us is Lehigh’s appeal from a Superior Court judgment, granting the city’s motion for summary judgment. This case came before the Supreme Court, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing 1', 'The reference of death and taxes is generally attributed to Benjamin Franklin, who wrote in a 1789 letter to Jean-Baptiste Leroy: “Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency, but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” In 1716, however, Christopher Bullock wrote in his play, The Cobbler of Preston, “’Tis impossible to be sure of any thing but Death and Taxes.”', '-1- the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On December 21, 2012, Lehigh filed a civil action for money damages against the city for having imposed an excessive and illegal tax. The complaint set forth the following facts.2', 'In 2002, Lehigh leased 3.65 acres of land at the Port of Providence from ProvPort, a non- profit, tax-exempt, public-private partnership that owns the Port. The city, however, taxed Lehigh on 16.8 acres of land rather than the 3.65 acres it was actually leasing. The error was not apparent from the tax bills and, consequently, Lehigh paid the bills in full. In total, Lehigh paid nearly $500,000 in taxes attributable to property it neither owned nor leased. When it became aware of the error in 2010, Lehigh brought it to the tax assessor’s attention, and the city corrected its records going forward. Lehigh met with the tax assessor on December 15, 2010, at which time the tax assessor represented that he would review the matter and, if an error had occurred, he would rectify it by giving Lehigh tax credits it could use against future bills. Subsequently, Lehigh engaged in additional communications with the city in the course of which the city assured Lehigh that it was aware of the problem and was working on it.3', 'Lehigh’s complaint sought the following relief: (count 1) that pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 44- 5-23, the assessor must correct the erroneous assessment for tax years 2006-2009 by issuing both corrected assessments to Lehigh and an appropriate refund; (count 2) that pursuant to the fair- 2', 'As Lehigh appeals from the granting of the city’s motion for summary judgment, we view the facts in the light most favorable to Lehigh. 3', 'Lehigh’s memorandum in support of its objection to the city’s motion for summary judgment included the affidavits of a licensed real-estate appraiser and Lehigh’s land manager. Both affiants swore to different instances of assurances made by the city that it was working on Lehigh’s assessment issue and that a credit might be issued in lieu of a refund.', '-2- distribution clause under article 1, section 2 of the Rhode Island Constitution, Lehigh is entitled to a refund of the taxes paid in excess because “[the city] failed to fairly distribute the burden of its property tax on Lehigh”; and (count 3) that pursuant to § 44-5-27, Lehigh is entitled to the return of the illegal tax imposed during 2006-2009.', 'On July 5, 2013, the city filed an amended answer to the complaint. Thereafter, the city filed a motion for summary judgment, to which Lehigh objected. A hearing was held on the city’s motion for summary judgment on January 7, 2016; and on January 14, 2016, the hearing justice issued a written decision, granting the city’s motion.', 'Regarding Lehigh’s claim under § 44-5-27, the hearing justice found that Lehigh “offer[ed] no support for its conclusory allegation that it was assessed an illegal tax.” The hearing justice also determined that Lehigh’s § 44-5-27 claim was untimely regardless of when Lehigh discovered the error; and he declined to apply the doctrine of equitable tolling because “Lehigh ha[d] not provided evidence that circumstances beyond its control prevented it from filing a complaint.” Concerning Lehigh’s claim under § 44-5-23, the hearing justice declared that “it does not appear that § 44-5-23 creates a private cause of action” nor does it permit taxpayers “to collect a refund for the taxes it paid in excess of the amount it owed.” Finally, in regard to Lehigh’s claim under the fair-distribution clause, the hearing justice determined that he “need not address Lehigh’s argument” because “Lehigh has not alleged any facts—other than a bare assertion—sufficient to support its argument that it was assessed an illegal tax * * *.”', 'On February 4, 2016, the hearing justice entered an order and judgment in favor of the city, from which Lehigh timely appealed.', '-3-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, ‘employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.’” Newstone Development, LLC v.

Fluette, 64 A.3d 302, 304 (R.I. 2013)). “We will affirm a [trial] court’s decision only if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id. (quoting Daniels, 64 A.3d at 304). Furthermore, “the nonmoving party bears the burden of proving by competent evidence the existence of a disputed issue of material fact and cannot rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.” Id. (quoting Daniels, 64 A.3d at 304). “[S]ummary judgment should enter ‘against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party’s case * * *.’” Id.

In particular, the city erroneously billed Lehigh as if it', 'were leasing 16.8 acres of land from ProvPort, when in fact it only', 'leased 3.65 acres. Pursuant to R.I. Gen. Laws § 44-5-23, the', 'Assessor must correct these errors by issuing corrected', 'assessments to Lehigh and issuing an appropriate refund.”', 'Lehigh asserts that § 44-5-23 permits a private right of action entitling it to relief “either in the form of a refund or in the form of corrective adjustments to future tax bills.” The city demurs, claiming that the only relief available to a taxpayer aggrieved by an assessment of taxes is the administrative process set forth in § 44-5-26.', 'The resolution of this question is a matter of statutory construction.', '“[W]hen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1226 (R.I. 1996). This Court “presume[s] that the Legislature intended every word, sentence, or provision to serve some purpose and have some force and effect, * * * but [the Court] will not interpret a statute in a manner that would defeat the underlying purpose of the enactment.” Pier House Inn, Inc. v. 421 Corp., Inc., 812 A.2d 799, 804 (R.I. 2002).', 'Therefore, when interpreting a legislative enactment, this Court must “determine and effectuate the Legislature’s intent and to attribute to the enactment the meaning', '-5- most consistent with its policies or obvious purposes.” Brennan v. Kirby, 529 A.2d 633, 637 (R.I. 1987).', 'Section 44-5-23 provides in pertinent part:', '“If any real estate liable to taxation in any city or town has been omitted in', 'the assessment of any year or years and has thereby escaped taxation, or if any tax', 'has been erroneously or illegally assessed upon any real estate liable to taxation in', 'any city or town in any year or years, and because of the erroneous or illegal', 'assessment the tax cannot be collected, or if paid has been recovered, the assessor', 'of taxes of the city or town in the next annual assessment of taxes after the', 'omission or erroneous or illegal assessment is known to him or her shall assess or', 'reassess, as the case may be, a tax or taxes against the person or persons who were', 'the owner or owners of the real estate in the year or years, to the same amount to', 'which the real estate ought to have been assessed in the year or years.

The taxes for which Lehigh seeks a “corrected assessment” and “appropriate refund” do not constitute taxes “omitted in the assessment of any year or years” and thereby escaped taxation for the purposes of § 44-5-23. Additionally, Lehigh alleges that the taxes were erroneously or illegally assessed. This latter category, however, is further qualified by language limiting the application of the statute to situations where “because of the erroneous or illegal assessment the tax cannot be collected, or if paid has been recovered[.]” Id. Here, the taxes at issue have in fact been paid but not recovered. Indeed, that is the very purpose of Lehigh’s lawsuit. Further, the remedy provided in § 44-5-23 permits the assessor to reassess the real estate to “the same amount to which the real estate ought to have been assessed” in addition to any assessment “for the then current year.” Thus, § 44-5-23 provides municipalities with a six-', '-6- year look-back period in which to assess or reassess real estate that may have escaped taxation. It does not provide relief to a taxpayer. Therefore, we affirm the judgement as to count 1.', 'B', 'The Fair-Distribution Clause', 'Lehigh argues that summary judgment on its claim under article 1, section 2 of the Rhode Island Constitution, the fair-distribution clause, was inappropriate.', 'Count 2 of Lehigh’s complaint alleged, “[d]uring the years 2006-09, the [c]ity did not distribute the burden of its property tax fairly among its residents” because it “taxed Lehigh on 13.15 acres of land that it neither owned nor leased, and it failed to tax whoever was responsible for paying the property tax on that 13.15 acres.”', 'Article 1, section 2 of the Rhode Island Constitution provides, in relevant part:', '“All free governments are instituted for the protection, safety and', 'happiness of the people. All laws, therefore, should be made for', 'the good of the whole; and the burdens of the state ought to be', 'fairly distributed among its citizens.”', 'As early as 1856, this Court recognized the precatory nature of this constitutional provision, explaining that the fair-distribution clause enunciated principles directed to the legislature rather than establishing limitations upon its powers. See In re Dorrance Street, 4 R.I. 230, 249 (1856). In In re Dorrance Street, Chief Justice Ames, writing for the Court observed:', '“We will not stop to notice the very general language and', 'declaratory form of this clause; setting forth principles of', 'legislation rather than rules of constitutional law—addressed rather', 'to the general assembly by way of advice and direction, than to the', 'courts, by way of enforcing restraint upon the law-making power.', 'We do not mean to say that a law, purporting to impose a tax or', 'burden of some sort upon the citizen, may not be in its distribution', 'of the burden, both in design and effect, so outrageously', 'subversive of all the rules of fairness, as not to come so far within', 'the purview of this general clause, as to enable the court to save the', 'citizen from oppression by declaring it to be void. But evidently a', 'wide discretion with regard to the distribution of the burdens of', '-7-', 'state amongst the citizens was intended to be reposed in the', 'general assembly by the will of the people, as signified in this', 'clause of the constitution. The form is ‘Ought to be,’ the word is', '‘fairly’ distributed, not ‘equally’ even—unless equality be fair,', 'which it is not always in any sense, and never is in some senses', '* * *.” In re Dorrance Sreet, 4 R.I. at 249. See also Kalian v. Langton, 96 R.I. 367, 372, 192 A.2d 12, 15 (1963) (“[T]he language employed by the people in art. I, § 2, was by way of advice and direction to the lawmaking power rather than to the courts by way of restraining such power.”).', 'More recently, in Picerne v. DiPrete, 428 A.2d 1074, 1078 (R.I. 1981), this Court held that the trial justice ruled correctly in finding that a municipality’s assessments were arbitrary and discriminatory and violative of the fair-distribution clause of the Rhode Island Constitution. This Court concluded that legally competent evidence existed in the record to support the trial justice’s conclusions that the revaluations of the plaintiffs’ properties were intentionally selective and patently discriminatory.', 'Here, although the erroneous or illegal assessment at issue is substantial ($500,000), Lehigh does not allege discriminatory or fraudulent intent. Nor can the assessments be said to be “so outrageously subversive as to offend notions of fairness.” See In re Dorrance Sreet, 4 R.I. at 249. Indeed, the tax bills were apparently not so outrageous as to raise any red flags causing Lehigh to question them before 2010. Based upon our de novo review, we are of the opinion that Lehigh’s claim under the Rhode Island Constitution is unavailing.', 'C', 'Section 44-5-27', 'Lehigh’s final contention on appeal is that the hearing justice erred in granting summary judgment on its claim under § 44-5-27, which provides in its entirety:', '-8-', '“The remedy provided in § 44-5-26 is exclusive if the taxpayer owned or', 'possessed any ratable estate at all, except that, in a proper case, the taxpayer may', 'invoke the equity jurisdiction of the [S]uperior [C]ourt; provided, that the', 'complaint is filed within three (3) months after the last day appointed for the', 'payment, without penalty, of the tax, or the first installment of the tax, if it is', 'payable in installments. A taxpayer alleging an illegal or void tax assessment', 'against him or her is confined to the remedies provided by § 44-5-26, except that', 'the taxpayer is not required to file an appeal with the local assessor.”', '“This Court frequently has emphasized that ‘the taxing statutes provide the exclusive relief to any person aggrieved by any assessment of taxes against him by any city or town.’” Narragansett Electric Co. v. Minardi, 21 A.3d 274, 278 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Murray v. Rockaway Boulevard Wrecking & Lumber Co., 108 R.I. 607, 609, 277 A.2d 922, 924 (1971)). Section 44-5-26(a) provides an administrative appeal process to “[a]ny person aggrieved on any ground whatsoever by any assessment of taxes against him or her * * *.” Appeals are to the local office of tax assessment in the first instance; and then, if still aggrieved, the taxpayer may appeal to the local tax board of review. Section 44-5-27 provides that the remedy set forth in § 44-5-26 is exclusive “except that, in a proper case, the taxpayer may invoke the equity jurisdiction of the [S]uperior [C]ourt.” This Court has also explained that “a taxpayer alleging an illegal tax may proceed directly to the Superior Court.” Narragansett Electric Co., 21 A.3d at 278.', 'The ability of a taxpayer to file a suit in equity directly in the Superior Court, however, is sharply circumscribed by a brief limitations period. A complaint must be filed “within three (3) months after the last day appointed for the payment, without penalty, of the tax, or the first installment of the tax, if it is payable in installments.” Section 44-5-27. It is undisputed that Lehigh did not meet this deadline for any one of the years for which it is seeking a refund.', 'Lehigh seeks to slay this procedural Goliath by invoking the discovery rule and the doctrine of equitable tolling. “[T]he heart of the discovery rule is that the statute of limitations', '-9- does not begin to run until the plaintiff ‘discovers, or with reasonable diligence should have discovered, the wrongful conduct of the [defendant].’” Mills v. Toselli, 819 A.2d 202, 205 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Supreme Bakery, Inc. v. Bagley, 742 A.2d 1202, 1204 (R.I. 2000)). Whether or not a plaintiff acts with reasonable diligence generally presents a factual inquiry not amenable to summary judgment.', 'We have serious concerns, however, about the applicability of the discovery rule in the circumstances of Lehigh’s complaint, which seeks the return of an allegedly illegal tax. The General Assembly has carefully crafted chapter 5 of title 44, entitled “Levy and Assessment of Local Taxes,” to provide for the financial support of Rhode Island’s cities and towns. We have previously made clear “the importance that the assessment process plays in the fiscal operation of the various municipalities located in this state.” Northgate Associates v. Shorey, 541 A.2d 1192, 1193 (R.I. 1988). Specifically, we have noted:', '“Real property taxation provides a significant source of municipal', 'revenues, and departmental appropriations are necessarily', 'dependent on the funds available. The share that each taxpayer', 'must contribute to support and sustain municipal services varies', 'with the assessment placed on his, her, or its property. Thus, both', 'the taxpayer and the municipality have an obvious interest in the', 'amount and accuracy of the individual assessments. The', 'municipality has an additional concern that disputes relative to an', 'assessment be resolved as expeditiously as possible so that the tax', 'roll may be finalized and the tax rate established. This concern has', 'been shared with the Legislature. When enacting § 44-5-27, the', 'General Assembly emphasized that a taxpayer’s complaint is to be', 'filed in the Superior Court ‘within three (3) months after the last', 'day appointed for the payment’ of such tax without penalty.', '“* * *', '“It is obvious that the Legislature, in enacting § 44-5-27,', 'recognized the necessity for finality in assessment disputes when it', 'stated that the taxpayer’s complaint was to be filed within three', 'months of the last day specified for payment without a penalty of', 'such tax.” Id.', '- 10 -', 'Even assuming without deciding, however, that the discovery rule has vitality in the context of a suit filed under § 44-5-27, it is not sufficient to save Lehigh’s claim.', 'It is indisputable that Lehigh became aware of the erroneous assessment in 2010, yet did not file its complaint until 2012, well beyond the limitations period set forth in the statute. It seeks, therefore, to employ another equitable concept—the doctrine of equitable tolling—to breathe new life into its moribund claim.', 'This Court has observed that “equitable tolling is an exception to the general statute of limitations based upon principles of equity and fairness * * *.” Johnson v. Newport County Chapter for Retarded Citizens, Inc., 799 A.2d 289, 292 (R.I. 2002). In support of its argument, Lehigh relies upon Rivera v. Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 70 A.3d 905 (R.I. 2013). There, a police officer missed the thirty-day statutory period for seeking judicial review of the denial of her application for accidental disability benefits, which period “beg[an] to run the day after the notice [of the decision was] mailed.” Id. at 911. After “bearing in mind all of the circumstances before us,” we held that petitioner’s appeal was timely pursuant to the doctrine of equitable tolling. We said:', '“Significantly, however, two explicit statements by the board (one', 'on the record at the conclusion of the final full hearing and one', 'contained within the notice of the final decision that was sent to', 'petitioner and her attorney) provided incorrect information to the', 'effect that the deadline for seeking judicial review was thirty days', 'from the receipt of the notice of the final decision. It is noteworthy', 'that [petitioner’s] appeal was indeed filed within thirty days of her', 'receipt of that notice of the final decision.” Rivera, 70 A.3d at 913.', 'The representations upon which Lehigh claims it relied are readily distinguishable from the two “authoritative misstatements” underlying our opinion in Rivera, 70 A.3d at 913. In the case at bar, Lehigh presents two affidavits in support of its objection to the city’s motion for', '- 11 - summary judgment. A licensed real-estate appraiser hired by Lehigh averred that he had met with the tax assessor and “discussed Lehigh receiving a go forward credit in lieu of a refund on the overbilling. [He] made several attempts with the [c]ity to follow up on this. Each time [he] was told that the [c]ity was working on the problem, or words to that effect.”', 'The second affidavit was by the land manager for Lehigh. He stated that on December 15, 2010, he met with the tax assessor, who said that “once he confirmed that Lehigh had been taxed on land it wasn’t leasing, he would correct the problem by giving Lehigh tax credits it could use against future tax bills.” The land manager further swore that “in reliance on [the tax assessor’s] representation, Lehigh did not immediately take legal action to recover its money, but instead assumed that the [c]ity would verify and correct the problem.” He also states that representatives of Lehigh “made many attempts to ensure that the [c]ity was following through on [the tax assessor’s] commitment to correct our problem” and reported that “when they were able to speak with someone, they were repeatedly told that the [c]ity was aware of Lehigh’s tax problem and was working on it.” The land manager provided four such instances: (1) in early 2011, a representative of Lehigh telephoned the recently-named acting tax assessor who indicated she “had been busy with her new role”; (2) on November 17, 2011, a representative contacted a lawyer for the city, “who indicated he would check into it and get back”; (3) in early February 2012, a Lehigh representative spoke with the tax assessor, who said he was aware of the problem and was “willing to correct it, but that he would need time because he had recently been named the new [a]ssessor and was busy with his new role”; (4) in August 2012, a representative spoke with the tax assessor, who confirmed that he was “familiar with the problem, but said that he had not taken any action to correct it.”', '- 12 -', 'These “representations” by the city over a two-year period essentially amount to little more than general statements that it was aware of the problem and working on it. Consequently, we are of the opinion that they are not sufficient to demonstrate that any reliance Lehigh might have had on receiving a refund or credit was reasonable. We conclude that the facts before us are insufficient to toll the three-month limitations period, particularly in light of the General Assembly’s carefully crafted statutory scheme to provide for the financial sustenance of Rhode Island’s cities and towns. We affirm, therefore, the grant of summary judgment in favor of the city on count 3 of the plaintiff’s complaint.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The plaintiff, Michelle Hall, appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court granting the motion for summary judgment of the defendants, Colleen Belmonte and Kim Hornby. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral arguments, and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument.', 'The primary issue presented on appeal is straightforward: whether G.L. 1956 § 10-6-2—which provides, in pertinent part, “that a master and servant or principal and agent shall be considered a single tortfeasor”—means that the release of the master from liability also releases the servant. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that it does and therefore affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The salient facts in this case are not disputed. In March 2015, plaintiff brought suit against Tavares Pediatric Center, Inc. on behalf of herself and her daughter, alleging that her daughter suffered serious injuries while in Tavares’s care. The complaint consisted of two counts: one alleging negligence, and a second alleging loss of consortium. Shortly thereafter, plaintiff and Tavares settled and the litigation was dismissed. As part of the settlement, plaintiff executed a Joint Tortfeasor Release, which released Tavares, its insurer, and others from claims arising from the medical treatment of plaintiff’s daughter. However, the terms of the Joint Tortfeasor Release specifically exempted “the agents, employees, representatives, and/or medical staff of Tavares * * *.” Indeed, plaintiff also “reserve[d] the right to make a claim against every other person, firm or corporation, including, without limitation, Colleen Belmonte[,] and * * * the right to make claim that Colleen Belmonte and not the Releasees are solely liable for alleged injuries, losses and damages.”', 'It is undisputed that, while she was in the care of Tavares, plaintiff’s daughter was treated by two nurses, Colleen Belmonte and Kim Hornby. After settling with Tavares and executing the Joint Tortfeasor Release, plaintiff brought a second suit against nurses Belmonte and Hornby. In a complaint nearly identical to the one that she had brought against Tavares, plaintiff again asserted two counts: one for negligence and a second for loss of consortium. Following some limited discovery, Belmonte and Hornby moved for summary judgment.', '-2-', 'In their motion, defendants argued that plaintiff’s claims were barred because of the language set forth in § 10-6-2. 1 Citing the language of the statute, defendants maintained that, because they and Tavares stood in a master-servant relationship, they “shall be considered a single tortfeasor.” It follows, defendants argued, that plaintiff’s release of Tavares from liability required that they, too, were released from liability. The trial justice agreed, finding that § 10-6- 2 barred plaintiff’s claims, and he therefore granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that when we review the grant of a party’s motion for summary judgment, we do so de novo. Van Hoesen v.

(quoting D’Amico, 866 A.2d at 1224).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, plaintiff advances three arguments. The plaintiff first maintains that § 10-6-2 does not bar her claims against defendants. Second, plaintiff argues that an affidavit submitted by her attorney—averring that plaintiff’s initial complaint against Tavares alleged that Tavares was independently liable for her daughter’s injuries—raises a genuine issue of material fact, rendering summary judgment inappropriate. Finally, notwithstanding the language of § 10- 6-2, plaintiff, relying on the language in the release, maintains that she preserved her claims against defendants.', 'At the outset, we note that this Court has previously declared that “[t]he language of § 10-6-2 is clear and unequivocal: ‘a master and servant or principal and agent shall be considered a single tortfeasor.’” DelSanto v. Hyundai Motor Finance Co., 882 A.2d 561, 566 (R.I. 2005) (quoting § 10-6-2). We are therefore bound to “give the words of the statute their', '-4- plain and ordinary meanings.” GSM Industrial, Inc., 47 A.3d at 268 (quoting D’Amico, 866 A.2d at 1224).', 'We turn our focus to § 10-6-2’s concluding clause, the requirement “that a master and servant * * * shall be considered a single tortfeasor,” and we can reach no other conclusion than that the release of one—either the master or the servant—results in the release of both. Here, pursuant to the pellucid language of § 10-6-2, Tavares, as master, and defendants, as servants, are a single tortfeasor. Consequently, plaintiff’s release of Tavares resulted in the release of defendants. The simple, direct, and unambiguous language of the statute forecloses plaintiff’s claims.', 'In an effort to limit the application of this clear statutory language, plaintiff argues that this Court has recognized a distinction as to the type of liability that is extinguished when an injured party releases a liable party. As plaintiff correctly points out, generally, when an injured party releases a tortfeasor-servant, it follows that the master is also released because the sole liability that flowed to the master is vicarious, imposed by a legal fiction based only on the servant’s tortious conduct. See Pridemore v. Napolitano, 689 A.2d 1053, 1056 (R.I. 1997). But, plaintiff posits, the converse situation is present here.', 'She contends that the release of a vicariously liable master has no effect on the liability of the tortfeasor-servant. In other words, plaintiff argues that there remains a liability that lingers with the tortfeasor-servant, a liability that is not extinguished by the release of the master. Because that lingering liability is actual and not derivative, plaintiff reasons that, under § 10-6-2, the release of the master does not result in the release of the servant.', 'Certainly, there are distinctions between the types of liability that may be present when fault is alleged against multiple parties.', 'See DelSanto, 882 A.2d at 566 (discussing the', '-5- difference between vicarious liability and joint and several liability). Significantly, however, § 10-6-2 makes no such distinction.', 'Its language is stark and unforgiving: Tavares and defendants “shall be considered a single tortfeasor.” We are therefore constrained to apply its plain and ordinary meaning, irrespective of the type of liability at issue. 2', 'Because we hold that § 10-6-2 forecloses the plaintiff’s claims in this case, we need not address whether the affidavit submitted by the plaintiff’s attorney raised a genuine issue of material fact. Our holding also disposes of the plaintiff’s argument that she preserved her claims against the members of Tavares’s medical staff pursuant to the Joint Tortfeasor Release. The language set forth in the Joint Tortfeasor Release purporting to preserve the plaintiff’s claims against the defendants cannot override the statute’s crystal-clear mandate that Tavares and the defendants, as master and servants, “shall be considered a single tortfeasor.” See Woonsocket Teachers’ Guild, Local 951, AFT v. Woonsocket School Committee, 770 A.2d 834, 838 (R.I. 2001) (stating that “applicable state * * * law trumps contrary contract provisions” (quoting State v. Rhode Island Alliance of Social Services Employees, Local 580, 747 A.2d 465, 469 (R.I. 2000)).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record shall be remanded to that court. 2', 'The complaint against Tavares set forth no basis of independent liability against the master, such as negligent hiring or failure to properly train.

On appeal, the defendant contends that the hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in adjudicating him to be a probation violator because, in defendant’s view, the record in this case does not substantiate the finding that he failed to keep the peace or remain on good behavior when he made certain statements in the course of telephone calls from the prison, where he had been detained prior to the probation-violation hearing. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.

Thereafter, on September 22, 2015, the state filed a second probation-violation report, alleging that defendant had been charged with obstruction of the judicial system while making certain phone calls from the ACI between September 6 and September 10, 2015 and further alleging that that conduct constituted a violation of the terms and conditions of his probationary sentence.1 The defendant was presented as a probation violator in the Superior Court; and, on September 30 and October 1, 2015, the hearing justice conducted a combined probation-violation and bail hearing, at the conclusion of which she adjudged defendant to be a violator and ordered him to serve six of the seven years of his suspended sentence.', 'In order to address defendant’s contentions on appeal, it is necessary to consider the contents of certain phone calls that he made from the ACI, which formed the focus of the hearing 1', 'The criminal complaint charging defendant with murder was dismissed on January 11, 2016, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-13-6, and the charge for obstruction of the judicial system was dismissed on September 7, 2016, pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.

I’m capable of killing someone.’” Ms. Suon also testified that she had previously provided all of this information to the police over the course of several interviews within three days of defendant’s arrest for the murder of Mr. A’Vant.', 'D', 'The Hearing Justice’s Decision', 'The hearing justice acknowledged that Ms. Suon was the mother of defendant’s young child and also acknowledged that the transcript of defendant’s telephone calls included several statements in which he expressed a desire to see his son. Nonetheless, the hearing justice found that defendant had made those phone calls from the ACI with the intent to influence or have others influence the behavior and statements of a witness.5 In so holding, the hearing justice observed that Ms. Suon was a “highly credible” witness, and she concluded that defendant’s purported motivation for trying to have others contact Ms. Suon—his desire to see his son—was not persuasive. The hearing justice rejected defendant’s argument that the purpose of the phone calls was to encourage Ms. Suon to bring their child to the ACI for a visit, stating:', '“This argument makes no sense in light of the substance of the', 'phone calls, that would be the totality of the phone calls. Although', 'the Court recognizes that statements on the tape include, ‘I’ve 5', 'Because the hearing justice found defendant to be a violator based on the charge of obstruction of justice, she declined to address the possible probation consequences stemming from the murder charge, stating: “There is no need to address the second violation since the [c]ourt has just ruled. It is entirely appropriate for a judge to decline to pass on legal issues that are not pertinent to his or her discretion. * * * For this reason and for judicial economy, the [c]ourt will decline to reach a decision on the violation relative to the homicide.”', '-7-', 'never been away from my son this long,’ the tape also includes', 'statements such as, ‘You need to convince her to see me alone.’', 'The tapes do not depict to this Court a loving father desiring to', 'visit with the child. The contrary.”6', 'The hearing justice found that defendant’s phone calls, taken in their totality, constituted “the worst type of behavior.” She considered the placing of those calls to be “an attempt to influence or have influenced this witness, Rithy.” She thus concluded that defendant’s conduct constituted a “failure to keep the peace and be of good behavior;” she stated:', '“This defendant agreed to keep the peace and be of good behavior,', 'and I’m reasonably satisfied that he did not do so. And it’s alleged', 'that - - rather than let our justice system unfold, it’s alleged that he', 'chose to quiet a witness. That’s the allegation.” Having found defendant to be a violator, the hearing justice ordered him to serve six of the seven years of his suspended sentence.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Finding of Probation Violation', 'At a probation-violation hearing, the state bears the burden of proving, to the “reasonable satisfaction” of the hearing justice, that defendant breached a condition of his probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior. State v. Sylvia, 871 A.2d 954, 957 (R.I. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is a basic principle that “the sole purpose of a probation violation hearing is for the trial justice to determine whether the conditions of probation—[k]eeping the peace and remaining on good behavior—have been violated.” State v. 6', 'In his 12A statement before this Court, defendant challenges the accuracy of the hearing justice’s comment that defendant asked to see Ms. Suon “alone.” In our view, this fact is not material to the disposition of this appeal because the hearing justice expressly noted that her decision was based on the “totality of the phone calls.”', '-8- Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 499 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). In determining whether or not a defendant has violated a condition of his probation, the hearing justice is called upon to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses. See State v. Washington, 42 A.3d 1265, 1271 (R.I. 2012); State v. Gauthier, 15 A.3d 1004, 1007 (R.I. 2011). And we are ever mindful that “[a]ssessing the credibility of a witness in a probation violation hearing is a function of the hearing justice, not this Court.” State v. Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d 45, 49 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). The deference that we accord to the credibility assessments of the nisi prius court at a probation violation hearing “is premised upon our realization that we lack the same vantage point as the presiding judge, and we are unable to assess the witness’ demeanor, tone of voice, and body language.” Washington, 42 A.3d at 1271 (internal quotation marks omitted). We will not conclude that a hearing justice has acted unreasonably or arbitrarily in finding a probation violation if, “after considering all the evidence, [he or she] accepts one version of events for plausible reasons stated and rationally rejects another version * * *.” State v. Bouffard, 945 A.2d 305, 311 (R.I. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Our review of a hearing justice’s finding of a probation violation is limited to determining “whether the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in assessing the credibility of the witnesses or in finding such a violation.” State v. Tetreault, 973 A.2d 489, 492 (R.I. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'The defendant argues that, in light of his repeated references to his son throughout the two phone calls at issue, the hearing justice’s finding that the recordings did not “depict to th[e] [c]ourt a loving father desiring to visit with the child” was arbitrary and capricious and lacked support in the record. The state, on the other hand, acknowledges that defendant mentioned his son in the phone calls but contends that those references were thinly veiled attempts to persuade', '-9- the individuals to whom he was speaking to have Ms. Suon visit him in person, so that he could tell her, without his words being recorded, to stop talking to the police. The state contends as follows:', '“The defendant wanted Ms. Suon to stop talking to the police, to', 'not be used as a witness against him, to be convinced that this', 'matter was between the two of them, to tell the police that the only', 'reason she spoke to them initially was because they scared her, and', 'that the police could not hurt her if she helped defendant out.” Thus, from the state’s perspective, the hearing justice acted reasonably when she “categorically rejected defendant’s argument that all of the statements at issue were aimed toward family harmony * * *.”', 'Based on our review of the record, it is our view that there were at least two plausible interpretations of the above-referenced telephone conversations: the first being the expression of a desire on defendant’s part to see his son and the second being, in the words of the hearing justice, defendant’s desire to “quiet a witness.” We are mindful of the principle that a hearing justice has not acted arbitrarily or capriciously when he or she has considered all of the evidence and has accepted one version of events while rationally rejecting another version. See Bouffard, 945 A.2d at 310-11. It is clear to us that this is precisely what the hearing justice did in this case. There is arguably ambiguity as to what defendant’s intent was in his telephonic communications, but we fail to see how the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding as she did. See Tetreault, 973 A.2d at 493.', 'The hearing justice indicated that her decision was based on the “totality of the phone calls,” and she commented:', '“During the phone conversations, the defendant made several', 'statements. And I’m not going to go over all of the statements, but', 'the statements included: ‘Can’t talk over the phone. Need you to', 'call Rithy. Call this girl to talk to Rithy. She needs to come up', '- 10 -', 'here and talk to me. Please, I need her to stop doing what she’s', 'doing. When you get a chance, call her at her job.’ Other', 'statements on the tape include: ‘Convince her that she is safe if', 'she does the right thing. She does not have to be afraid.’” Additionally, the hearing justice expressly acknowledged the portions of the phone calls in which defendant expressed a desire to see his son, stating: “[T]he [c]ourt recognizes that statements on the tape include, ‘I’ve never been away from my son this long.’” Nonetheless, after considering the phone calls in their entirety, the hearing justice found that defendant’s purported motivation for the phone calls—that he wanted to see his son—was not persuasive because it “ma[de] no sense in light of the substance of the phone calls.” She noted that the phone calls were “riddled” with defendant’s attempts to have the individuals to whom he was speaking contact Ms. Suon and convince her to stop cooperating with police. Finding Ms. Suon to be a “highly credible” witness, the hearing justice accepted the state’s interpretation of the gravamen of defendant’s statements and stated that she was reasonably satisfied that defendant’s actions constituted a “fail[ure] to keep the peace and be of good behavior.”', 'In our view, there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the hearing justice’s conclusion that defendant made phone calls with the intent to influence the statements and behavior of a key witness in the then-pending murder case against him and that he thereby violated the terms and conditions of his probation. Accordingly, it is our view that the hearing justice’s decision adjudging defendant to be a probation violator was neither arbitrary nor capricious; and, therefore, we perceive no sufficient basis for overturning it. See Hazard, 68 A.3d at 501.', '- 11 -', 'B', 'Sentence', 'It is well established that, “with respect to a trial justice’s decision to execute all or a portion of a defendant’s previously suspended sentence after a finding of probation violation, [t]he [trial justice] has wide discretion when determining the proper sentence to exact upon a probation violator, and we will uphold that decision unless it constitutes an abuse of that discretion.” State v. Roberts, 59 A.3d 693, 697 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). In determining how much of a previously suspended sentence to impose for a probation violation, a hearing justice’s primary focus should be on the nature of the initial offense, although the hearing justice may also take into account the circumstances of the conduct that prompted the filing of a probation violation report—the “triggering offense.” State v. McKinnon-Conneally, 101 A.3d 875, 879 (R.I. 2014). Our review of a hearing justice’s probation-violation sentence is “for an abuse of discretion only.” Id.', 'The defendant argues that, even if he was properly found to have violated the conditions of his probation, the six-year sentence imposed by the hearing justice was based on improper considerations and was excessive. The defendant claims that the hearing justice improperly based her decision to remove a large portion of his suspended sentence solely on the triggering offense (obstruction of justice); he argues that “the only reason [the hearing justice] offered for executing six out of the seven years of his suspended sentence was that ‘he chose to quiet a witness’ instead of ‘let[ting] our justice system unfold.’” The defendant further contends that a sentence of three to four years to serve would have been appropriate and fair, in light of the fact that he had not previously been violated on his 2010 conviction and the fact that the maximum sentence for the charge of obstruction of justice would have been five years. Accordingly,', '- 12 - defendant avers that the hearing justice abused her discretion when she ordered him to serve six of the seven years of his suspended sentence.', 'In our view, the hearing justice did not abuse her discretion or rely on improper considerations when ordering defendant to serve six years of his previously suspended sentence. While the hearing justice unquestionably did consider defendant’s phone calls in her sentencing decision, we have “never held that the trial justice must completely ignore the nature of the second offense when imposing a sentence for a probation violation.” State v. Pires, 525 A.2d 1313, 1314 (R.I. 1987). Rather, the circumstances of the second offense may also be taken into account so long as the hearing justice is “guided principally by consideration of the nature of the first offense.” Id. Thus, even though the hearing justice referred to defendant’s alleged attempt to “quiet a witness” in her sentencing decision, that fact does not persuade us that the six-year sentence was solely based on the triggering offense of obstruction of justice.', 'The hearing justice explained that she had recounted the facts underlying the obstruction of justice charge merely to illustrate her finding that defendant was a probation violator, stating:', '“In so ruling, the [c]ourt is not weighing in on these underlying', 'charges. Rather, it recounts the events that depict this poor', 'behavior.” Furthermore, the hearing justice specifically couched her sentencing decision in terms of defendant’s failure to abide by the terms and conditions of his probation, concluding that “[t]his defendant agreed to keep the peace and be of good behavior, and I’m reasonably satisfied that he did not do so.” Based on these findings, the hearing justice stated: “I’m going to remove six years from the sentence.”', 'Additionally, when defendant argued at the probation-violation hearing that “the triggering charge [was] a five-year maximum felony” and, therefore, in defendant’s opinion, a', '- 13 - sentence of “three to four years” would be appropriate, the hearing justice expressly clarified that her decision was not based on the “triggering charge,” stating: “I understand that it’s a five-year felony, but I’m not sentencing on the five-year felony.”', 'As we consider the hearing justice’s decision as a whole, it is our view that she relied on the facts of the underlying charge of obstruction of justice—i.e., the phone calls defendant made from the ACI—primarily for the purpose of determining whether defendant had violated the terms and conditions of his probation, and not for the purpose of determining the length of the sentence to be imposed. Her commentary throughout her decision makes clear that she “remove[d] six years from the sentence” because “defendant agreed to keep the peace and be of good behavior” as a condition of the probationary period imposed as a result of his 2010 conviction and because, in the hearing justice’s estimation, “he did not do so.” Thus, we are not persuaded that the hearing justice relied solely on those phone calls in sentencing defendant. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the hearing justice did not abuse her discretion in executing six of the remaining seven years of defendant’s previously suspended sentence. McKinnon- Conneally, 101 A.3d at 879.', 'Finally, the defendant’s argument that a sentence of three to four years would have been “appropriate and fair” does not change the fact that the hearing justice was legally empowered to impose “any or all of defendant’s previously suspended sentence.” Id. We have previously remarked that, “[l]ike the sword of Damocles, the unexecuted portion of a probationer’s suspended sentence hangs over his or her head by the single horsehair of good behavior, until such time as the term of probation expires.” State v. Parson, 844 A.2d 178, 180 (R.I. 2004). The fact that the defendant believes that a shorter sentence might have been appropriate or fair does', '- 14 - not mean that the six-year sentence was inappropriate or unfair or an abuse of the hearing justice’s discretion.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

84,"Pamela Azar : v. : Town of Lincoln, et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. Pamela Azar (plaintiff or Azar), a former employee of the Town of Lincoln School Department, appeals the Superior Court’s grant of a motion for judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants, Town of Lincoln, Lincoln School Committee, and John Ward, in his official capacity as Finance Director for the Town of Lincoln (collectively, Lincoln or defendants) in an employment discrimination action. The plaintiff appears before us pro se. This case came before the Supreme Court on November 2, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and reviewing their memoranda, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide this appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On August 8, 2012, Azar filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court alleging claims of employment discrimination pursuant to the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act (RICRA),', '- 1- G.L. 1956 chapter 112 of title 42, and the Civil Rights of People with Disabilities Act (CRPDA), G.L. 1956 chapter 87 of title 42. She argued that she was discriminated against because she advocated for education services for her disabled son who was a student in the Lincoln school system. Specifically, plaintiff contended that the Lincoln School Department filed truancy charges with respect to her son’s absences as retaliation.1', 'At a jury trial in June 2016, where she was represented by an attorney, plaintiff testified to various actions taken by teachers and the school principal, which amounted to what she considered a hostile work environment. All the instances about which plaintiff testified occurred after Lincoln filed truancy charges in 2006 against her son and lasted until plaintiff took a leave of absence in 2008. For example, plaintiff described how other teachers treated her, including ignoring her at meetings and excluding her from positions she previously held. The plaintiff also said that the Special Education Department often summoned her during her workday to attend to issues regarding her son’s education, and plaintiff recalled being called to the main office over the intercom, which was not a common practice. Azar, in reaction to these occurrences, testified that she told the principal that she was feeling “isolated by the teachers,” but that he responded that he did not “want to get involved.”', 'The plaintiff also testified regarding the 2009 truancy charges Lincoln filed against her in response to her son’s failure to attend school for much of the 2008-2009 school year. She stated that in the fall of 2008, she had started exploring other placements for her son, and she disagreed with Lincoln’s choice of placement at the Bradley School.2 As a result, she appealed it to federal 1', 'In Superior Court, plaintiff also filed claims of malicious prosecution and abuse of process, which she voluntarily dismissed during trial. 2', 'In March 2008, plaintiff had sued Lincoln in Superior Court regarding her son’s educational placement, and Lincoln removed the case to federal court. The case eventually settled, and, as part of the settlement, Lincoln involved an expert to determine the most appropriate placement', '- 2- court, and, in the interim, a hearing on the truancy charges was conducted in October 2009. At the hearing, a Family Court justice ordered that plaintiff’s son be placed at the Wolf School3 for forty-five days. Azar testified that the justice commented that he could not “comprehend” why Lincoln took so long to file the truancy charges. Over the next year, the parties returned to the Family Court at least three times to reassess Azar’s son’s educational placement. In October 2010, the charges were dismissed. However, Azar testified that Lincoln wanted to drop the charges earlier, but she requested that the charges not be dropped because she wanted to “stay under the protection of the Family Court” to ensure her son’s placement at the Wolf School.', 'In addition to plaintiff’s testimony, Mary Ann Canning McComiskey, the teachers’ union president and a school social worker in Lincoln, testified for plaintiff at the trial. She recalled that members of the school community were well aware of Azar’s “difficulties” with Lincoln regarding her son. McComiskey, sensing the less-than-harmonious relationships between Azar and other teachers, spoke to teachers and the principal about the matter. She stated that, during her conversation with the principal, he was unable to justify why Azar had been called to the office over the intercom. McComiskey recalled explaining to the school superintendent in either 2005 or 2006 that Azar was being “socially isolated” and that the superintendent responded that Azar was “crazy.”', 'The defense called three witnesses to testify: Maryann Strubel, the director of student services; and Barbara Marsden and Kristen Lowe, two teachers who had worked with Azar. Marsden and Lowe both testified that Azar had changed during the 2006-2007 school year, for Azar’s son. While both parties agreed that Azar’s son required an out-of-district placement, they disagreed as to the best school for him. 3', 'The Wolf School had been successful with educating a number of students with a similar diagnosis to Azar’s son.', '- 3- transforming every conversation into one about her son, causing both teachers to try to change the topic or avoid Azar altogether.', 'After both sides rested, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The trial justice found that the statute of limitations did not bar plaintiff’s action with respect to the 2009 truancy charges, but did bar her claims for the 2006 truancy charges.4 As a result, the trial justice considered whether plaintiff had satisfied her burden of proving that defendants subjected her to a hostile work environment such that a reasonable jury could find that defendants had discriminated against her based on her advocacy for her son. The trial justice concluded that plaintiff had not met that burden. He also analyzed whether plaintiff had met her burden under a retaliation claim analysis, ruling that the evidence showed that Lincoln had legal justification to bring the truancy charges based on her son’s extended absence during the 2008-2009 school year. He found that the 2009 truancy charges were not in retaliation for Azar’s advocacy for her son. The trial justice ultimately granted defendants’ motion.', 'On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred in granting the motion for judgment as a matter of law because, in her view, she presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find in her favor on her hostile work environment and retaliation claims. 4', 'In ruling on the motion for judgment as a matter of law, the trial justice noted that the evidence, “although it[] [was] a little bit all over the lot,” demonstrated that the second truancy action was filed in September 2009. At trial, plaintiff testified that she was arraigned on the charges on July 10, 2009, supported by an exhibit that identified that date. However, one of defendants’ witnesses, Maryann Strubel, testified that the charges were filed in September 2009. At oral argument, defense counsel conceded that defendants do not press the argument that plaintiff’s retaliation claim based on the 2009 truancy charges is time barred.', '- 4-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Our review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law is de novo.” Roach v.

After conferring with court-appointed counsel, Mr. Motyka asked to have his previous writings—viz., the operative application for postconviction relief and his response to court-appointed counsel’s motion to withdraw—entered as “evidence.” The hearing justice then denied Mr. Motyka’s application for postconviction relief relative to his contention that he was actually innocent. Court-appointed counsel proceeded to discuss each contention raised by Mr. Motyka in turn, and the trial justice gave Mr. Motyka an opportunity to be heard on each contention in turn. During each of these instances, with the exception of the discussion of his due process contention, Mr. Motyka again asked to have his previous writings entered as “evidence.” The hearing justice then proceeded to immediately deny the postconviction relief application as to each of the contentions being raised. While availing himself of his “opportunity', '-6- to be heard” on his contention that his due process rights had been violated, Mr. Motyka, after conferring with court-appointed counsel, submitted a very lengthy document entitled “Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: On a Path Forward,” which document, he argued, the trial justice “should have followed” during his criminal trial.', 'After the last claim in the application for postconviction relief was denied by the hearing justice, court-appointed counsel asked the court to grant his motion to withdraw, and the state asked the court to consider its motion to dismiss. The hearing justice then stated the following: “The Court finds that the filing of [court-appointed counsel’s] No Merit Memorandum is justified; and, therefore, the Court is denying and dismissing Mr. Motyka’s postconviction relief application.”', 'After an extensive and comprehensive review of the transcript in this case, it is abundantly clear to this Court that the December 3, 2014 proceeding was not the evidentiary hearing that we required in Tassone. Nor are we convinced that it even met the requirements set forth in Shatney. We view as particularly disquieting the fact that Mr. Motyka was clearly unable to articulate his arguments in court and the fact that it is plain from the hearing transcript that his court-appointed counsel seemed to be advising him on how to respond to the hearing justice’s questions and how to submit evidence while simultaneously arguing why Mr. Motyka’s claims lacked merit.3 Moreover, we are made uneasy by the hearing justice’s use of the word “therefore” in rendering her decision—since the granting of a motion to withdraw based on a 3', 'We also find it concerning that, after granting court-appointed counsel’s motion to withdraw, the hearing justice, in the same sentence, told Mr. Motyka that she was “sure that [court-appointed counsel] would be more than happy to guide [him] through filing any appellate papers should [he] choose to do so.” Moreover, after the motion to withdraw was granted, court- appointed counsel was permitted to submit various documents on Mr. Motyka’s behalf, including “a motion and an affidavit to proceed in forma pauperis regarding the cost of the transcript[,] * * * a request for the transcript to be ordered, and the notice of appeal.”', '-7- “justified” no-merit memorandum should not be determinative of the merits of an application for postconviction relief.

Accordingly, we take this opportunity to hold that, from this point forward, Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000), shall be deemed abrogated and inapplicable in any case involving both an initial application for postconviction relief and an applicant who has been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.', 'As such, we instruct that on remand counsel be appointed for Mr. Motyka and that the Superior Court conduct further proceedings in accordance with this opinion and our opinion in Tassone.4', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.

The applicant, Keith Burke, appeals1 from the denial of his application for postconviction relief at the conclusion of a March 5, 2015 hearing in Providence County Superior Court. He contends on appeal that the hearing justice erred in denying his application for postconviction relief because “on October 12, 1994, [he] negotiated, bargained for, and reached an unambiguous agreement with the state, in which it would dismiss the murder case [pending against him] in exchange for his guilty plea in two other felony cases and the state breached [that] agreement.”', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 22, 1992, Mr. Burke was indicted for murder.2 On November 23, 1993, he was charged by criminal information with breaking and entering (P2/93-3719A); and, on December 22, 1993, he was also charged by criminal information with larceny (P2/93-3967A). On October 1', 'After Mr. Burke appealed but before oral argument in this case, the General Assembly amended G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-9 to require a party aggrieved by a final judgment entered in a postconviction relief proceeding to seek review by filing a petition for a writ of certiorari with this Court. See P.L. 2015, ch. 91, § 1; P.L. 2015, ch. 92, § 1. 2', 'The murder indictment in the record is not dated, but the docket reflects the fact that it was entered on May 22, 1992.', '-1- 12, 1994, while represented by counsel, Mr. Burke pled guilty to the charges of breaking and entering and of larceny; and he was sentenced to a ten-year suspended sentence and ten years probation on each charge, to be served concurrently. The murder charge was dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Mr. Burke contends that his guilty pleas in the breaking and entering and larceny cases were in exchange for what he characterizes as the dismissal with prejudice of the pending murder charge.', 'Thereafter, on September 3, 2004, Mr. Burke was indicted, in P1/04-2715A, for the same murder that had formed the basis of the indictment that had been dismissed in 1994. On June 22, 2005, Mr. Burke, through counsel, moved to dismiss the 2004 murder indictment, making the same argument that he makes before this Court—that the murder charge was dismissed with prejudice in 1994 in exchange for his guilty pleas on the other two charges. The state denied Mr. Burke’s contention that the dismissal of the 1992 indictment was a dismissal with prejudice. The Superior Court justice presiding over the motion to dismiss held a full-blown hearing, at which hearing testimony from the prosecutor who handled the 1994 pleas and his supervisor was elicited. Thereafter, the Superior Court justice, in a written decision, made findings of fact and denied Mr. Burke’s motion to dismiss; the Superior Court justice found that the 1994 dismissal of the murder charge was without prejudice. Mr. Burke took no further action with respect to that finding.3', 'On February 23, 2007, while the 2004 murder indictment was still pending, Mr. Burke filed the instant application for postconviction relief, seeking leave to withdraw his guilty pleas 3', 'It may well be that Mr. Burke is collaterally estopped by the Superior Court’s ruling that the 1994 dismissal was without prejudice; but that is an issue which we need not and, therefore, do not reach in the context of this case.

He argued that the state “violated a contractual relationship” when it re-indicted him for the murder in 2004 after he “reli[ed]” on the state’s intention to dismiss the 1992 murder indictment when he pled guilty to breaking and entering and larceny; he added that, at the time he pled guilty to breaking and entering and larceny, he thereby waived his constitutional rights, “including the right to proceed to trial.” On October 1, 2008, while the instant application for postconviction relief remained pending, Mr. Burke pled guilty to second-degree murder in P1/04-2715A—the 2004 murder case. As part of his plea agreement, Mr. Burke agreed to withdraw “all pending matters before the Superior and Supreme Courts.” Significantly, the docket reflects the fact that Mr. Burke then filed a motion to dismiss the instant application. The docket does not reflect that an order granting the dismissal was entered.', 'There was no further action in this case for an extended period; then, on April 17, 2014, Mr. Burke filed a bevy of motions. Those motions included: (1) a motion to withdraw the just- mentioned motion to dismiss; (2) a motion requesting an evidentiary hearing; and (3) a motion for “enforcement and specific performance of plea agreement and request for dismissal” of the 2004 murder indictment. A hearing was held on March 5, 2015 before another justice of the Superior Court, at the conclusion of which the hearing justice denied Mr. Burke’s application for postconviction relief; the hearing justice based his decision on the fact that Mr. Burke had agreed, as part of his guilty plea to second-degree murder, to withdraw all pending applications for postconviction relief, including the instant application.

On February 23, 2007, Mr. Burke filed the instant application for postconviction relief seeking to withdraw his guilty pleas on the breaking and entering and larceny charges. He filed this application before he pled guilty to the murder charge in 2008.

The previous renter, Withers, had been a tenant for only two months when she left a note indicating that she had moved and would pick her mattress up at a later date.', 'At trial, DiPaola testified that, as she was cleaning, Barros yelled to her that Withers and a man—later identified in the police report as Antonio Bryant—were approaching the property. The property had exterior stairs in the front of the building, and it also had interior stairs leading up to the apartment door. DiPaola instructed Barros to stop Withers from coming into the apartment. In response to “yelling and shouting,” DiPaola recalled that she opened the apartment door to see Withers and Bryant walking up the stairs. DiPaola testified that Withers was walking backwards up the outside stairwell, using a walker, and Bryant was assisting by pushing the walker.', 'DiPaola walked down the interior stairs and began yelling at Withers, “[y]ou can’t come in.” At this point, DiPaola observed Withers “barrelling [sic] up the stairs,” before Withers “grabbed [her] on [her] arm” and “threw [her] down the stairs.” DiPaola tumbled down about four or five stairs and landed at the very bottom of the stairwell. In response, DiPaola called out to Barros, “Help me. She threw me downstairs.” DiPaola testified that Barros was located on the exterior stairs at this time.', 'At trial, Barros recalled walking out of the building to the exterior stairs as Withers and Bryant were walking up those stairs. He called the police to report Withers’ arrival on the property without DiPaola’s consent, and at the same time he noticed DiPaola “on the floor, yelling, Call [sic] the police. She just pushed me down the stairs.” On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Barros whether he had seen Withers walking up the inside stairs, to which Barros responded, “She went passed [sic] me with the other guy * * * and she started going up', '-2- the stairs.” Barros then clarified that he did not actually see Withers going up the stairs because he was looking at his phone, but he stated that he knew she had been walking up the stairs.', 'Officer Brian Auclair responded to DiPaola’s apartment building for a reported assault, and he spoke with DiPaola who “appeared upset. I believe she was crying.” Officer Auclair testified that DiPaola told him she was pushed down the stairs by the second-floor tenant. Officer Auclair took a written statement from DiPaola, who was “shaking” while she wrote. In his police report, Officer Auclair memorialized the events as follows:', '“DiPaola and Barros stated that Tonya Withers * * * and Antonio', 'Bryant * * * came rushing up the stairs and began to force the door', 'open. When DiPaola ran down the stairs telling her to stop,', 'Withers pushed her causing DiPaola to fall down the stairs. Police', 'observed DiPaola holding her left shoulder but she refused', 'Rescue.”', 'In her written statement, DiPaola wrote that Withers “came up to [the] door, and was pushing it in[.] I ran down the stairs to open [the] door. And she grab[ed] me and push[ed] me down outside stairs.” On redirect, the prosecutor asked DiPaola what she considered “outside” stairs, and DiPaola responded that she meant the stairs outside the apartment, meaning the interior stairs.', 'On cross-examination, defense counsel confronted DiPaola with her prior testimony from a housing court hearing a few weeks after the purported assault. In those proceedings, DiPaola described the incident: “I came to the front door, and [Withers] started screaming at me, and I was in front of the door, and she was trying to move me out of the door, and she literally picked me up and threw me down the stairs.” When defense counsel asked DiPaola at trial to what stairs she had been referring, DiPaola clarified that she considered the apartment door the front door, indicating that the stairs she was thrown down were the interior stairs.', '-3-', 'After the close of the trial, the jury found defendant guilty of simple assault. The defendant moved for a new trial, which was denied. The defendant was sentenced to one year of probation, including mental health counseling. The trial justice also ordered no contact between defendant and the victim. The defendant timely appealed to this Court. In her appeal, defendant raises two issues—(1) the trial justice erred in denying a motion for a new trial; and (2) the trial justice erred in not letting defendant proceed pro se, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.1', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'A', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'When this Court reviews a motion for a new trial, we give “great weight” to a trial justice’s ruling when she “articulate[s] sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” State v.

With respect to the trial justice’s “findings of historical fact, and inferences drawn from those facts,” this Court defers greatly to the trial justice’s determinations. State v.

In determining whether to grant a new trial, “the trial justice must ‘(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” State v. Moore, 154 A.3d 472, 481 (R.I. 2017) 2', 'The state points this Court to a number of federal district court cases in support of its position that this Court’s relevant standard of review should be abuse of discretion. See State v.

However, in light of our recent decision in Cruz, we review the trial justice’s decision de novo. See State v. Cruz, 109 A.3d 381, 386, 389 (R.I. 2015) (reviewing a trial justice’s grant of a defendant’s request to proceed without counsel once the jury selection had commenced).', '-5- (quoting State v.

(quoting State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 870 (R.I. 2010)).', 'The trial justice cited to her role as the “13th juror” in passing “independent judgment on the credibility of the witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” The trial justice first remarked on her concerns with DiPaola’s credibility as a trial witness, especially given DiPaola’s conflicting statements and “jumbled” version of events. The apartment building had two sets of stairs—one interior and one exterior. DiPaola’s description of Withers’ assault “troubled” the trial justice as DiPaola placed the assault on the interior stairwell, while she had referred to the location in the witness statement as occurring on the “outside stairs.”', 'The trial justice also commented on the trial version of DiPaola’s account of the incident, explaining that she found “the version [DiPaola] offered at trial” was “really difficult to understand logistically how it occurred.” She suggested that the confusing aspect of DiPaola’s testimony was how DiPaola could have been “thrown down the stairs” without “hit[ting] the body of the [d]efendant * * * [or] the walker,” but rather, “she just went down the stairs.” Referring to the housing court transcript, the trial justice also remarked that Barros testified in those proceedings that he found DiPaola on the floor inside the house “pretty upset.” While questioning the portion of DiPaola’s testimony describing how she fell, the trial justice did believe her when she testified that the police came quickly, which the trial justice found to be consistent with the testimony of Officer Auclair. The trial justice again referred to a transcript from housing court proceedings, where Barros testified that the incident occurred inside while he was outside.', '-6-', 'Based on her disbelief of the sequence of events as relayed at trial, the trial justice concluded that she would have found that the state had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. However, given the standard for a motion for a new trial, the trial justice proceeded to decide whether reasonable minds could have differed. The trial justice ultimately found that there was sufficient evidence, even after discrediting DiPaola’s testimony that defendant committed an assault.3 In making her determination, the trial justice relied on the testimony of Officer Auclair and Barros, both of whom she found credible. Officer Auclair recalled arriving on the scene soon after the incident and found DiPaola “shaking and crying” while she relayed that she had been pushed down the stairs and her arm was sore. Barros stated that he saw DiPaola on the floor, telling him to call the police because Withers had pushed her down the stairs.', 'After a close review of the record, we cannot conclude that the trial justice clearly erred or “overlook[ed] * * * material inconsistencies.” State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 366 (R.I. 2011). Even discounting DiPaola’s testimony at trial, two other witnesses testified that they encountered DiPaola after the incident, visibly upset, and she told them Withers had pushed her—declarations a reasonable jury could have found to have been credible based on the circumstantial evidence presented at trial. Here, the trial justice found that the circumstantial evidence surrounding DiPaola’s fall down the stairs was sufficient to overcome the confusing portion of her testimony regarding the incident. See State v. Whitaker, 79 A.3d 795, 804 (R.I. 2013) (upholding denial of 3', 'A “simple assault [is] an ‘unlawful attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do a corporal hurt to another, whether from malice or wantonness.’” State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 620 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Pope, 414 A.2d 781, 788 (R.I. 1980)). Often charged with assault, a battery is “an act that was intended to cause, and does cause, an offensive contact with or unconsented touching of or trauma upon the body of another, thereby generally resulting in the consummation of the assault.” State v. Albanese, 970 A.2d 1215, 1221 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Messa, 594 A.2d 882, 884 (R.I. 1991)).', '-7- a motion for a new trial where the trial justice found numerous witnesses not credible, but still determined that the testimony was supported by circumstantial evidence). Affording the trial justice great deference in her determination, we conclude that Withers’ assault of DiPaola is supported by the evidence. Therefore, after a close review of the lower court record and the trial justice’s remarks, we are convinced that she did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'We affirm her denial of that motion.', 'B', 'Sixth Amendment Right to Proceed without Counsel', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred in denying defendant the right to proceed pro se at trial. The state counters that defendant’s request to represent herself on the second day of trial was untimely. It is not clear whether defendant expressly requested to proceed pro se at trial; but, in any event, we address defendant’s argument now.', '“[A] [s]tate may [not] constitutionally hale a person into its criminal courts and there force a lawyer upon him, even when he insists that he wants to conduct his own defense.” State v. Kennedy, 586 A.2d 1089, 1091 (R.I. 1991) (quoting Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 807 (1975)). However, a defendant may proceed pro se if he or she wishes only so long as the waiver of his or her right to counsel is valid. Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390. A defendant’s waiver must be made “voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.”', 'Id.', 'First, the Court must determine whether the waiver was voluntary, and then the Court should proceed to decide whether it was “knowing and intelligent.” Id. (quoting State v. Laurence, 848 A.2d 238, 253 (R.I. 2004)). Where a defendant is competent, we have articulated six factors that the trial justice may use as a', '-8- guide in reviewing a defendant’s request under a totality of the circumstances approach. 4 Id. at 391. The factors are as follows:', '“(1) the background, the experience, and the conduct of the', 'defendant at the hearing, including his age, his education, and his', 'physical and mental health; (2) the extent to which the defendant', 'has had prior contact with lawyers before the hearing; (3) the', 'defendant’s knowledge of the nature of the proceeding and the', 'sentence that may potentially be [ ]imposed; (4) the question of', 'whether standby counsel has been appointed and the extent to', 'which he or she has aided the defendant before or at the hearing;', '(5) the question of whether the waiver of counsel was the result of', 'mistreatment or coercion; and (6) the question of whether the', 'defendant is trying to manipulate the events of the hearing.” State', 'v. Chabot, 682 A.2d 1377, 1380 (R.I. 1996).', 'The defense contends that the trial justice failed to determine whether Withers was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waiving her right to counsel. We disagree. The trial justice explicitly referenced Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390, and cited the “voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently” test. She expressed the test as follows: “When confronted with a purported waiver of counsel, the [c]ourt applies a two-prong analysis to determine the validity of the waiver. The [c]ourt first determines whether it was voluntary, and then whether it was knowing and intelligent. It must be all three. I have to examine the totality of the circumstances.” Then, “[a] valid waiver of counsel is effective only if a defendant knows what he or she is doing, and his or her choice is made with eyes open. A criminal defendant certainly should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.” 4', 'If there is a question of a defendant’s mental competency, a trial justice must consider the six factors in deciding whether a defendant’s waiver of his or her right to counsel is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. See Cruz, 109 A.3d at 391. However, the trial justice need not explicitly apply these six factors when the mental competency of a defendant is not at issue. Id. at 392. Here, neither party addresses Withers’ competency in their briefs, and the trial justice did not indicate any concern on the record regarding Withers’ competency when she denied the defendant’s request to proceed pro se; and so we assume defendant was competent and review the trial justice’s decision accordingly.', '-9-', 'In this case, the trial had already commenced when defendant expressed dissatisfaction with her lawyers. In fact, DiPaola had already testified, and her cross-examination had been completed by defense counsel. As the defense noted, the trial justice did refer to the timing of defendant’s request in relation to the trial proceedings, noting also that defendant had been absent for one-and-one-half days of the trial after the jury was sworn. Although defendant voiced a number of excuses for her absence, the trial justice determined that her failure to show up to court was voluntary.', 'Additionally, defendant stated her desire to avoid the trial entirely:', '“And I still say my lawyers, they don’t—they don’t, um—they', 'don’t impress me. And I’m fine. Again, you wanted to do it. I’m', 'going prepared to drop them, drop this whole court crap, because,', 'okay, it’s on the phone where I was.

I don’t care. Whatever. I don’t', 'care. I’m going to Supreme. I don’t care. I don’t care. You’re', 'fired. Leave me alone. Can I go back to my cell now?”', 'The trial justice also asked defendant to specify her issues with her counsel.', 'The defendant expressed concern with defense counsel’s jury selection because there were no African-American jurors. The trial justice attempted to explain to defendant that there had been no African Americans stricken from the jury because there were simply no African Americans selected—something beyond defense counsel’s control.', 'The trial justice concluded that she did not believe defendant had “made the requisite intelligent and knowing decision to discharge counsel at this stage to meet the standard,” and she gave the defense attorneys an opportunity to address the matter. Defense counsel represented', '- 10 - that they were prepared to continue defending Withers notwithstanding her request for them to withdraw. Subsequently, the trial justice denied Withers’ request to discharge her attorneys.', 'We agree with the trial justice. The defendant’s contentions regarding her counsel elucidated her lack of understanding of the jury selection process, which is evidence that defendant was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waiving her right to counsel. Put differently, defendant raised a complaint about her counsel that, had she represented herself, she could not have done better.', 'But see State v. Spencer, 783 A.2d 413, 417-18 (R.I. 2001) (upholding a grant of a defendant’s request to proceed pro se where the defendant explained that there were issues he wished to address with the witnesses that were important to his defense).', 'Furthermore, defendant had not been present for the testimony of key witnesses, including that of DiPaola. As such, her choice to represent herself pro se after a significant absence could certainly not be said to be knowing or intelligent where such nonattendance put her at a substantial disadvantage in completing the trial. See Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390 (“A valid waiver is effective only if a ‘defendant knows what he [or she] is doing and his [or her] choice is made with eyes open.’” (quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835)). It is inconceivable to us that defendant would knowingly put herself at such a disadvantage. Moreover, although the timing of defendant’s midtrial request was not dispositive to the trial justice’s analysis, as the defense suggests, it certainly indicates that defendant’s waiver was not knowing or intelligent. See Spencer, 783 A.2d at 417 (acknowledging that the totality of the circumstances analysis used in determining whether a waiver is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent must be conducted “in light of the particular stage of the proceedings at the time the waiver is proposed”). Likewise, defendant’s stated wish to abandon the trial altogether and “go back to [her] cell” demonstrates a', '- 11 - lack of understanding that firing her attorneys would still result in defendant’s required appearance in court for the remainder of the trial.', 'Although we have expressed a preference for trial justices to have more than a brief discussion with a defendant before deciding whether a waiver of right to counsel is effective, the defendant’s failure to attend the initial portion of the trial indicates that the defendant was not making a knowing and intelligent waiver of her constitutional rights. See Cruz, 109 A.3d at 393 (“[A]lthough an explicit Chabot discussion would have been preferable, the absence of such a colloquy does not infect [a] defendant’s waiver of counsel with any constitutional defect.”). In view of that, we find that the trial justice engaged in an appropriate inquiry with the defendant in order to establish whether her requested waiver of her right to counsel was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Following a probation-violation hearing in August 2014, Eric Neufville (Neufville or defendant) was found to have violated the terms of his probation and was sentenced to serve sixteen years in prison. The defendant appeals the hearing justice’s sentencing determination on the probation violation and his denial of a motion for reconsideration.1 This case came before the Supreme Court on October 4, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing arguments of counsel and reviewing the parties’ memoranda, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'At oral argument, defendant conceded that he was only challenging the sentencing portion of the violation hearing, along with the hearing justice’s denial of his motion to reconsider.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On January 23, 2014, defendant was presented as a probation violator pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The state alleged that Neufville committed a robbery on December 27, 2013 while on probation.2 The facts regarding the details of the robbery are largely undisputed.3', 'On December 27, 2013, Bonnie Aguilar and her boyfriend, Nicolas Petrucci, were robbed at gunpoint in their apartment by two men impersonating undercover Providence police officers.4 Around 10:30 p.m., Petrucci answered a knock at the door of their apartment. After some commotion at the door, an African-American male later identified as defendant pointed a gun in Aguilar’s face, forcibly entered the apartment, and handcuffed Aguilar and Petrucci.', 'The defendant was with an accomplice, described as a white male. Petrucci’s friend, Travis Greer, accompanied the two men to the apartment after the pair had threatened him with criminal charges.5 It is uncertain whether Greer also entered the apartment. The defendant and his accomplice ransacked the apartment, taking $200 in cash, an engagement ring, a two-carat 2', 'The state moved to violate defendant on the terms of his probation in four cases: P2/03-3184A; P2/03-3234AG; P2/11-1362A; P2/12-1323A. The defendant appealed the violation hearing finding, denial of his motion to reconsider, and denial of bail (PM 14-461) with regard to the new robbery charge. Since the robbery charge was dismissed prior to oral argument, the issue of bail is moot. 3', 'The defendant does not dispute that the robbery occurred, but instead argues that he was not the perpetrator. 4', 'This Court was not provided the transcripts of the violation hearing. As a result, we base our rendition of the facts on those relayed in the hearing justice’s probation-violation decision. 5', 'At the violation hearing, Greer testified that he had sold marijuana to defendant on two occasions. After the second meeting, defendant appeared at Greer’s apartment, identified himself as an undercover Providence police officer, and offered to drop potential criminal charges if Greer set up a buy with his supplier. Greer testified that he complied with defendant’s orders, leading defendant and his accomplice to Petrucci’s apartment on December 27, 2013.', '-2- diamond watch, assorted jewelry, a gift card, a Coach purse, an iPod, an iPad, and an Xbox from the apartment during the robbery.', 'At the probation-violation hearing, the state presented three witnesses: Aguilar, Greer, and Det. Ronald Riley. The defense presented one witness: Petrucci. At the hearing, Aguilar identified defendant as the African-American man who robbed them at gunpoint.', 'Aguilar recalled that defendant wore a cap at the time of the robbery. Additionally, Aguilar testified that defendant’s behavior was “insane” and that he grew angrier when she denied having a safe in the apartment. The robbery lasted over an hour, and the hearing justice found that Aguilar stood in very close proximity to defendant for “a good part of that time.”', 'Both Aguilar and Petrucci testified that, initially, the couple identified a different person as the alleged robber after looking at Greer’s Facebook page. However, Providence police investigated further and identified defendant as another potential suspect. Aguilar later testified that, when Providence police asked her to look at a photo array, she “froze” and covered the man’s head as if he wore a cap before identifying defendant as the African-American man in her apartment on December 27, 2013. At the hearing, Aguilar testified that she was “150 percent” sure that it was defendant who had been in her apartment.', 'Ultimately, the hearing justice found defendant to be a probation violator, concluding that he was “reasonably satisfied that [defendant] was the person who committed those acts * * *.” On September 2, 2014, the hearing justice removed the suspension on the longest of defendant’s sentences, thereby sentencing him to sixteen years.', 'Following the violation hearing, defense counsel learned that the state had failed to turn over a police statement made by Aguilar on the day after the robbery. In that statement to police, Aguilar described one attacker as a “white man * * * about 6’2 with a baseball cap, like, a', '-3- Boston Red Sox baseball cap” with a “navy blue hoodie, navy blue jeans.” Aguilar characterized the second person as an African-American man, about five-feet-five inches tall, with a “black hoodie” and black jeans. When the police officer asked Aguilar if she saw the African-American attacker’s head, Aguilar responded, “I could. He didn’t have any facial hair,” adding that he had short hair on his head. Further, Aguilar stated, “it was dark in our house,” and she added that they “only had the little kitchen light” on when the attackers forced their way into the apartment.', 'On January 21, 2016, defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the hearing justice’s finding that defendant violated the terms of his probation, arguing that the hearing justice should reconsider his decision or give defendant another probation-violation hearing in light of the newly produced police statement. After review, the hearing justice denied defendant’s motion for reconsideration.', 'The defendant has appealed the hearing justice’s sentencing determination on the original violation and denial of his motion to reconsider.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'A', 'Probation Violation', '“At a probation-violation hearing, [t]he sole issue for a hearing justice * * * is whether * * * the defendant has breached a condition of his or her probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” State v.

The defendant also contends that Aguilar’s “prior inconsistent police statement” combined with her prior misidentification of another man on Facebook undermined her credibility. The defendant states that Aguilar’s December 28, 2013 police interview is inconsistent with her hearing testimony because she never mentioned in the interview that defendant wore a hat, but did specifically mention that the white assailant wore a “dark blue Boston Red Sox hat.” Finally, defendant argues that the hearing justice’s credibility determination is not supported by the record, particularly in light of the newly produced evidence.', '1', 'Probation Violation', 'Though defendant challenges only the sentencing portion of the probation-violation determination, we will first briefly address the hearing justice’s finding of violation. At the', '-6- conclusion of the violation hearing, the hearing justice articulated that “the credibility of witnesses is extremely important in [probation-violation] cases” because there is a low standard for finding a violation. He stated that “the starting point * * * for this Court is Ms. Aguilar’s testimony.” The hearing justice found Aguilar to be “very credible” and “her testimony to be compelling and certainly worthy of belief,” even after noting her prior misidentification. Specifically, the hearing justice considered Aguilar’s testimony to be “measured,” “very authentic,” and found that “[s]he had an excellent memory of the events of that evening.” Further, the hearing justice stated that “in this courtroom [Aguilar] said she’s * * * 150 percent certain it was the defendant in her apartment on December 27[].” As to the other witnesses, the hearing justice concluded that “[t]he other witnesses * * * did provide some corroborating evidence and corroborating facts that give [Aguilar’s] testimony even more credibility in the eyes of this Court.”', 'Our review of the record reflects that the hearing justice considered the tone of Aguilar’s testimony, her ability to remember clearly the facts of that night, and her certainty in identifying defendant. The hearing justice also took into account Aguilar’s misidentification, along with the other witnesses’ credibility and corroborating testimony in making his decision. Therefore, the hearing justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously when he found Aguilar to be a credible witness at the probation-violation hearing.', '2', 'Motion for Reconsideration', 'We take this opportunity to note that no authority exists for the filing of a motion to reconsider. See School Committee of Cranston v. Bergin-Andrews, 984 A.2d 629, 649 (R.I. 2009).

Rule 60(b)(3); see Turacova v. DeThomas, 45 A.3d 509, 514-15 (R.I. 2012). Here, defendant’s motion for reconsideration was filed more than sixteen months after the judgment.7 As such, it was not properly before the Court. Even if timely, it would have been of no avail to defendant.', 'At the hearing on defendant’s motion, the hearing justice acknowledged that his probation-violation decision relied heavily on Aguilar’s testimony. The hearing justice further acknowledged that the December 28, 2013 statement, unlike Aguilar’s testimony during the probation-violation hearing, did not “say definitively [defendant] was wearing a hat,” but that Aguilar “does say [defendant] was wearing a hoodie or some type of a hood-type of sweatshirt * * *.” The hearing justice found no “material in here that would have, in any way, in any significant fashion, have undermined what [Aguilar] said on the stand under oath and what this Court embraced as accurate and credible and trustworthy in reaching this decision that it reached.”', 'In deciding the motion, the hearing justice looked to the transcript of the probation- violation decision, his own notes of Aguilar’s testimony, and the new evidence—Aguilar’s December 28, 2013 statement to police. The hearing justice concluded that “[t]here is some material in there, but I just don’t think it’s that kind of substantial difference in testimony between the prior statement and what someone says at trial that would have been game changing 7', 'After a review of the transcript, it appears that the hearing justice did not address the issue of whether defendant’s motion for reconsideration was appropriately before him, and he decided the motion on the merits. While the motion very well may have been improper, see State v. English, 21 A.3d 403, 406 n. 8 (R.I. 2011), the state appears to concede that no objection was raised when defendant filed it. See State v. Barros, 148 A.3d 168, 172 (R.I. 2016).', '-8- or even significant.” After taking all of these factors into account, the hearing justice still found Aguilar to be credible.', 'In reviewing defendant’s motion, the hearing justice weighed Aguilar’s credibility in light of the new evidence presented to him and remained reasonably satisfied that defendant robbed Aguilar and Petrucci.', 'Based on this determination, the hearing justice found that defendant did not keep the peace or act with good behavior, and therefore denied the motion. He did not err in doing so.', 'B', 'Sentencing', 'The defendant contends that the hearing justice abused his discretion in executing the remaining sixteen years of his suspended sentence because he mostly looked at defendant’s overall criminal record and the new offense, rather than focusing on the matters for which he was on probation. This Court has held that “the unexecuted portion of a probationer’s suspended sentence hangs over his or her head by the single horsehair of good behavior, until such time as the term of probation expires.” McKinnon-Conneally, 101 A.3d at 879 (quoting State v. Parson, 844 A.2d 178, 180 (R.I. 2004)). Additionally, a hearing justice may consider a defendant’s prior record when determining an appropriate sentence for a probation violator. See Fairweather, 138 A.3d at 829.', 'Here, the Court has not been provided with the transcript of the hearing justice’s sentencing decision. In its brief, the state refers to a part of the sentencing hearing where the hearing justice considered defendant’s overall criminal record and, in part, the new offense.

Peters. :,criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on October 3, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised on appeal should not be summarily decided. The State of Rhode Island appeals from the trial justice’s decision granting a motion to dismiss several counts set forth in a criminal information against the defendant, Luke P. Peters (Peters or defendant), pursuant to Rule 9.1 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The state argues that the trial justice erred as a matter of law when he concluded that there was no probable cause to support the allegation that the defendant was operating a motor vehicle in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 31-27-2.6, 31-27-1.2, and G.L. 1956 § 31-11-18.', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that good cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided without further briefing or argument. We vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts that follow are derived from the filings of the parties and are undisputed for the purposes of this appeal. On August 6, 2014, after having purchased alcohol from a local liquor', '-1- store, defendant, along with John Willette (Willette) and two underage minors, Julia, and Kajia,1 went to Willette’s home and consumed the alcohol. At 11 p.m., the group decided to drive to Twin River Casino (the casino) in Lincoln, Rhode Island. While en route in Willette’s vehicle, defendant, Julia, and Kajia continued to imbibe. After the parties arrived at the casino, they decided not to risk entering because Julia and Kajia were minors and not permitted within the facility. They returned to Willette’s vehicle and continued to drink while parked in the casino’s parking lot.', 'At around midnight, as they left the parking lot, Willette was at the wheel with Kajia in the front passenger seat; Julia was the rear passenger behind the driver, and defendant was sitting behind the front passenger. While traveling at a high rate of speed on the highway, an argument ensued among the parties. The defendant suddenly leaped from the rear seat and violently grabbed the steering wheel. He then turned the wheel, causing the vehicle to lose control, veer off the roadway, and roll over. A collision ensued, resulting in serious bodily injuries to Kajia and bodily injuries to Julia.', 'A criminal information was returned in Superior Court, charging defendant with assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (count 1); driving under the influence of liquor resulting in serious bodily injury in violation of § 31-27-2.6 (count 2); driving so as to endanger resulting in serious bodily injury in violation of § 31-27-1.2 (count 3); driving so as to endanger resulting in nonserious bodily injury in violation of § 31-27-1.2 (count 4); contributing to the delinquency of a minor in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-9-4 (count 5); and driving with a revoked license in violation of § 31-11-18 (count 6). The defendant’s motion to dismiss counts 1 through 4, alleging insufficient probable cause to support the allegations, came 1', 'We have declined to reveal the identities of the minors.', '-2- before a magistrate of the Superior Court. After the hearing, the magistrate denied the motion, finding that, although defendant was not “driving” the vehicle, there was probable cause to conclude that he was “operating” a motor vehicle at the time of the incident. Thereafter, defendant appealed the magistrate’s decision to a justice of the Superior Court pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 8-2-39(e).2', 'On March 24, 2016, defendant’s appeal was heard by a trial justice. The defendant argued that the magistrate erred when he concluded that probable cause existed to charge defendant with assault with a dangerous weapon, as well as operating a motor vehicle in violation of §§ 31-27-2.6 and 31-27-1.2. In his decision, the trial justice determined that tugging on the wheel does not amount to driving or operating for purposes of §§ 31-27-2.6 and 31-27- 1.2.3 Accordingly, the trial justice granted defendant’s Rule 9.1 motion to dismiss counts 1 through 4 and count 6.4 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 8-2-39(e) provides that any party aggrieved', '“by an order entered by the general magistrate shall be entitled to a', 'review of the order by a justice of the relevant court.

Reed, 764 A.2d 144, 146 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Aponte, 649 A.2d 219, 222 (R.I. 1994)). A trial justices’ review of whether probable cause exists is limited to “the four corners of the information package.” State v. Young, 941 A.2d 124, 128 (R.I. 2008). It is well settled that the probable-cause standard applied to a Rule 9.1 motion to dismiss is identical to the traditional probable-cause standard to support an arrest. See Reed, 674 A.2d at 146. “[P]robable cause to arrest exists when the facts and circumstances within the police officer’s knowledge and of which he or she has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to conclude that a crime has been committed and that the person to be arrested committed it.” Id. When ruling on a motion to dismiss, the trial justice must afford the state “the benefit of every reasonable inference in favor of finding probable cause.” Young, 941 A.2d at 128 (quoting State v.

Diamante, 83 A.3d 546, 548 (R.I. 2014). “[W]hen the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1226 (R.I. 1996).

Chariho Regional School District, 21 A.3d 264, 271 (R.I. 2011)).', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, the state argues that the trial justice erred when he declared that defendant could not have violated §§ 31-27-1.2 and 31-27-2.6, or § 31-11-18 because defendant—a back-seat passenger—was not operating or driving the motor vehicle when he suddenly grabbed the steering wheel and turned the wheel, causing the vehicle to veer out of control and roll over, leading to catastrophic injuries.', 'The defendant contends that the “actual physical control” language found in the statutory definition section, G.L. 1956 § 31-1-17(c) and (d), for the terms “driver” and “operator” is not applicable to the offenses charged in the criminal information at hand.', 'To support this contention, defendant submits that the General Assembly amended § 31-27-2(a),6 which governs 6', 'See P.L. 1982, ch. 176, § 1', '-5- driving under the influence of liquor or drugs, by deleting the phrase “actual physical control” from the statute. Thus, defendant argues that by deleting the phrase “actual physical control” from § 31-27-2(a), the Legislature intended that all driving offenses set forth in chapter 27 of title 31 require more than momentary control of a vehicle to qualify as a driving offense.', 'This Court has not been called upon to address whether a passenger in a moving vehicle who forcibly seizes the steering wheel has exercised sufficient control of the vehicle to be deemed a “driver” or “operator” under the reach of chapter 27 of title 31. Thus, this appeal solely rests on the precise question of whether the terms “operating” or “driving,” under §§ 31- 27-1.2, 31-27-2.6 and 31-11-18, can encompass a passenger in a moving motor vehicle who suddenly seizes the wheel from the driver and steers the vehicle.', 'We begin our analysis by examining the statutory definitions of “driver” and “operator” under chapter 1 of title 31, entitled “Definitions and General Code Provisions.” Significantly, § 31-1-2, entitled “[a]pplicability of definitions,” provides: “[e]xcept as otherwise provided, the following definitions of the words and phrases in this chapter apply throughout this title.” (Emphasis added.) Turning to § 31-1-17, the term “[d]river” in § 31-1-17(c) is defined as:', '“any operator or chauffeur who drives or is in actual physical', 'control of a vehicle.”', 'The term “operator” in § 31-1-17(d) is defined as:', '“every person, other than a chauffeur, who drives or is in actual', 'physical control of a motor vehicle upon a highway or who is', 'exercising control over or steering a vehicle being towed by a', 'motor vehicle.” (Emphasis added.)', 'In accordance with our well-settled practice of statutory construction, we first determine whether these statutory definitions, by their plain language, are clear and unambiguous. See Diamante, 83 A.3d at 550. After careful review of the relevant sections for driving offenses, as', '-6- well as the statutory definitions of “operator” and “driver,” we are satisfied that § 31-1-17(c) and § 31-1-17(d) are indeed clear and unambiguous. Section 31-1-17 provides for two types of operators: the driver or a person who is in actual physical control of the vehicle. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that, in certain circumstances, an operator may be distinct and separate from a driver.', 'The defendant cites State v. Capuano, 591 A.2d 35 (R.I. 1991) in support of his argument that momentary control is not sufficient to support a finding that a person is operating or driving a motor vehicle for purposes of the statute governing driving under the influence. In that case, however, the sole issue before this Court was whether an intoxicated individual should be considered to have been driving or operating a motor vehicle when he was on a vehicle with the motor running but the vehicle was idling. In holding that the defendant was not operating or driving a motor vehicle, the Capuano Court reasoned that “[u]nder a strict construction of the post amendment language of § 31-27-2(a) in favor of [defendant], it becomes clear that the Legislature, in removing the actual physical control language from the section, intended that more than simple possession of a motor vehicle was necessary to constitute operating or driving.” Capuano, 591 A.2d at 37. Our decision in Capuano is distinguishable from the case on appeal because Capuano dealt with mere possession of a motor vehicle that was running, but not moving. Id. In the case at bar, defendant was not in mere possession of the motor vehicle. Rather, defendant seized control of a moving vehicle when he jumped up from the backseat, grabbed the steering wheel—thus divesting the driver of control—and steered the vehicle off the highway causing a roll-over crash. For these reasons, we deem Capuano unavailing. See id.', 'Equally unpersuasive is the case State v. Morris, 666 A.2d 419 (R.I. 1995) (mem.). The Court in Morris, relying on the Connecticut case, State v. Townsend, 294 A.2d 650 (Conn. 1972),', '-7- held that a “person ‘operates’ a motor vehicle * * * when in the vehicle he [or she] intentionally does any act or makes use of any mechanical or electrical agency which alone or in sequence will set in motion the motive power of the vehicle.” Morris, 666 A.2d at 419 (quoting Townsend 294 at 652). In Morris, we concluded that the trial justice was correct in finding that an individual was in violation of operating a motor vehicle without a license when he or she knowingly and purposefully turned on the ignition of the vehicle and set it in motion. Id. at 419- 20. We are satisfied that Morris and the case before us are miles apart because defendant forcibly seized the steering wheel of a moving vehicle from the driver who had already set the car in motion.', 'Accordingly, we conclude that the conduct alleged in this case falls within the definition of “operating” as set forth in § 31-1-17; and, because there is no specific statutory exception that excludes offenses under §§ 31-27-1.2, 31-27-2.6, and 31-11-18 from the ambit of § 31-1-17, this definition applies. By forcibly controlling and altering a fundamental feature of a moving vehicle—such as steering the direction of the vehicle—defendant placed himself squarely in the realm of an operator of a vehicle. Therefore, we conclude that this conduct can support a prosecution for violating §§ 31-27-1.2, 31-27-2.6, and 31-11-18.', 'We further note that we are not alone in this holding. Our research has revealed that when confronted with this issue, jurisdictions across the country have reached similar conclusions. See State v. Rivera, 83 P.3d 69, 74 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2004) (holding a passenger grabbing and turning a steering wheel assumed actual physical control for purposes of DUI statute); State v. Sanchez, 296 P.3d 1133, 1137 (Kan. Ct. App. 2013) (an intoxicated individual in a motor vehicle can operate or be in actual physical control in violation of DUI statute by grabbing the steering wheel); People v.

Freeman, 908 N.E. 2d 1026, 1029-30 (Ohio Ct.

The defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance; possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime of violence; carrying a firearm without a license; breaking and entering a dwelling without consent; and conspiracy to commit the crime of breaking and entering.

On April 23, 2014, at approximately 7:30 p.m., Weston heard a loud knock at the front entrance to the apartment building.1 When Weston looked out her window, she saw two men who were unknown to her. From the second floor Weston asked if she could help; the men responded that they were looking for the “gentleman on the first floor.” Weston informed the strangers that the first-floor tenant—whom she identified at trial as “Troy Grant” or “Troy Tunstall”—was not home. She then overheard the men discuss “jimmying the lock” and watched as they attempted to gain entrance by manipulating the lock of the front door. After this attempt proved unsuccessful, the men walked around to the back and peered into the first-floor apartment windows. The men began talking to each other, and Weston testified that “they mentioned what they were going to do and then proceeded to do that.” Specifically, Weston overheard one of the men say “go pop the front lock” as the other man thereafter pushed open the window to the first-floor apartment; he entered through the window, and Weston called 9-1-1 to report a break-in. The man who entered through the window opened the front door for the other man. Shortly thereafter, Weston saw one man leave the apartment building.', 'Two police officers, Giuseppe Scarcello (Officer Scarcello) and Michael Gammino (Officer Gammino) (collectively the officers), were the first to respond.', 'Officer Scarcello testified that when he first arrived he saw the open window on the first floor.

Officer Gammino testified that he asked the individual to show his hands, but he neither moved nor responded. The officers apprehended the suspect and located plastic bags containing crack cocaine in the suspect’s front jacket. The man was identified as defendant.', 'The defendant was charged in a ten-count criminal information2 that proceeded to trial in October of 2015. After a five-day jury trial, defendant was convicted of simple possession of a controlled substance; possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime of violence; carrying a firearm without a license; breaking and entering; and conspiracy to commit breaking and entering. The defendant was acquitted of the remaining charges. Thereafter, defendant moved for a new trial and for a judgment of acquittal as to count 9, breaking and entering, and count 10, conspiracy to commit breaking and entering. On November 9, 2015, defendant’s post- trial motions were heard and denied by the trial justice, and the trial justice sentenced defendant to a total of twenty years with twelve years to serve and eight years suspended with probation.

Mercado, 635 A.2d 260, 263 (R.I. 1993)). “If the totality of the evidence so viewed and the inferences so drawn would justify a reasonable juror in finding a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the motion for the judgment of acquittal must be denied.” Id.

Forbes, 779 A.2d 637, 641 (R.I. 2001)).', 'Analysis', 'On appeal to this Court, defendant raises two issues: (1) that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on count 10, conspiracy to commit breaking and entering of the first-floor apartment located at 38 Bergen Street; and (2) that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to count 9, the breaking-and-entering charge. We reject these arguments.', 'A', 'Count 10—Conspiracy to Commit Breaking and Entering', 'We first address the defendant’s contention that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal of conspiracy to commit breaking and entering, arguing that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that he conspired to commit the act of breaking and entering. pending consideration for that motion. Thereafter, an amended judgment was entered on September 20, 2016, and the papers were timely returned to this Court.', '-4-', 'A criminal conspiracy is an “agreement by ‘two or more persons to commit an unlawful act or to perform a lawful act for an unlawful purpose.’” State v. Abdullah, 967 A.2d 469, 474- 75 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Lassiter, 836 A.2d 1096, 1104 (R.I. 2003)).

Day, 925 A.2d 962, 975 (R.I. 2007)). The essence of a criminal conspiracy is the agreement to commit an unlawful act. The evidence presented may be solely circumstantial such that it may be “inferentially established by proof of the relations, conduct, circumstances, and actions of the parties.” State v. Disla, 874 A.2d 190, 197 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Lassiter, 836 A.2d at 1104).', 'When passing upon a motion for judgment of acquittal, in accordance with Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, the trial justice is required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, according “full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and draw[ing] therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” State v. Fleck, 81 A.3d 1129, 1133 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Cardin, 987 A.2d 248, 250 (R.I. 2010)).', 'At trial, the state presented Weston, the second-floor neighbor and eyewitness to the crimes, as well as the two police officers who apprehended defendant. After Weston informed the suspects that the first-floor tenant was not at home, she overheard defendant and his counterpart discuss entering the apartment by “jimmying the lock” to the first door and watched as they attempted to manipulate the lock. Weston testified that, when their efforts proved unsuccessful, the men then went around to the back of the house and she overheard one man direct the other to “go pop the lock.” She also watched as they opened a window and one of the men climbed through the window and opened the front door for his counterpart. Additional evidence presented at trial established that the police officers discovered defendant in the first-', '-5- floor apartment hiding in the dark under a table with a firearm in his immediate vicinity. This testimony, when viewed in the light most favorable to the state, is sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant, and his unidentified counterpart, conspired to unlawfully enter the apartment. The state presented a witness who overheard the suspects discuss their plans. We are therefore satisfied that the statements overheard by the second-floor tenant constitute direct evidence of the conspiracy. Nothing more is required.', 'The defendant also attacks the conviction on the ground that the state did not identify defendant’s co-conspirator.', 'However, we have recently held that there can be sufficient evidence to establish a conspiracy conviction despite the fact that the co-conspirators’ identities were unknown. See State v. Tully, 110 A.3d 1181, 1195 (R.I. 2015). Here, the record clearly reflects that defendant entered into an agreement with another person to unlawfully enter the apartment. They collectively agreed to disable the lock to the front door and attempted to do so. They were also observed opening a first-floor window in order to gain entrance. The fact that the co-conspirator was unidentified is of no moment to the sufficiency of the evidence in support of defendant’s conspiracy conviction.', 'The defendant further contends that the evidence to support a conspiracy charge was nothing more than a pyramiding of inferences that was based on speculation and conjecture. In a criminal prosecution, the state may seek to establish guilt “by a process of logical deduction, reasoning from an established circumstantial fact through a series of inferences to the ultimate conclusion of guilt.” State v. Vargas, 21 A.3d 347, 353 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v.

The crime of conspiracy consists of an agreement between “two or more persons to commit an unlawful act or perform a lawful act for an unlawful purpose.” Lassiter, 836 A.2d at 1104 (quoting State v. Mastracchio, 612 A.2d 698, 706 (R.I. 1992)). The crime is complete when the agreement is made. Conspiracy does not require an overt act or even an attempt to perform an act in furtherance of the agreement.', 'In the case at bar, abundant and direct evidence was introduced from which a factfinder could find—without drawing any inferences—that these suspects agreed to enter the dwelling. They were overheard discussing how to break in, and an eyewitness saw them enter the apartment through the window. To the extent that defendant challenges whether there was an ambiguous inference that the intruders knew that the entry was unlawful (that is, they entered without consent) this would constitute the only inference, drawn from the eyewitness testimony and “by proof of the relations, conduct, circumstances, and actions of the parties.” Lassiter, 836', '-7- A.2d at 1104 (quoting Mastracchio, 612 A.2d at 706). This inference obviously could be drawn from the direct evidence that defendant was located hiding in a dark kitchen, under the table, with a firearm. The defendant’s suggestion that the finding of guilt in this case was contingent upon a pyramiding of ambiguous inferences is not supported by the record or the law of conspiracy and is incorrect. Because this is not a case of one or more ambiguous inferences, we are satisfied that the trial justice was correct in denying the defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal as to count 10.', 'B', 'Count Nine-Breaking and Entering a Dwelling', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to count 9 because the state failed to prove that the defendant did not have consent to be in the apartment. In support of this contention, the defendant argues that there was a material variance between the pleadings and the evidence causing the jury to be misled at trial. A review of the record reveals that the defendant did not properly raise this argument before the trial justice. Therefore, we deem this issue waived. See State v.

On July 2, 2015, a grand jury indicted Daniel Tejeda (Tejeda or defendant) on charges of first-degree murder in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1. A Providence County Superior Court jury convicted the defendant on April 14, 2016. On appeal, the defendant argues that his trial commenced after the 180 days required by the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IAD), G.L. 1956 § 13-13-2, Art. III(a). He also argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motions to suppress the seizure of his cell phone and the records of that cell phone, as well as the bags, zip ties, and a BB gun retrieved from his apartment. Additionally, he asserts that the trial justice erred in allowing the admission of statements made by him while he was in the hospital. Finally, he alleges that the sentence imposed upon him was unduly harsh and unwarranted. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'The Murder', 'On March 31, 2015, Courtney Jewett (Jewett) found her cousin Ashley Masi (Masi or victim) unconscious in Masi’s bedroom with a zip tie fastened around her neck.

Earlier that afternoon, Masi had posted an advertisement for prostitution services on Backpage.com.1 In 2015, Masi had been working as an escort for at least five years, and she usually engaged clients through online postings. Generally, when Masi published a post, she received about twenty to thirty responses, from which she usually responded to about ten.', 'The March 31 posting was no different. Jewett testified that she was with Masi when she “started getting replies for her ad, and her phone was going off like crazy.” Shortly after 3 p.m., Masi told Jewett that a client was on his way, but the client wanted to look around the apartment when he arrived.', 'Jewett testified that such a request was not uncommon because many prostitution clients act paranoid. Masi’s client entered through the back stairwell, and Jewett testified that she never saw him enter the apartment. Jewett watched Masi’s baby in the front hallway while Masi saw the client. 1', 'We have defined Backpage before as recently as this year. “Backpage is a classified advertising website where individuals can list a variety of products and services.

Jewett called Masi’s phone, but it was turned off. Around 5:30 p.m., Jewett went upstairs to Masi’s apartment, where she found Masi’s unconscious body on her bedroom floor with an industrial zip tie tightened around her neck. Masi’s shirt was still on her body, but her pants were hanging over a chair. Her face was blue, and the floor beneath her head was covered in blood. Jewett screamed and dialed 9-1-1.2 Providence police officers responded to the call, but they were unable to remove the zip tie from Masi’s neck. The fire department transported her body to the hospital.

The Backpage advertisement Masi posted on March 31 at 1:07 p.m. included her cell phone number. Masi’s phone was not recovered, so Det. Otrando requested from her phone carrier a call log of calls and texts made and sent on March 30 and March 31.', 'Detective Otrando also interviewed Philip Towns, the father of Masi’s six-month-old child.

Jewett testified that Towns had sometimes been violent with Masi, and in fact had injured her only a few days before her death—she had a black eye that was still discolored as of March 31. Towns consented to a search of his cell phone and gave a DNA sample to Det. Otrando. Detective Otrando also investigated other individuals considered close to Masi, including Masi’s brother, as well as the second-floor tenant at the River Avenue apartment, and Towns’s girlfriend.', 'Masi’s phone records from March 30 and 31 spanned sixteen pages, and Det. Otrando began to investigate some of the phone numbers at random, choosing to put some focus on those contacts with more communications with Masi. During the first week of April, Det. Otrando chose to lock in on (401) 442-3344, a number that revealed twenty-five text messages with Masi on March 31. When he ran it through the police department’s system, Det. Otrando found that it was Tejeda’s phone number. Detective Otrando initially called the number, unsuccessfully attempting to get defendant to visit the police station. Then, Det. Otrando learned that defendant was going to be arrested on a federal supervised release violation3 on April 28, 2015. In furtherance of the investigation, search warrants were obtained for a buccal swab of defendant, for the cell phone records of the (401) 442-3344 number, and for a search of defendant’s residence.', 'C', 'Suppression Hearings', 'Before trial, defendant moved to suppress evidence of his cell phone, including its records, and the items that had been retrieved from defendant’s apartment—bags, zip ties, and a BB gun.

First, federal Deputy Justin Carvalho, who had been in charge of the arrest-warrant execution on April 28 at defendant’s home at 17 Van Buren Street, Providence, testified. A number of U.S. marshals, Rhode Island State Police officers, and Providence Police officers joined the arrest team. At the time of the arrest, Deputy Carvalho testified that he knew defendant was also wanted for questioning of a homicide in Providence. When the team arrived at defendant’s apartment, his mother answered the door, and she agreed to let them inside, pointing them towards defendant’s bedroom. The defendant’s two bedroom doors were locked and he had barricaded himself in the room.', 'Deputy Carvalho recalled standing at one bedroom door with federal Deputy Elden DaSilva, and he remembered four team members at the other door: Rhode Island State Police Det.

Poncia—a cell phone, defendant’s I.D. card, and a BB gun. Deputy Carvalho also testified that Det. Poncia never informed him that he seized a cell phone.', 'Next, Det. Poncia testified. The day of defendant’s arrest, Det. Poncia was tasked with performing perimeter security outside defendant’s apartment, entering the apartment after defendant was apprehended.', 'Once inside the apartment, Det. Poncia testified, he entered defendant’s bedroom and seized a firearm that was on the floor near the mattress.', 'When defendant was taken outside the house, Det. Poncia recalled, he was wearing pants and a shirt. Subsequently, Det. Poncia said that he searched defendant for safety reasons, and he found a cell phone and an I.D. card in defendant’s right front pants pocket.', 'On cross- examination, Det. Poncia explained that he took the cell phone from defendant in response to Det. Otrando’s request to seize any cellular devices he found during the arrest.4', 'After searching defendant, Det. Poncia recalled driving him to RWH at defendant’s request because of a complaint of taser injuries. Once he delivered defendant to the destination, Det. Poncia alerted Det. Otrando as to defendant’s whereabouts. Detective Poncia eventually brought the cell phone to the Providence Police property room to secure it. He filled out an incident report for the items seized that day. 4', 'Detective Otrando also testified that he had told Det. Poncia to get any cell phones he saw during the April 28 arrest. Additionally, at the pretrial hearings, notes on Deputy Carvalho’s file for the Tejeda arrest were introduced. Handwritten notes were written on the cover of the file: “Chris, seize phones and zip ties.” Also, Det. Otrando’s name and number were written on the file. Further, the following remarks were written in Deputy Carvalho’s handwriting: “3/31/15, unaccountable entire day. Old number assoc with victim. Shut it off day after murder.” Deputy Carvalho testified that he did not recall where he received that information, but he said it would have been written on or before he executed defendant’s arrest warrant.', '-6-', 'Once defendant was at the hospital, Det. Otrando paid him a visit. After reading him his rights, Det. Otrando had a short conversation with him, during which defendant told him his various phone numbers, one of which was (401) 442-3344. The defendant said, “I don’t want to make a statement,” but Det. Otrando continued to ask him questions. Prior to that however, defendant told Det. Otrando that he was at Rhode Island Hospital (RIH) all day on March 31.', 'A number of other arresting federal marshals also testified at the suppression hearings. Deputies Moore, Murphy, and DaSilva each testified that they never saw a cell phone when they arrested defendant on April 28. Deputies Murphy and DaSilva also did not know who had given clothes to defendant. While Deputy Engen could not remember who had done so, he did testify that officers typically found clothes for defendants before arresting them. Deputy Engen stated that he did not search for or seize any evidence while he was in defendant’s bedroom, but he did recall defendant being tased by Deputy Moore after refusing to show officers his hands. Deputy Engen handcuffed defendant, and he remembered that Det. Poncia was the officer who transported defendant to the hospital.', 'At the pretrial hearings, defendant also took the stand, and he explained that he locked himself in his bedroom to swallow some Vicodin pills before the police officers broke the door down. The defendant identified Deputy Carvalho as the marshal who brought him clothes and drove him to the hospital. Detective Poncia, defendant remembered, was at the hospital as well. The defendant testified that he told Deputy Carvalho, Deputy Engen, and the doctor and nurses at RWH that he had taken Vicodin that day.5 5', 'When Det. Poncia was cross-examined, he stated that he had told Det. Otrando that defendant had ingested Vicodin pills before he was arrested. However, Det. Otrando testified that defendant was alert when he spoke with him at the hospital on April 28.', '-7-', 'The defendant also recalled that his Huawei cell phone was in his “blue, black, yellow, and gray North Face backpack” on April 28.

The defendant also testified that he did not have any firearms in plain view in his bedroom that day.', 'D', 'Defendant’s Statements', 'After defendant was released from the hospital, he was housed at the Donald Wyatt Detention Center (Wyatt) in Central Falls. He requested another opportunity to speak to Det. Otrando. On April 30, Det. Otrando interviewed defendant, along with Det. Steve Sullivan at Wyatt. During that interview, defendant implicated one Ramon Rodriguez in the murder of Masi. The defendant told some stories about loaning his phone to Rodriguez, editing the time frame of that alleged loan once Det. Otrando told him the contacts between defendant’s phone and Masi’s were between 2:28 p.m. and 3 p.m. Throughout the interview, defendant asserted that he had not spoken to Masi nor had he seen her at any point on March 31.', 'The defendant indicated he would speak further if a particular prosecutor was present, so the detectives returned the following day with that prosecutor.

Detective Otrando also testified regarding the search, attesting that the white zip ties were the same size and color of the zip tie found around Masi’s neck. He explained that although the opened package Det. Garcia located had space for five zip ties, only four remained. Further, Det.

Doctor Stanley opined that the two abrasions on Masi’s neck indicated that she had not committed suicide.

The defendant testified that he told Caraballo to tell Brenda Rivera, his child’s mother, to go get his bag that contained his phone because he was worried about any incriminating information that could implicate him in family court matters with Rivera.

92,State : v. : Luis Padilla. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The defendant, Luis Padilla (defendant or Padilla), appeals his conviction of first-degree robbery1 following a Superior Court jury-waived trial in Providence County.', 'This matter came before the Supreme Court on September 26, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, the Superior Court’s judgment is affirmed. 1', 'Padilla was convicted of first-degree robbery under G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a) after the trial justice determined that he “aid[ed], abet[ted] and assist[ed] Mr. Lugo and Mr. Rivera in the commission of first degree robbery of Justin McFadden on July 24[ ], 2010, and he is therefore guilty as a principal.” See State v. Long, 61 A.3d 439, 447 (R.I. 2013) (“The law is well settled that one who aids and abets in the commission of the crime and is also present at the scene may be charged and convicted as a principal.” (quoting State v. Davis, 877 A.2d 642, 648 (R.I. 2005))).', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This appeal arises from an incident that occurred on July 24, 2010. On that date, Justin McFadden (complainant or McFadden), as he had in the past, went to the Crossroads’2 clinic for medical services. The events that followed his arrival, however, interrupted his purpose and instigated the criminal prosecution that is at issue in this case.', 'McFadden testified that, when he arrived at Crossroads, he carried in his pockets his bank cards, bus pass, approximately $500 in cash, a necklace, and a bag of medication.', 'He immediately went downstairs to the clinic, but learned that he could not be seen for at least another hour. He left and waited his turn in an outdoor locker area, sitting on the concrete floor with his back against a wall. He reported seeing two people, later identified as Juan Lugo (Lugo) and Jackson Rivera (Rivera),3 about five to eight feet away, huddled together and conversing in Spanish. McFadden observed them for a short while before they turned to speak with a third man, later identified as Padilla, waiting outside the gate.4 One of the men walked over to Padilla, who remained outside the gate, and both looked over at McFadden. At that point, they were approximately seventeen feet away from McFadden. From five to eight feet away, the third man continued to look “right at” him.', 'At this point, all three men came together and “came at [McFadden].” Approximately four feet before reaching him, Padilla “broke off” from the group. Rivera and Lugo continued 2', 'Crossroads is an organization in Providence that offers shelter and other services to homeless individuals. 3', 'Lugo and Rivera pled nolo contendere to their charges resulting from this incident and are not involved in this appeal. 4', 'We recognize that the term “gate” is subject to multiple interpretations and, as such, it caused some confusion during trial. The trial justice addressed the confusion, saying “[o]ne thing we can call it is a door. We can call it a gate because it is attached to a fence. Usually when something opens attached to a fence you often call it a gate, but we can call it a door as well.”', '-2- towards McFadden, and Lugo “pulled out a Rambo style knife and charged at [him].” After Lugo pulled out the knife, McFadden recalled him saying “I’m going to stab you” or “[g]ive what you have, your money.” Rivera reiterated that sentiment, telling McFadden “[g]ive him the money.”', 'Within a few seconds of these statements, Lugo stabbed McFadden in his arm. Padilla then “rushed at [McFadden].” McFadden remembered “[p]unching, kicking, whatever [he] could do” to protect himself. He testified that he tried to grab Lugo’s arm. He remembered he “had a good grip on [Lugo],” but Padilla “hit [him] and [he] got turned around.” Lugo then stabbed him multiple times in the back. McFadden testified that he felt “[o]ne gigantic [incision] and one not so gigantic [incision].” Rivera then “was trying to go in [McFadden’s] pockets.” Though in and out of consciousness at that point, McFadden felt his belongings being removed from his pockets. McFadden testified at trial that Padilla was the one who “hit [him] like a linebacker” before going through his pockets while he was on the ground. In his statement to the grand jury six months after the incident, McFadden had testified that Padilla “came up from behind [him] pretty quickly” after he was stabbed in the arm.', 'He also noted that, while he wrestled Padilla, he “got a good look at his face.”', 'At trial, McFadden testified that, following the stabbing, he chased after the three men. As he ran, he recalled seeing and hearing a woman, later identified as Frances Paban, who was “very upset” “screaming” at Lugo, “not in so many words saying you are an idiot, what are you doing.” McFadden recalled that a person grabbed him from behind, attempting to stop his bleeding. Fire and rescue soon arrived and transported him to the hospital. He awoke a day or so later to learn that his kidney had been lacerated. In addition, he had superficial wounds on his arm and back, and an interior mesh had been inserted into his abdomen. He was initially', '-3- released from the hospital after one week, but later hospitalized a second time after developing an infection. He also spent six months using a walker upon his release.', 'The day after the attack, McFadden gave the police a recorded statement wherein he reviewed three photo arrays to identify his attackers. The police instructed McFadden to circle anyone who participated in the attack, and to write the nature of that person’s involvement under his picture. McFadden identified Rivera as the man who said “give me the money” while approaching him alongside Lugo. In a second photo array, McFadden selected Lugo as the man who stabbed him.', 'Finally, in a third photo array, McFadden recognized Padilla, who he acknowledged “was there.” The police returned three days later to take another statement, at which time McFadden confirmed the previous photo identifications.', 'A. Paban’s Testimony', 'In addition to McFadden, Frances Paban also testified as a state’s witness at trial.5 Paban – fifteen years old on the date of the attack – frequently stayed with her boyfriend, Lugo, at Crossroads, and on July 24, 2010 spent the morning outside Crossroads’ locker area doing drugs with him. Despite her altered state, Paban recalled seeing Lugo, Rivera, and Padilla in the locker area that day.', 'While in the locker area, Paban heard Lugo and Rivera tell each other in Spanish,6 in the presence of McFadden, that they wanted to rob him. When she heard this, Paban had lost sight of Padilla, though she had previously seen him sitting silently atop a crate shaving his legs about thirty feet away from Lugo and Rivera. Paban “went to go see what was going on,” and testified that, when she reached Lugo, she did not see anyone besides Rivera in his immediate vicinity. 5', 'The state called two other witnesses to testify as well: Officer Jose Deschamps and Det. Emilio Matos, Jr. The defense called one witness, Lugo, who testified that Padilla was not involved in the robbery and, instead, that he acted alone. 6', 'Paban testified to her belief that Lugo and Rivera knew the victim did not understand Spanish.', '-4- After Lugo told her to sit back down, she returned to her previous spot, from which she could no longer see Lugo and Rivera, and she “sat on a crate, * * * put [her] headphones * * * on” and “zoned out.” Approximately five to ten minutes later, Paban saw Lugo come “outside of the locker, behind from where the locker was[,] with blood on his hands and on his clothes.” Temporarily deafened by her headphones, Paban said she had not heard any commotion, nor had she seen Padilla move from the crate.', 'Amid the chaos, Paban and Lugo agreed to meet at Amos House.7 She rode a bicycle to the agreed place. Paban, unaware of Rivera’s location, met Lugo at Amos House; and, as Lugo sat down at a picnic table, she saw the handle of a knife and blood dripping down his pants leg. Shortly thereafter, Rivera arrived, followed by Padilla. The police interrupted their rendezvous moments later, “thr[owing] [Lugo] to the floor, lift[ing] up his shirt and f[inding] his knife.”8 Meanwhile, Rivera was about six picnic tables away.', 'After the police arrested Lugo, Paban went to the police station with Det. Emilio Matos and gave a full recounting of the morning’s events. Later that evening, however, Paban returned to the station seeking to change her statement. While her second statement references Padilla’s involvement, her first statement makes no mention of him. In her second statement to Det. Matos, Paban, in describing the events, said “[Padilla] got involved in it and [he] said I will watch but I want half and they said all right.” She elaborated that “[Padilla] was at the end of it, 7', 'Amos House is an organization that offers food, shelter, and social services to those in need in the Providence area. 8', 'During trial, Officer Jose Deschamps testified about his experience escorting Lugo to the police station. Deschamps recalled Lugo telling him: “I know who took the money. It was two of my fam. They are probably going back to Crossroads. Oh, shit, there they are.” Deschamps then saw “two male subjects,” later identified as Rivera and Padilla, walking down the street. Lugo, with his hands cuffed behind his back, motioned his head in Rivera and Padilla’s direction. Deschamps broadcast a description of Rivera and Padilla over his radio, and officers arrived and arrested them.', '-5- at the end of the gate watching it * * * he was very aware of [what was going on] * * * he * * * [w]anted a cut.” At trial, Paban again switched her story, testifying that Padilla had nothing to do with the incident and instead helped the victim tend to his wounds. In addition, she testified that, following her first statement to police but before her second, she used drugs.', 'Toward the end of her trial testimony, Paban asked the trial justice if she could “come up and talk to [him] * * * away from everybody else.” He denied her request, but directed the prosecutor to bring her issue to his attention if necessary. Later in her testimony, Padilla’s attorney asked Paban to read her witness statement aloud, to which she responded “[I] can’t read. I can follow along if you read but I can’t read it.” Upon further inquiry, she clarified that she had a limited reading ability such that she can read names and can “follow along if [someone] read[s] it out loud.”', 'Throughout her trial testimony, each time counsel for either side referred Paban to her witness statements, they either read her the statement or played her a recording of it. Moreover, prior to testifying, Paban was both permitted to listen to a recording of her statement and provided with a transcript of it. When asked if she recognized the transcript of her statement, she indicated that she did; she said she followed along with the transcript while listening to the recording at the station.', ""Padilla moved to dismiss his charge pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure after the state rested, but the trial justice reserved his decision until the defense presented its case. At the conclusion of all evidence, the trial justice denied the motion to dismiss. In so doing, the trial justice quoted State v. McKone, 673 A.2d 1068 (R.I. 1996), which allows that “if the trial justice in a criminal case setting concludes that the trial evidence is sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he or she denies the defendant's motion to"", '-6- dismiss and, if both sides have rested, enters decision and judgment of conviction thereon.” Id. at 1073. He ultimately determined that the evidence proved Padilla guilty of first-degree robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. On April 14, 2014, he sentenced Padilla to fifteen years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with four years to serve and eleven years suspended with probation. Padilla filed a notice of appeal on April 15, 2014.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court affords great deference to a trial justice’s credibility determinations when sitting without a jury.” State v. Edwards, 147 A.3d 982, 987 (R.I. 2016). “When reviewing determinations of credibility and findings of fact by a trial justice sitting without a jury, this Court will not disturb the trial justice’s findings unless they are clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” State v. Erminelli, 991 A.2d 1064, 1069 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1222 (R.I. 2009)). “When the record indicates that competent evidence supports the trial justice’s findings, we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for his [or hers] even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.” Edwards, 147 A.3d at 987 (quoting State v. Van Dongen, 132 A.3d 1070, 1076 (R.I. 2016)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Padilla argues that the trial justice committed two errors warranting reversal of his conviction: (1) that the trial justice misconstrued McFadden’s testimony as to who confronted him; and (2) that the trial justice erred in relying on Paban’s witness statements where', '-7- her inability to read rendered her unable to acknowledge them. We will discuss each issue in turn.', 'A. McFadden’s Testimony', 'Padilla first challenges the trial justice’s characterization of the attack, arguing that he inaccurately recounted McFadden’s testimony and, specifically, that he erred in saying that “all three men approached [McFadden]” and “all three confronted [McFadden].” Padilla argues that, rather than “all three” approaching the complainant, McFadden actually testified that only Lugo and Rivera approached and confronted him. We disagree and instead hold that the trial justice, in summarizing McFadden’s testimony, accurately recounted it.', 'In describing the complainant’s testimony, the trial justice highlighted that “Mr. McFadden then testified that all three men approached him. He could tell from their demeanor as they approached that ‘something bad was going to happen close.’” Padilla primarily takes issue with the trial justice’s statement that he “confronted” McFadden along with Lugo and Rivera. However, we do not find the trial justice’s indication that Padilla participated in the initial confrontation inconsistent with the record. During his testimony, McFadden narrated that the “man that was standing [ten] feet away was joined by the other two and they came at me.” When asked specifically by the trial justice whether “all three c[a]me towards you,” he answered in the affirmative.', 'We believe, contrary to Padilla’s argument, that “confront” accurately describes McFadden’s narration of Padilla’s actions – that Padilla “c[a]me towards” McFadden with Lugo and Rivera before retreating.', 'Furthermore, it is clear that Padilla takes the trial justice’s summary out of context. While he is correct that McFadden testified that Padilla “broke off and was near the [gate] area” after approaching the complainant, the trial justice also spoke of Padilla’s departure from the', '-8- group. The trial justice, after saying that “all three men approached [McFadden],” continued that “[s]hortly after all three confronted him one of the men who he later identified as Mr. Padilla broke off from the confrontation * * *.” Later, the trial justice reiterated that “[McFadden] recalled all three men approaching and he sensed something bad was about to happen. As the confrontation between Mr. McFadden and these men began, he recalled Mr. Padilla breaking off from the group and taking a position near the gate area or the entrance to that locker area.” This Court has said that a trial justice should not “pick one isolated statement in a witness’s testimony out of context from the whole of it.” State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 481 (R.I. 1998). It follows, then, that counsel should refrain from doing the same. See Deatte v. Duxbury, 66 R.I. 1, 9, 17 A.2d 24, 27 (1940) (“The suggestion of the trial justice to which the complainant objects must be read with what precedes and follows; it should not be isolated from its context * * *.”).', 'The trial justice did not “misconceive[ ] or overlook[ ] material evidence” sufficient to warrant reversal. Erminelli, 991 A.2d at 1069. Rather, Padilla has sequestered one sentence of the trial justice’s bench decision without relating it back to the whole. Thus, we accept the trial justice’s summary as accurate.', 'B. Paban’s Prior Statements', 'Next, Padilla challenges Paban’s recognition of her prior witness statements during her testimony. He argues that Paban’s concession late in her testimony that she could not read rendered her unable to effectively acknowledge her prior statements, which the trial justice relied on in finding him guilty. Padilla’s argument, however, is unpersuasive.', 'In light of the trial justice’s revelation that Paban’s testimony was “the most enlightening and damaging * * * which clearly implicates and explains in detail Mr. Padilla’s participation in this robbery,” it is not surprising that Padilla seeks to undermine it. “However, as we have stated', ""-9- many times, this Court's ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes our consideration of an issue that has not been raised and articulated at trial. * * * It is well settled that a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.” State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008). Padilla did not take issue with the prosecutor’s use of Paban’s prior statements at trial, and his failure to challenge it then precludes him from now raising the argument on appeal. As such, having failed to preserve it, Padilla has waived his objection."", 'Nevertheless, even if we were to overlook the “raise-or-waive” rule, we still would not be inclined to hold that the trial justice erred in relying on Paban’s testimony regarding her prior statements. In his bench decision, the trial justice recalled that, during her testimony, “[Paban] was confronted with the inculpatory statements she attributed to Mr. Padilla that were contained in her second taped statement * * *. Those statements from her recorded statement were placed in front of her in the courtroom and she in her statement acknowledged all of these statements were made in her presence according to that recorded statement.” Padilla argues that Paban’s inability to read means she was unable to recognize her prior statements. However, his argument relies on the misconception that the prosecutor asked Paban to read her statements before she acknowledged them as her own.', 'Instead, before asking Paban if she recalled a specific statement, the prosecutor either read it to her aloud or played her a recording of it, in which she recognized her voice.9 Moreover, during her testimony, Paban had a copy of the transcript in front of her, and she told Padilla’s counsel that she could “follow along if [someone] read[s] it out loud,” which is precisely what the prosecutor did. 9', 'In fact, after Paban’s disclosure, Padilla’s counsel offered to utilize the same method as the prosecutor by reading Paban her statement – the same procedure with which Padilla now takes issue.', '- 10 -', 'A review of Paban’s testimony reveals that she was capable of recognizing her prior statements, and could do so through the means the prosecutor used.', 'So, “[r]ather than misconceive or overlook evidence, the trial justice duly considered” Paban’s testimony and statements. Edwards, 147 A.3d at 987. Padilla’s contention that “the trial record indicates that she had no ability to recognize [her July 24, 2010 statement’s] accuracy or inaccuracy” reflects a distorted view of the record and one that we reject.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the aforementioned reasons, the Superior Court’s judgment is affirmed.

93,State : v. : Chaquiro Blandino. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Chaquiro Blandino, appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury found him guilty of (1) first-degree murder of Francis Rodriguez; (2) discharging a firearm during a crime of violence (murder), resulting in the death of Rodriguez; (3) assault with a dangerous weapon (a firearm) upon Marvin Vasquez; (4) discharging a firearm during a crime of violence (assault with a dangerous weapon), without causing injury to Vasquez; (5) discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle, creating a substantial risk of injury to Rodriguez and Vasquez; and (6) unlawfully carrying a pistol without a license. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial justice denied. The trial justice imposed consecutive life sentences on counts 1 and 2; a consecutive ten-year sentence on count 3; a consecutive ten-year sentence, non-parolable, on count 4; and concurrent ten-year sentences, suspended with probation, on counts 5 and 6, to run consecutive to count 4. Before this Court, the defendant asserts that the trial justice erred when he denied the defendant’s request to order the state to produce the investigative notes of Det. Angelo A’Vant of the Providence Police', '-1- Department. The defendant further contends that the trial justice erred when he denied the defendant’s motion for a new trial. After careful consideration of the defendant’s arguments and a thorough review of the record, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Trial Testimony', 'There is little factual dispute in this case. It is uncontroverted that defendant shot and killed Francis Rodriguez on May 2, 2014. It is also undisputed that defendant had previously been robbed, shot, and frequently harassed by members of the “C-Block” gang.1 The only question at trial was whether the killing of Rodriguez was a cold-blooded, premeditated murder or an act of self-defense. The jury found it to be the former.', 'The central issue on appeal is whether defendant was entitled to certain notes taken by Det. A’Vant during the course of his investigation. Those notes, defendant argues, may have contained information about the potential C-Block membership or association2 of Rodriguez, the murder victim, and Vasquez, the main witness for the state. The defendant also posits that Det. A’Vant’s notes could have included information about defendant’s reputation to C-Block as a snitch and the gang’s ensuing harassment of him. According to defendant, access to the notes would have helped him more effectively pursue and present his theory of self-defense. The defendant claims that that access would clearly have depicted the life-threatening violence he experienced at the hands of C-Block members and his resulting need to respond with deadly 1', 'The C-Block gang derives its name from its base of operations around Congress Avenue on the south side of Providence, between Broad Street and Elmwood Avenue. 2', 'Detective A’Vant explained the distinction between a member and an associate of a gang. He said that a gang member is someone who is involved in all the gang’s criminal activities, including drive-bys and robberies—a member “rides and dies” with the gang. A gang associate, on the other hand, may be from the gang’s area or be a friend of gang members, but an associate does not necessarily participate in the gang’s crimes. Despite this loose affiliation, an associate of a gang risks being “labeled” as a member by rival gang members.', '-2- force when Vasquez and Rodriguez—purported members (or at least associates) of the gang— pulled a gun on him.', 'To effectively analyze defendant’s claim, it is first necessary to parse through defendant’s description of his tangled history with C-Block. In January of 2011, when he was sixteen years old, defendant went to see a girl. As he made his way into her home, a young male, who was later identified as a member of C-Block, pointed a gun at defendant and forced him to remove and hand over his pants, shirt, shoes, and watch. While defendant was in this state of undress, the C-Block member pistol-whipped defendant and demanded he leave the building. Needing no further invitation, defendant fled down the street. As he did, he was stopped by a Providence police officer. The defendant relayed to the officer that he had been robbed and beaten, and he later testified before a grand jury to that effect.', 'C-Block consequently labeled defendant as a snitch.', 'Members of the gang began following defendant; first at his high school, then at the Community College of Rhode Island. The defendant claims he was assaulted with a baseball bat on one occasion. Out of fear, however, defendant simply endured the harassment. He never again reported a C-Block member to the police.', 'In November of 2013, defendant was working at his mother’s restaurant, which is located on Elmwood Avenue just blocks away from C-Block’s main territory on Congress Avenue. Behind the restaurant, defendant said, he saw C-Block members approaching and that one of them was flashing a silver gun.3 The defendant jumped a fence and ran away as fast as he could. Despite his best efforts to escape, defendant was shot once in the back and once in the leg. He 3', 'The defendant said that the individuals were readily identifiable as members of the gang because of their black hooded sweatshirts, which bore the words “I think I’m Geek.” The defendant knew this to be a reference to a fallen C-Block member.', '-3- was forced to undergo surgery and remain in the hospital for over a week. When he recovered, defendant refused to cooperate with authorities during the prosecution of the C-Block member who was ultimately convicted and incarcerated for the shooting. The defendant maintained that he had learned his lesson after the 2011 robbery; he would not snitch on the gang again.', 'Despite his silence, defendant said that his troubles with C-Block continued. According to him, gang members knew that he worked nearby, and they continued to follow and harass him. On May 2, 2014, the day of Rodriguez’s death, defendant testified that he was sitting in his mother’s minivan outside the restaurant, waiting to make a delivery, when a green Subaru containing Rodriguez and Vasquez pulled up alongside his vehicle. The defendant testified that he knew both men from the local barbershop; he also declared that he knew them both to be C- Block members. According to defendant, Rodriguez drew his finger across his throat—a sign that defendant said he interpreted as a death threat. At that point, defendant drove off and picked up his friend, Nelson Pineda. The two drove around Providence, smoking marijuana and making deliveries for defendant’s mother.', 'The defendant said that, later that afternoon, as defendant and Pineda were in the area of the restaurant, they saw the same green Subaru approaching them. Rodriguez and Vasquez were still in the car. The driver of the Subaru tried to block defendant’s minivan at a stop sign, such that he could not turn left or right. Rodriguez emerged from the Subaru and yelled insults at defendant. Pineda later testified that defendant responded in a similar vein. The defendant was able to maneuver the minivan around the Subaru, but he said that, as he was pulling away, he heard a loud bang from the rear of the car and concluded that Rodriguez had hit the rear window.', '-4- Indeed, according to Pineda’s testimony, Rodriguez struck the minivan with what looked to him like the barrel of a gun.4 The defendant and Pineda got away, for the time being.', 'The defendant further testified that, at that point, having been confronted and threatened by Rodriguez twice in one day, he drove home and retrieved a gun. 5 Once back in the car, defendant said, he placed the gun to the right of the driver’s seat, hidden from Pineda’s view in the passenger seat. Pineda testified that he was too high from smoking marijuana to realize that they had stopped at defendant’s house or that defendant returned in possession of a gun. The two then went back to the restaurant.', 'Around 8 p.m., defendant and Pineda were driving around again. This time, they stopped on Warrington Street to roll blunts.6 The minivan was parked on top of a speed hump7 on the right side of the road, facing in the direction of Broad Street, with the engine and lights off and the keys still in the ignition. As defendant was finishing cracking open a cigar, he opened his window to discard the tobacco. It was then that he noticed headlights approaching. When he looked more closely, defendant said, he realized it was Rodriguez’s green Subaru yet again. Suddenly their open drivers’ windows were mere feet apart.', 'The testimony of the witnesses diverged as to what happened next. The defendant testified that he saw Rodriguez leaning forward while Vasquez pointed a gun at him from the passenger seat. Thinking he was about to die, defendant testified, he ducked down and grabbed the gun from the floor with his right hand. The defendant said that, while still crouching, he 4', 'It should be noted, however, that Pineda testified twice before the grand jury without mentioning either being present for the confrontation or witnessing Rodriguez with a gun. 5', 'The defendant testified that he had obtained the gun from a friend, Shaquele Padilla, in exchange for marijuana, which defendant admitted selling. 6', 'If one empties the contents of a cigar, it can be filled with marijuana and resealed.

The defendant then started the car and drove away, not knowing whether he had shot either Rodriguez or Vasquez. He said that he dropped Pineda off at his house. Pineda was called as a witness for the state; his testimony regarding the shooting substantially mirrored that of defendant.8', 'Vasquez, who was also called by the state, offered a markedly different version of events. He said that he and Rodriguez had spent the day simply driving around Providence smoking marijuana. Vasquez denied that any sort of verbal or physical altercation between defendant and Rodriguez had occurred earlier that day. According to Vasquez, neither he nor Rodriguez had a gun in the car when Rodriguez was killed. Vasquez claimed that, at the time of the shooting, he was high, reclined in the passenger seat, drinking a beer, staring into space, and dozing off. While Rodriguez was slowing down to cross the speed hump on Warrington Street, Vasquez said, he heard a sudden rapid succession of gunshots. As both men ducked, Vasquez testified, he looked to his left and saw Rodriguez, motionless and bleeding. Rodriguez was also unresponsive to Vasquez’s questions. Thinking that Rodriguez was dead, Vasquez—a fugitive from justice who had previously been convicted of carrying a pistol without a license—fled the vehicle and walked to a friend’s house. Vasquez said that he looked back only to find that Rodriguez still had not emerged from the stopped car. Vasquez claimed that he never saw who had fired at them and killed Rodriguez. 8', 'Pineda admitted that the first time he testified before the grand jury, he had denied being in defendant’s car during the shooting. His second version presented to the grand jury involved his telling defendant that he should have just fought Rodriguez rather than shooting him. Pineda’s testimony at trial that Vasquez pointed a gun at defendant, necessitating self-defense, was first shared with a defense investigator the night before the trial began. After Pineda failed to appear in court in response to a subpoena, the trial justice then issued a body attachment to ensure his presence.', '-6-', 'Ballistic evidence was introduced, and it lent further credence to Vasquez’s recounting of the shooting.', 'Detective Douglas Allin of the Providence Police Department’s Bureau of Criminal Identification testified that he recovered six cartridge casings clustered closely together around the speed hump on Warrington Street.', 'Farther down the street, toward Elmwood Avenue, Det. Allin discovered an expended projectile. Also, the processing of Rodriguez’s Subaru, which had come to rest against a building, yielded three more projectiles: one that was imbedded in the left rear bumper, which had entered the vehicle just underneath the taillight assembly; a second partial fragment that was lodged in the driver’s side rear door frame, which had entered directly above the molding; and a third in the glove compartment. That round had fragmented as it entered immediately above the glove compartment; copper jacketing from the projectile was found on the floor of the front passenger seat area. Detective Allin then proceeded to place a ballistic rod in the hole where the projectile entered above the glove compartment to test the trajectory from which it had been fired. He determined that the bullet had traveled through the open driver’s window at an acute angle and passed through the passenger cabin before penetrating the dashboard and coming to rest in the glove compartment.', 'Notably, Assistant Medical Examiner Priya Banerjee, M.D., testified that the bullet that killed Rodriguez entered the back of his neck and exited through his left eye orbit.9', 'Detective A’Vant testified that he was tasked with investigating who was responsible for the shooting of Rodriguez. After being informed of the suspect vehicle’s registration, as relayed by a witness who saw the minivan fleeing from the scene, Det. A’Vant learned that the vehicle was registered to defendant’s mother.', 'Police officers responded to her address—where defendant also resided—to set up surveillance. There, they arrested defendant’s brother, Johan 9', 'Before trial, the state and defendant stipulated that a DNA profile obtained from the projectile in the glove compartment matched that of Rodriguez.', '-7- Blandino, on a charge of driving with a suspended license. Johan, who was on bail for a pending firearm possession charge, was brought to the police station and interviewed by Det. A’Vant. The next day, Johan indicated that he had additional information to share with Det. A’Vant; he later informed the detective about the location of the murder weapon. In a bush in front of the home of defendant’s neighbor, Det. A’Vant uncovered a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson and an accompanying magazine.10 While in the vicinity, Det. A’Vant also saw, behind defendant’s house, the minivan used during the shooting. A warrant was issued for defendant’s arrest as a result of the investigation. After ten months on the run, defendant turned himself in to the Superior Court in February 2015.', 'II', 'Brady & Rule 16', 'During the trial, Det. A’Vant brought a notebook with him when he resumed the witness stand for cross-examination. He testified that it simply contained the notes he had been taking throughout the trial. Defense counsel then asked whether Det. A’Vant had taken notes during the course of his investigation. Detective A’Vant conceded that he had. As to the whereabouts of those notes, he testified that “I believe I have the notepad * * * in my file – folder.” Defense counsel responded, “If you could just provide that to me at some point, I’d like to see that.” The state immediately objected and asked for a sidebar. The trial justice sustained the objection at that point, but he indicated that the state could not be heard on the issue until a later time.', 'Under cross-examination, Det. A’Vant disclosed that, because of the drive-by nature of the shooting, he initially believed that it might be gang-related. Defense counsel inquired into 10', 'When Det. A’Vant searched the Providence Police database, he found a report of a stolen .40- caliber Smith & Wesson filed by Victor Padilla, the father of defendant’s friend, Shaquele Padilla.', '-8- whether Det. A’Vant had pursued that theory. It was then revealed that Det. A’Vant had indeed interviewed members of C-Block. He did so because he was aware that Rodriguez had been associated with C-Block at some point in his life and that defendant previously had been shot and robbed by members of the gang.', 'However, Det. A’Vant testified that he did not take notes of all those interviews and that he could not recall if the information gleaned from those interviews had been recorded in any police reports. As Det. A’Vant explained, “[t]here is a lot of information that’s relevant to this case, and all of that is recorded. Certainly, there’s conversations that I have with dozens of people when I conduct investigations. Not all of that is recorded, no, if I don’t deem it to be pertinent to the case.” He testified that he did not consider his C-Block interviews to be important enough to record because “any hearsay or anyone who believed that the victim was part of a gang, associated with a gang, or was a gang member, it wasn’t necessarily pertinent to me * * *, whether they’re a gang member or not, that’s not important to the investigation.” Detective A’Vant summed up his role as an investigator as follows:', '“I’m not building a case for defense when I’m putting a case', 'together.', 'I’m building a case that’s based on facts and', 'circumstances that prove or disprove the guilt or innocence of your', 'client.

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). See DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 570 (R.I. 2011) (“[T]he Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court in Brady * * *, and its progeny, ‘requires that the state provide a criminal defendant with certain information.’” (quoting State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 229 (R.I. 2008))); State v. Briggs, 886 A.2d 735, 754 (R.I. 2005) (“When a criminal', '- 10 - defendant requests discovery material concerning witnesses the state may call to testify at trial, Rule 16 obligates the state to produce ‘only prior recorded statements of a witness, a summary of the witness’s expected trial testimony, and any records of prior convictions.’” (quoting State v. Chalk, 816 A.2d 413, 418 (R.I. 2002))).', 'It is clear from the record that defense counsel did not know what he was looking for in Det. A’Vant’s notes when he first requested to see them.', 'Indeed, none of Det. A’Vant’s testimony relating to C-Block and his investigation into the possibility that Rodriguez’s murder might have been gang-related had yet been elicited. At that juncture, all defense counsel knew was that Det. A’Vant had taken notes during his investigation; defense counsel was merely hoping to find something useful in those notes. In fact, even at the sidebar—when defense counsel actually had more information available to him as to the potential contents of the notes— he argued only that Det. A’Vant was not the appropriate person to decide what material was relevant and what should be provided to defendant. It was the state, in its objection, that raised Rule 16, arguing that the discovery rule does not require the disclosure of investigative notes. And it was the trial justice, in making his ultimate ruling, who raised the ever-looming Brady issue. The defendant never so much as mentioned either Rule 16 or Brady, let alone argued that either required the state to produce Det. A’Vant’s notes. Accordingly, no Brady or Rule 16 argument has been preserved for appeal. See State v. Yon, 161 A.3d 1118, 1128 (R.I. 2017) (“The raise-or-waive rule ‘imposes upon litigants a duty to raise all their claims for relief in the trial court and properly articulate them to a judge for a ruling.’” (emphasis added) (quoting D’Alessio v.

Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) requires the state “to turn over information that ‘(1) constitute[s] either exculpatory or impeachment evidence and (2) [is] material to the outcome of the case or sentencing.’” State v. Burnham, 58 A.3d 889, 900 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Wyche, 518 A.2d 907, 909 (R.I. 1986)). The defendant has failed to satisfy even the first prong. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Det. A’Vant’s notes contained any exculpatory or impeachment evidence whatsoever.', 'Nor did Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure entitle defendant to comb through Det. A’Vant’s notes. Rhode Island has “one of the most liberal discovery mechanisms in the United States.” State v. Huffman, 68 A.3d 558, 568 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Oster, 922 A.2d 151, 163 (R.I. 2007)). Notwithstanding this liberality, investigation notes of a testifying detective are not explicitly covered by Rule 16. See Rule 16; State v. Briggs, 886 A.2d 735, 754 (R.I. 2005). “But the state’s discovery obligations extend beyond the literal language of Rule 16 * * *.” DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 570 (R.I. 2011). This Court has held that “[w]hen evidence * * * may nonetheless be helpful to [the] defendant’s effective cross- examination of a witness, a defendant’s right to that evidence arises from the right of confrontation, and thus becomes an issue ‘only when a defendant is improperly denied the ability to confront and to effectively cross-examine an adverse witness at trial.’” State v. Chalk, 816 A.2d 413, 418 (R.I. 2002) (quoting State v. Kelly, 554 A.2d 632, 635 (R.I. 1989)).', 'Here, defendant was not denied the ability to searchingly cross-examine Det. A’Vant on any and all issues pertaining to C-Block. Defense counsel elicited testimony that Det. A’Vant was aware that defendant had been robbed, beaten, followed, threatened, and shot by C-Block members over the course of the three years leading up to the murder; further, Det. A’Vant was aware that Rodriguez had at least been associated with that very gang in the past. The types of questions defense counsel asked during cross-examination of Det. A’Vant certainly were not “improperly restricted” by the absence of the detective’s investigation notes. State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 469 (R.I. 1998) (quoting Kelly, 554 A.2d at 635).

This requires a three-step analytical process “whereby the trial justice must ‘(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” State v.

Staffier, 21 A.3d 287, 290 (R.I. 2011)).', 'As long as the trial justice follows this procedure and articulates “a sufficient rationale for denying [the motion], the decision will be given great weight.

Muralles, 154 A.3d 925, 932 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013)).', 'B', 'Analysis', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice clearly erred by overlooking and misconceiving material evidence in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. First, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred because he credited the testimony of Vasquez that he did not have a gun in his possession on the night of the murder. In light of Vasquez’s history as a gang member and', '- 13 - fugitive from justice, to say nothing of the firearm-possession conviction on his record, defendant claims that Vasquez could not have been characterized as a more credible witness than either defendant or Pineda. Therefore, according to defendant, the trial justice should have accepted the testimony of Pineda and defendant that Vasquez indeed pointed a gun at defendant. Second, defendant maintains that the trial justice erred in finding that defendant’s explanation of the shooting did not match the ballistic evidence. To the contrary, defendant argues that his testimony wholly accounts for and diminishes the ballistic evidence used against him. Finally, defendant avers that the trial justice erred in discrediting the testimony of Pineda and Johan Blandino due to their shifting stories.', 'Their inconsistencies, defendant claims, are readily explained away by the same fear of C-Block that led defendant to remain silent when he was shot by a member of the gang.', 'The trial justice outlined his responsibilities in passing on a motion for a new trial, beginning first with his consideration of the evidence in light of the jury instructions. In so doing, he recognized that the case could be distilled to one issue: whether defendant fired on Rodriguez in self-defense.', 'The trial justice then proceeded to independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. He began with Vasquez:', '“I recognize that Vasquez arrived on the stand with a fair', 'amount of baggage, including a prior conviction for unlawfully', 'carrying a pistol. He also admitted that he had spent the day', 'smoking marijuana, but that apparently is how every witness,', 'including the defendant, spent their days.', 'In my view,', 'notwithstanding all of his warts and blemishes, Vasquez was a', 'credible witness.” The trial justice next considered Johan’s credibility. Acknowledging the witness’s awkward position in having to testify against his brother, the trial justice nonetheless found his failures of', '- 14 - memory to be “painfully and obviously perjurious.” And the trial justice found that Pineda “wasn’t much better.”', 'The trial justice discussed the fact that Pineda, between his two appearances before the grand jury and one at trial, had provided three different versions of events. The second version, in fact, was to the effect that he had said to defendant after the shooting that defendant “didn’t have to shoot [Rodriguez], just could have fought him.” As the trial justice remarked, “[s]o much for the claim of self-defense.” The trial justice concluded that neither Johan nor Pineda had helped defendant; “[i]ndeed, their testimony at trial was antithetical to the defendant’s interest.”', 'Turning to defendant’s credibility as a witness, the trial justice recited the following language from this Court:', '“[W]hen a defendant elects to testify, he runs the very real risk that', 'if disbelieved, the trier of fact may conclude that the opposite of', 'his testimony is the truth. * * * As long as there exists some other', 'evidence of the defendant’s guilt, disbelief of a defendant’s sworn', 'testimony is sufficient to sustain a finding of guilt.” State v.', 'Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1109 (R.I. 1992). In that regard, the trial justice found that “the defendant’s explanation at trial of how he fired the weapon was simply, in my view, and obviously so from this verdict and the jury’s view, wholly unacceptable. The physical evidence just does not fit the defendant’s explanation.” First of all, the trial justice opined that, if defendant had fired the gun as he demonstrated during his testimony, the cartridge casings would have been within his vehicle, not outside of it on the speed hump. The trial justice further noted that the bullet holes in the rear of Rodriguez’s car and the fatal shot that entered the back of Rodriguez’s neck did not correspond with the driver’s- window-to-driver’s-window shooting that defendant described.', 'The trial justice summed up his assessment of the evidence as follows:', '- 15 -', '“The physical evidence clearly reflects that the defendant', 'must have had his arm extended through the driver’s window and', 'aimed down the roadway as Rodriguez’s car was leaving the speed', 'bump.', '“There is little question in my mind that the defendant had', 'parked his van on the speed bump expecting, or at least hoping, he', 'would spot Rodriguez, whom he claimed had been harassing him', 'most of the day. The defendant had gone home to retrieve his gun,', 'and he was lying in wait for Rodriguez. And when the opportunity', 'finally presented itself, he took advantage of it and shot into', 'Rodriguez’s car deliberately, purposefully, and with the specific', 'intent of killing him. This was in no way self-defense, and I reject', 'that claim, as did the jury.', '“I am well satisfied that the State easily and beyond a', 'reasonable doubt demonstrated that the defendant did not act in', 'self-defense. No gun was found in Rodriguez’s car, and I', 'disbelieve any suggestion by the defendant and by Nelson Pineda', 'that there ever was a gun in the Rodriguez car.” Agreeing with the jury’s verdict, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'It is clear to us that the trial justice followed the well-settled three-step analytical process set forth in our jurisprudence.

His decision is thus due great weight.
