0,State : v. : Luis Barrios.,reversal,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Luis Barrios, was convicted by a jury on two counts of second-degree sexual assault, and he has appealed from that conviction. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On September 16, 2010, the state filed a criminal information charging defendant with two counts of second-degree sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4 and one count of simple assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3.1 1', 'It is clear from the record that the simple assault charge related to the throwing of a cup of soda against the leg of the complaining witness.', '-1-', 'In due course, a jury trial was held over five days in October and November of 2011. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial', '1.', 'The Testimony of the Complaining Witness', 'The complaining witness, Anna,2 testified that, on July 22, 2010, she went to a pub in North Providence at approximately 10 p.m. with friends; one of those friends was a woman to whom we refer as Cathy. It was the testimony of Anna that she shared two pitchers of beer with Cathy and another friend and that, in addition, she and Cathy each consumed a shot of alcohol. Anna further testified that, although Cathy left the pub earlier in the evening, she remained there until shortly before the closing of the establishment at 1 a.m. (i.e., early in the morning of July 23).', 'Anna testified that, upon leaving the pub, she commenced the approximately five minute walk back to Cathy’s home at 43 George Street in North Providence, where she was then living. She responded in the affirmative when asked on direct examination whether, when she left the pub alone, she was “aware of [her] senses” and knew what was “going on around” her; and she responded in the negative when asked if she had experienced any difficulty with her vision or was “falling down.” She testified that, as she was walking along George Street in an area which she described as being “well-lit,” a dark colored car approached; she added that there were “some boys” in the car, which was “inching along” beside her. She further testified that the occupants of the car were “propositioning” her and saying “sexual things” to her. She stated that 2', 'In order to protect their privacy, we shall refer to the complaining witness by the pseudonym “Anna” and to her friend by the pseudonym “Cathy.” See State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 101 n. 2 (R.I. 2013); State v. Adefusika, 989 A.2d 467, 470 n. 1 (R.I. 2010).', '-2- she looked over at the car for “a second” and noticed that it contained two males—one in the passenger seat and the other in the driver’s seat, both of whom were unknown to her. She also stated that she was able to see the faces of the two occupants of the car and that she “just kept walking away.”', 'Anna further testified that she then “heard a car door” and that, while she was in front of 35 George Street (which she said was two houses away from Cathy’s home), someone came up behind her and began walking alongside her. She stated: “I looked [at him]. He was talking to me, telling me that he wanted to take me home with him.” She testified that the man said that he resided on George Street.', 'She further testified that he was walking right next to her for approximately twenty seconds and that she concentrated on his face at that time. She stated that she recognized him as one of the males whom she had seen in the car; she added that his hair was “really spiked” and that he “looked like an Asian * * * .” It was further her testimony that she was “very nervous” and that she started walking faster. She described what happened next as follows:', '“[I] told him I didn’t want anything to do with it. So he grabbed', 'me by my crotch over my clothes and, so I broke away from him.', 'He quickly grabbed me again, grabbed my chest. * * * I just', 'started running really fast * * * .”', 'Anna then went on to testify that, when she reached Cathy’s driveway, her attacker threw a Taco Bell cup containing soda at her, striking her on the back of her leg. Anna testified that she ran into Cathy’s George Street home whereupon a call was placed to 911.3 Anna stated that, when the police responded to the 911 call, she recounted the incident to them and provided a description of the person who she said had assaulted her. She testified that the police thereafter 3', 'A recording of the 911 call at 1:01 a.m. on July 23, 2010 was entered as a full exhibit at trial, over defense counsel’s objection.', '-3- drove her to 35 George Street, where officers escorted a man (who, according to the testimony of Detective Frank DelSanto, was one Fernando Justiniano4) to the car and asked her if he was the person who had attacked her. It was her testimony that she told the police that he was not her attacker but that she had seen him in the car with the person who attacked her.', 'She stated that the police then took her to a residence on nearby Morgan Avenue in North Providence, where she observed the same car that had pulled up alongside her on George Street. She testified that the police then brought a man from the residence to the driveway; she stated that, even though the police shone a light on the man’s face, she could not identify him from the place where the police car in which she was sitting was positioned. She further testified, however, that, when the police brought the man closer to the police car, she was able to identify him as her attacker. At trial, she identified a photograph of defendant’s car and testified that it was the same car that had pulled up alongside her on the night of the incident at issue; she also identified a photograph of defendant as her attacker (the photograph having been taken on the morning of July 23), but she was not asked to identify him in court.', '2.', 'The Testimony of Detective DelSanto', 'North Providence Det. Frank DelSanto testified that, on July 23, 2011, he was dispatched to 43 George Street for the purpose of investigating an alleged sexual assault. He testified that, upon arriving at that location, he spoke with Anna, whom he observed to be “hysterical,” “shaking,” and “very upset.” He stated that, although he could detect “a small slight amount of alcoholic beverage on her breath,” she did not have any difficulty speaking; he added that her speech was not slurred and that he could understand her. 4', 'The record indicates that Fernando Justiniano did not testify at trial. The defendant testified that Mr. Justiniano had left the country after he (defendant) was arrested and that his repeated attempts to contact Mr. Justiniano had been unsuccessful.', '-4-', 'Detective DelSanto testified that Anna described the vehicle driven by her attacker. He further testified that she described her attacker as being an “Asian male” with “spiked hair,” which was “heavily jelled [sic];” he also acknowledged that she answered in the affirmative when he asked her whether her attacker could have been Hispanic. Detective DelSanto testified that it was he who drove Anna to the George Street and Morgan Avenue addresses, and he corroborated her testimony with respect to her identification of defendant as her attacker (after he was brought closer to the police car), stating that she manifested “no hesitation.”', 'The detective also stated that the police seized a Taco Bell cup from underneath a vehicle in Cathy’s driveway. He described that driveway as having been “sandy” and the cup as having been “wet” and “squashed;” and he then stated that, “based on [his] training and experience with respect to surfaces and conduciveness of lifting prints,” he decided not to have the cup fingerprinted because of “the poor quality of the cup.” Detective DelSanto testified at trial that defendant was the same man as Anna had identified on July 23 as her attacker.', '3.', 'The Testimony of Defendant', 'The defendant, Luis Barrios, testified in his own defense. He testified that, at some point in time late on July 22, 2010 or early on July 23, 2010, he drove his car with his former friend Fernando Justiniano to a Taco Bell establishment. He further testified that, while he did not buy anything at the Taco Bell, Mr. Justiniano purchased both a meal and a soda; defendant added that he then proceeded to drive Mr. Justiniano to the latter’s home at 35 George Street.', 'The defendant further testified that, while driving on George Street, after midnight, he saw a female, who he believed to be intoxicated, walking along the street. He stated:', '“When I stopped at the stop sign on the first half of George Street,', 'a female approached my car and asked me, do I know you? * * * I', 'kept driving past the stop sign.”', '-5- The defendant further stated:', '“[Mr. Justiniano] told me, ask her if she wants a ride, ask her if she', 'wants to come home with us. I looked at him like he was crazy. I', 'asked him why would I ever do that, and he just kind of stood', 'quiet.” It was defendant’s testimony that he subsequently pulled the car into Mr. Justiniano’s driveway and that, after Mr. Justiniano exited the car (taking his soda from Taco Bell with him), he returned home to Morgan Avenue. The defendant denied having sexually assaulted Anna.', 'The defendant also testified that, when the police arrived at his home approximately thirty to forty minutes after he went to bed, which he did shortly after arriving home, he was escorted by police officers to the “top of [his] driveway,” where they shone a light on his face. He further testified that the police car was at the end of his driveway, roughly twenty feet from where he was positioned, and that he heard an officer step out of the police car and say, “She cannot I.D. him.” It was additionally his testimony that he was then brought closer to the police car by the officers until he was roughly “three, three and a half feet” away from it; he stated that at that point he observed an officer sitting next to a woman whose hands were over her face and whose head was in her lap.5 He testified that “one of the police officers whispered something in the woman’s ear” and that he then heard an officer say “positive I.D.” He further stated that he was “positive” that the woman did “not look at [him] for one second.”6 The defendant stated 5', 'Detective DelSanto testified that he had instructed Anna to keep her head down and to then raise her head when he told her to do so. He stated: “At that point when [defendant was moved closer to the car], I said raise your head, look to the left, and that’s when he was positively identified.” 6', 'Although defendant’s testimony with respect to Anna’s identification of him was corroborated by the testimony of his stepsister, the state called as a rebuttal witness North Providence Police Officer Christopher Puleo, who had observed Anna’s identification of defendant at the latter’s residence on Morgan Avenue. Officer Puleo’s testimony was consistent with the testimony of both Anna and Det. DelSanto. He testified that Det. DelSanto was in the', '-6- that he was arrested at that time and that he then asked the police to fingerprint the Taco Bell cup which the police told him had been thrown at the complaining witness because he believed it might exonerate him.', 'A photograph of Mr. Justiniano and defendant taken in 2010, in which they are shown standing side by side, was entered into evidence at trial; after being shown that photograph, defendant testified that he and Mr. Justiniano appeared “not much different” from each other physically. He added that Mr. Justiniano was “maybe half an inch” taller than he and that, at the time of the alleged attack, both he and Mr. Justiniano wore their hair in the style which he characterized as a “Mohawk.” He further stated that, early on the morning of July 23, 2010, he had been wearing “dark jeans, pants [sic], dress shoes, [and a] purple dress shirt” and that Mr. Justiniano had been wearing a white dress shirt and jeans. However, he proceeded to testify that, by the time that Anna identified him in his driveway, he had changed and was then wearing a white shirt and jean shorts. The defendant has consistently contended that Anna mistakenly identified him rather than Mr. Justiniano as her attacker. On appeal, defendant argues that they resemble each other physically—specifically, with respect to their “age, distinctive hair style, hair color, race, height, and weight.” He also emphasizes that, when he was identified by Anna, he was wearing a white shirt, the same color shirt as Mr. Justiniano was wearing when defendant dropped him off at his home on the morning of July 23. driver’s seat of the police car. He stated that Det. DelSanto never exited the police car and that he did not see him whispering to Anna. He added that Anna was seated in the rear of the car by herself; he further testified that, although her head had been in her lap, there came a point in time when he saw her look up and identify defendant.', '-7-', 'B', 'The Verdict, the Motion for a New Trial, and the Sentencing', 'On November 2, 2011, a jury found defendant guilty on Counts One and Two (both charging second-degree sexual assault), but it acquitted him on Count Three (charging simple assault).', 'Subsequently, on November 8, 2011, defendant moved for a new trial; defendant argued that the “most significant” fact giving rise to reasonable doubt as to his guilt was the absence of an in-court identification of him by Anna. The defendant argued that the testimony of Anna, Det. DelSanto, Officer Puleo, and Cathy was contradictory. He also contended that the police department’s investigation of the incident was flawed in that the police had not fingerprinted the Taco Bell cup and had not conducted a side by side identification process. The defendant maintained that he was innocent and that, if anyone had attacked Anna, it was Mr. Justiniano. The trial justice ultimately denied defendant’s motion. In due course, defendant was sentenced to concurrent three year terms of imprisonment on each of the two counts on which he had been found guilty; the trial justice ordered that the sentences be suspended, with probation.', 'The defendant filed a timely appeal to this Court. On appeal, defendant challenges only the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because “reasonable minds could not differ regarding the evidence and the reasonable inferences drawn therefrom in this case” and because the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the person who sexually', '-8- assaulted Anna. The defendant submits that the evidence tended to establish that Mr. Justiniano was the “likely culprit,” and defendant asserts that what he considers to be Anna’s “misidentification” of him was caused by her consumption of alcohol and the similarity of his physical appearance to that of Mr. Justiniano.', ""When a trial justice considers a motion for a new trial, he or she “acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 947 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Wray, 38 A.3d 1102, 1108 (R.I. 2012); State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 121 (R.I. 2006). In carrying out that role, “the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Silva, 84 A.3d 411, 416 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 30 (R.I. 2013); State v. Perkins, 966 A.2d 1257, 1260 (R.I. 2009). If, after conducting that three-step process of independent review, “the trial justice agrees with the jury's verdict or determines that reasonable minds could differ, then the analysis is complete and the verdict should be affirmed.” State v. Harrison, 66 A.3d 432, 445 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Rosario, 35 A.3d at 947; State v. DeOliveira, 972 A.2d 653, 665 (R.I. 2009)."", 'This Court has “indicated that the record should reflect a few sentences of the [trial] justice’s reasoning on each point.” State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 870 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have further stated that, “[i]n providing a rationale for a decision * * * the trial justice need * * * only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern', '-9- whether the [trial] justice has applied the appropriate standards.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'On appellate review, “[i]f the trial justice has complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, his or her decision will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 842 (R.I. 2013); Harrison, 66 A.3d at 445.', 'It is clear to us that the trial justice in the instant case set forth and applied the correct standard in reviewing defendant’s motion for a new trial. First, the trial justice considered the evidence presented at trial in light of the jury charge, giving special attention to the testimony of the complaining witness, Anna. The trial justice expressly acknowledged defendant’s contention that this was a case of mistaken identity, and he recognized that “the verdict turned on the jury’s assessment of the credibility of the complaining witness * * * [,] in particular, the reliability of her identification of Mr. Barrios as the person who assaulted her * * * .” In accordance with the second step in the process of analyzing a motion for a new trial, the trial justice then independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. The trial justice made comprehensive findings on the record setting forth his reasons for denying defendant’s motion.', 'When addressing defendant’s claim that Anna was intoxicated and thus could not identify him, the trial justice noted that “she insisted that despite her drinking, when this assault occurred, she was possessed of all her senses;” the trial justice found that insistence on her part to be corroborated by the testimony of Cathy and Det. DelSanto, as well as by the sound of Anna’s voice on the 911 tape. The trial justice concluded that: “[N]either I nor the jury, apparently, was', '- 10 - persuaded that she had [drunk] to an extent that it rendered her perception of what occurred and who did it on the evening in question unreliable.” With respect to Anna’s identification of defendant, the trial justice stated that her identification of him was “unequivocal” and found as follows:', '“The defendant fits the description, particularly when you view the', 'way he looked on the day of the incident as depicted by the', 'photograph that was displayed on the screen and [Anna] identified.', '* * * [I]t may be a bit unusual that no in-court identification was', 'proffered, but that doesn’t change the fact that there was evidence', 'that that was the photograph of Mr. Barrios and that was the way', 'he looked on the evening in question.”', 'The trial justice then considered the testimony of defendant and his stepsister with respect to the circumstances surrounding Anna’s identification of defendant as her attacker at defendant’s home on Morgan Avenue. He ultimately found the testimony of both defendant and his stepsister not to be credible, whereas he found the testimony of Detective DelSanto and Officer Puleo “in terms of their relating of what transpired at Morgan Avenue, to be credible and truthful.”', 'The trial justice significantly concluded pursuant to the third step of his independent review that “reasonable minds could differ as to the defendant’s guilt or innocence.” Then, in accordance with well-established legal principles, the trial justice subsequently denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. See State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765 (R.I. 2011) (stating that if, after conducting the required analysis, “the trial justice * * * determines that, based upon the evidence, reasonable minds could differ as to the proper outcome, then the inquiry is at an end and the motion for a new trial should be denied”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In our judgment, the trial justice properly carried out his role as the metaphorical thirteenth juror, conducting the required three-step analysis before denying defendant’s motion', '- 11 - for a new trial. Although defendant attempts to cast doubt on Anna’s identification of him, importantly, the trial justice expressly found that, after considering Anna’s alcohol consumption, the presence of street lights, her proximity to the assailant, and the description which she gave to the police, he was not persuaded that her perception of what had occurred was unreliable. 7 In rendering his decision, the trial justice reviewed all of the testimony and evidence at trial, and he ultimately found Anna to be credible.', 'As we have noted, the trial justice concluded that “reasonable minds could differ” as to defendant’s guilt and that, in his opinion, the jury’s guilty verdict was “supported by the evidence.”', ""This Court has stated on several occasions that we afford “a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.” Paola, 59 A.3d at 106 (internal quotation marks omitted). Bearing in mind the deferential standard of review that governs our scrutiny of a trial justice's findings and conclusions in this context, we are unable to rule that the trial justice in this close and credibility- intensive case was either clearly wrong or that he overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence in his denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial. See Clay, 79 A.3d at 842; State v. Adefusika, 989 A.2d 467, 481 (R.I. 2010). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice properly denied the defendant’s motion. 7"", 'This Court has discussed the relationship between witness credibility and witness reliability.

We have specifically stated that, when ruling on a new trial motion, the trial justice “must also determine to what extent reliability affects the witnesses’ credibility and what weight should be given to their testimony.” Luanglath, 749 A.2d at 6.

1,State : v. : Wilson Rodriguez. :,reversal,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on writ of certiorari on January 22, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided.1 The defendant, Wilson Rodriguez (defendant or Rodriguez), appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury verdict finding him guilty of one count of delivery of a controlled substance, to wit cocaine. After the trial justice heard, and denied, the defendant’s motion for a new trial, he sentenced the defendant to five years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with one year to serve and four years suspended with probation. Before this Court, the defendant raises a bevy of issues, all of which lack merit. The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in: (1) his denial of the defendant’s motion in limine to bar the testimony of Detectives Louis Stravato (Det. Stravato) and Anthony Hampton (Det. Hampton); (2) his charge to the jury; (3) his failure to include certain portions of testimony during a read back to the jury; (4) his denial of the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal; and (5) his denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial. 1', 'The defendant filed a petition for certiorari after his appeal was dismissed by the Superior Court for failure to properly perfect his appeal.', '-1- After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. We affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On February 26, 2008, Providence Police Detectives Stravato and Hampton were investigating defendant for possible narcotics violations. Detective Stravato testified that they set up a surveillance because they “had information that [defendant] was * * * a narcotics dealer, specifically crack cocaine.” The detectives observed defendant exiting a home on Barry Road in Providence with an elderly gentleman—later determined to be defendant’s father—and drive off in a white Acura. The detectives proceeded to follow defendant.', 'Eventually, after passing through portions of Cranston and Warwick, the surveillance led the detectives to the parking lot of the Rhode Island Mall in Warwick. The detectives parked thirty to forty feet away from defendant’s vehicle and saw another vehicle park next to defendant’s vehicle; both vehicles were facing in the same direction. Detective Stravato then saw the passenger of the second vehicle—later identified as Pamela Sherman (Sherman)—throw “crumbled currency, crumbled in a ball” into defendant’s car and then defendant threw what appeared to be cocaine into the car occupied by Sherman. The two cars then exited the parking lot, and the detectives followed the car in which Sherman was a passenger because, according to Det. Stravato, they had already “identified [defendant] so we weren’t concerned about, you know, particularly apprehending him at that point.”', 'The Providence police detectives stopped the Sherman vehicle after it had entered West Warwick. Detective Hampton removed Sherman from the car and asked her about drugs in her vehicle. Sherman admitted that the drugs were in a pack of cigarettes inside the vehicle. The', '-2- pack of cigarettes contained a bag of suspected crack cocaine. It was seized and turned over to Detective Sergeant Lavigne of the West Warwick Police Department. Sherman was arrested by the West Warwick Police and charged with drug possession. The suspected narcotics were field- tested at the West Warwick police headquarters and tested positive for cocaine. 2 Eventually, on March 11, 2008, defendant was arrested by the Providence police on the basis of a Warwick Police Department arrest warrant with an affidavit signed by a member of the Providence Police Department and was later transferred to the custody of the Warwick Police Department.', 'In a pretrial ruling, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion in limine to preclude trial testimony of Detectives Stravato and Hampton on the grounds that the Providence police lacked jurisdictional authority to conduct a surveillance outside of Providence’s city limits without informing the local police departments, and that the Providence police had no authority to seize suspected narcotics from Sherman. The trial justice rejected defendant’s argument, observing that the detectives did not arrest defendant outside of Providence, but merely conducted surveillance of defendant. Furthermore, the trial justice noted that there was no authority that suggested that the detectives’ actions were in violation of state law.', 'The case was reached for trial on January 4, 2010. The state called several witnesses in support of its case, including Det. Stravato, Det. Hampton, and Sherman. The state rested on January 5, 2010; and the next day, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal. The trial justice denied the motion, concluding that the state had submitted evidence supporting all of the elements of the charged offense. The defense rested without presenting any evidence. After the trial justice instructed the jury, defendant raised a number of objections to the jury charge, all of which were denied by the trial justice. 2', 'The state crime laboratory later confirmed that the substance in the plastic bag was cocaine.', '-3-', 'During its deliberations on the afternoon of January 6, 2010, the jury submitted the following question to the trial justice: “What body parts did the following witnesses say they saw coming from the defendant’s car?”', 'The question listed Det. Stravato, Det. Hampton, and Sherman as the pertinent witnesses about whom the jury inquired. The trial adjourned for the day to enable the stenographer to find the responsive testimony.', 'The next day, the trial justice read back the following two excerpts from the testimony of Det. Stravato: (1) Q: “Now, did you see any part of his body perform that action, is what I’m asking?” A: “Yes, his left hand.” and (2) Q: “Okay. Can you tell us what you observed next?” A: “I observed Mr. Rodriguez’s hand, um, come through his window of his vehicle and toss into her vehicle a, um, small bag of suspected crack cocaine.”', 'However, the trial justice refused defendant’s request to read a portion of Det. Stravato’s cross-examination testimony in which he testified that he did not see defendant’s hand outside of his car at a particular point in time. The trial justice determined “that the request of the jury is specifically as to body parts coming from the defendant’s car.” Therefore, the trial justice concluded that the read back requested by defendant was “not in the positive. It’s not something coming from the car. He said he didn’t see anything coming from the car at that time.” Thus, the trial justice declined to read back that portion of Det. Stravato’s testimony as it was not responsive to the jury’s question. Later that day, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of delivery of a controlled substance.', 'The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and also that the trial justice had committed an error of law when he refused to read back the requested portion of Det. Stravato’s testimony to the jury. The trial justice denied both bases of defendant’s motion. The defendant was later sentenced to five years, with one year to serve and four years suspended with probation.', '-4-', 'Analysis', 'Motion in Limine', 'This Court “review[s] the grant or denial of a motion in limine for an abuse of discretion.” State v. Marte, 92 A.3d 148, 150 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Fravala v. City of Cranston ex rel. Baron, 996 A.2d 696, 702 (R.I. 2010)). “When reviewing the grant or denial of a motion in limine, this Court will consider only whether the challenged evidence was proper and admissible and, if not, whether there was sufficient prejudice to constitute reversible error.” State v. Scanlon, 982 A.2d 1268, 1274 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 111 (R.I. 2005)).', 'The defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in denying his motion in limine seeking to exclude the testimony of Providence Detectives Stravato and Hampton because they were outside of their jurisdiction when they observed the alleged criminal conduct in Warwick. The defendant argues that G.L. 1956 § 12-7-19 and G.L. 1956 § 45-42-1 impose an obligation upon police to contact local authorities from the cities and towns when making an arrest outside their jurisdiction. By extension, defendant contends that the same obligation applied to Detectives Stravato and Hampton during their surveillance. Thus, defendant asserts that the surveillance was illegal and the testimony derived therefrom should have been excluded.', 'This argument ignores our recent holding in State v. Morris, 92 A.3d 920, 926 (R.I. 2014), where we stated “that the Pawtucket police could properly travel outside of their jurisdiction without the accompaniment of Providence police in the course of investigating the robberies.”', 'As Detectives Stravato and Hampton were merely conducting surveillance of defendant—that began in Providence—and they did not arrest him at that time, the detectives', '-5- were not required to contact the authorities of the cities and towns through which they traveled. See id.', 'Furthermore, the detectives did not follow defendant out of the parking lot, but rather pursued Sherman.', 'Thus, even if Sherman had been arrested outside of the detectives’ jurisdiction, defendant has no standing to challenge her arrest because the Fourth Amendment is a personal right and defendant would have no expectation of privacy in the search that was conducted. See State v. Quinlan, 921 A.2d 96, 109 (R.I. 2007) (“A party has standing when he or she is found to have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched or the thing seized.” citing State v.

Vargas, 991 A.2d 1056, 1060 (R.I. 2010)). “[W]e examine the challenged portion in the context in which it was delivered to ascertain how a jury composed of ordinary, intelligent lay people would have understood the instructions.” State v. Sivo, 809 A.2d 481, 488 (R.I. 2002). “A ‘trial justice is bound to ensure that the jury charge sufficiently addresses the requested instructions and correctly states the applicable law.’” Long, 61 A.3d at 445 (quoting State v.

We note at the outset that defendant failed to specifically identify the portions of the jury instructions that he is contesting on appeal.', 'The defendant’s argument contesting the jury charge has not been sufficiently developed for this Court to review. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n.19 (R.I. 2007). Nonetheless, from our review of the trial transcript, it is abundantly clear that the instructions provided by the trial justice properly instructed the jurors on the applicable law and the state’s burden of proof. It was not necessary that the term “beyond a reasonable doubt” be repeated throughout the instructions, but rather, that the meaning of “beyond a reasonable doubt” must adequately be conveyed to the jury. See State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1030, 1033 (R.I. 2007) (holding that the trial justice is “not obligated to use the specific words requested by [the] defendant” so long as the trial justice “adequately cover[s] the law”).

Dumas, 835 A.2d 438, 443 (R.I. 2003)). “The trial justice generally should honor such a request, ‘especially when it is practically possible to do so without consuming an inordinate amount of time and without misleading the jury.’” Id. (quoting Dumas, 835 A.2d at 443). Furthermore, a read back must be both fair and impartial; thus, “it should include all testimony pertaining to the subject matter of the jury request.” Id. (citing Dumas, 835 A.2d at 444).', '-7-', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred when, in response to the question posed by the jury, he did not read back the following excerpt: Q: “Was Mr. Rodriguez’s, I assume, left hand outside the window?” A: “Not at that point.” The trial justice determined that this excerpt was not within the purview of the question posed by the jury because it did not relate to what parts of defendant’s body the witnesses “saw coming from the defendant’s car[.]”', 'We discern no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice in excluding the challenged portion of Det. Stravato’s testimony. While the testimony implies that Det. Stravato saw defendant’s hand at some other point, it was not responsive to the question that was posed by the jury. It is well settled that “[t]he trial justice has considerable discretion in how to respond to a request.” Ros, 973 A.2d at 1176. Here, the trial justice determined that the challenged testimony was not responsive, particularly in light of the fact that the question called for an answer as to when defendant’s body parts were coming from the vehicle, and the challenged testimony related to a point when defendant’s hand was not observed outside the vehicle. We previously have stated that “[w]hen a jury makes a request for information, the response should be tailored to the request.” Id. We are satisfied that the response provided by the trial justice was appropriately tailored to the request of the jury, and it was within his sound discretion to decline to read back the portion requested by defendant.', 'Motion for a New Trial and Judgment of Acquittal', '“When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v.

Stravato’s testimony. The defendant contends that the detectives’ credibility was first called into question because they knowingly allowed defendant to drive even though they had probable cause to arrest him for operating the vehicle without a valid license. Additionally, defendant asserts that there were inconsistencies between the testimony of the detectives as to where in the parking lot the delivery took place.', 'Although the trial justice acknowledged the minor inconsistencies between the testimony of Detectives Stravato and Hampton, he also found that, to the extent the testimony was inconsistent, Sherman’s testimony established that she purchased cocaine from defendant at that location.

He concluded that it was not error to decline to read back the portion requested by defendant.', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.

After Sarah’s mother saw defendant run out of Sarah’s room, she went into her daughter’s room, turned on the light, and noticed that the blankets covered her daughter’s head. When Sarah’s mother moved the blankets, she saw that her daughter’s jeans and underwear had been pulled down below her waist. Sarah’s mother immediately took the child into her own bedroom, locked the door, and asked her “Did he touch your cookie?”3 Sarah answered “yes[,]” and her mother subsequently called the East Providence police. When the police arrived, Sarah’s mother explained what had happened, and Sarah was taken to Hasbro Children’s Hospital (Hasbro) for an examination, which was performed by Dr. Goldberg. The following day the police arrested defendant.', 'On March 18, 2011, a criminal information was filed against defendant in Providence County Superior Court, alleging one count of second-degree child molestation in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3 and § 11-37-8.4. A jury trial was held in September 2012.

A pretrial hearing on the motion was held, which featured the testimony of two East Providence police officers, defendant, defendant’s mother, defendant’s cousin, and an attorney who had been contacted by defendant’s cousin.', 'Detective Mark Jones (Det. Jones) of the East Providence police department was the first witness. Detective Jones was on duty on January 29, 2011 and spoke with defendant the following day, after defendant’s arrest. According to Det. Jones, he and another officer, Det. Michael Spremulli (Det. Spremulli), first spoke to defendant while in the department cellblock and, after he agreed to speak with them, defendant was moved to an interview room. Detective Jones stated that he “asked [defendant] if he understood, if he could read English, if he could read period, and [defendant] said yes.” Detective Jones testified that he provided defendant with a rights form and advised defendant of his constitutional rights, as set forth on the form. The defendant then initialed each numerically listed item on the rights form and signed the form.', 'Next, Det. Jones testified that, although defendant was alert, he appeared “subdued but nervous[,]” which the detective characterized as normal behavior.', 'Detective Jones acknowledged that defendant stated that he had vomited some sleeping pills which he ingested prior to being arrested while purportedly attempting suicide, but the officer testified that he did not observe anything that would suggest defendant had taken sleeping pills. Detective Jones testified that defendant stated the following:', '“He said that night of the incident, he was in Cranston * * * doing', 'shots. He got home, he thinks it was around midnight or so, took a', 'sleeping pill, and then he said he went into [Sarah’s] bedroom to', 'check on her.

Then he said', 'when he saw her vagina he got curious as to what it would feel', 'like. So at that time, he said he touched her vagina, got nervous,', '-3-', 'realizing what he did was wrong, and then left the room.” After the interview, Det. Jones typed the statement, asked defendant to read the statement, and then asked him if there were any inconsistencies in the statement or anything he wished to change. Detective Jones testified that defendant never indicated that the statement was incorrect or that it was incomplete in any way. The defendant then signed the statement. Detective Jones noted that at no time during his interaction with defendant did defendant ever ask to speak to an attorney, nor did defendant request that he be allowed to make a phone call.4', 'Detective Spremulli also testified at the suppression hearing. Detective Spremulli’s testimony corroborated the testimony of Det. Jones. Specifically, Det. Spremulli testified that he was present when defendant read the rights form, indicated to the officers that he understood the contents of the form, and initialed and signed the rights form. Detective Spremulli’s recollection of defendant’s confession was substantially the same as that of Det. Jones. Detective Spremulli also testified that he did not recall defendant asking for a lawyer, nor did he recall anyone coming into the interview room to tell the officers about a telephone call.', 'The defendant’s version was at variance with the testimony of the police detectives. According to defendant, after he was first arrested and while still in handcuffs, ten to fifteen officers “kept saying[,] * * * did you resist arrest? Did he resist arrest? * * * I hope he does, I hope he does, I’m really in the mood to mess him up. They kept saying, I want to mess him up, I want to fuck him up.” He testified that the officers were “fingering their Billy clubs and putting their hands on their guns and stuff * * *.” The defendant stated that he “was afraid they were going to beat the hell out of [him]” and that he felt “intimidated.” The defendant testified that, when he arrived at the station, officers further threatened him about what he could expect from 4', 'Detective Jones did, however, testify that the booking sheet was marked “phone call, no[,]” indicating, according to the officer, that defendant “didn’t choose to make a phone call.”', '-4- the other inmates at the prison, which made him think that he “was going to die.” The defendant stated that, while at the police station, he asked an officer if he could make a phone call; however, because the telephone number of the person he wished to call was on his mobile phone, the officer allowed defendant to make one phone call from his mobile phone. The defendant testified that he called his mother and asked her to call his cousin and ask the cousin to obtain a lawyer for him.', 'The defendant’s testimony concerning the interview with Det. Jones and Det. Spremulli also differed from that of the detectives. He testified that, numerous times before he was shown the rights form, he asked for a lawyer. He testified that Det. Jones ignored his requests and kept pestering him about the incident. The defendant testified that he signed the rights form because he was scared, tired, and “afraid that the judge was going to decide [he] was guilty if [he] didn’t give [his] side of the story.” He also told the court that, while being questioned, another officer came into the room where he was being questioned and said something to Det. Jones about a phone call. The defendant admitted to giving a statement to the police and signing it, but he stated that he never read it and only signed it because he “was afraid not to.” However, on cross- examination, defendant admitted that he understood he did not have to say anything to the officers but spoke with Det. Jones anyway.', 'The defendant’s mother also testified at the suppression hearing. She testified that, on January 30, 2011, she received a call from defendant, requesting that she obtain a lawyer for him. She testified that she told defendant that she would contact his cousin to obtain a lawyer for him; she then called defendant’s cousin, who agreed to help. The defendant’s cousin also testified and stated that she contacted Attorney Priscilla DiMaio (Attorney DiMaio), who agreed to represent defendant.', '-5-', 'Lastly, Attorney DiMaio testified. Attorney DiMaio testified that, on January 30, 2011, at approximately 9:45 in the morning, she called the East Providence police department, identified herself as an attorney who was trying to contact defendant, and asked to speak to a detective. She stated that she also asked to speak with defendant, but her request was denied. She testified that she told a detective “to let [defendant] know that [she had] called, and * * * not to give a statement.” We note that the record discloses that defendant signed the waiver of rights form at 9:40 that morning.', 'At the conclusion of testimony and after hearing counsels’ arguments, the trial justice rendered a bench decision. The trial justice denied the motion to suppress, declaring that, based on the record before her, defendant’s statement was voluntary and that defendant had not been deprived of his right to counsel. With respect to whether the statement was voluntary, the trial justice found defendant’s testimony “implausible,” “unbelievable,” and “far-fetched.” “Viewing all the evidence and under the totality of the circumstances[,]” the trial justice found that defendant’s statement was not coerced and that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his rights. Also, with respect to defendant’s argument that he was deprived of his right to counsel, the trial justice, citing State v. Burbine, 451 A.2d 22 (R.I. 1982), noted “that the effort by third parties to retain counsel for the defendant is entirely irrelevant to whether the defendant asked for and was denied the right to counsel.” See id. at 27-28. The trial justice went on to find “the detectives to be more credible than the defendant in testifying that the defendant never did request counsel.” Specifically, the trial justice found “it incredible that such numerous requests [for a lawyer] were made * * * and fell on deaf ears * * *.” The trial justice determined that the state had established by clear and convincing evidence that defendant did not request an attorney and, therefore, was not deprived of his right to counsel.', '-6-', 'Before this Court, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress his statement to police, arguing that his statement was not voluntary. “Both the Rhode Island and the United States Constitutions bar the use of a defendant’s involuntary statements in a criminal trial.” State v. Bojang, 83 A.3d 526, 532 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 835 (R.I. 2008)). “In order for the trial justice to admit a defendant’s statement at trial, ‘the state must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his or her right against self-incrimination and that the statement was voluntary.’” Id. at 533 (quoting State v. Monteiro, 924 A.2d 784, 790 (R.I. 2007)). “This inquiry ‘requires an analysis of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.’” Id. (quoting State v. Jimenez, 33 A.3d 724, 734 (R.I. 2011)). “This Court applies the following two- step review of a trial justice’s finding of voluntariness:', '‘First, we review the trial justice’s findings of historical fact with', 'deference, and we will not overturn those findings unless they are', 'clearly erroneous. * * * Second, because this issue is of', 'constitutional dimension, we accept the historical facts and', 'credibility determinations, and we then conduct de novo review of', 'the trial justice’s conclusion that the confession was voluntary.’”', 'Id. (quoting Monteiro, 924 A.2d at 790).', 'After examining the record in this case, we are satisfied that defendant’s confession was voluntary and that the trial justice did not err when she refused to suppress the confession. The evidence presented at the suppression hearing disclosed that Det. Jones advised defendant of his rights, both orally and in writing. The defendant initialed and signed the waiver of rights form that was introduced into evidence. Detective Jones testified that defendant appeared alert, and both Det. Jones and Det. Spremulli testified that defendant acknowledged that he understood his rights. Finally, defendant himself testified that he knew he did not have to say anything to the detectives, but he nevertheless proceeded to speak with the detectives and then to sign the statement.', '-7-', 'Although the trial justice set forth her decision in a comprehensive bench ruling, she did err when she stated that “defendant never testified that his mother, aunt, and/or cousin were in the process of retaining an attorney * * * [n]or did the defendant testify that he, in fact, had already made a call to his mother requesting that she procure an attorney for him.” The record reveals that defendant did testify about the phone call to his mother. Nonetheless, this error was not material and has no impact on our decision given the appropriate factual findings and credibility determinations made by the trial justice in view of the totality of the circumstances.5 The trial justice specifically found that defendant did not invoke his right to counsel. The trial justice rejected defendant’s argument that the police officers threatened him or deprived him of his right to counsel. The trial justice concluded, after analyzing the totality of the circumstances, that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his rights and spoke to the police.', 'In light of the trial justice’s findings of historical fact and credibility determinations, which we review with deference, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not misconceive or overlook material evidence, nor did she err in her conclusions. Our de novo review also satisfies us that defendant’s confession was given voluntarily.', 'Finally, we pause to note that defendant also argued that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress because he “was denied his right to a confidential phone call pursuant to R.I.G.L. § 12-7-20.” General Laws 1956 § 12-7-20 provides that a person who is arrested “shall be afforded, as soon after being detained as practicable, * * * the opportunity to make use of a telephone for the purpose of securing an attorney * * *.” Here, defendant testified that, after he 5', 'The defendant testified that he was given an opportunity to make a phone call and did make a phone call. The detectives testified that the booking sheet was marked “phone call, no[,]” indicating that defendant “didn’t choose to make a phone call.” Whether or not the notation on the booking sheet meant that defendant did not make a phone call from a police phone is irrelevant to our analysis. It is not disputed that defendant did in fact make a telephone call to his mother.', '-8- was arrested and transported to the East Providence police station, he made a phone call to his mother and requested that she assist him in obtaining a lawyer by contacting a cousin. Accordingly, we deem this argument without merit.', 'Testimony of Dr. Goldberg', 'Next, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred when she allowed Dr. Goldberg to testify regarding what defendant characterized as “physical examination, diagnosis, and treatment of penetrative first degree sexual assault[,]” as contrasted with the second-degree sexual assault of which he was accused. During trial, the state sought to introduce the testimony of Dr. Goldberg, an attending physician in the Child Protection Program at Hasbro who had examined Sarah on the night of the incident. At trial, Dr. Goldberg discussed her examination of the child, presented certain disclosures that Sarah made during her examination, and explained what was meant by an examination that was found to be normal. Doctor Goldberg testified that, on January 29, 2011, Sarah, in describing the incident and her physical condition, had told her “she felt wet,” a symptom which, Dr. Goldberg explained, prompted her to evaluate the child for an acute sexual assault. Next, Dr. Goldberg testified that Sarah had some redness in her genital examination but that the rest of her physical examination appeared to be normal, which she explained to the jury meant that she saw no specific abnormalities. Doctor Goldberg went on to explain that a normal finding does not necessarily mean that the child was not abused. Although defense counsel objected numerous times throughout Dr. Goldberg’s testimony, these objections were grounded on lack of materiality. Significantly, the witness was asked, without objection: “[a]nd that normal examination in your mind at the time, can you say for certain whether or not she was touched in the manner that you understood?” To which Dr. Goldberg replied, “[Sarah’s] normal examination does not exclude the possibility of sexual abuse, or even penetration, in my', '-9- mind.” Not only was there no objection to this question, there was no motion to strike this answer.', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in admitting this testimony because it was irrelevant, beyond the scope of proper expert testimony, and substantially prejudicial. It is well settled that this Court will “review a trial justice’s decision admitting or excluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.” State v. Covington, 69 A.3d 855, 862 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Brown, 42 A.3d 1239, 1242 (R.I. 2012)). “We will reverse a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of evidence only where ‘it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.’” Id. (quoting Brown, 42 A.3d at 1242).', 'After a thorough examination of the record, this Court concludes that defendant failed to preserve this issue for appellate review. We note at the outset that, prior to Dr. Goldberg’s testimony, defense counsel expressly agreed that “[Dr. Goldberg could] testify as to what the absence of any injuries means, and [could] also testify as to the result of her examination.” During Dr. Goldberg’s direct examination she was asked, “[a]nd that normal examination in your mind at the time, can you say for certain whether or not she was touched in the manner that you understood?” To which Dr. Goldberg answered, “[h]er normal examination does not exclude the possibility of sexual abuse, or even penetration, in my mind.” As noted, defense counsel did not object to the question, or move to strike the answer. Therefore, according to this Court’s “raise- or-waive” doctrine, we deem defendant’s argument that the trial justice erred in permitting Dr. Goldberg to testify waived.6 However, were this issue properly preserved before the Court, we are convinced that Dr. Goldberg’s testimony—which was equivocal at best—was not unduly 6', 'See Berard v. HCP, Inc., 64 A.3d 1215, 1219 n.2 (R.I. 2013) (noting that the Court “shall ‘not review issues that were not presented to the trial court in such a posture as to alert the trial justice to the question being raised[.]’” quoting State v. Kluth, 46 A.3d 867, 876 (R.I. 2012)).', '- 10 - prejudicial or implied that defendant engaged in sexual penetration, as the trial justice instructed the jury “that there is no evidence in this case of the type of conduct that this doctor just referred to * * *.” It is also significant that defendant was not charged with first-degree sexual assault and that he, through his confession, admitted to improperly touching Sarah, the act that led to the charge of second-degree child molestation for which he was convicted.', 'In addition, “because the state bears the burden of proving each element of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt, it has the right to present evidence establishing those elements in its case in chief.” State v. Marmolejos, 990 A.2d 848, 852 (R.I. 2010). Here, the child’s disclosure to Dr. Goldberg, about feeling “wet,” prompted the physical examination about which the witness testified.', 'Thus, the state was within its rights to present testimony about the examination.', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'Lastly, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. “When passing on ‘a trial justice’s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, this Court applies the same standard as the trial justice.’” State v.

See Lynch, 19 A.3d at 56. In this case, the six-year-old child took the stand at trial and testified that, on the night of the incident, she woke up, felt something on her vagina, and opened her eyes to the defendant standing at her bed. Sarah’s mother also testified at trial and corroborated the child’s statements and the events of that night. According to Sarah’s mother, on January 29, 2011, she had put her daughter to bed with her jeans and underwear pulled up to her waist. At approximately one o’clock in the morning, she saw someone leaving her daughter’s room; and, when she went into the room, she discovered that her daughter’s pants and underwear had been pulled down below her waist. She testified that she took Sarah into her room, locked the door, and asked her if the defendant touched her, to which Sarah replied, “yes.” Doctor Goldberg testified that Sarah told her that the defendant had been in her room that night and that “she felt wet.” Further, Det. Jones also testified at trial and read the defendant’s sworn statement, which stated:', '“On January 28, 2011, I was out drinking * * *. Then I went to', 'check on [Sarah]. I noticed that she had jeans on, and she looked', 'very uncomfortable. * * * I went over to [her] and pulled her jeans', 'down. The jeans were so tight that her underpants came down', 'with the jeans. * * * I was always curious if a young girl felt the', 'same as a woman. * * * After [Sarah’s] underpants came down', 'with her jeans, I saw her vagina. * * * So I touched the outside of', '[her] vagina with my hand.”', '“A person is guilty of a second degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual contact with another person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” Section 11- 37-8.3. Because we are satisfied that the state presented ample evidence that Sarah was six years old when the defendant touched her vagina, in violation of § 11-37-8.3, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to withstand the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal and to support the conviction. Accordingly, the trial justice did not err when she denied the defendant’s', '- 12 - motion for a judgment of acquittal.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment below.

3,State : v. : Gary Gaudreau.,reversal,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court.', 'The defendant, Gary Gaudreau, appeals from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury found him guilty of first-degree arson in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-4-2. The trial justice sentenced the defendant to twenty-five years—with nine years to serve and sixteen years suspended, with probation—for setting fire to his place of business, Physique Gym, during a severe snowstorm in the middle of the night on March 2, 2009. This case came before the Supreme Court for argument on March 1, 2016. The defendant raises two issues on appeal: (1) he challenges the admission into evidence of a video recording of his custodial police interrogation; and (2) he challenges the denial of his motion for a new trial on the basis that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. After careful consideration of the defendant’s arguments and a thorough review of the record, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', '1', 'Facts and Travel', 'The Fire and the Early Morning Investigation', 'During the early morning hours of March 2, 2009, in blizzard-like weather conditions, the Physique Gym on York Avenue in Pawtucket became engulfed in flames. 1 At around 3:40 a.m., the Pawtucket Fire Department received a call and responded to the fire. The first officer to arrive at the scene reported the fire to be “code red, fully involved,” meaning that it was “an actual active confirmed fire” and “more progressed than you would normally expect on a certain arrival time.” Battalion Chief Timothy Mercer said that the fire was fought during “[s]ome of the worst conditions [he’d] experienced,” with “single[-]digit cold, heavy snow and quite windy.” Mercer described the conflagration as “quite extensive,” that “[f]lames were already shooting out the windows, [and a] heavy smoke condition [was] reducing the visibility in the area quite substantially.”', 'At about that same time, at 3:50 a.m., the gym’s proprietor, Gary Gaudreau, called the police to report a breaking and entering at his home. Predictably, Mr. Gaudreau quickly became the primary target of police interest for what was already suspected to be an intentional arson.', 'Officer David Dolan reported to Gaudreau’s home to investigate the reported breaking and entering. Because of the hazardous conditions, it took him approximately thirty minutes to go the four miles from the police station to Gaudreau’s home. The officer said that he was “paying special attention” because he had been informed on his way to the investigation that Gaudreau’s business was ablaze. Upon arrival, Officer Dolan observed only one set of tire 1', 'As set forth in detail, infra, there were two jury trials. The first jury trial was held in November 2012 and ended in a mistrial when the jury could not reach a verdict. The second trial was presided over by a different trial justice in September 2013. The facts presented here are derived entirely from testimony and evidence presented at the second trial, unless otherwise specified.', '-2- marks on the snow-covered driveway and he did not see any footprints on the sidewalk, in the driveway, or in the front yard. However, when he walked up the driveway toward the detached garage, Officer Dolan did see one set of footprints leading from the garage to the back porch area.', 'When Officer Dolan reached the back door of the home, he noticed a broken Plexiglas window, with glass on the ground, both outside and inside the door. Gaudreau admitted the officer into the kitchen and living room. At that time, Gaudreau told him that he had left his house at approximately 1:30 a.m. and drove around for a couple of hours because he was unable to sleep. He said that he returned home at approximately 3:40 or 3:50 a.m. and called the police about the break-in. Gaudreau also told the officer that the only thing that was missing from his home was a “fanny pack” that had been on an ottoman in the living room. He said that the fanny pack contained his keys to the gym, his wallet, and an unloaded handgun. Dolan did not investigate the rest of the house, relying on Gaudreau’s statement that he had searched the house and had found no one present and no other broken windows. Gaudreau also showed the officer an alarm-type system in his living room, explaining that “[w]hen it registers a noise, such as glass break [sic], there is a delay and then an alarm sounds.” Gaudreau explained that he believed that whoever had broken in came through the rear window, became spooked by the alarm, and grabbed the fanny pack before leaving through the same window.', 'At Officer Dolan’s request, Gaudreau showed him the garage, where the officer inspected the interior and exterior of the car, finding nothing of interest except that, when he touched the hood of the car, it felt cold. Officer Dolan explained that Gaudreau was helpful, cooperative, and even talkative throughout his investigation, but that he appeared to be “walking very slowly and deliberately,” or “gingerly.” Officer Dolan said that he was at Gaudreau’s house for about ten', '-3- minutes, but Gaudreau did not mention that he was aware that his business was on fire until the end of the investigation. At that time, Gaudreau told the officer that he was going to drive over to the scene of the fire at his gym.', 'Meanwhile, the battle to fight the blaze continued; the fire had progressed to a “third alarm,” meaning that the battalion chief had twice called for additional apparatus and manpower from within Pawtucket, as well as “mutual aid” from other communities. David Curran, a fire investigator with the State Fire Marshal’s office, arrived and photographed the scene in those early morning hours.', 'Detective Scott Feeley of the Pawtucket Police Department, the lead detective on the case, spoke to firefighters at the scene and contacted the property owner, George Gardinar. Mr. Gardinar informed Det. Feeley that he leased the property to Gaudreau for use as a gym and that he had allowed his insurance policy on the building to lapse a few years earlier. Detective Feeley then contacted Gaudreau and asked to speak with him at the police station about the fire and the breaking and entering. Around 7 a.m., he and Det. Robert Matook informed Gaudreau of his Miranda rights and informed him that, although he was a suspect, the interview was voluntary; the interview was not recorded. 2 Gaudreau told the detectives that he left the gym the night before at approximately 9:30 p.m., stopped at a bank on his way home, and made a deposit. He said that he was at home for a few hours and then he went for a drive at about 1:30 a.m. because he could not sleep. He said that he drove into and around Seekonk, Massachusetts, before returning home around 4 a.m. Detective Feeley said that Gaudreau told him that someone had broken into his house while he was out driving and that whoever broke into his home had taken his fanny pack containing his gym keys, his wallet, a firearm, and cash.', 'After the 2', 'Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).', '-4- interview, Det. Feeley searched Gaudreau’s car, house and garage, but nothing was seized, and Gaudreau returned home.', 'However, when Det. Feeley returned to the station, he was notified that a witness had contacted law enforcement at the scene of the fire. Paul Richard, a snowplow driver, met Det. Feeley at the police station and told him that he had seen Gaudreau at the Physique Gym earlier that night when he was plowing snow. He gave the detectives a signed statement explaining that he was called into work at about 9 or 10 p.m. that night to plow in the area of the gym. He said that he saw Gaudreau, with his car backed up to an open door at Physique Gym with the trunk open, at approximately 1:45 a.m. Mr. Richard explained that he was familiar with Gaudreau and with his car because he was a member of Physique Gym. About 15 minutes later, Mr. Richard recalled seeing Gaudreau in his car at the intersection of Newport and Columbus Avenues; indeed, he recalled flashing his lights for Gaudreau to go through the intersection. Mr. Richard also identified Gaudreau from a photo array.', 'The Interrogation', 'Not surprisingly, after he was identified by Mr. Richard, Gaudreau was asked to return to the police station around noon. Gaudreau voluntarily returned, again waived his Miranda rights, and was interviewed again.', 'The second interview was videotaped.', 'At trial, the video interrogation was played for the jury during Det. Feeley’s testimony. The interrogation began with the detectives asking Gaudreau to once again explain his whereabouts during the preceding night and early morning. After Gaudreau essentially repeated the same story that he related to Officer Dolan and during his 7 a.m. interview at the police station, the detectives asked him directly, “You had nothing to do with starting this fire?” Gaudreau responded, “Nothing to do with starting this fire.”', '-5-', 'Detective Feeley then said, “Well, now that we have that taped, I want to read the statement we have –.” He then read from Mr. Richard’s sworn statement explaining that he had seen Gaudreau at the gym around 1:45 a.m. Detective Feeley said he “showed him eleven pictures and guess who he picked out as the guy who was coming out the door at 1:45 a.m.?” Gaudreau responded, “Not me.” Gaudreau also denied the detectives’ accusations that “the jig is up,” that it was Gaudreau who set the building on fire, that there was a witness who knew him, and that Gaudreau was lying. The detectives repeatedly told Gaudreau that he was lying, that he made false statements to the police, that he made up the “cockamamie” story about his house being broken into, and that they were sure they would find his fanny pack at the gym.', 'Gaudreau steadfastly refused to change his story, saying, “The guy might have seen me earlier, but he didn’t see me anywhere near that time.”', 'When he continued to deny any involvement in setting the fire, Det. Feeley finally said, “You’re being charged with second degree arson. This is your last chance to be remorseful and give us a reason.” But after they failed to wrest a confession out of Gaudreau, the detectives left the room.', 'Curran, the fire inspector, who was also at the Pawtucket police station to meet with detectives and Gaudreau, advised the police that, because the building had been occupied within the past six months, the appropriate charge would be first-degree arson. When the detectives returned to the interrogation room a few minutes later, they informed Gaudreau that he would be charged with first-degree arson, a capital offense. Detective Feeley said, “So, is there anything you want to say? Because this is the last time we’re ending the interview. We’re going to bring you downstairs.” Gaudreau said, “No,” and was placed under arrest.', '-6-', 'The Post-Arrest Investigation', 'After Gaudreau was arrested, the detectives brought him to the cellblock to process him and to seize his clothing, so that they could be tested for accelerants. When Gaudreau’s clothes were removed, the detectives observed large sores on his lower legs and slight injuries on his hands.', 'When asked what had happened to his legs, Gaudreau replied that it was a rash. Gaudreau was brought to the hospital to be treated for his obvious injuries; Det. Feeley was informed by medical personnel that the sores were second-degree burns.', 'Detective Feeley then obtained warrants to search Gaudreau’s home for a second time, the garage, and the gym. In addition, the detective sought assistance from Sgt. Michael Peters of the Massachusetts State Police, a certified accelerant detection canine handler, who was brought in the next day. Sergeant Peters worked with a dog trained to search a fire scene and alert to the presence of petroleum products, or “flammable liquids that are carbon-based, gasolines, kerosenes, diesel fuels.”', 'There were no alerts from Gaudreau’s car, residence, or the clothing that had been confiscated at the time of his arrest. However, the dog did alert to four areas at the scene of the fire. Upon excavating, or de-layering, two of the areas, burned paper towels and the melted remains of what appeared to be a thirty-gallon Rubbermaid-type barrel were discovered. Also, a strong odor consistent with gasoline, one cap from a gas can, and rubber mats covering the floor were found. The other two areas also were de-layered and washed down, and irregular and “very significant burn pattern[s]” were discovered, consistent with “flammable liquid being poured out of a container and then ignited.”', 'At each of the four alert sites, fire inspector Curran collected samples in certified evidence cans to send to the state crime lab. Outside the building, near an entryway, a fanny', '-7- pack and what appeared to be the remains of a coat were found on the ground. Investigators recovered a scarf and fanny pack wrapped inside a charred “puffy type” winter coat and a set of keys to the premises that was “still in the lock.” The fanny pack contained a loaded handgun and Gaudreau’s wallet, driver’s license, pistol permit, eyeglasses, a cigarette butt, and about $493. The jacket pockets contained a small can of lock deicer, business cards, and a lighter. Burned matter and charred debris in tissues in a bathroom wastebasket were also seized from Gaudreau’s home, even though the accelerant detection dog never alerted to anything in the house.', 'Curran later testified that it was his opinion that, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, there were four separate areas of origin for the fire and the cause was an intentional act of fire setting. He opined that:', '“the gasoline had been introduced into the trash cans, and even the', 'gas cans were left behind within these trash cans. And at that', 'point, a piloted flame or a match or a cigarette lighter, more than', 'likely a match, * * * was brought into contact with the contents of', 'the trash cans and the gasoline.”', 'When he was cross-examined at trial, Det. Matook 3 admitted that, although he seized several items—a gas can, rag, and burned fabric found in the car; the tissues and burnt matter found in the bathroom; a cigarette butt found in the burned jacket—he had not submitted any of those seized items to the state crime lab for analysis for accelerants or for DNA testing. He also conceded that the police did not dust for fingerprints at Gaudreau’s house; they had not obtained financial documents from defendant’s house or contacted Citizens Bank about Gaudreau’s bank account; they never investigated whether he was current on his mortgage, nor had they sought to obtain security footage from gas stations that were located near Gaudreau’s home and business. 3', 'Detective Feeley retired shortly after the gym fire and Det. Matook replaced him as lead detective on the case.', '-8-', 'Kim Freeland, of the Rhode Island state crime laboratory, testified that several samples from the fire scene had tested positive for gasoline and other types of volatile components. Kevin Murphy, a senior fire investigator with the Rhode Island State Fire Marshal’s office, said that he had examined the electrical service and concluded that the cause of the fire was not electrical.', 'The Trials', 'On July 2, 2009, Gaudreau was charged by indictment with first-degree arson (count 1) and knowingly making a false statement of a crime in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-32-2 (count 2). Pretrial motions were heard before a justice of the Superior Court on November 14 and 15, 2012. The trial justice severed the two counts for trial and proceeded on the arson charge to ensure that defendant was not prejudiced by the state’s allegations that he made a false claim to the police when he reported the breaking and entering at his home.', 'The defendant sought, in limine, to suppress the videotaped interrogation on the grounds that comments by the detectives on the tape were irrelevant and highly prejudicial, and constituted inadmissible testimony concerning witness credibility. During a lengthy argument about the video spanning two days, defendant requested that, if the tape was not suppressed entirely, then it should be redacted and the jury should be given a cautionary instruction about the detectives’ comments. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion to suppress, but ordered that two lines at the end of the tape—about the veracity of the snowplow driver—be redacted. On the day that the tape was to be played before the jury, defendant again raised an objection to', '-9- the videotape and again requested a cautionary instruction. The trial justice decided to give a brief instruction just before the video was played, explaining the context of the interrogation. 4', 'However, that trial ended in a mistrial because the jury was unable to reach a verdict. A second jury trial began before a second trial justice in September 2013. The parties agreed that the evidentiary rulings from the first trial would constitute the law of the case and that the exhibits marked as full in the first trial would be admitted as full exhibits in the second trial. The defendant requested that the trial justice acknowledge his objection on the record to the 4', 'The trial justice gave the following cautionary instruction, to which there was no objection, before the videotaped interrogation was played for the jury:', '“I just want to take a moment to explain what is going to be', 'played for the jury at this time.

All right.”', '- 10 - admission of the video recording of the interrogation, but he did not reassert his request for a cautionary instruction. 5', 'At the second trial, in addition to the testimony of police and fire investigators, the state presented testimony from Karen Kane-Taylor, who worked for defendant at the gym in return for membership. Ms. Kane-Taylor identified the puffy jacket and scarf that were found at the scene as belonging to defendant and said that he wore them on a daily basis. She also testified that, in the weeks leading up to the fire, it seemed to her that products that were sold at the gym, such as protein bars, drinks, water, and magazines, were not being replenished.', 'The defendant testified in his own defense. He said he had owned Physique Gym for twenty-three years and that there were about 400 members as of March 2009. He testified that revenue was generated from membership and from selling nutritional supplements and other products and that his bills were current and his accounts were balanced. He said that he burned his legs at home in the early morning hours of March 1, 2009, the night before the gym fire, when an oil lamp he was filling spilled and caught on fire. He said that he told the police the burns on his legs were a rash because “they were claiming that I set fire to my gym. I said[,] ‘Uh oh. If they see my legs, they’re going to think I burned myself setting fire to the gym.’ I just came up with the first thing off the top of my head was, oh, it’s a rash.”', 'The defendant reiterated much of the story that he had repeatedly told the police, with various deviations. He said that the night before the fire, he was at home until about 9:30 p.m., at which time he went to the bank to make a deposit. He said he continued on to the gym to repair equipment and to paint an office door. He said it was common for him to be at the gym at 5', 'The parties also agreed to redact additional “bolstering” comments by the detectives about the snowplow driver on the videotape and in the transcript. Those statements are not at issue in this appeal.', '- 11 - night because he could only repair equipment when the gym was closed and there were no members waiting to use equipment. He testified that he parked his car right in front of the gym and backed up to the door. He could not recall what time he left; however, he recalled that a snowplow driver waved him through the intersection at Columbus Avenue and Newport Avenue when he was on his way home. He said that he was home for a little while, but, because he was unable to sleep, he went out for a ride. This, he said, was a normal practice for him. He testified that he drove to the Seekonk-Attleboro area “[b]ecause the roads are better plowed in Massachusetts.” He claimed that he arrived back at home just before 3:50 a.m. and discovered the break-in at his home.', 'The defendant testified that he had his fanny pack with him when he went to the gym on the day of the fire, but he took it off when he got home, and he did not take it with him when he went on his late-night sojourn to Massachusetts. He testified that he left the fanny pack on a hassock in the living room. He said he discovered that the Plexiglas window in his back door was broken when he returned. He said he called the police immediately after noticing that the fanny pack was missing as soon as he entered the house. However, he also testified that he soon received a call notifying him about the fire at the gym. Finally, defendant said that he owned several winter coats, including the coat and scarf that had been found at the scene, but that he kept that coat and scarf at the gym and wore a black fabric coat on Sundays.', 'At the conclusion of the evidence, the jury returned a guilty verdict for first-degree arson. The defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied, and he timely appealed.', 'The defendant raises two issues on appeal. First, he argues that the first trial justice abused his discretion when he refused to exclude or redact the videotaped interrogation under Rules 401 and 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, because the detectives’ statements', '- 12 - expressing disbelief in his story were both irrelevant and inadmissible comments on defendant’s credibility. He further argues that any possible relevance was substantially outweighed by its enormously prejudicial impact because the jury repeatedly heard the detectives call defendant a liar.', 'Second, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because there was no evidence linking him to the fire and, in particular, no evidence of an accelerant on his clothing, in his house, or in his car.', '2', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Videotaped Interrogation', 'The defendant argues that the first trial justice abused his discretion when he denied his motion in limine to either suppress or redact the recorded police interrogation. He maintains that the videotaped interrogation had no probative value because it did not contain a confession and because the detectives’ repeated accusations that defendant was lying were the equivalent of credibility testimony, which is absolutely prohibited from a witness. The defendant further argues that the prejudicial impact of the police officers’ comments outweighed any minimal relevance that the tape might have had because they do not provide context, because defendant did not change his story during the course of the interview.', 'The state argues, as it did in the trial court, that defendant’s statements were relevant as an “adamant” and “false” denial, which is evidence of guilt. The state further argues that the detectives’ comments were typical interrogation techniques that the jury was familiar with, and', '- 13 - that those statements were not equivalent to testimony from the detectives on the stand and were therefore not prejudicial to defendant.', 'i', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v.

Although we have not yet adopted a rule requiring that all police interrogations be audio or video recorded, several organizations within the state have either adopted such rules or have recommended that police departments adopt them. 6 Now, as more interrogations are being recorded, this Court is faced with new issues that are associated with those recordings. 6', 'See, e.g., Task Force to Investigate & Develop Policies & Procedures for Electronically Recording Custodial Interrogations, Final Report (Feb. 1, 2012), available at https://www.ribar.com/UserFiles/FINAL-REPORT-MERI-TF.pdf (recommending that every law enforcement agency adopt uniform written policies and procedures requiring the electronic recording of custodial interrogations in their entirety); Rhode Island Police Accreditation Commission, RIPAC, Accreditation Standards Manual, Ch. 8, § 8.10 at 44-46 (May 2013),', '- 15 -', 'Often, defendants move to suppress confessions that have not been recorded because “[b]oth the Rhode Island and the Federal Constitutions bar the use in a criminal trial of a defendant’s involuntary statements.” State v.

It is a frequent argument that a videotape is the best evidence of whether a defendant’s inculpatory statements have met that test.', 'However, when a defendant does not challenge the admission of his own statements as being involuntary, but, as is the case here, seeks to suppress the statements of the police, trial courts must engage in a very different type of analysis. In these situations, it is our opinion that the evidence should be viewed like any other evidence; other grounds may exist for the introduction of such evidence, in its entirety or in a redacted form, pursuant to the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. See Rule 402 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by the constitution of Rhode Island, by act of congress, by the general laws of Rhode Island, by these rules, or by other rules applicable in the courts of this state. Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.”).', 'Several states have addressed the particular issue of whether a recorded interrogation is admissible when the defendant neither confesses nor challenges his statements as involuntary, but rather attacks the admissibility of comments made by police that are contained in the recording. The law is quite unsettled on this point, and there is a clear split in authority between the jurisdictions that have addressed the issue, with no apparent majority.', 'Some courts have found the evidence to be inadmissible opinion testimony that should not be admitted indirectly in the form of a recording, and they have held that such statements available', 'at', 'http://ripolicechiefs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/RIPAC_Accreditation_ Standards_Manual_First_Edition_May_2013.pdf (last visited April 13, 2016).', '- 16 - must be redacted.

Musser, 835 N.W.2d 319, 329-30 (Mich. 2013) (finding that the probative value of the interrogator’s statements was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, under Rule 403, and error was not harmless).', 'In Elnicki, 105 P.3d at 1224-25, the Supreme Court of Kansas addressed a similar issue in a trial for rape and sodomy, the only difference being that the defendant, throughout the interrogation and in later statements, repeatedly changed his story about the events of the night in question. The defendant told the police several varying versions of the facts, from having never seen the victim that night, to being too drunk to remember, to her agreeing to have oral sex for $25, and more variations, all the while denying that he committed rape. Id. The court held that, under its rules, a trial court has no discretion to allow one witness to testify about another’s credibility, and so reviewed the admission of the tape de novo. Id. at 1226. The court then held that the trial court erred when it admitted the videotape, explaining the following:', '“A synthesis of the referenced case law leads us to', 'conclude that it was error for Detective Hazim’s comments', 'disputing Elnicki’s credibility to be presented to the jury. The jury', 'heard a law enforcement figure repeatedly tell Elnicki that he was', 'a liar; that Elnicki was ‘bullshitting’ him and ‘weaving a web of', 'lies.’ * * * A jury is clearly prohibited from hearing such', 'statements from the witness stand in Kansas and likewise should', 'be prohibited from hearing them in a videotape, even if the', '- 17 -', 'statements are recommended and effective police interrogation', 'tactics. As far as context for Elnicki’s answers are concerned, the', 'State could have safely accomplished its goal simply by having', 'Detective Hazim testify and point out the progression of Elnicki’s', 'various stories as the tape was played—minus Hazim’s numerous', 'negative comments on Elnicki’s credibility. The absence of a', 'limiting instruction merely compounded the already serious', 'problem, misleading the jury into believing that Hazim’s negative', 'comments carried the weight of testimony.” Id. at 1229. Thus, even where the defendant’s story shifted throughout the course of the interview, that court found that the statements of the detective on credibility were absolutely prohibited. Id.', 'Similarly, an intermediate appellate court in Pennsylvania held that videotaped comments by the police accusing the defendant of lying “were akin to a prosecutor offering his or her opinion of the truth or falsity of the evidence presented by a criminal defendant, and such opinions are inadmissible at trial.” Kitchen, 730 A.2d at 521. The court held that each of the defendant’s own statements made during the interrogation—wherein she admitted her relationship with the victim and the co-defendant, and to her presence at the scene, among other things—were relevant to determination of her guilt as an accomplice to the murder, and, therefore, analyzed the many statements of the police under Rule 403 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence. Kitchen, 730 A.2d at 519-20. Ultimately, the court held that instances where police accused the defendant of lying, where the defendant did not respond to questioning, and where police stated that they had a strong case against the defendant had to be redacted. Id. at 521-23.', 'The Supreme Court of Wyoming analyzed whether the trial judge committed plain error in allowing the state to present improper vouching evidence of a deputy in a recorded video and in testimony from the stand that he met with the victim and that he believed she was being truthful in her accusation. Sweet, 234 P.3d at 1198-99. The court held that, although the', '- 18 - defendant had not objected to any of that evidence, the deputy’s statements “violated in a clear and obvious way th[at] [c]ourt’s long-standing rules prohibiting a witness to express opinions about the accused’s mendacity and guilt and about the alleged victim’s truthfulness and credibility * * *.” Id. at 1204-05.', 'A majority of the Supreme Court of Washington held, in Demery, 30 P.3d at 1285, that an officer’s accusations amounted to opinion evidence regarding the defendant’s veracity should not have been admitted, but that the trial court did not commit reversible error in admitting the officer’s accusations because of the wealth of evidence against the defendant. The four-justice minority, who opined that the evidence was admissible, rested their decision on the fact that the evidence was not “testimony” because it was neither given under oath nor from the witness stand, nor was it offered to prove the officer’s opinion. Id. at 1280-85.', 'On the other hand, courts have found that statements made by officers during the course of an interrogation were not admitted in error. The majority of those courts held that the comments by law enforcement were probative because they provided context for the defendants’ shifting stories during the course of the interrogations. See State v. Boggs, 185 P.3d 111, 121 (Ariz. 2008) (en banc) (holding that the defendant “cannot establish prejudice because he did, in fact, provide multiple stories about his involvement; the jury did not need [detective]’s comments to know that [the defendant] lied”); Lanham v. Commonwealth, 171 S.W.3d 14 (Ky. 2005); State v. Castaneda, 715 S.E.2d 290, 295, 296 (N.C. Ct. App. 2011) (the defendant’s explanation of what happened when he stabbed the victim repeatedly shifted throughout his post- arrest interview; therefore, the detective’s statements were probative to give context to the defendant’s changing story and not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice).', '- 19 -', 'A small minority of states that have considered the issue have held that a police officer’s statements have probative value for providing context even where the defendant, as here, made no inculpatory statements and had not changed his story during the interrogation. See Dubria v. Smith, 224 F.3d 995, 1001-03 (9th Cir. 2000) (no violation to fundamental due process, even though California law would have required that the tapes be redacted, because not every trial error constitutes a failure to observe fundamental fairness and because trial judge gave two specific instructions that cured prejudice); State v. Willis, 75 A.3d 1068, 1078 (N.H. 2013) (finding that probative value was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice because the officer’s comments were in the form of questions rather than accusations, and provided context for the defendant’s responses).', 'In Lanham, 171 S.W.3d at 26, the Supreme Court of Kentucky reviewed the range of decisions that have addressed this issue, noting that “it is quite difficult to synthesize a majority rule, especially given that the evidentiary rules in these various states differ significantly.” The court declined to adopt a rule that such evidence should be per se excluded as opinion testimony, reasoning that “[a]lmost all of the courts that have considered the issue recognize that this form of questioning is a legitimate, effective interrogation tool.” Id. at 27. However, the court also “recognize[d] that the introduction of such comments, no doubt, entails the possibility that the jury will misunderstand and accord to those comments an impermissible weight during deliberation.” Id. While specifically disagreeing with the Supreme Court of Kansas that the comments must be redacted, the court held that the appropriate remedy was for the court to provide the jury “a limiting admonition” “to inform the jury that the officer’s comments or statements are ‘offered solely to provide context to the defendant’s relevant responses.’” Id. at 28 (quoting Demery, 30 P.3d at 1283) (emphasis added). The court remarked that most other', '- 20 - courts have endorsed such an admonition and that Rule 105 of the Kentucky Rules of Evidence specifically provides for it, so long as the defendant requests it. 7 Id.', 'With that somewhat disparate background in mind, we now turn to the issues in the case before us. The defendant proposes several grounds for his claim that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress or redact those portions of the interrogation that feature the police challenging defendant’s veracity about what he said he was doing the night of the fire. First, he argues that the evidence is inadmissible credibility testimony. See State v. Miller, 679 A.2d 867, 872 (R.I. 1996) (“Determination of the truthfulness or the credibility of witnesses is the exclusive province of a jury. * * * If the opinion testimony has the same ‘substantive import’ as if it squarely addressed and bolstered another witness’s credibility, it is inadmissible.”). Second, defendant argues that the statements had no relevance, under Rule 401, because the detectives’ statements did not have any tendency to either prove or disprove that he committed the arson and, furthermore, their statements provided no context to defendant’s statements because he never made any inculpatory statements or even shifted his story. Finally, defendant maintains that the statements of the detectives should have been excluded under Rule 403 because they were highly prejudicial due to the fact that the jury heard the same detective, who was on the stand while the video was played, repeatedly yell at defendant, call him a liar, and declare that his story was made up. 7', 'See Lanham v. Commonwealth, 171 S.W.3d 14, 28 n.57 (Ky. 2005) (Rule 105 of the Kentucky Rules of Evidence says, “When evidence which is admissible as to one (1) party or for one (1) purpose but not admissible as to another party or for another purpose is admitted, the court, upon request, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and admonish the jury accordingly. In the absence of such a request, the admission of the evidence by the trial judge without limitation shall not be a ground for complaint on appeal, except under the palpable error rule.”). Kentucky’s Rule 105 is different from Rhode Island’s Rule 105 in that the Rhode Island Rule does not contain the second sentence on review under the palpable error rule. See Rule 105 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', '- 21 -', 'As an initial matter, we must point out that the first trial justice’s ruling to deny defendant’s motion in limine addressed only the relevance of defendant’s statements, even though defense counsel conceded that defendant was not challenging the admission of his own statements. 8 Although we can infer that the first trial justice was not persuaded by defendant’s argument that the detectives’ comments were per se inadmissible as credibility testimony, it also does not appear from the record that he articulated a ruling on either that argument or on the balancing test required by Rule 403. The trial justice’s decision to admit the videotape was based solely on its probative value because he reasoned that, in the context of the entire case, the jury could conclude that defendant made false statements to the police, relying on our decision in State v. Diaz, 654 A.2d 1195 (R.I. 1995). We have held that failing to rule on an issue that has properly been raised is an error. See State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 953 (R.I. 2008) (“Superior Court erred when it did not attempt to strike a balance between the necessity of admission and the danger of unfair prejudice”); see also Power v. City of Providence, 582 A.2d 895, 900 (R.I. 1990) (in the civil context, “[t]he trial judge erred in failing to rule on the legal question of whether the settlement agreement is invalid on the basis that it contravenes the act”).', 'Nevertheless, to the extent that the comments from the officers may have prejudiced defendant, we conclude that the admission of such evidence—when viewed in light of the other overwhelming evidence against him—was harmless. We “will not disturb the trial justice’s ruling unless the abuse of discretion [or error] resulted in prejudicial error.” State v. Ceppi, 91 A.3d 320, 331 (R.I. 2014). “In order to meet the harmless-error test, there must be proof 8', 'Defense Counsel: “Not everything is admissible. Rules of evidence tell us what is admissible and what is not admissible and the opinions of police officers whether as to the character of somebody else or the hearsay statements, that[,] Judge[,] is objectionable.

Tavares, 590 A.2d 867, 870 (R.I. 1991). We have held that credibility-bolstering testimony by a witness during trial is impermissible, “even if the witness does not literally state an opinion concerning the credibility of another witness’s testimony.” State v. Lassiter, 836 A.2d 1096, 1107 (R.I. 2003). However, if such testimony is impermissibly admitted, this Court reviews the trial justice’s decision to admit the testimony for prejudicial error. State v. Rushlow, 32 A.3d 892, 899 (R.I. 2011). In Rushlow, we declined to vacate the conviction because a police officer’s testimony about the complaining witness’s sincerity was “brief and without follow-up,” and the complaining witness was extensively cross-examined, which “provided the jury with ‘ample opportunity to form an independent opinion’ about her credibility.” Id. at 900 (quoting State v. Higham, 865 A.2d 1040, 1046 (R.I. 2004)).', 'Because the statements by the detectives in this case were made during the course of an interrogation, it goes without saying that they were not spoken by a witness under oath during trial and, therefore, did not constitute “testimony,” as that term has traditionally been defined. Black’s Law Dictionary 1704 (10th ed. 2014) (“Evidence that a competent witness under oath or affirmation gives at trial or in an affidavit or deposition.”). We agree with those states that have concluded that such evidence is not strictly controlled by the rules on opinion testimony and should, therefore, be analyzed for its admissibility under Rules 401 and 403.', '- 23 -', 'Rule 401 defines “relevant evidence” as “evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Rule 403 provides that “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * * *.” We have held that “Rule 403 may be invoked to exclude evidence that is prejudicial to [the] defendant to the extent that the negative effect outweighs its probative value. Such evidence is rendered inadmissible if it is prejudicial and irrelevant.” State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 505 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Grundy, 582 A.2d 1166, 1172 (R.I. 1990)).', '“When a defendant objects to a remark as prejudicial, the trial justice is obliged to evaluate the potential prejudice of the statement or question on the outcome of the case by examining the statement in its factual context.” State v.

Patel, 949 A.2d 401, 413 (R.I. 2008).', '- 24 -', 'In this case, the detectives repeatedly told defendant that “the jig is up,” that he concocted the story, that he lied to them, and that he should express remorse. Much of the interrogation resulted in either nonresponsive answers or repeated denials from defendant.', 'Indeed, the majority of the video and transcript, after the initial confrontation with the witness statement, are dominated by the comments of the two detectives, with defendant occasionally responding in the negative. 9 Because of the paucity of relevant or useful responses to be gleaned from defendant’s consistent explanation of events and assertion of innocence, those officers’ comments cannot be said to have had any contextual value.', 'On the other hand, those comments certainly are prejudicial to defendant. The fact that the jury viewed a videotape of the very detective sitting on the witness stand telling defendant that he was a liar compounded the danger that the jury might have been prejudiced against defendant.', 'It is our view that defendant’s videotaped statements to the police, including that he had driven around aimlessly during near blizzard conditions while his business was completely engulfed in flames, that he had neglected to take his keys, glasses, wallet, and driver’s license with him, and that his home was broken into while he was gone, were far more prejudicial to him than anything said by his interrogators.

We are therefore unable to conclude that, in the factual context of this case, a reasonable possibility existed that the prejudicial effect of the officers’ comments impacted the outcome of his trial.', 'Ultimately, it is our opinion that the trial justice should have conducted a balancing test and carefully weighed the low probative value of the recorded comments from the officers against the prejudicial impact to defendant. But, to the extent that there was any error in admitting the videotaped interrogation, we conclude that it was harmless. Viewing the prejudice against the tapestry of the factual evidence and bearing in mind the conduct, tone, and length of this particular interrogation, we cannot conclude that the passions of the jury would have been “so inflame[d] * * * as to prevent their calm and dispassionate examination of the evidence.” Gomes, 764 A.2d at 136 (quoting Fernandes, 526 A.2d at 498).', 'Although we conclude that the videotaped interrogation admitted against this defendant was not so prejudicial as to require a new trial, we believe such evidence should be judiciously considered for its probative value when, as here, the defendant makes no inculpatory statements. We echo the observation of the Supreme Court of Kentucky that there is a real concern that these types of interrogations have the potential to lead to substantial prejudice, see Lanham, 171 S.W.3d at 28, and trial justices should be alert to the danger of potential abuse, such as the introduction of manufactured evidence that would not be admitted at trial. See Kitchen, 730 A.2d at 521 n.5 (“if the Commonwealth had no witnesses to produce in the instant case, then any comments to Appellee, on the videotapes, relating to witnesses would have to be redacted; the deception would be permissible, but it could not be displayed before the jury since the police comments would be irrelevant and prejudicial”).

If defendant had requested an instruction, the trial justice should have advised the jury of the context of an interrogation and admonished them that the tactics used by the police are not to be taken as evidence in and of themselves and that the credibility of all witnesses resides solely within their province.', 'B', 'Motion for New Trial', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial.

The trial justice concluded that the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that he set the fire willfully. Although the trial justice found that the police investigation “wasn’t perfect,” she nonetheless determined that the officers who testified for the state were credible. Despite her conclusion that, from an investigatory perspective, more could have been done, “they did a sufficient job to convince [her] and apparently to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that the [d]efendant planned and carried out the crime.” Critically, the trial justice also found that defendant’s version of events leading up to the time when Officer Dolan arrived at defendant’s home “lacked believability” and made no sense.', 'With respect to the eyewitness, the trial justice found that Paul Richard was a “credible witness even though he didn’t appear to be very sharp.

Upon reconsideration, we re-affirmed our initial holding, again vacated the conviction, and remanded the case for a new trial. State v. Mattatall, 525 A.2d 49, 53 (R.I. 1987).3 2', 'In Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436 (1986), a state prisoner sought habeas corpus; one issue decided by the Supreme Court was “whether the Sixth Amendment forbids admission in evidence of an accused’s statements to a jailhouse informant who was ‘placed in close proximity but made no effort to stimulate conversations about the crimes charged.’” Kuhlmann, 477 U.S. at 456 (brackets omitted) (quoting United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264, 271 n.9 (1980)). After reviewing a line of its previous cases, the Court held that, when an accused’s statements are obtained in this manner, the Sixth Amendment does not prohibit their admission into evidence. Id. The Court held that, in order to show a violation of an accused’s Sixth Amendment right in this circumstance, “the defendant must demonstrate that the police and their informant took some action, beyond merely listening, that was designed deliberately to elicit incriminating remarks.” Id. at 459. Kuhlmann remains good law today. 3', 'Upon reconsideration after remand by the Supreme Court, this Court held that Kuhlmann’s analysis, “when applied to the facts of the case at bar, leads us to the conclusion that the role of the informant * * * was not one of mere passive listener and therefore would be controlled by the', '-2-', 'The defendant’s second trial began in September 1987. However, he was twice held in contempt of court because of persistent misconduct in the courtroom, and a mistrial was declared. The defendant’s new (and last) trial was held in 1988, and he was found guilty again of second-degree murder. He was sentenced to sixty years’ imprisonment, with fifty years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation. The defendant also received an additional sentence of twenty years to serve as a habitual offender, which, importantly and as expected, was ordered to be served consecutively to the sentence for second-degree murder. The habitual offender sentence was to be nonparolable for the first eighteen years of the sentence. This Court affirmed defendant’s conviction in 1992. State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1119 (R.I. 1992). The record before us establishes that the judgment of conviction for the crime of murder, which was designated in the judgment as “count 1,” was incorrect because the sentence was ordered to be served consecutively to the sentence imposed as a habitual offender.', 'Although defendant has challenged his conviction and imprisonment regularly, appearing before the Superior Court and this Court on numerous occasions since 1992, the erroneous judgment of conviction was not discovered until almost three decades after it was entered.4 Significantly, Mattatall’s first appearance before the parole board was originally scheduled in 2001―after he served precisely eighteen years’ imprisonment, but the hearing actually occurred in 2002.5 In 2002, parole was denied for multiple reasons, including defendant’s disciplinary record at the Adult Correctional Institutions. He also appeared before the parole board on four doctrine * * * applied by us in our initial opinion.” State v. Mattatall, 525 A.2d 49, 52-53 (R.I. 1987). 4', 'The defendant had filed four petitions for postconviction relief prior to the filing of the motion to correct in the case on appeal, as well as other requests for relief filed since and currently pending before both the Superior Court and this Court. 5', 'The defendant asserts that he postponed his first parole hearing because he wanted to achieve six months of booking-free conduct in prison.', '-3- more occasions, in 2007, 2010, 2012, and 2014. After each hearing, parole was denied for reasons other than defendant’s behavior at the ACI, including the serious nature of the crime, his past criminal history, and the length of his sentence.', 'On July 13, 2015, defendant appeared before the parole board for the fifth time, and parole was granted. At that point, defendant had been incarcerated for more than thirty-two years. However, the minutes from that parole board hearing reflect uncertainty concerning whether defendant was eligible for release or whether he was to be paroled to begin serving the nonparolable eighteen-year habitual offender sentence. The parole board concluded that, if defendant’s eligibility had not been calculated in the aggregate, then defendant would be paroled to his consecutive sentence as a habitual offender in August 2015. However, the parole board also decided that, if it was determined that his eligibility had been calculated in the aggregate and he therefore no longer had consecutive time to serve, then he would be paroled in January 2016 to a residential substance-abuse treatment program.', 'In October 2015, the parole board chairperson, by letter to defendant, informed him that the parole decision would be applied to the sentence for the murder conviction and that he was paroled to the consecutive nonparolable sentence as a habitual offender, a sentence over which the parole board did not have jurisdiction. Therefore, after serving thirty-two years of a fifty- year sentence for second-degree murder, defendant was paroled to the habitual offender sentence, and will serve a total of at least fifty years in prison.', 'In 2016, defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, as well as an application for postconviction relief. On July 25, 2018, a hearing was held in the Superior Court on the Rule 35 motion and the', '-4- application for postconviction relief. Both the application and the Rule 35 motion were denied.6', 'In the Superior Court, Mattatall conceded that the sentence imposed in 1988 was not an illegal sentence under Rule 35(a), but that the error arose from the manner in which the sentence was executed. The defendant contended that the oral pronouncement of the sentence reflected that the habitual offender sentence was ordered to be served consecutively to the sentence for the murder conviction. Thus, under the law in effect at the time, G.L. 1956 § 13-8-13, he was eligible to appear before the parole board in 1993, after ten years’ imprisonment. But it was not until 2001 that he was first deemed eligible to appear before the parole board—after the precise length of the nonparolable sentence, which was eighteen years.', 'Unquestionably, in 1988, the trial justice sentenced defendant to sixty years at the ACI for second-degree murder, with fifty years to serve.', 'He also sentenced defendant to a consecutive term of twenty years’ imprisonment and ordered that eighteen years of that sentence was nonparolable. There is no dispute that the trial justice orally ordered that the habitual offender sentence be served consecutively to the sentence for the murder conviction. However, the written judgment for the murder conviction directs that the sentence is “to run consecutive to habitual offender sentence[,]” and the judgment for the habitual offender sentence mandates that sentence “[t]o run consecutive with count 1.”', 'Although defendant conceded before the trial justice that the sentence was not an illegal sentence under Rule 35, he argued that its execution was illegal and constituted a violation of his due-process rights because it deprived him of his right to appear before the parole board for eighteen years, which was eight years longer than § 13-8-13 provided.7 The defendant correctly 6', 'The trial justice’s denial of defendant’s application for postconviction relief is not before the Court in this present appeal. 7', 'Although defendant acknowledged before the trial justice that he was denied parole in 2002', '-5- argues that the judgment of conviction contains an error because it specifically recites that the sentence for murder shall “run consecutive to the habitual offender sentence.”', 'The state argued that the trial justice did not have the authority to adjust defendant’s parole eligibility because, even if the Department of Corrections improperly calculated his parole eligibility, this error did not render the sentence illegal for Rule 35 purposes.8 The state also argued that there was no prejudice from defendant seeing the parole board after eighteen years rather than ten years, because the reasons for the board ultimately denying parole were not related to defendant’s conduct at the ACI.', 'Despite the quandary created by the error in the judgment and the erroneous calculation of defendant’s parole-eligibility date, the trial justice was careful not to “play Super Parole Board” in making his decision. He found that the sentence being served by defendant―as a habitual offender―was a nonparolable term that could not be altered unless the trial justice first found that it was an illegal sentence. Because, as the parties agreed, defendant’s sentence was not an illegal sentence under Rule 35, the trial justice concluded that it was not subject to correction. However, the trial justice was “nonetheless troubled by the circumstances” presented by defendant’s situation. The trial justice denied defendant’s application for postconviction relief and his Rule 35 motion, ruling in favor of the state. Before this Court in this appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his Rule 35 motion. partly because of his institutional record, he contends that he was prejudiced because, had he appeared before the parole board eight years earlier, he would have received the rehabilitative direction from the parole board that triggered his eventual turnaround in behavior which led to his eventual parole. According to defendant, it was his initial appearance before the parole board in 2002 that gave rise to the realization that he could one day be released on parole. 8', 'The state also argued harmless error and asserted that the reasons for the denial of his parole after the initial 2002 appearance indicated that, had defendant seen the parole board eight years earlier, he might not have been released.', '-6-', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court follows a “strong policy against interfering with a trial justice’s discretion in sentencing matters.” State v. Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d 950, 952 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1254 (R.I. 2010)). Therefore, this Court’s “review of a trial justice’s decision on a Rule 35 motion is extremely limited.” Id. (quoting Chase, 9 A.3d at 1254). “When faced with the interpretation of statutes and court rules upon review of a Rule 35 motion, however,” this Court applies “a de novo standard.” State v. Bouffard, 35 A.3d 909, 916 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Goncalves, 941 A.2d 842, 847 (R.I. 2008)).', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to correct an illegal sentence. Because the judgment of conviction does not conform to the oral sentence, defendant contends, the sentence is illegal. With no citation to authority, defendant also contends that the judgment of conviction imposed an unauthorized form of punishment. We deem this incorrect. The defendant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment upon conviction for second- degree murder. Prison is where convicted murderers are sent; an unauthorized form of punishment for an offense such as this in this state would be the death penalty or a public flogging, for instance.', 'On the other hand, the state argues that the trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s Rule 35 motion for several reasons, including that the motion was “procedurally infirm” because defendant was not seeking to correct an illegal sentence within the meaning of Rule 35(a). Instead, as defendant conceded before the trial justice, he was challenging the execution of his sentence, not its legality. Additionally, the state argues that any correction to the judgment would not alter Mattatall’s current parole-eligibility date. According to the state, notwithstanding', '-7- the erroneous calculation of the date when Mattatall became eligible to apply for parole, he was eventually afforded the opportunity to appear. According to the state, Mattatall has failed to establish any prejudice from this delay. We decline to engage in this speculation, and we confine our analysis to the record.', 'We observe that, once defendant began the parole process, the reasons for which the parole board denied parole are in line with the board’s standards for evaluating parole applications in accordance with § 13-8-14.1, and accurately mirror the statutory release criteria set forth in § 13-8-14, the first of which is a prisoner’s institutional disciplinary record. The other factors include the seriousness of the offender’s crime and whether release would “depreciate the seriousness of the prisoner’s offense or promote disrespect for the law[.]” Section 13-8-14(a)(2). The reasons for denying Mattatall’s parole application clearly relate to the murder conviction, for which release on parole was granted in 2016. At that point, Mattatall had been incarcerated for thirty-two years and faced another eighteen years without parole. The minutes of his last appearance before the board on July 13, 2015, indicate that the board was “uncertain if Mr. Mattatall’s parole eligibility on his two sentences has been calculated in the aggregate.” However, the board decided that, if Mattatall “no longer has consecutive time to serve, then the [b]oard votes to parole Mr. Mattatall in January 2016 to [a] residential substance abuse treatment program[.]” Thus, as of July 2015, the parole board was of the opinion that his release on parole was appropriate. However, Mattatall faced either another six months in prison or an additional eighteen years.', 'This Court’s jurisprudence recognizes a difference between illegal sentences under Rule 35 and clerical mistakes in judgments under Rule 36. Relief under either rule is not available to this defendant. First, as he conceded in Superior Court, the trial justice did not', '-8- impose an illegal sentence. As the Reporter’s Notes to Rule 35(a) provide, “an ‘illegal sentence’ is one which has been imposed after a valid conviction but is not authorized under law.” This would include a sentence in excess of that provided by law or an unauthorized form of punishment, such as the death penalty. Unfortunately, the clerical mistake in the judgment of conviction was not discovered until defendant had served thirty-two years, and may have resulted in adverse consequences.', 'The trial justice was not without sympathy. He agreed that “somebody dropped the ball” and that Mattatall “was not seen by the [p]arole [b]oard when he lawfully was entitled to see the [p]arole [b]oard.” The state did not disagree that Mattatall’s parole eligibility was improperly calculated. However, the trial justice also recognized that defendant currently was serving a nonparolable term of imprisonment over which the parole board had no authority. He also correctly acknowledged that, in the context of this case, the law does not permit the court to alter the sentence without a finding that it was illegal. The trial justice pointed that out, and added: “But I am nonetheless troubled by the circumstances.”', 'Neither the trial justice nor this Court can turn back time, nor can we speculate, one way or the other, on what the parole board would have done had Mattatall timely appeared before the board after he had served ten years of the sentence for second-degree murder. This unfortunate circumstance cannot be corrected. We deem it appropriate, however, to exercise our supervisory jurisdiction and afford defendant an opportunity to seek relief from the trial justice who has patiently presided over this case for three decades. We fully recognize that “the exercise of our supervisory jurisdiction is an extraordinary measure.” State v. Barros, 24 A.3d 1158, 1166 (R.I. 2011) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1273 (R.I. 1980)). However, “this Court under its general supervisory powers can exercise its inherent power to', '-9- fashion an appropriate remedy to serve the ends of justice.” Bates-Bridgmon v. Heong’s Market, Inc., 152 A.3d 1137, 1145 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Clarke v. Morsilli, 723 A.2d 785, 786 (R.I. 1998) (mem.)). We hold that, based upon the dilemma wrought by the erroneous judgment in this case, the defendant may, within 120 days of the issuance of this opinion, file a motion to reduce the sentence imposed as a habitual criminal in accordance with Rule 35 and the general laws, or a motion to reduce the nonparolable portion of the sentence. See State v. O’Rourke, 463 A.2d 1328, 1331 (R.I. 1983) (noting that, in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 12-19-10, the Superior Court’s authority to reduce a sentence under Rule 35 is limited to shortening the period of imprisonment while not suspending any portion of a sentence the offender has commenced serving).', 'We hasten to add that, although we deem this opportunity to seek a reduction in sentence fully warranted under the circumstances before us, we are careful to make clear that our decision applies to this case and this case only.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court and remand this case to the Superior Court.', '- 10 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'State v.

5,State : v. : George L. Ditren :,reversal,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The defendant, George L. Ditren (Ditren or defendant), appeals from a finding that he violated his probation. This matter came before the Supreme Court on September 29, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the matter at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 19, 2013, at approximately 9:08 p.m., Providence Patrolman Michael Clary (Officer Clary) stopped a vehicle driven by Michael Clemente (Clemente) for failing to obey a yield sign while coming onto the Point Street Bridge and for crossing the center line of the road. 1 The defendant was a passenger in the vehicle, which belonged to Clemente’s girlfriend. Officer 1', 'Officer Clary also testified that the vehicle was traveling “at a high rate of speed” and “well over” the twenty-five-mile-per-hour speed limit.', '-1- Clary testified that as he approached the vehicle, he noticed defendant was “moving around a lot” and, more specifically, that defendant “made a movement towards the rear driver’s side towards the leg compartment” of the vehicle. Concerned for his safety, Officer Clary called for backup, to which Officer Robert Kells (Officer Kells) responded.', 'Upon Officer Kells’s arrival, the two patrolmen approached the vehicle – Officer Clary approached Clemente on the driver’s side and Officer Kells approached defendant on the passenger’s side. Officer Clary testified that Clemente appeared nervous, was sweating, and avoided eye contact, while Officer Kells testified that defendant also appeared to be nervous and sweating, and his “non-verbal body language” indicated that he was “hiding something.” When Officer Kells asked where they were coming from, defendant said that they were coming from his cousin’s house on Public Street; but, as Officer Kells noted, the vehicle was traveling in the “totally opposite direction” of Public Street.', 'Both men were ordered out of the vehicle and were subjected to a Terry 2 pat-down. 3 No weapons were found on either Clemente or defendant. The two were then placed in the back seats of separate patrol cars. Although they were not handcuffed, Officer Clary did testify that the back doors of the patrol cars were locked such that they could not be opened from the inside, so defendant and Clemente were, in effect, unable to get out of the cars. Officer Clary testified that neither Clemente nor defendant was under arrest at this time. A search of the rear driver’s side area of the vehicle – the area that Officer Clary observed defendant reaching into – revealed an Apple MacBook laptop and a Sony PlayStation 3 video game console. Officer Kells also observed a maroon pillowcase located underneath the front passenger seat where defendant was sitting. 2', 'Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). 3', 'By this time, three more officers had arrived on scene to provide additional backup.', '-2-', 'When asked, Clemente said that the laptop belonged to his cousin, Bernardino, and, at Officer Clary’s request, he turned it on. Saved on the desktop of the computer was a résumé with the last name “Calcagni.” Officer Kells called the phone number listed on the résumé and spoke to a man who identified himself as Anthony Calcagni, a recent graduate of Brown University. Calcagni verified that he owned the type of laptop and video game console that were found in the vehicle. The officers agreed to meet Calcagni, who had left home sometime around 8:20 that evening, at his apartment on Power Street.', 'Upon arriving home, Calcagni and the officers noticed that the air-conditioning unit in the bay window of his apartment was pushed inward from the window and onto the floor, presumably from someone breaking in. Officer Clary showed Calcagni the items found in the vehicle, which Calcagni identified as his. Notably, the laptop was inscribed with the last six digits of Calcagni’s Brown University student identification number, and he was indeed missing a maroon pillowcase from his bedroom. Clemente and defendant were ultimately transported to the Providence police station.', 'Detective Charles Boranian (Det. Boranian), who had also responded to the scene earlier, testified that he read defendant his Miranda rights at the police station. Detective Boranian further testified that, while defendant was cooperative at first, he became increasingly less obliging, especially when Det. Boranian asked for his girlfriend’s contact information to verify his assertion that he was with her earlier in the evening before “a friend” called him to “go for a ride.” A criminal complaint was filed against defendant charging him with burglary.', 'A combined bail and violation hearing was held in Providence County Superior Court on September 6, 9, and 10, 2013. The hearing justice found that the stop was legal and that defendant lacked standing to challenge the search of the vehicle because he was merely a', '-3- passenger in it, neither he nor Clemente owned the vehicle, and he had never driven it or kept any personal property in it. Furthermore, the hearing justice found that, even if defendant did have standing to challenge the search, it was “certainly * * * justified” based on defendant’s “so- called furtive movements” and his reaching toward the area behind the driver’s seat and under the passenger compartment. This, the hearing justice stated, was “enough to raise a reasonable and articulable suspicion in [Officer] Clary’s mind that there may be [weapons] or contraband or evidence of a crime being hidden under the driver’s seat and/or under the passenger seat by * * * defendant.” This reasonable and articulable suspicion was then “further * * * solidified” by the nervous demeanor and evasiveness exhibited by both Clemente and defendant.', 'The hearing justice went on to hold that, based on the evidence presented, the items seized from the vehicle were “obvious[ly]” stolen from Calcagni’s apartment and that defendant was at the very least in constructive possession of those items. The hearing justice inferred that, based on defendant’s furtive movements in the vehicle – specifically those in which he reached toward the rear driver’s-side leg compartment and underneath his seat – defendant was “attempting to hide * * * the computer and the PlayStation under the driver’s seat and the pillowcase under the front passenger seat.”', 'In light of this evidence, the hearing justice was “reasonably satisfied that * * * defendant failed to * * * be of good behavior” and concluded that defendant violated the terms of his probation. The hearing justice removed the suspension from defendant’s sentence and ordered him to serve five years in prison. Bail was also set on the burglary complaint. 4', 'On September 12, 2013, defendant filed a timely appeal to this Court. 4', 'To date, no indictment or information charging defendant with burglary or any other crime has been filed.', '-4-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The sole issue for a hearing justice to consider at a probation violation hearing is whether or not the defendant has breached a condition of his or her probation by failing to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” State v.

Thus, “[o]n appeal from a finding of a probation violation, this Court’s review is limited to ‘whether the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in assessing the credibility of the witnesses or in finding such a violation.’”', 'Tetreault, 973 A.2d at 492 (quoting State v.

(quoting Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 109).', '“The determination of whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, and thus standing, is a two-tiered analysis: (1) the defendant must have a ‘subjective expectation of privacy,’ and (2) the expectation must also be ‘one that society accepts as objectively reasonable.’” Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 109 (quoting State v. Bertram, 591 A.2d 14, 19 (R.I. 1991)). We look at several factors, such as “whether the suspect possessed or owned the area searched or the property seized; his or her prior use of the area searched or the property seized; the person’s ability to control or exclude others’ use of the property; and the person’s legitimate presence in the area searched.” State v.

While he was a legitimate guest in the vehicle, he had no ownership or possessory interest in it, nor does he assert any prior use of the vehicle, nor could he control or exclude others from its use. The same reasoning applies to the items seized from the vehicle – defendant asserts no ownership or lawful possessory interest in any of the property seized, nor does he assert any prior use of the property, nor could he rightfully control or exclude others’ use of any of the property. 6 In Quinlan, 921 A.2d at 110, we recognized that the defendant “certainly had no expectation of privacy that society would recognize as objectively reasonable” in a vehicle that he was merely a passenger in, had never driven, or kept any personal property in. Neither does defendant here. As such, he lacks standing to contest the legality of the search of the vehicle.', 'While we may be able to resolve this matter based on defendant’s lack of standing alone, we nevertheless address his remaining arguments on appeal. The defendant challenges the “prolonged and unjustified seizure of his person” and argues that the fruits of such an unjustified seizure should be suppressed. He argues that the seizure continued long after the purpose of the traffic stop had come to a close, which, according to defendant, is when the investigation should have ended. Although defendant was not under arrest, he was clearly seized when he was removed from the vehicle, told not to leave, and was put in the back seat of Officer Kells’s police car. While he was not handcuffed, the police car did not have door handles on the inside, so, in effect, defendant was not free to leave the vehicle. See State v. Foster, 842 A.2d 1047, 1050 (R.I. 2004) (“A police officer has ‘seized’ a person, within the meaning of the Fourth 6', 'The defendant himself undermines his own standing by asserting that “none of the items [seized] were in the immediate physical possession of [defendant]: it was not his vehicle, he was not driving, it was unknown how long he had been riding in the car, the objects were not on his person, and there was nothing about the objects that connected them to him.”', ""-7- Amendment, when he restrains that person's freedom to walk away.”) (citing State v.

However, the seizure of defendant and Clemente beyond this point was nonetheless warranted “based on a reasonable suspicion that resulted from the events that [Officers Clary and Kells] observed [during and] after a routine traffic stop.” Foster, 842 A.2d at 1052. “[T]he Supreme Court held that in evaluating the constitutionality of a stop, the totality of the circumstances must be taken into account.” Id. at 1050-51 (citing United States v.

Keohane, 814 A.2d 327, 330 (R.I. 2003)).', 'Here, in view of the totality of the circumstances surrounding defendant’s detention, as well as the factors we have explicitly enumerated, Officers Clary and Kells, who were both veteran police officers, had “an articulable basis for suspecting criminal activity and * * * the isolation and detention of * * * defendant [was] reasonable under the circumstances” while they continued their investigation.', 'See Foster, 842 A.2d at 1052.', 'Furthermore, we note that defendant and Clemente were only detained for approximately one hour, and there is no indication that they were mistreated by the police or subjected to improper questioning. See id. at 1051.', '-8-', 'B', 'The Exclusionary Rule Does Not Apply to Probation Violation Hearings', 'Even assuming the police illegally obtained the evidence, the exclusionary rule offers defendant no relief. The exclusionary rule, when applicable, bars the introduction of evidence obtained from illegal searches and seizures. See, e.g., State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I. 1983). However, “the law is well settled that the exclusionary rule does not apply to probation- violation hearings.” State v. Campbell, 833 A.2d 1228, 1232 (R.I. 2003) (citing State v. Spratt, 120 R.I. 192, 194, 386 A.2d 1094, 1095-96 (1978)).', 'Because a violation hearing is civil in nature, “the defendant is not entitled to ‘the full panoply of rights’ inherent in a criminal trial.” Campbell, 833 A.2d at 1233 (quoting State v.

We are satisfied that their conduct in doing so was proper.', 'C', 'Constructive Possession', 'Lastly, defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence presented to the hearing justice to satisfy even the lowered “reasonable satisfaction” standard with respect to the finding that he was in possession of the stolen property found in the vehicle.

Accordingly, there was more than enough evidence to meet the lowered “reasonably satisfied standard” with respect to the hearing justice’s finding that the defendant, at the very least, constructively possessed the stolen property found in the vehicle. Thus, it cannot be said that the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in finding that the defendant violated his probation.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

6,State : v. : Rafael Ferrer.,reversal,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Rafael Ferrer, was convicted by a jury on one count of carrying a pistol without a license and one count of possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a crime of violence. He has appealed from that conviction. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On January 20, 2011, the State of Rhode Island filed a criminal information charging defendant with one count of carrying a pistol without a license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-', '-1- 8(a) (Count One) and one count of possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-5 (Count Two).1', 'Prior to trial, defendant stipulated that he had been previously convicted of a crime that satisfied the predicate offense element set forth in § 11-47-5. So that the jury would not learn of that criminal history, defendant agreed that, if he was convicted on Count One, he would “automatically be adjudged convicted” on Count Two. Accordingly, a jury trial was held on Count One in October and November of 2011. We summarize below the salient aspects of what occurred at trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony of Trooper Brent Pereira', 'Massachusetts State Police Trooper Brent Pereira testified at trial.', 'It was Trooper Pereira’s testimony that he was working on the evening of September 12 and the early morning hours of September 13, 2010 as part of a construction detail on Interstate 195 in Seekonk, Massachusetts. He testified that he left the construction detail and began following a “dark- colored green Toyota Rav4” in a westerly direction on Interstate 195; he did so after receiving a radio message advising him to be on the lookout for a dark-colored sport-utility vehicle (SUV) that was possibly traveling towards Providence. He further testified that that radio message also informed him that the SUV had multiple occupants (“most likely three”), who were described as being dark-skinned Hispanic males. It was his testimony that, while following the SUV, he drove his police cruiser alongside the right side and then the left side of the SUV and that he illuminated the interior of the SUV with his “cruiser-mounted spotlight” from both sides in order 1', 'The defendant was also charged in that criminal information with one count of possession of a firearm by a person who is a fugitive from justice in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-5 (Count Three), but the state dismissed that count pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', '-2- to observe the occupants; he added that he observed a female driver and three male occupants, who appeared to him to be dark-skinned. According to Trooper Pereira’s testimony, he decided to continue to follow the SUV as it drove into Rhode Island so that he could conduct a motor vehicle stop when “backup” became available; he learned that there would be “backup” available on the right side of westbound Interstate 195 just before the Iway Bridge.', 'Trooper Pereira testified that, as he approached the bridge, he saw that there were other state police cruisers occupying the breakdown lane as well as the right travel lane just before the beginning of the bridge; he stated that the cruisers had their overhead red and blue emergency lights activated. Trooper Pereira added that he turned on his emergency lights to signal the SUV to pull over. He testified that the SUV drove past the other police cruisers and came to a stop in front of them; he added that the guardrail on the right side of the bridge was approximately three or four feet from the passenger’s side of the vehicle. Trooper Pereira further testified that he stopped his cruiser at a point between ten and fifteen feet behind the SUV. According to his testimony, there were overhead lights on the bridge, and he had his headlights, searchlight, and “takedown” lights (bright white lights located on the light bar on top of the cruiser) fixed on the back of the SUV. He answered in the affirmative when asked on direct examination whether he could “clearly see into the rear of that vehicle,” and he stated that he observed two black males in the backseat of the SUV. Trooper Pereira also stated: “I opened my cruiser door and I stepped half way out and I got onto my PA system.” According to his testimony, he then saw that the passenger in the right rear seat of the SUV had moved slightly to the side and extended most of his arm out of the right rear window. He further testified that he observed a “grayish metallic object released from [that] arm and go over the guardrail.” It was Trooper Pereira’s testimony that he turned and mentioned to a Rhode Island trooper that he had seen one of the passengers', '-3- throw something over the guardrail; he added that troopers then searched the area below the bridge.', 'Trooper Pereira testified that he then proceeded to instruct the occupants of the SUV to place their hands on the ceiling while remaining inside of the SUV. He further testified that he instructed the right rear passenger to extend his arm outside of the door through the window and to open the door from the outside, walk to the trooper’s location, and assume a kneeling position; he added that, after the right rear passenger complied, he asked the man his name and was informed that it was Rafael Ferrer. At trial, he identified defendant as the right rear passenger of the SUV. Trooper Pereira stated that, after all four occupants of the SUV were in custody, another trooper directed his attention to the area below the bridge to the right side of where the SUV was stopped. He stated that he observed a firearm on an abutment approximately twenty to twenty-five feet down.', 'B', 'The Testimony of Trooper Daniel Hernandez', 'Rhode Island State Police Trooper Daniel Hernandez testified next. Trooper Hernandez testified that, shortly after 12 a.m. on September 13, 2010, he responded to the Iway Bridge to assist a Massachusetts State Trooper, whom he identified as being Trooper Pereira, in connection with a motor vehicle stop. Trooper Hernandez testified that, when he arrived at the Iway Bridge, Trooper Pereira’s cruiser was parked behind a dark-colored SUV in the breakdown lane and that he was outside of his car, giving instructions to the right rear passenger of the SUV to slowly exit the vehicle. At trial, Trooper Hernandez identified defendant as the right rear passenger.', 'Trooper Hernandez testified that he then spoke to Trooper Pereira, who informed him that he had “observed the occupant throw something out of the vehicle and it went over the side', '-4- of the bridge.” Trooper Hernandez stated that he went “down around to the intersection of Tockwotton Street and South Water Street” in order to investigate the area that was below the bridge and perpendicular to the passenger’s side of the SUV. In response to being asked why he focused on that area, he stated:', '“Because it was below the vehicle. Lined up. It made sense. If', 'something was thrown from a vehicle, it would -- it could --', 'likelihood that it would land there.” Trooper Hernandez testified that, after climbing up to the second tier of the bridge abutment, he found a handgun lying on its side approximately fifteen to twenty-five feet below and ten to fifteen feet perpendicular to the part of the bridge where the SUV was positioned; he added that, from where he was standing when he discovered the handgun, he could see the SUV. He testified that there were four or five live ammunition rounds around the handgun and that there was one “spent cartridge that was half in the cylinder of the revolver.” He testified that, although the abutment was dirty and sandy, the handgun was not. Trooper Hernandez identified the handgun shown to him at trial as being the same one that he had observed on the abutment.', 'C', 'The Testimony of Corporal John Grassel', 'Rhode Island State Police Corporal John Grassel also testified at trial, after first having been qualified by the trial justice as an “expert in crime scene evidence collection.” He testified that, on the morning of September 13, 2010, he was called to assist other troopers at a crime scene located at “South Water and Tockwotton Street * * * in the area of the Iway Bridge.” He stated that at that crime scene he recovered from the bridge abutment a .38 caliber revolver, one cartridge casing which was partially inside one of the chambers of the gun, and five cartridges in the immediate vicinity of the weapon; he identified the handgun entered into evidence at trial as', '-5- being the same handgun that he observed on September 13, 2010. When he was shown at trial a photograph of the handgun lying on the abutment, Corporal Grassel pointed out that the photograph showed a glass bottle near the handgun, and he testified that he had observed that glass bottle when he recovered the handgun near the abutment. Corporal Grassel stated that, while there was debris including sand, gravel, and cigarette butts on the abutment where he recovered the gun, “the firearm was relatively clean, as far as soot or soil,” whereas the bottle “had a layer of soot or sand on it.”', 'According to Corporal Grassel’s testimony, the firearm was tested for fingerprints approximately six months after it was seized. He further testified that there were no latent fingerprints on “the cartridges, the cartridge, the cartridge casing, or the weapon;” however, he added that the chance of finding fingerprints “would definitely be less after six months.” Corporal Grassel stated that the bottle was neither seized nor processed for fingerprints. He also stated that it was determined that the firearm had been lawfully purchased in Maine; it was his testimony, however, that he never inquired of the registered owner (who was not defendant) as to how the firearm came to be located on the bridge abutment.', 'D', 'Stipulations and the Defendant’s Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal', 'Following Corporal Grassel’s testimony, it was then stipulated: (1) that, on September 13, 2010, defendant did not have a duly issued license to carry or possess a firearm; and (2) that the firearm at issue was operable on that date. At the close of the prosecution’s case, defense counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice found that the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the state, was sufficient to warrant a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt', '-6- on Count One and, therefore, automatically, on Count Two. In denying defendant’s motion, the trial justice stated:', '“The evidence, if viewed in that regard, together with all', 'reasonable inferences, the testimony is that the officer viewed the', 'individual, later to be identified by him as your client, in the right', 'rear passenger seat of the vehicle throwing a metal object, as he', 'described it, out of the window of the vehicle over the wall of the', 'bridge. Later, the area was inspected below that parapet. The only', 'thing that was found was a firearm and an old bottle, the inference', 'fairly being that this was the object that was thrown from the', 'vehicle and thrown by your client.” After the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the defense proceeded to present its case.', 'E', 'The Testimony of Lina Leav', 'The driver of the SUV, Lina Leav, testified for the defense. She testified that she was driving her 2002 Toyota Rav4 SUV westbound on Interstate 195 on the night of September 12 and the early morning hours of September 13, 2010. Ms. Leav testified that Rafael Ferrer, a friend of her boyfriend, was a passenger in the SUV and that he was seated in the rear seat on the driver’s side (the left side); she added that a man named Pablo, whom she had met that night and whose last name she did not know, was sitting in the rear seat on the passenger’s side (the right side). She further testified that, as she was entering Providence near the Iway Bridge, she was pulled over by a State Police cruiser. It was her testimony that she drove past the police cruisers that were already positioned in the breakdown lane and parked on the bridge; she added that the police cruiser which signaled her to pull over then stopped approximately one car length behind her SUV—at an angle so that the cruiser was “closest to the driver’s rear quarter” of her SUV. She stated that the trooper told her and the other occupants to put their hands on the ceiling and', '-7- then asked them to “roll” down the windows. She also testified that the trooper told the passengers to exit the SUV one by one, opening the car doors by extending their arms through the open windows. According to her testimony, Pablo, who occupied the rear passenger’s seat, was the first person to exit the SUV, followed by defendant, Rafael Ferrer.', 'Ms. Leav testified that no one threw anything out of the SUV when it was being pulled over because the windows were rolled up. She further testified that she did not see anything thrown out of the windows when the trooper requested that the windows be rolled down. It was her testimony, however, that her attention was focused “only” on the state trooper, and her testimony indicated that she observed him by using her “driver door mirror.” She answered in the affirmative when asked on cross-examination if she was not paying attention to the backseat passengers.', 'F', 'The Defendant’s Renewed Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal, the Jury Instructions, and', 'Defense Counsel’s Closing Argument', 'At the close of defendant’s case, defense counsel renewed his motion for a judgment of acquittal; the trial justice again denied the motion “for the reasons given previously by the court.”', 'The trial justice proceeded to instruct the jury. Among the instructions given to the jury, the trial justice stated that the jury should not consider punishment in its deliberations because punishment “should never be considered by the jury in any way in arriving at an impartial verdict.”', 'Defense counsel thereafter made his closing argument to the jury, during which the following exchange occurred between defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the trial justice:', '-8-', '“[Defense Counsel]: There should be some corroboration of the', 'facts of this case. How many times have you heard recently in the', 'news people who are serving 20 years in jail for a rape or murder', 'they didn’t commit?', '“[State]: Objection.', '“[Trial Justice]: I’m not going to stand for that. I told this jury', 'that issues relating to punishment shouldn’t even be a topic of their', 'discussions, and it better not be in -- continue to be part of your', 'comments.', '“[Defense Counsel]: That wasn’t my intention, but my point is', 'every day people are found to have not committed a crime --', '“[State]: Objection.', '“[Trial Justice]: Be careful, [Defense Counsel].', '“[Defense Counsel]: I understand, Judge. -- because of scientific', 'evidence. Do you really think that mistakes are only made in those', 'types of cases, or do you think that they’re made across the board', 'just every now and then? There’s not that type of DNA evidence', 'or something else to exonerate the person. I suggest to you that’s', 'exactly the case in this situation. The defense never had the', 'opportunity to have that weapon fingerprinted. It was in the', 'custody of the State Police.', '“[State]: Objection.', '“[Trial Justice]: Sustain that objection.”', 'Ultimately, the jury found defendant guilty on Count One.', 'The trial justice then proceeded to rule, pursuant to the parties’ pretrial stipulation, that defendant was also automatically guilty on Count Two.', 'In due course, on January 12, 2012, the trial justice sentenced defendant to two concurrent terms of ten years to serve on Counts One and Two. Defense counsel agreed that defendant was subject to the habitual offender statute codified in G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21, and the trial justice, pursuant to that statute, also sentenced defendant to a term of twenty years', '-9- imprisonment, with eight years to serve without the possibility of parole and the remaining twelve years suspended, with probation, to run consecutively to the ten-year sentences.', 'The defendant filed a notice of appeal on February 10, 2012.2 On appeal, defendant makes two arguments: (1) that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal; and (2) that the trial justice “violated his right to assistance of counsel under the United States and Rhode Island constitutions by improperly restricting defense counsel’s closing argument.”', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the evidence presented at trial did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that “Mr. Ferrer (and not another occupant) threw a gun (and not another object) out of the SUV.” (Parentheticals in original.)', 'Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “a judgment of acquittal shall be entered when the evidence is not legally sufficient to sustain a conviction.” State v. Lopez, 78 A.3d 773, 780-81 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Cardin, 987 A.2d 248, 250 (R.I. 2010). When this Court considers the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, “[t]he standard of review is not that of abuse of discretion, but rather whether the trial justice was correct as a matter of law.” State v. Rodriguez, 742 A.2d 728, 732 (R.I. 1999). As such, we proceed in a de novo manner. See Grady v. Narragansett 2', 'On February 10, 2012, defendant filed a motion in the Superior Court for leave to file a notice of appeal out of time, which was granted.', '- 10 - Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 41 (R.I. 2009) (“In contrast to our deferential stance vis-à-vis factual findings made by a trial justice, we review in a de novo manner a trial justice’s rulings concerning questions of law.”); see also Waterman v. Caprio, 983 A.2d 841, 844 (R.I. 2009). In reviewing “a trial justice’s denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal, we employ the same standards as the trial court.” State v. Robat, 49 A.3d 58, 71-72 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Buchanan, 81 A.3d 1119, 1128 (R.I. 2014); State v. DeOliveira, 972 A.2d 653, 663 (R.I. 2009). That standard requires this Court to “view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, giving full credibility to its witnesses, and drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.”', 'State v. Diaz, 46 A.3d 849, 860 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Whitaker, 79 A.3d 795, 809 (R.I. 2013); State v. Pitts, 990 A.2d 185, 189 (R.I. 2010). Then, if that examination “reveals evidence sufficient to warrant a jury verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial justice’s decision should be upheld.” Lopez, 78 A.3d at 781; State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1232, 1237 (R.I. 2010); State v. Mondesir, 891 A.2d 856, 861 (R.I. 2006).', 'The defendant supports his argument that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal by emphasizing: (1) that not one of the state troopers at the scene, other than Trooper Pereira, saw defendant throw an object from the window of the SUV; (2) that Trooper Pereira could not identify the object that he alleged was thrown from the SUV by defendant as a gun; (3) that the discovery of the gun on the bridge abutment was insufficient to prove that it was the particular object that had been allegedly thrown from the SUV; and (4) that Trooper Pereira was unable to see the face of the individual who allegedly threw the object because he was positioned behind the SUV and based his conclusion that defendant had thrown the gun only on his belief that it was defendant who was the right rear passenger in the SUV.', '- 11 -', 'We are not persuaded by defendant’s arguments. This Court, like the trial justice, “is required to evaluate only that evidence that the prosecution claims is capable of supporting proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Lopez, 78 A.3d at 781 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Cardin, 987 A.2d at 250. Drawing all inferences in favor of the state, we are convinced that the testimony of Troopers Pereira and Hernandez as well as that of Corporal Grassel was sufficient to support the conviction.', 'It was adduced at trial that Trooper Pereira saw an individual, later identified by him as defendant, who was seated in the right rear passenger’s seat of the SUV, throw a “grayish metallic” object out of the window of the SUV; according to Trooper Pereira’s testimony, the object went over the guardrail of the bridge. Trooper Hernandez corroborated Trooper Pereira’s testimony that defendant was the right rear passenger in the SUV; and he stated that, when he inspected an abutment below the bridge and perpendicular to the passenger’s side of the SUV, he observed a firearm. Although defendant notes that Ms. Leav’s testimony with respect to the positions of the passengers in the car was contradictory to the testimony of Troopers Pereira and Hernandez, this Court has stated that we “[do] not pass upon the credibility of witnesses in determining whether a judgment of acquittal was warranted.” State v. Long, 61 A.3d 439, 446 (R.I. 2013); see also State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010) (stating that, in reviewing a trial justice’s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, “we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and draw therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Corporal Grassel additionally testified that the only items he observed on the abutment were a firearm and a glass bottle; and he added that the glass bottle had “a layer of soot or sand on it” whereas the firearm was “relatively clean.” When viewing this evidence in the light most', '- 12 - favorable to the state, we are satisfied that a logical and reasonable inference could be drawn that the handgun found on the abutment was the object that was thrown from the SUV and that it was thrown by defendant. Accordingly, it is our opinion that the state produced sufficient evidence from which a jury could infer beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the handgun.3', 'After a careful review of the evidence presented in the instant case and considering that evidence in the light most favorable to the state, giving full credibility to its witnesses and drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with defendant’s guilt, it is clear to us, as it was to the trial justice, that there was more than sufficient evidence submitted at trial to support a verdict of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. See Lopez, 78 A.3d at 781; State v. Rolon, 45 A.3d 518, 524-25 (R.I. 2012); State v. Cipriano, 21 A.3d 408, 421-22 (R.I. 2011). Accordingly, the trial justice did not err when he denied defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal.', 'B', 'Defense Counsel’s Closing Argument', 'The defendant’s second argument on appeal is that he is entitled to a new trial because, in his view, the trial justice “violated his right to assistance of counsel under the United States and Rhode Island constitutions by improperly restricting defense counsel’s closing argument.” The defendant focuses on two points in the closing argument as to each of which he contends that there was an improper restriction on defense counsel’s argument. We shall address each in turn.', 'We have recognized that “final argument is a vital part of the assistance of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States * * * .” State v. 3', 'It will be recalled that it was stipulated during the course of trial that defendant did not have a license to possess a firearm on September 13, 2010 and that the firearm was operable on that date.', 'The defendant had also stipulated prior to trial that he would “automatically be adjudged convicted” on Count Two if he was convicted on Count One.', '- 13 - Pemental, 434 A.2d 932, 937 (R.I. 1981); see Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 862 (1975) (“In a criminal trial, which is in the end basically a factfinding process, no aspect of such advocacy could be more important than the opportunity finally to marshal the evidence for each side before submission of the case to judgment.”). It is well settled, however, “that the conduct of a trial in the Superior Court is within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Barnes v. Quality Beef Co., 425 A.2d 531, 534 (R.I. 1981). And, “[i]t is a long-standing rule of law that the trial justice sitting in a jury trial may, in the exercise of his [or her] sound discretion, limit the scope and extent of counsel’s closing argument.” Id. at 535; see also State v. Frost, 161 P.3d 361, 365 (Wash. 2007) (en banc) (“It is well established that trial courts possess broad discretionary powers over the scope of counsel’s closing arguments.”). In State v. Ellis, 619 A.2d 418 (R.I. 1993), we expressly alluded to the broad discretion accorded to the trial justice with respect to ensuring that closing argument “does not stray unduly from the mark, or otherwise impede the fair and orderly conduct of the trial.” Id. at 422 (internal quotation marks omitted). The following passage from Ellis is directly relevant to the instant case:', '“This is not to say that closing arguments in a criminal case', 'must be uncontrolled or even unrestrained.

The trial justice instead admonished defendant that issues relating to punishment should not “continue to be part of [his] comments,” and the trial justice referred to his explicit prior instruction to the jury that punishment “should never be considered by the jury in any way in arriving at an impartial verdict.” It is worth noting that the entire colloquy took place in the presence of the jury; and, therefore, the jury heard defense counsel’s clear argument regarding what he contended was a lack of corroborating evidence in the case at bar. In our judgment, the cautionary language of the trial justice with respect to defense counsel’s mention of “people who are serving 20 years in jail” cannot be construed as a limitation on defendant’s closing argument; it was simply a reminder to counsel that punishment was not a permissible topic. Accordingly, we see no merit in the first of defendant’s contentions as to the violation of his right to the assistance of counsel.', 'The defendant’s second contention in relation to the closing argument is that the trial justice improperly curtailed defense counsel’s opportunity to present the case to the jury by sustaining the state’s objection to defense counsel’s statement “pointing out the undisputed fact that the gun had been in the custody of the Rhode Island State Police since the date of the alleged offense.” Immediately after the colloquy with the court that we discussed in the preceding case. How many times have you heard recently in the news people who are serving 20 years in jail for a rape or murder they didn’t commit?” See Part I.F., supra.', '- 15 - paragraph, defense counsel proceeded to state in the presence of the jury: “The defense never had the opportunity to have that weapon fingerprinted. It was in the custody of the State Police.” At that point, the prosecutor objected, which objection was sustained by the trial justice. It is defendant’s argument on appeal that “[d]efense counsel was entitled to argue that[,] without fingerprints, Mr. Ferrer could not, unfortunately, be exonerated by scientific evidence” and that his assertion that the firearm had been in the custody of the police “tied in with defense counsel’s argument that the state may have greatly reduced the likelihood of successful fingerprinting by waiting to test until six months after the gun was seized, test-fired, and repeatedly handled * * * .”', 'We do not find defendant’s argument to be at all persuasive. We agree with the state’s assertion in its written submission to this Court that defense counsel’s statement tended to imply, misleadingly, to the jury that the state “had acted deliberately to violate [defendant’s] rights.” Nothing in the record indicates that defendant at any point sought to have a fingerprint test performed on the firearm or was prevented by the state from doing so. It was well within the trial justice’s discretion to sustain the state’s entirely proper objection in order to ensure that the closing argument did “not stray unduly from the mark.” Ellis, 619 A.2d at 422 (quoting Herring, 422 U.S. at 862).', 'It is our definite opinion that no limitation on closing argument occurred at the time of the first objection and that the trial justice properly sustained the state’s subsequent objection to defense counsel’s statement with respect to the fingerprinting of the handgun.

On April 5, 2012, a Providence County Superior Court jury found the defendant, Elizabeth Mendez, guilty of possession of more than five kilograms of marijuana in violation of G.L. 1956 § 21-28-4.01.2(a)(5).1 On May 24, 2012, the trial justice sentenced the defendant to twenty years imprisonment, with five years to serve and the remaining time suspended with probation.', 'On appeal, defendant contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in his supplemental jury instruction given in response to a question posed by the jury; (2) that the trial justice erred in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial; and (3) that defendant’s twenty-year sentence is violative of Article 1, Section 8 of the Rhode Island Constitution. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The cited statute provides, in pertinent part, as follows: “Except as authorized by the chapter, it shall be unlawful for any person to possess, manufacture, sell, or deliver the following enumerated quantities of certain controlled substances: * * * (5) More than five kilograms (5 kgs.) of a mixture containing a detectable amount of marijuana[.]” G.L. 1956 § 21-28- 4.01.2(a)(5).', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On January 20, 2011, defendant was charged by indictment with one count of possession of more than five kilograms of marijuana in violation of § 21-28-4.01.2(a)(5), (b) (Count 1); one count of conspiracy to possess more than five kilograms of marijuana in violation of § 21-28- 4.08 (Count 2); and one count of possession of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)2 in violation of § 21-28-4.01(c)(2)(i) (Count 4).3 In that same indictment, two co-defendants were similarly charged with possession of more than five kilograms of marijuana and conspiracy to possess more than five kilograms of marijuana.4 Those co-defendants, Osvaldo German and Jonathan Espinal, were not tried with defendant.5', 'The defendant’s criminal trial began in March of 2012, and the evidence presented therein included testimony from Trooper Marc Alboum of the Rhode Island State Police, Officer Diego Mello of the East Providence Police Department, Officer Raymond Reall of the North 2', 'Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, more commonly known as ecstasy or MDMA, is a type of psychoactive drug which “produces feelings of increased energy, euphoria, emotional warmth, and distortions in time, perception, and tactile experiences.” Vasquez v.

The Testimony of Trooper Marc Alboum', 'The state began its case with the testimony of Trooper Alboum of the Rhode Island State Police. Trooper Alboum testified that, while he was on patrol in his cruiser on the night of July 26, 2010, he heard a broadcast on his police radio about a carjacking at gunpoint in the city of Providence, specifically at the intersection of Admiral Street and Hawkins Street. Trooper Alboum stated that the broadcast described the carjacking suspects as “two dark-skinned males * * * wearing white T-shirts,” and he added that the broadcast described the car as a “light blue Kia minivan.” He further testified that he heard in a later broadcast that the carjacked vehicle had been recovered in a Walgreens parking lot. Trooper Alboum testified that he proceeded to that location; he said that, at the Walgreens, there were law enforcement officers from several police departments all “standing around.” In his testimony, Trooper Alboum estimated that there were around fifteen to twenty officers in uniform at the scene. 6', 'We omit from our discussion the testimony of Trooper Ernest Adams, Trooper Luke Shatz, and Trooper Herbert Tilson, as their testimony has no direct bearing on defendant’s contentions on appeal. In addition, we reference only where necessary the testimony of two forensic scientists, Paul Breault and Paul Steven Iwuc. The forensic testing undertaken by those scientists, performed in order to identify the substances found in defendant’s car, need not be revisited in detail here. The parties do not dispute on appeal that both MDMA and marijuana were discovered in defendant’s vehicle, nor do the parties dispute the amounts found therein.', '-3-', 'Next, Trooper Alboum testified that, while he was standing in the Walgreens parking lot, he observed a black Nissan Maxima drive past. Trooper Alboum testified that he could see that the driver of the Nissan Maxima was a woman and that in the car there were two male passengers, both dark-skinned and wearing white T-shirts. Trooper Alboum also testified that the driver of the Nissan Maxima was “staring straight ahead” as she passed the Walgreens parking lot and that her two passengers were “slouching down,” while also “looking straight ahead.” Trooper Alboum further testified that the behavior of the occupants of that car stood out in contrast to what was transpiring in the other cars passing by, in that the occupants of the latter cars were turning their heads in the direction of what Trooper Alboum testified was a “large police presence” in the parking lot.', 'Trooper Alboum then testified that, after observing the occupants of the Nissan Maxima, he proceeded to “run an inquiry” on the vehicle’s license plate and discovered that the license plate affixed to the Nissan Maxima “came back [registered to] a 2000 silver Toyota.” Trooper Alboum stated that “the registration [did not] match the vehicle.” It was Trooper Alboum’s testimony that, after that discovery, he started his cruiser and began to follow the Nissan Maxima. He further testified that he “clock[ed]” it as traveling at 45 miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour zone. Trooper Alboum stated that the Nissan Maxima proceeded to enter Route 146 and that, as it did so, it entered “right behind [another] vehicle, nearly striking it.” Trooper Alboum testified that, as he followed the Nissan Maxima onto Route 146, he activated his lights and siren; he added that the Nissan Maxima nonetheless continued without stopping. Trooper Alboum stated that it was only after another police cruiser passed the Nissan Maxima in the high speed lane, positioned itself in front of the vehicle, and slowed down, that the Nissan Maxima slowed and eventually stopped.', '-4-', 'Trooper Alboum then testified that, after exiting his cruiser, he approached the Nissan Maxima and that, as he did so, he could smell “the odor of fresh marijuana” emanating from the back of that vehicle. He further testified that he approached the driver’s side of the car and asked all of the occupants to “put their hands up;” Trooper Alboum stated that he made this request in order to “see everyone’s hands to make sure they didn’t have any weapons in their hands * * * .” He testified that, although all of the occupants initially complied, he observed that Mr. Espinal, the passenger seated behind the driver’s seat, was “starting to put his hands down.”7 It was Trooper Alboum’s testimony that he asked Mr. Espinal to step out of the car, searched him for weapons, and handcuffed him, before finally placing him in the back of the police cruiser.', 'Trooper Alboum testified that he then returned to the Nissan Maxima and approached the driver’s side. It was Trooper Alboum’s testimony that, at that point in time, he could detect the odor of burnt marijuana coming from inside the vehicle. He testified that he asked defendant, the driver of the car, for her license and that, when she began to reach toward the floor of the car, he asked her to step out of the car.8 He said that he made that request because “it’s not normal that people reach for their licenses on the floor of the vehicle.”', 'Trooper Alboum further testified that, after defendant stepped out of the car, he “sent her * * * towards the other troopers;” he added that he did not handcuff her himself, because his “set of handcuffs was on Mr. Espinal.”9 Trooper Alboum next testified that he checked under the 7', 'During his testimony at trial, Trooper Alboum identified the person seated behind the driver as co-defendant Jonathan Espinal. 8', 'During Trooper Alboum’s in-court testimony, he identified defendant as being the driver of the car on the night of July 26, 2010. 9', 'Although Trooper Alboum was not able to testify specifically as to the details of defendant’s arrest because he neither arrested defendant personally nor observed another officer effectuating the arrest, it is apparent from the record that the arrest occurred after Trooper', '-5- floor mat on the driver’s side (where defendant had been sitting) and found a “clear plastic baggy with a half a blue pill” inside.10 He added that Officer Raymond Reall of the North Providence Police Department searched the other passenger, Mr. German, and in the course of that search found a “plastic bag” containing what appeared to be marijuana.11 It was Trooper Alboum’s testimony that, following that discovery, he embarked on a more thorough search of the car with the assistance of another law enforcement officer—namely, Officer Reall, who had accompanied him in a separate cruiser in the pursuit of the Nissan Maxima onto Route 146.', 'Trooper Alboum stated that, in the course of the more thorough search, he opened the trunk of the Nissan Maxima and immediately observed “two rectangular objects that had a clearish green plastic baggy on it [sic].” In addition, Trooper Alboum noted that the odor of fresh marijuana “increased * * * significant[ly]” once he had opened the trunk. According to Trooper Alboum’s testimony, a complete search of the trunk yielded six such “rectangular objects” (which he described as “bales”) covered in “greenish clear cellophane wrap.” Later testimony at trial by one of the state’s forensic scientists was to the effect that the bales contained marijuana and that the total weight of the marijuana was approximately thirty kilograms.12', 'Trooper Alboum further testified that, on July 27, 2010 (the morning after the arrests of defendant, Mr. German, and Mr. Espinal), Mr. German agreed to make a statement, and he was Alboum asked defendant to step out of the car and sent her in the direction of the other law enforcement officers at the scene. 10', 'One of the forensic scientists who testified for the state indicated that his testing demonstrated that the blue pill contained MDMA. 11', 'When Officer Reall testified during defendant’s trial, he stated that the marijuana was found during a patdown of Mr. German’s clothing. 12', 'One kilogram is the equivalent of approximately 2.2 pounds in the system of weights commonly used in this country. See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 966 (5th ed. 2011). Accordingly, the bales referred to in the text weighed approximately sixty- six pounds.', '-6- advised of his constitutional rights at that time.', 'The trooper testified that his subsequent discussion with Mr. German lasted approximately twenty to thirty minutes; he added that the discussion was thereafter memorialized in a six-page “formal typed statement” (hereinafter “the unsigned statement”). Trooper Alboum stated that Mr. German initialed each of the first five pages of the unsigned statement, but did not sign it or check a box indicating that the “above statement was true to the best of [his] knowledge.” Trooper Alboum further testified that he (Trooper Alboum) thereafter changed the last line of the unsigned statement and that the resulting version of the statement was read and signed by Mr. German (hereinafter “the signed statement”). According to Trooper Alboum’s testimony, the two statements were substantively identical, with the exception of the last line.', 'Trooper Alboum first testified concerning the contents of Mr. German’s unsigned statement. He stated that, in the course of his conversation with Mr. German about the events leading to defendant’s arrest, Mr. German told him that defendant had come and picked up Mr. Espinal and Mr. German around 6 or 7 p.m. on what would be the night of the arrest. Trooper Alboum then testified that Mr. German said that a friend named Felix had called and told Mr. German that he had marijuana and wanted to know if Mr. German could “get rid of it.” Trooper Alboum further testified that Mr. German also told him that Felix then said that he had “something for Ellie”13 and that Mr. German should “come get it.” Trooper Alboum stated that Mr. German then said that defendant, who was in the car with Mr. German and Mr. Espinal, could hear the phone conversation between Mr. German and Felix and that Mr. German subsequently directed defendant to drive to the location where they would meet Felix. 13', 'It was Trooper Alboum’s testimony that Mr. German “specifically used the word ‘Ellie’ to refer to the defendant.”', '-7-', 'It was Trooper Alboum’s further testimony that he asked Mr. German why defendant would be the one to “get rid” of the marijuana and that Mr. German replied: “Because she [(Ms. Mendez)] is the one that sells it.” Trooper Alboum stated that Mr. German said that defendant was “fully aware” that there was a large amount of marijuana in her car on the night of her arrest. Finally, Trooper Alboum testified that, when he asked Mr. German whether he had anything to add to his first statement, Mr. German stated: “It was not my weed. It was Elizabeth’s weed.” Trooper Alboum testified that Mr. German refused to sign anything at that point in time.', 'Finally, Trooper Alboum testified that, after Mr. German opted not to sign the first statement (the unsigned statement), Trooper Alboum prepared another statement (the signed statement) in which he asked Mr. German the same series of questions, and Mr. German replied with exactly the same answers, with one exception. Trooper Alboum explained that, as he finished preparing the signed statement, he again asked Mr. German whether he had anything to add, and Mr. German replied: “The marijuana was all mine, and I am taking the hit for it all.” Trooper Alboum stated that, after the just-quoted assertion by Mr. German as to the marijuana being “all his” was added, Mr. German signed the second statement.', '2. The Testimony of Officer Diego Mello', 'Officer Diego Mello of the East Providence Police Department also testified for the state. He testified that, on the day of defendant’s arrest, he was working as the Vice Unit sergeant in the North Main Street area of Providence and that he responded to a BOLO14 concerning a “blue Kia minivan” that had been reported as having been carjacked by “two Hispanic males with guns.” Officer Mello testified that he heard on the police radio that the carjacking occurred in the Hawkins Street area of Providence and that the minivan was last seen heading towards 14', 'Officer Mello testified that the acronym “BOLO” stands for “be on the lookout.” See also State v. Austin, No. 2013-77, 2015 WL 1954726 at *8 n. 4 (R.I. May 1, 2015).', '-8- Branch Avenue. He stated that he responded to that area and “[t]ried to figure out the fastest route out of Providence,” which, in his opinion, “would be the route that they [the carjackers] would have taken.” Officer Mello testified that he determined that the fastest route would be Charles Street, heading outbound towards North Providence; he stated that he proceeded to drive along that route, eventually discovering the blue Kia minivan parked in the Walgreens parking lot. It was his testimony that, after he located the minivan, he “contacted dispatch” with the vehicle’s description, and it was confirmed that the vehicle which he had discovered was the carjacked Kia minivan.', 'Officer Mello further testified that he stayed at the scene and continued to pay attention to the ambient activity; in particular, he said that he could observe the cars that were passing by and that he “looked in every one.” He indicated that it was a “sunny summer day” and that he could see the people inside the passing cars. He also testified that he was “able to see which way the drivers of those [passing] cars were looking[.]” Officer Mello added that there was a “heavy police presence” at the Walgreens parking lot; he specified that there were “about 12 police officers, [and] maybe a half dozen police cars [with] their lights on * * *.”', 'Officer Mello next testified that he observed a Nissan Maxima pass by the parking lot and that he could see its occupants. He noted that the passengers were Hispanic males, matching the description in the BOLO that he had heard earlier. It was Officer Mello’s testimony that the occupants of the Nissan Maxima acted in a way that “raised a major red flag” for him; he said that, as the Nissan Maxima approached the Walgreens parking lot, in which there was the above- described “heavy police presence,” the occupants “were just fixated straight ahead.” Officer Mello elaborated on this observation as follows:', '“Everyone else was looking in our direction wanting to see what', 'was going on, just like [when] you pass a car accident, everyone', '-9-', 'looks to see what’s going on. In this case every single person in', 'the [Nissan Maxima] was just fixated straight ahead. They acted', 'as though we weren’t even there.” Officer Mello proceeded to testify that he observed Trooper Alboum and Officer Reall depart to follow the Nissan Maxima, while he stayed at the scene and participated in a search of the Kia minivan.', '3. The Testimony of Officer Raymond Reall', 'Officer Raymond Reall of the North Providence Police Department also testified for the state. He stated that, on the night of defendant’s arrest, he heard a BOLO concerning a stolen vehicle taken at gunpoint; he added that this information brought him to the Charles Street area in North Providence, where he was joined by Trooper Alboum. Officer Reall further testified that the stolen vehicle was recovered in a Walgreens parking lot and that he was “dispatched” to that location. It was Officer Reall’s testimony that, once there, he and Trooper Alboum made “sure there was nobody inside of [the vehicle].” He testified that, as he waited with Trooper Alboum for the arrival of Providence law enforcement, he observed “[q]uite a few” more police officers come to the scene. He stated that “every single car that * * * stop[ped] at the red light [on Charles Street] looked over to see what was going on due to the fact [that] there [were] several police cars and people running around over there.” He further testified, however, that he noticed one car whose occupants did the opposite; specifically, he testified as follows:', '“There was a vehicle that was stopped at the red light on Charles', 'Street; and I noticed that there was a person sitting in the passenger', 'seat front [of the vehicle] with a white T-shirt, and there was also', 'a[] Hispanic male in the back with a white T-shirt; and that was the', 'description given from the BOLO from Providence. * * * [T]hey', 'would not look over at the parking lot where the police were.” Officer Reall next testified that, after making that observation, he entered his police cruiser and attempted to catch up to the just-referenced vehicle so that he could stop and question its', '- 10 - occupants. His testimony mirrored that of Trooper Alboum as he recounted the details of his pursuit of the Nissan Maxima and his eventual success at pulling the Nissan Maxima over into the breakdown lane of Route 146.', 'Officer Reall stated that, once the Nissan Maxima was on Route 146, it continued to travel “at a high rate of speed;” he added that he “went into the left lane * * * passed Trooper Alboum’s car, passed the [Nissan] Maxima, and got in front of the [Nissan] Maxima and slowed it down * * *.” He said that his cruiser and the Nissan Maxima “veered off into the breakdown lane,” eventually coming to a stop. Officer Reall testified that he and Trooper Alboum exited their cruisers to approach the Nissan Maxima.', 'It was Officer Reall’s testimony that he approached the Nissan Maxima on the passenger side and told the front-seat passenger and the other occupants of the car to “put their hands on the roof.” Officer Reall testified that he later learned that the name of the front-seat passenger was Osvaldo German.', 'Officer Reall proceeded to testify that he took “the passenger [(Mr. German)] out” of the Nissan Maxima and searched him. He stated that, upon searching Mr. German, he discovered marijuana in Mr. German’s front pocket.15 Officer Reall then testified that, following that discovery, he “released [Mr. German] to the custody of the Rhode Island State Police * * * [because] [t]hey ha[d] jurisdiction.” Officer Reall stated at trial that, after releasing Mr. German to the custody of the State Police, he helped the State Police search the Nissan Maxima. He testified that he searched the front passenger area, but did not find anything; he added, however, that he became aware of a “strong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle,” which odor he stated was that of “fresh” marijuana. Officer Reall further testified that, when the trunk of the 15', 'Subsequent testimony for the state by Paul Steven Iwuc, a forensic scientist with the Department of Health, indicated that the substance discovered in Officer Reall’s search of Mr. German was, in fact, marijuana.', '- 11 - Nissan Maxima was opened, the odor of marijuana “increased.” Officer Reall concluded his testimony on direct examination by stating that, although he was not present when the contents of the trunk were unloaded, he did observe marijuana inside the trunk as he assisted in the search of the Nissan Maxima.', '4. The Testimony of Osvaldo German', 'Mr. German, one of the co-defendants, also testified as a witness for the state. He stated that defendant is the mother of his son, who was about two years old at the time of trial. Mr. German further testified about the events that took place on the night of defendant’s arrest—July 26, 2010.', 'Specifically, Mr. German testified that, on that night, he was a passenger in defendant’s black Nissan Maxima; he said that they were traveling on Charles Street towards Route 146 and that, when the car reached the highway, he observed “cops behind [them] with the lights on.” It was Mr. German’s testimony that the Nissan Maxima eventually stopped on Route 146 because they were “getting pulled over.” Mr. German stated that law enforcement officers approached the Nissan Maxima “with their guns drawn telling [him and the other occupants of the car] to get out, put [their] hands up.” Mr. German further testified that the law enforcement officers “took [them] out of the car” and that he was searched—during which search “a small amount of weed” was discovered. It was Mr. German’s testimony that, after that discovery, law enforcement officers “put the cuffs” on him and then put him into a police car.', 'Mr. German proceeded to testify concerning what took place at the Rhode Island State Police barracks, where he was taken after his arrest. He stated that, on the night of July 26, “there [were] a whole bunch of cops there [at the barracks] that [were] asking me questions;” he added, however, that he “didn’t answer them.”', '- 12 -', 'Mr. German went on to testify that, on the morning of the next day, July 27, he was brought into a room and was asked “more questions.” In particular, when asked whether he recalled speaking with any police officers, Mr. German testified that he thought he remembered speaking to Trooper Alboum, whom he identified sitting at counsel table,16 as well as another police officer who had been in the courtroom earlier that day.', 'Mr. German next stated that he did not remember what he and the officer talked about, but he added that he did remember that the officer “was typing” during their discussion. However, Mr. German added that the officer “wasn’t typing what I was saying.” Mr. German also stated that the officer “was just asking questions.” When asked what the officer’s questions “dealt with,” Mr. German responded: “[F]irst they went from a van, then they went [to] the weed.” The prosecutor’s questions then turned to the details of “the weed,” asking Mr. German: “And the five kilograms of weed, what did the [officer] ask you about it?” In response to that question, Mr. German testified that, when the officer had asked him whether the weed was his, he responded in the affirmative. However, when the prosecutor asked whether claiming the weed as his own was what Mr. German had “first told” the officer, Mr. German testified that he did not know what he first told the officer.', 'At that point in his testimony, after stating that he was not sure what he “first told” the officer, Mr. German recounted his version of events with respect to the unsigned and signed statements. Specifically, Mr. German stated:', '“[W]hen I first talked to [the officer], he went and print out [sic] a', 'paper, and when he brung the paper back, it was not what I had 16', 'It will be recalled that Trooper Alboum testified that he interviewed Mr. German on July 27. In addition, Mr. German stated that he thought he remembered talking to Trooper Alboum. Accordingly, it can fairly be inferred that the “police officer” with whom Mr. German recalled conversing at the barracks was Trooper Alboum.', '- 13 -', 'told him. And I told him I take full responsibility for everything,', 'that the weed was all mine; and I didn’t talk to him after that.”17 Yet when asked by the prosecutor about the second statement (the signed statement), which contained the above-referenced assertion by Mr. German that “the weed was all [his],” Mr. German testified that he did not remember what he (Mr. German) was talking about at that time. In addition, when asked by the prosecutor: “[I]s that exactly what you said, ‘The weed’s all mine’?” Mr. German responded: “I don’t remember what I said.” Mr. German’s testimony continued in that vein, with Mr. German frequently answering “I don’t remember” to questions with respect to his discussion with the officer and with respect to the unsigned and signed statements.', 'Mr. German was then given the opportunity to review his signed statement, and he thereafter stated that he remembered “saying that the marijuana’s all [his] and [he’ll] take full responsibility for everything,” but that he “didn’t say [he’ll] take the hit for it all.” In Mr. German’s testimony, he characterized the difference between what he said and what was reflected in the signed statement as “the same issue with the other paper [the unsigned statement], why [he] didn’t sign; because [the officer] was typing, [Mr. German would] say one thing, [and the officer would] put another.”', 'With respect to the events of the night of defendant’s arrest, Mr. German testified that it was he who put the marijuana in the car and that, as far as he knew, defendant “didn’t know anything about it.” In addition, when engaged in a colloquy with the prosecutor concerning the details of his plea agreement, Mr. German indicated that he had believed at the time that he entered into the agreement that Ms. Mendez “was out of the indictment;” he said that he “would 17', 'It is readily apparent from Mr. German’s testimony that his reference to “the paper” is meant to refer to the unsigned statement; Trooper Alboum testified that it was the first document that he drafted during their discussion, which document Mr. German did not sign.', '- 14 - have signed [the plea agreement] as long as the charges [were] dropped against her.” The following exchange between the prosecutor and Mr. German is in the same vein:', '“Q', 'What was most important to you, you would have signed', 'anything as long as the defendant, her name wasn’t brought', 'into it?', '“A', 'Yes, cause she had nothing to do with it.” In sum, Mr. German’s testimony at trial indicated that he remembered very little about the conversations that resulted in the unsigned and signed statements and that the only thing he remembered was stating that he would take “full responsibility” for the marijuana.', 'B', 'The Defendant’s Case', 'Following the conclusion of the state’s case in chief, defense counsel moved, pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, for a judgment of acquittal, in light of what defense counsel characterized as the “inconsistent testimony” proffered by the state. The state objected to the motion, citing an array of evidence presented during the state’s case in chief that provided “ample evidence” of Ms. Mendez’s “possession,” including testimony regarding the odor of marijuana emanating from her car and the unsigned statement made by Mr. German that had been brought out during the testimony of Trooper Alboum. After hearing from both parties, the trial justice denied the motion for judgment of acquittal.', 'The defense then put on its case. Jennysa Ayala was the sole witness for the defense. It was her testimony that she was with defendant at an apartment at 99 Rugby Street in Providence “all day” on the day of defendant’s arrest. Ms. Ayala did testify, however, that defendant left the Rugby Street apartment that evening and did not return at all thereafter. She stated that, “a little bit before 8 o’clock at night,” defendant had been preparing a meal when she received a phone', '- 15 - call and then left the apartment, leaving her three-month-old son in Ms. Ayala’s care for the evening. Following Ms. Ayala’s testimony, the defense rested.', 'C', 'The Jury Instructions', 'On April 4, 2012, after closing arguments were delivered by both sides, the trial justice instructed the jury. Those instructions included the following language relative to the crime of possession of a controlled substance:', '“In order to prove that first element of the offense, the State', 'must show that the defendant possessed the controlled substance in', 'question. The law recognizes two different types of possession,', 'actual and constructive. A person has actual possession of', 'something if he or she has direct physical control over it with', 'knowledge of its nature. A person has constructive possession of', 'something if she or he does not have physical control over it but', 'knowingly has both the power and the intent at a given time to', 'exercise dominion and control over it either by himself, herself, or', 'through another person.', '“The mere presence near something or mere knowledge of', 'its location by itself is not enough to prove the possession of', 'something. The State must persuade you that the defendant knew', 'the nature of what she possessed; and in this regard the very', 'possession of an item may give rise to the inference that the person', 'who possesses the item knows the nature of what he or she', 'possesses. Although you are permitted to draw that inference,', 'you’re not required to do so. As always, you decide what weight', 'to assign the evidence that you’ve already heard and seen, and', 'what inferences, if any, that you choose to draw from the evidence.', '“* * *', '“To establish the second element of this offense, the State', 'must show that the possession was knowing and intentional. The', 'person acts knowingly when he or she acts deliberately and', 'purposefully, and not because of a mistake, accident, or any other', 'innocent reason. In order to determine whether knowledge has', 'been established, you may consider, among other things, where the', 'defendant was in relation to where the drugs were found; and the', 'amount of drugs that were found.”', '- 16 - Defense counsel raised no objection to the portion of the instructions quoted above nor to any other aspect of the jury instructions given during that initial charge to the jury.', 'After having been instructed, the jury deliberated for approximately two hours and then submitted the following question to the court: “‘Is the operator of a motor vehicle responsible and/or accountable for all of the contents of that vehicle?’”18', 'Before answering the jury question, the trial justice met with counsel and proposed the following supplemental instruction:', '“‘You need to consider the Court’s instructions, find the facts,', 'accord to those the weight you deem appropriate, apply the law to', 'those facts set forth in the instructions.’” Defense counsel objected to the proposed supplemental instruction, arguing that the trial justice should read to the jury only the first seven words thereof, without going any further—such that the instruction would read as follows: “You need to consider the Court’s instructions.” The trial justice considered defense counsel’s objection, but ultimately rejected it; and he proceeded to give the supplemental instruction as he had originally proposed. The jury then returned to its deliberations.', 'The next morning, April 5, before the jury reconvened, defense counsel requested that the trial justice give an alternative instruction in response to the jury’s question; counsel contended that his newly minted alternative instruction was preferable to the supplemental instruction that had been given by the trial justice the previous day. Specifically, defense counsel requested that the jury be instructed as follows:', '“‘The State may not rely upon a defendant’s ownership and control', 'of a vehicle to prove that the defendant knew that she possessed', 'marijuana. While these are factors you may consider, the State', 'must prove that there is other evidence indicating the defendant’s', 'guilty knowledge of marijuana hidden in the vehicle.’” 18', 'The quoted question was the second that the jury posed to the trial justice. The first question asked by the jury during its deliberations is not at issue in the instant appeal.', '- 17 - The state objected, pointing to the fact that defense counsel had previously had the opportunity to review the court’s jury instructions and the fact that the supplemental instruction simply referred back to the original jury instructions, which were not objected to. The trial justice declined defense counsel’s alternative instruction, and the jury continued its deliberations.', 'D', 'The Verdict and Sentencing', 'Later on April 5, the same day that defense counsel had requested that the trial justice give the alternative instruction, the jury returned its verdict. The defendant was found guilty on the possession of marijuana charge (Count 1) and not guilty on the charges of conspiracy to possess marijuana (Count 2) and possession of MDMA (Count 4). Subsequently, the trial justice sentenced Ms. Mendez to twenty years of imprisonment, with five years to serve and fifteen years suspended with probation.', 'E', 'The Motion for a New Trial', 'On April 13, 2012, defendant moved for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. In her written submission to the trial court, she contended as follows:', '“1. Defendant was denied a fair and impartial trial because the', 'Court erred in charging the jury and in refusing to charge the', 'jury as requested.', '“2. This Court erred in denying the defense motion for a directed', 'verdict of acquittal and the conviction is based on insufficient', 'evidence of guilt in violation of defendant’s due process', 'rights;', '“3. The verdict is contrary to law; and/or', '“4. The verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence and fails', 'to do substantial justice.”', '- 18 -', 'At the hearing on the motion, defense counsel focused on the supplemental instruction that the trial justice gave in response to the jury’s question, stating that the motion for a new trial was brought “first and foremost * * * over the concern with regard to the jury instruction.” Defense counsel contended, inter alia, that the jury “may have been somewhat confused” with respect to the supplemental instruction given in response to the question concerning possession. Counsel pointed to the fact that the jury convicted defendant of possessing over five kilograms of marijuana while acquitting her of conspiracy to commit the same crime. He argued that, if the jury believed the evidence that was consistent with finding defendant guilty of the underlying crime of possession, it would not have been possible for the jury to simultaneously acquit her of conspiracy to commit that crime. Defense counsel contended that the court’s supplemental instruction caused the jury to think that “as long as drugs were in [defendant’s] car or found in that car, that’s it,” meaning that the jury would be required to find defendant guilty of the possession charge in spite of their findings with respect to the conspiracy charge. In addition, defendant argued that this Court’s decision in State v. Berroa, 6 A.3d 1095 (R.I. 2010), was authority for the proposition that the alternative instruction proposed by defendant was in fact the correct statement of the law as it related to possession (and presumably would have dispelled the jury’s confusion). In the end, however, the trial justice denied the motion for a new trial. We shall in due course describe more fully the reasoning which underlay that denial.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in failing to provide the alternative instruction, which defendant contends would have been the “correct” supplemental instruction (as opposed to the supplemental instruction that was actually given); (2) that the trial', '- 19 - justice erred in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial; and (3) that defendant’s twenty-year sentence is violative of Article 1, Section 8 of the Rhode Island Constitution. We shall address those arguments in the same order, referencing the applicable standard of review where necessary.', 'A', 'The Supplemental Jury Instruction', 'The defendant first argues on appeal that the trial justice erred in declining to give the alternative instruction that defendant proposed on the morning of April 5. The state responds that the trial justice did not err in this regard because a jury is presumed to understand instructions as given; the state further contends that, in view of the fact that the jury did not seek further clarification after having heard the trial justice’s supplemental instruction, the jury should be presumed to have understood. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that defendant has waived any argument which she may have had relative to the trial justice’s declining to give the alternative instruction because that argument was not raised in a timely manner before the trial justice.19 19', 'While defense counsel did lodge an objection to the trial justice’s proposed supplemental instruction on April 4 (the day on which the trial justice gave the supplemental instruction), he did so on grounds that are utterly different from those reflected in the alternative instruction that, on the following day, he argued was appropriate.', 'The transcript reveals that, on April 4, after the trial justice shared with counsel his proposed supplemental instruction in response to the jury question, defense counsel lodged an objection to “anything beyond” the first seven words of the instruction (i.e., anything beyond this directive to the jury: “‘You need to consider the Court’s instructions.’”) When the trial justice asked what defense counsel found “prejudicial” in the remaining portion of the trial justice’s proposed supplemental instruction, defense counsel responded as follows:', '“What I think is prejudicial, your Honor, is that they might forget', 'to consider the elements of the charges with that specific', 'instruction. If they just find the facts, associate some type of', 'weight with them, and then apply the law, I know that they’re', '- 20 -', 'We have long abided by the principle that we may not “consider[] at the appellate level issues not properly presented before the trial court.” State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 236 (R.I. 2008); see also State v. Clements, 83 A.3d 553, 564 (R.I. 2014); State v. Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 113 (R.I. 2005). That principle, commonly referred to as the raise or waive rule,20 is a “well-', 'suppose[d] to apply the elements, but without that specifically', 'being instructed to them, I think that a step in that process, so to', 'speak, may not take place and they may forget to actually -- the', 'specific elements have to be analyzed as well.” The trial justice proceeded to give a thoughtful and considered response to defense counsel’s concern, and further cited his own concern that referencing the elements specifically may result in “cut[ting] out a great deal of the 26 pages of text” that comprised the jury instructions. The trial justice referred back to his earlier admonishment to the jury during his initial instructions: that the jurors ought to “consider the instructions in their entirety” and not to single out any one instruction. Following the above statements, the trial justice added that he would send “an additional six copies” of the jury instructions up to the jury deliberation room, in addition to the six copies which had been previously sent up to the jury.', 'We recount the above exchange between defense counsel and the trial justice to illustrate that defense counsel’s objection was clearly on different grounds from those raised before this Court in the instant appeal.', 'Furthermore, to the extent that defendant argues before us that her April 4 objection on the above-referenced grounds—namely, that the trial justice erroneously gave the entire supplemental instruction, rather than just the seven words thereof as requested by defendant in her initial objection—we deem that argument to be waived. See Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n. 1 (R.I. 2002). Although defendant alludes to the issue in her briefing before this Court, she makes no meaningful argument with respect to whether the trial justice erred in giving the entire supplemental instruction; instead, she limits herself to advocating for the alternative instruction, which she proposed on the morning of April 5. Our precedent requires more than an allusion to an issue for it to become the proper subject of appellate review. See id. (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”); see also Hines Road, LLC v. Hall, 113 A.3d 924, 931 n. 6 (R.I. 2015); State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n. 19 (R.I. 2007).', 'Finally, we note that we consider the alternative instruction later proposed by defendant to act as a further objection to the supplemental instruction, see Perry v. Alessi, 890 A.2d 463, 470 (R.I. 2006) (“He then objected to the trial justice’s failure to give eleven of his proposed instructions * * *.”); Butera v. Boucher, 798 A.2d 340, 348 (R.I. 2002), and it is this latter objection that we address more fully in our analysis of defendant’s arguments on appeal. 20', 'Our cases have recognized a narrow exception to this Court’s raise or waive rule. For that exception to be applicable, however, “the alleged error must be more than harmless, and the', '- 21 - established maxim,” Thornley v. Community College of Rhode Island, 107 A.3d 296, 302 (R.I. 2014), and it “imposes upon litigants a duty to raise all their claims for relief in the trial court and properly articulate them to a judge for a ruling.” D’Alessio v. State, 101 A.3d 1270, 1278 (R.I. 2014) (emphasis added).', 'With respect to objections to jury instructions in particular, this Court has “consistently been exacting about applying the raise or waive rule.” Ferris Avenue Realty, LLC v. Huhtamaki, Inc., 110 A.3d 267, 285 (R.I. 2015); see also King v. Huntress, Inc., 94 A.3d 467, 483 (R.I. 2014) (describing this Court as being “especially rigorous in the application of the [raise or waive] rule when considering objections to jury instructions”) (internal quotation marks omitted); State v. Crow, 871 A.2d 930, 935 (R.I. 2005) (“[I]f an objection to a jury instruction is not effectively raised below, it is waived on appeal.”).', 'In addition, our law is demanding as to when an objection to a jury instruction should be made: pursuant to Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “[n]o party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the party’s objection.” (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we have emphasized that “[c]ounsel’s objection to the jury instruction must be made before the jury retires because once alerted to the perceived error in the instruction that has been given, the trial justice has an opportunity to cure the alleged deficiencies before the jury retires for exception must implicate an issue of constitutional dimension derived from a novel rule of law that could not reasonably have been known to counsel at the time of trial.” State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50, 57 (R.I. 2001); see also State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 n. 7 (R.I. 2011); State v. Texter, 896 A.2d 40, 43 (R.I. 2006); see generally Pollard v. Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429, 432, 433 (R.I. 2005). To the extent that defendant seeks an appeal on such constitutional grounds, we perceive absolutely no basis for concluding that this narrow exception could properly be invoked in this case.', '- 22 - deliberations.” State v. Viveiros, 45 A.3d 1232, 1243-44 (R.I. 2012) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758, 766 (R.I. 2009); cf. DiFranco v. Klein, 657 A.2d 145, 147 (R.I. 1995) (discussing parallel rule of civil procedure and describing the rationale for the rule as “allow[ing] the trial justice an opportunity to make any necessary corrections to his or her instructions before the jury begins its deliberations”) (emphasis added). We note that the foregoing principles are equally applicable in the context of a trial justice giving a jury a supplemental instruction as distinguished from the initial charge to the jury. See, e.g., State v. Vega, 789 A.2d 896, 898 (R.I. 2002) (“After giving both of these supplemental instructions, the trial justice asked the attorneys whether they had any objections to these charges. Both counsel replied in the negative and they also failed to suggest any different or supplemental instructions. * * * [B]y failing to object at trial to the above-referenced instructions, [the] defendant has failed to preserve any alleged inadequacies or errors relating to these supplemental instructions and he is precluded from raising such arguments for the first time on appeal.”). We now turn to the instances in which defendant claims that she has properly preserved her objections.', 'The defendant first asserts that the alternative instruction was correct and that the jury deserved to have it presented to them; in addition, she contends that it “was preserved for direct appeal by [defense] counsel’s timely objection,” in the form of the alternative instruction. Specifically, defendant contends that defense counsel “objected and requested the correct jury instruction shortly after the trial justice answered [the jury question].”', '(Emphasis added.) However, the record clearly reveals that contention to be entirely without any foundation in fact. First, and significantly, defense counsel did not contemporaneously object to the supplemental instruction on the grounds that are now presented in his brief to this Court—namely, in the form', '- 23 - of the alternative instruction. In our view, it is inaccurate for defendant to claim that his proposed alternative instruction was brought to the trial justice’s attention “shortly” after the trial justice gave his own supplemental instruction in response to the jury question. Significantly, after the trial justice gave his supplemental instruction, the jury resumed its deliberations; and it was only the next morning that counsel requested the alternative instruction. We note that our precedent emphasizes that “it is imperative that a focused objection specific enough to alert the trial justice as to the nature of [the trial justice’s] alleged error in giving any jury instruction * * * must be made on the record after the jury is instructed and before it retires to deliberate.” Berman v. Sitrin, 101 A.3d 1251, 1266 (R.I. 2014) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). In view of that clear precedent, and in light of the amount of time that elapsed between the trial justice’s supplemental instruction and defense counsel’s alternative instruction, we are not persuaded that defendant’s objection was timely.', 'The defendant argues that our opinion in State v. Fetzik, 577 A.2d 990 (R.I. 1990), supports her contention that her objection (which came in the form of an alternative instruction) which was articulated on the day after the trial justice gave his supplemental instruction was sufficient to preserve the issue for appellate review. However, we are not persuaded by that argument. In Fetzik, 577 A.2d at 992-93, the defendant proposed an instruction with respect to the defendant’s physical condition at the time of the crime to the trial justice before the trial justice charged the jury, albeit after the close of evidence. Pursuant to Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “when a defendant relies upon an affirmative defense or justification or a matter in mitigation he or she must advise the court no later than the close of evidence.” Fetzik, 577 A.2d at 992 (emphasis added). However, we stated in Fetzik that, “[a]lthough the instruction was technically late, the trial justice appears to have had an adequate', '- 24 - opportunity to consider this instruction” regarding the defendant’s physical condition, especially in light of extensive testimony documenting said condition, and that “[t]he requested instruction was one that could easily have been included with those that were given.” Id. at 993. Those circumstances are clearly distinguishable from those at issue in the instant case. Here, the trial justice had no opportunity to consider the substance of defense counsel’s alternative instruction because the proposal did not arrive until the next morning, after the supplemental instruction had been given and the jury had resumed deliberations. For similar reasons, defendant’s alternative instruction could not have easily been included with the supplemental instruction. Simply put, in the instant case, the objection (in the form of the alternative instruction) was not timely, and our opinion in Fetzik does not support the contention that the issue was somehow preserved.', 'The defendant argues that, even if the argument relative to the proposed alternative instruction was not preserved during the actual trial, it has been “preserved for direct appeal as it was included in the Rule 33 New Trial Motion and ruled on by the Trial Court on the merits.” But that argument flies in the face of our precedent. In State v. Flori, 963 A.2d 932, 938 (R.I. 2009), we specifically stated: “Although * * * [R]ule [33] allows the court to grant a new trial if required in the interest of justice, it does not circumvent or override contemporaneous objection rules, such as Rule 30.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) We see no reason to deviate from that principle in the instant case; defendant did not timely object because she did not timely provide her alternative instruction, and her failure to do so was not cured by her decision to raise the issue in her motion for a new trial.', 'Third, defendant claims that the issue is “properly before the Court as the State failed to object to the timing of counsel’s objection.” We are not persuaded by this argument. The state did not need to present an objection to defendant’s untimely proposal for an alternative', '- 25 - instruction where the trial justice explicitly ruled against giving that instruction; defendant’s argument in this regard is meritless, and we summarily reject it.', 'Finally, we note that a trial is one-directional in nature; it moves forward from beginning to end. And essential to the trial process is the requirement that objections be made at the time when an event occurs that counsel deems objectionable. See Rule 51 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure (“Formal exceptions to rulings or orders of the court are unnecessary; but for all purposes for which an exception has heretofore been necessary it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes known to the court the action which the party desires the court to take or his or her objection to the action of the court * * *.”) (emphasis added); see also In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273, 1280 (R.I. 2011) (“An issue is properly preserved—and, as a result, may be raised before this Court on appeal—if the litigant’s objection was both ‘timely and appropriate.’”) (emphasis added) (quoting State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010)); see generally Thomas v. Ross, 477 A.2d 950, 953 (R.I. 1984) (“Trial on an installment-plan basis cannot be countenanced * * *.”). In addition, it is required that the objecting party not only voice the objection contemporaneously with the perceived error, but it is further required that all grounds for the objection be brought to the attention of the presiding judicial officer at that time. See State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1007 (R.I. 2005); see also State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 (R.I. 2011). In the instant case, as soon as the question posed by the jury had been addressed by the trial justice, the jury continued deliberating. For the court on the next morning to have given a further supplemental instruction might well have unduly been perceived by the jurors as a sort of red flag, causing them to infer that the trial justice was imparting some sort of cryptic message.', '- 26 -', 'Accordingly, we hold that defendant has failed to preserve her objection to the supplemental jury instruction.', 'B', 'The Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant next argues on appeal that the trial justice erred when he denied her motion for a new trial. She contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in crediting Mr. German’s unsigned statement, which was testified to by Trooper Alboum; and (2) that her conviction was based on insufficient evidence. Specifically, she claims that the jury did not find Mr. German’s unsigned statement to the police to be credible—whereas, if the jury found the statement to be credible, it could infer that defendant knowingly possessed the marijuana. Indeed, she argues that the unsigned statement was so undermined by Mr. German’s criminal record, his purported connection to the carjacking earlier that day, and his subsequent contradictory statements, that no jury could have found that the unsigned statement was worthy of credence. In addition, she claims that it was not reasonable to conclude that she could have smelled the fresh marijuana in the trunk in view of the evidence that Mr. German, sitting in the front passenger’s seat, “reeked” of burnt marijuana. Therefore, she argues it could not be properly inferred that defendant knew that there was marijuana in the trunk. We hold, for the reasons set forth below, that the trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Preliminarily, we note that defendant’s appeal utilizes the language of both a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence and a motion for a new trial based on the sufficiency of the evidence. As we have explained in State v. Perkins, 460 A.2d 1245, 1247 (R.I. 1983), the two motions are different, and each requires its own distinct legal analysis. See also State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235 (R.I. 2011); State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569-71 (R.I.', '- 27 - 2009). It is not entirely clear to this Court whether defendant intends to argue both bases for the motion. However, to the extent that she in fact seeks to raise both, we shall address each basis.', 'When a defendant moves for a new trial based on both the weight of the evidence and the sufficiency of the evidence, it is the practice of this Court to first address the motion based on the weight of the evidence. See State v. Robat, 49 A.3d 58, 72 (R.I. 2012) (stating that this Court reviews a motion for a new trial before reviewing a motion for a judgment of acquittal); State v. Richardson, 47 A.3d 305, 317 (R.I. 2012); see also Clark, 974 A.2d at 570 (“The difference in nomenclature of a motion for a new trial based on the insufficiency of the evidence and a motion for judgment of acquittal does not mean that courts must review these motions differently.”). We proceed in that manner because a defendant seeking to prevail on a motion for a new trial based on the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavier burden than does a defendant seeking to prevail on a weight of the evidence argument; unless a defendant can demonstrate that the evidence failed to support his or her conviction based on the weight of the evidence standard, he or she will necessarily be unable to establish entitlement to a new trial based on insufficient evidence. See Robat, 49 A.3d at 72.', 'When a trial justice considers whether a verdict is against the weight of the evidence, he or she “acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Barrios, 88 A.3d 1123, 1128 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Austin, No. 2013-77-C.A., 2015 WL 1954726, at *6 (R.I. May 1, 2015); Robat, 49 A.3d at 70. In carrying out his or her role as the “thirteenth juror,” it is incumbent upon the trial justice to “(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from', '- 28 - that reached by the jury.” State v. Silva, 84 A.3d 411, 416 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 30 (R.I. 2013). If, after carrying out that just- described analytical process, “the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or determines that reasonable minds could differ, then the analysis is complete and the verdict should be affirmed.” State v.

Our case law is clear that “we will not disturb a trial justice’s decision with respect to a motion for a new trial unless we determine that the trial justice committed clear error or that he or she overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case.” Hie, 93 A.3d at 975 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Robat, 49 A.3d at 71.

First, he considered the evidence in light of the jury charge regarding constructive possession of marijuana; he expressly noted that it was clear from his jury instruction that, “in order to find the defendant guilty * * * the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the [marijuana], * * * and did so knowingly and intentionally.” While the trial justice did not refer to every single piece of evidence, he focused on all of the evidence relevant to the issue of defendant’s knowledge. See Robat, 49 A.3d at 71. That evidence consisted of the testimony of Mr. German and Trooper Alboum, and Mr. German’s unsigned and signed police statements.', 'Proceeding to the second step of the analytical process, the trial justice independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and weighed the relevant evidence. He began this second step of the process by focusing on Mr. German’s credibility, noting that Mr. German was a “hostile” and “evasive” witness who sought to “undermine whatever he had put in writing at an earlier time.” Nonetheless, the trial justice independently concluded that there was “some credibility” to Mr. German’s unsigned statement, which indicated that the marijuana belonged to Ms. Mendez. In contrast, he stated on the record that he “specifically * * * disbelieve[d]” those portions of Mr. German’s signed statement in which he indicated that the marijuana was all his and that he would be “‘taking the hit for it.’”', '- 30 -', 'The trial justice then carried out the remainder of the second analytical step by identifying several specific facts weighing in favor of the jury’s verdict. Those facts included: (1) the “strong” smell and sheer “bulk” of the marijuana bales that the state introduced as evidence; (2) Trooper Alboum’s testimony that Ms. Mendez did not look at the large police presence surrounding the carjacked van; and (3) Trooper Alboum’s testimony regarding the efforts of Ms. Mendez to avoid being pulled over. With regard to the smell and size of the marijuana (the marijuana having been admitted as a full exhibit at trial), the trial justice noted:', '“The State’s attorney flung the marijuana around on the witness', 'stand and the boxes in front of the Court. The Court noticed it.', 'The jury noticed it. * * * This is not the same as a small package', 'of controlled substances that can be secreted in a foot locker or', '* * * under a spare tire, in a jacket, or even in a bag.” The trial justice concluded that those facts, coupled with Mr. German’s “statements [that] all allowed for a reasonable inference that [defendant] knew about the marijuana or knew that there was marijuana in the back of her car,” clearly supported the jury’s verdict.', 'Third and finally, the trial justice concluded the three-step analytical process by explicitly stating that he agreed with the jury’s verdict. In light of the trial justice’s proper execution of the three-step analysis and his agreement with the jury verdict, he was not required to do anything further. See Hie, 93 A.3d at 977.', 'The trial justice properly undertook the required steps to rule upon a motion for a new trial, but we pause to note that, in the course of making his ruling, the trial justice distinguished the instant case from two cases that defendant relied upon heavily in both her briefing and argument on the motion below and before this Court. The two cases are State v. Berroa, 6 A.3d 1095 (R.I. 2010), and United States v. Chadwick, 393 F. Supp. 763 (D. Mass. 1975), aff’d, 532 F.2d 773, 785 (1st Cir. 1976), aff’d, 433 U.S. 1, 16 (1977). The defendant cited those opinions', '- 31 - in support of her argument that the jury could not properly infer her knowledge of the marijuana because the evidence relied upon by the state to indicate that she had such knowledge was subject to equally plausible, noncriminal explanations. In the first case, Berroa, 6 A.3d at 1099, a defendant was found driving a car in which two passengers had concealed cocaine inside their purses. The defendant in that case then allegedly showed signs of nervousness while police investigated the car. Id. We vacated the judgment of conviction because the evidence “simply [was] not sufficient to affirm the conviction,” even though the facts could have led to “speculation or conjecture” regarding the defendant’s involvement with a sophisticated drug- trafficking scheme. Id. at 1102, 1104.', 'In the second case, Chadwick, 393 F. Supp. at 766, 768, a defendant was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking because he was found in the presence of two people who possessed a footlocker containing marijuana.', 'The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts determined that the police did not have probable cause to arrest the defendant because “a non-criminal explanation * * * [was] at least as likely as one indicating that an offense [had] been or [was] being committed.” Id. at 768 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In the instant case, defendant argues that, similar to the facts in Berroa and Chadwick, the “facts and circumstances” of her case, taken together, are “consistent with a reasonable hypothesis that she is innocent”—i.e., that the facts and circumstances are consistent with ignorance of, rather than knowledge of, the presence of marijuana in her car. However, in ruling on the motion, the trial justice pointed to specific facts indicating otherwise, such as Mr. German’s unsigned statement implicating defendant’s knowledge of the marijuana, the strong smell and sheer bulk of the marijuana in the car operated by defendant, Trooper Alboum’s testimony that defendant did not look at the police presence surrounding the carjacked van, and', '- 32 - Trooper Alboum’s additional testimony that defendant attempted to avoid being pulled over. The trial justice then stated: “I am sure that lightning didn’t strike twelve times in the same place on that day when this case occurred. Any one of [the facts] by themselves might have been insignificant, but it would appear that there were a number of places here where the inferences can be drawn in light of the instructions I told the jury.” Furthermore, in her briefing to this Court, defendant concedes that only “[o]nce the incredulous [sic] statements of Osvaldo German and smell issues are set aside” would her case be “on point” with Berroa and Chadwick. As we have already discussed, the trial justice concluded that Mr. German’s incriminating original unsigned statement and the smell of the marijuana were both highly relevant to the determination of defendant’s guilt in this case.', 'We see no reason to disturb the trial justice’s findings. He considered all of the relevant evidence as he applied the three-step analytical process and he articulated sufficient reasoning to support his decision to deny the motion.', 'In light of the fact that defendant could not successfully prevail on her motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, we need not address her challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. See Richardson, 47 A.3d at 317; Clark, 974 A.2d at 570. Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'C', 'The Sentence', 'The defendant’s final argument on appeal is that her twenty-year prison sentence is “manifestly excessive” and “violates the constitutional requirement that ‘all punishments ought to be proportioned to the offense.’” See R.I. Const. art. 1, sec. 8. We have consistently and repeatedly held that “review of a sentence must begin in the Superior Court pursuant to Rule 35', '- 33 - of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.” State v.

The trial justice sentenced the defendant to forty-five years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with eighteen years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation. The defendant timely appealed. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of conviction and remand the case to the Superior Court for a new trial.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In August 2015, the complainant, Veronica,1 was seven years old. Her parents, Antonio Pina (Pina) and Kathryn Johnson (Kathryn), who never married, lived separately. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Veronica stayed with her father, who lived across the street from defendant and his common-law wife, Denise Jones (Jones). 1', 'We refer to the complainant in this case by a pseudonym. Additionally, because the complainant’s mother and grandmother share the same last name, we will refer to them by their first names; we intend no disrespect by doing so.', '-1-', 'The testimony at trial revealed that Pina and defendant were friends and shared a common interest in automobiles. Veronica testified that she also thought of defendant as her friend, and that defendant would hug her every time he saw her. Pina stated that Veronica would often walk across the street to defendant’s house, and, whenever Veronica saw defendant or Jones, “she would run over to them” and “give them a hug and a kiss on the cheek, just being friendly.”', 'On August 4, 2015, Veronica and her father were playing in Pina’s front yard when Jones stopped and gave Veronica a flower. Veronica and Pina then walked across the street to talk to defendant, who was standing in his yard. Veronica hugged defendant. The defendant then sat on a pile of shingles, and Veronica sat on his lap. According to Veronica, she sat on defendant’s left leg with her legs inside defendant’s legs and defendant’s left hand against her back. When her father went to look at defendant’s Chevrolet El Camino, which was parked in his driveway, out of defendant’s sight, defendant put his right hand under Veronica’s skirt and touched her vagina, over her underwear. Veronica testified that defendant “tapped” her vagina and then she felt his finger go inside of her. Veronica testified that she was scared and uncomfortable, and she devised an excuse to get off defendant’s lap. According to Veronica, defendant smiled at her but said nothing.', 'Veronica did not immediately tell Pina about the assault because she thought he would be upset. Later that evening, Veronica told her grandmother, Helene Johnson (Helene), about the incident because it was easier to talk to her grandmother and Veronica did not think that the disclosure would upset her.', 'Helene called Kathryn at work and told her what happened. Kathryn left work and went to Helene’s house to talk to Veronica—who, according to Kathryn, appeared scared and confused. Kathryn did not have an exhaustive discussion with Veronica at', '-2- that time, because she was frightened and uncertain about what to say to her daughter. Kathryn did not report the assault to the police. She called Pina, but when she began to explain what happened, he “flipped out on [her,]” and she was unable to tell him everything that Veronica had revealed to her.', 'The next day, Veronica went to Pina’s house and told him about the assault. Pina did not call the police, however, “[b]ecause the way I asked [Veronica], she agreed with the way I asked her and to me I took it as it was a mistake. It was an accident.” Veronica testified that initially she thought the touching could be an accident, but after meeting with her counselor, she realized that it was not accidental.', 'In September 2015, about a month after the assault, Pina witnessed a raid at defendant’s house by multiple state troopers; he later learned on social media that it was a police investigation into defendant for possession of child pornography. Pina called Kathryn and told her about the raid, and that prompted her to report the assault to the Warwick police.', 'On November 17, 2015, a grand jury indicted defendant for one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-8.1. The defendant was convicted following a jury trial in October 2016. On January 20, 2017, the trial justice sentenced defendant to forty-five years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with eighteen years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation. The defendant filed a timely appeal.', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Before this Court, defendant advances four assignments of error. The defendant argues that the trial justice erred: (1) in denying defendant’s motion for a mistrial based on a police officer’s reference during his testimony to a polygraph examination; (2) in denying defendant’s motion for a mistrial based on the prosecutor’s comments during closing argument about', '-3- defendant’s courtroom demeanor at trial; (3) in admitting testimony about the arrest and prosecution of defendant for possession of child pornography; and (4) in failing to safeguard defendant’s right to a fair trial based on various claims related to the presence of members of a motorcycle group known as “Bikers Against Child Abuse” (BACA) in the courtroom during trial. We address each contention in turn, and we will provide additional facts and procedural history as necessary.', 'Motions to Pass the Case', 'Standard of Review', '“When ruling on a motion to pass, the trial justice must assess the prejudicial impact of the statement in question on the jury and determine whether the evidence was of such a nature as to cause the jurors to become so inflamed that their attention was distracted from the issues submitted to them.” State v. Lastarza, 203 A.3d 1159, 1165 (R.I. 2019) (quoting State v.

Moreira, 126 A.3d 447, 449 (R.I. 2015)).', '“[A] trial justice’s decision on a motion to pass the case is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not disturb the ruling on such a motion absent an abuse of discretion.” Lastarza, 203 A.3d at 1165 (quoting State v. Rosado, 139 A.3d 419, 423 (R.I. 2016)). “We give great deference to the trial justice in this regard because he or she has a front-row seat at the trial and is in the best position to determine whether a defendant has been unfairly prejudiced.” Id. (quoting Rosado, 139 A.3d at 423).', '-4-', 'Reference to the Polygraph Examination', 'Before the facts of this case were known to the Warwick police, defendant was interviewed by the police on two occasions concerning the child pornography investigation. During the second interview at the state police barracks, defendant underwent a polygraph examination. The circumstances of the police interviews and an inadvertent reference to the polygraph examination by a witness at trial are issues in this case.', 'Before trial, defendant filed a motion in limine to preclude evidence of the polygraph examination at trial. During a hearing on that motion, the court recognized that the state had “agreed on the record to * * * redacting out anything that makes reference to a polygraph examination.”', 'Indeed, the prosecutor stated: “The state does not intend to introduce any evidence related to the polygraph. I have no issue redacting anything * * * relating to a polygraph or any mention thereof[.]” At trial, however, Detective Kevin Petit, the police officer who had administered the polygraph examination to defendant, referenced the polygraph while testifying on cross-examination. Detective Petit testified that he initially interviewed defendant at his home, and then conducted a follow-up interview at the state police barracks. Defense counsel then asked Det. Petit how long the follow-up interview lasted, and the following colloquy ensued:', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Do you know how long that interview', 'took place?', '“[DETECTIVE PETIT]: A couple of [sic] three hours I believe. In', 'the interim there was a polygraph exam given so I didn’t have—', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.', '“THE COURT: Sustained. The jury will disregard.” Defense counsel requested a sidebar and immediately moved to pass the case, arguing that the polygraph reference warranted a mistrial, and that a curative instruction would not be sufficient to cure the prejudice caused by its reference. The state argued that a curative instruction would', '-5- be sufficient because Det. Petit did not reveal the results of the polygraph examination, but only that one had been administered to defendant.', 'The trial justice declined to grant a mistrial, stating:', '“Counsel, the [c]ourt is going to decline your motion to pass. You', 'have preserved the record at this point. The [c]ourt will at some', 'point give a curative instruction and has instructed the jury to', 'disregard the answer.” The defendant did not object to the failure to give an immediate cautionary instruction, nor did he proffer any suggestions about the substance of the instruction. After the cross-examination, redirect, and recross of Det. Petit concluded, the trial justice gave the following curative instruction to the jury:', '“[A]t the very beginning of the trial I told you that when the', '[c]ourt has an objection and will overrule or sustain it. When I', 'overrule an objection, it’s very easy. You can consider the answer', 'as evidence. If I sustain an objection to a question that was not', 'answered, you’re never hearing the answer so there is no evidence', 'to consider, and, as I told you, you can’t read into the question', 'itself. There have been times during this witness’ testimony and', 'others where the witness said something, there was an objection', 'afterwards and I sustained the objection. I want to remind the jury', 'again, as I did initially, you cannot consider either the question or', 'the answer given by the witness. It cannot have any weight or any', 'evidentiary value one way or another. You can’t make any', 'inferences as to what you heard. You must and this jury must', 'completely disregard any answer to a question that was sustained', 'by the [c]ourt even if an answer was given, and you heard that', 'numerous times over the course of the testimony.” The defendant did not object to the timing or adequacy of the instruction or otherwise ask the court to provide additional language.', 'Because we are vacating the judgment of conviction on other grounds, we decline to reach these questions regarding the polygraph reference.', '-6-', 'The Prosecutor’s Closing Argument', 'During closing argument, the prosecutor stated:', '“This man, Henry Bozzo, molested that young girl. It wasn’t a', 'mistake. He did it intentionally. He stared at her as she was', 'walking out of the courtroom. He stared her down. I saw it. It', 'was right there. That is no mistake there.” (Emphasis added.) The defendant immediately objected. The trial justice reserved ruling on the objection. The prosecutor continued: “You know there is no mistake there. He knew what he was doing.” After the prosecutor concluded his closing argument, the trial justice called for a sidebar, and defendant moved to pass the case, arguing that the prosecutor was “basically testifying[,]” and making an “absolutely a hundred percent improper argument.” The defendant contended that the prosecutor improperly referred to that which he had personally observed, rather than to facts that were in the trial record. The defendant also argued that the prejudice caused by the statements was so significant that it could not be cured by an instruction. The state responded that the prosecutor’s remarks stemmed from defendant’s conduct and demeanor when Veronica left the stand—all of which occurred in the presence of the jury. The state further argued that, even if the remarks were inappropriate: “It’s only argument. I think the [c]ourt can instruct on that. I think a curative instruction would be fine. The [c]ourt is going to give an instruction that it’s only an argument. It’s not to be considered as evidence.”', 'The trial justice made the following ruling:', '“First of all, the [c]ourt finds that it was improper. The jury is', 'instructed from the beginning they can only consider answers to', 'questions from the witness stand and the exhibits. They cannot', 'consider anything else. Clearly, the prosecutor bringing up what', 'he observed or his observations is improper. The [c]ourt declines', 'to grant a mistrial. The [c]ourt will give a curative instruction to', 'the jury. The jury is aware closing arguments are not evidence.', 'The [c]ourt will instruct the jury to disregard. The [c]ourt', 'disagrees with defense counsel there is no other way to cure this.', '-7-', 'The [c]ourt has dealt with this exact issue and the [c]ourt will give', 'a curative instruction.” The trial justice proceeded to give the following curative instruction to the jury:', '“Members of the jury, before we take a brief break and come back', 'and give you the instructions, there was a comment made by the', 'prosecutor during the closing argument that dealt with an', 'observation of staring down or something to that [e]ffect. You', 'know what I’m referring to. First of all, as I told you before the', 'closings are not evidence. The defense closing is not evidence and', 'the [s]tate’s is not evidence. It’s what you heard from the witness', 'stand. I have also told you that the evidence is what you heard', 'from the witness stand and the statements. It’s not nothing [sic]', 'else that occurs in the courtroom itself. So I am going to instruct', 'you specifically that you must disregard that statement. Now as I', 'said, you wouldn’t be considering it as evidence anyway because', 'the closing is not evidence. But I am specifically going to instruct', 'you that you must disregard that statement. It’s up to you, the jury,', 'in terms of the witnesses, the evidence, the weight that you give', 'that and so I give you that instruction.” The defendant did not object to the instruction.', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant submits that the trial justice abused his discretion in failing to pass the case after the prosecutor’s statements during closing argument about defendant’s courtroom demeanor and behavior toward Veronica. The defendant argues that there is no evidence in the record to support the prosecutor’s representation that defendant glared at Veronica when she left the witness stand, and that the prosecutor inserted his personal observations into the record, which deprived defendant of his right to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the evidence presented at trial. Moreover, defendant argues that the instruction that was given could not cure the prejudice that this remark generated. We agree.', 'A criminal trial is a search for the truth. State v. Pacheco, 161 A.3d 1166, 1177 (R.I. 2017). “The purpose of closing argument is ‘to sharpen and clarify the issues for resolution by', '-8- the trier of fact in a criminal case.’” State v. Boillard, 789 A.2d 881, 885 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Herring v. New York, 422 U.S. 853, 862 (1975)). “Only after all the evidence has been presented are counsel for the parties in a position to present their respective versions of the case as a whole.” Id. “Only then can they argue the inferences to be drawn from all the testimony and point out the weaknesses of their adversaries’ positions.” Id.

(brackets omitted) (quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885). “The probable effect of the prosecutorial statements on the outcome of the case must be evaluated by examining the remarks in the context in which they were made.” Id. (quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885).', 'On numerous occasions, this Court has been called upon to examine purportedly improper statements by a prosecutor during closing argument. See, e.g., Lastarza, 203 A.3d at 1165; State v. Clements, 83 A.3d 553, 561 (R.I. 2014); State v. Vieira, 38 A.3d 18, 21 (R.I. 2012); Boillard, 789 A.2d at 884. In Boillard, the defendant was convicted of first-degree and second-degree child molestation. Boillard, 789 A.2d at 882. One of the victims testified that she had witnessed the defendant’s daughter performing a sexual act on the defendant. Id. at 884. The victim also testified that, when she confronted the defendant’s daughter about what she had seen and whether it happened often, the daughter responded, “only when I see my [d]ad.” Id. During', '-9- the daughter’s testimony, however, she denied ever having sexual contact with her father. Id. In closing argument, the prosecutor specifically addressed the daughter’s testimony and suggested that she may have “repressed” the memories or did not remember them. Id. The defendant objected, and the trial justice overruled the objection. Id. The prosecutor proceeded to discuss the inconsistencies in the testimony of the victim and the defendant’s daughter. Id. at 884-85. Once again, the defendant objected, and the trial justice overruled the objection. Id. at 885. We held that the trial justice did not err in overruling the defendant’s objections because the prosecutor’s statements suggesting possible explanations for the obvious inconsistencies in the testimony of the witnesses, “though conjectural, were within the array of reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the facts presented at trial, and they were neither extraneous nor inflammatory.” Id. at 885-86.', 'More recently, in Lastarza, we examined the issue of allegedly improper comments made by the prosecutor during closing argument. Lastarza, 203 A.3d at 1165. There, the prosecutor made several statements during closing argument related to the defendant’s acts of dishonesty and criminal history; the prosecutor called the defendant a “thief,” a “career thief,” a “scam artist,” and a “con artist.” Id. This Court concluded that the statements did not warrant a mistrial because they “were based in large part upon the evidence and testimony adduced at trial.” Id. In that case, the defendant took the stand at trial, placing his credibility before the jury, and volunteered information about his past crimes and acts of dishonesty. Id. at 1166. Thus, we determined that the trial justice did not err in denying the defendant’s motion to pass the case because the prosecutor’s statements were not “totally extraneous to the issues in the case,” and because the “remarks specifically addressed defendant’s performance on the witness stand[.]” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885).', '- 10 -', 'In both Boillard and Lastarza, the prosecutor’s remarks were directed to information and facts that had been revealed on the witness stand in the presence of the jury. The prosecutor’s statements in the case at bar diverge from our holdings in the Boillard line of cases because they were not based on the evidence or testimony at trial. Indeed, the prosecutor’s remarks about defendant’s demeanor have no support in the record, because defendant did not place his credibility at issue by testifying at trial. Cf. Lastarza, 203 A.3d at 1166 (where the prosecutor’s remarks “specifically addressed the defendant’s performance on the witness stand”). Nor did defendant have an opportunity to refute the prosecutor’s allegation that defendant “stared her down” as she was walking out of the courtroom. Moreover, the prosecutor’s statements were not “within the array of reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the facts presented at trial”; rather, the statements were based solely on the prosecutor’s own observations. Boillard, 789 A.2d at 886. As a result, the prosecutor’s statements—which placed the purported conduct of defendant before the jury without any evidentiary support—impacted defendant’s Fifth Amendment right not to testify at trial and may have influenced the jury’s verdict. Additionally, the context in which the remarks were made is notable because the prosecutor’s comments struck at the heart of the defense’s theory at trial—that the alleged assault was an accident. The prosecutor pointed to defendant’s courtroom demeanor as evidence that defendant’s actions were not accidental or mistaken. This is simply not allowed.', 'We are of the opinion that the prosecutor’s statements exceeded the “considerable latitude” he was allowed because his statements were not based on evidence or testimony adduced at trial, were extraneous to the issues in the case, and had the potential for unfair prejudice.

Thus, we conclude that the trial justice erred in denying defendant’s motion to pass the case.', 'Rule 404(b) Evidence', 'After the police raid and child pornography investigation, defendant was charged with one count of possession of child pornography. On May 9, 2016, he entered a plea of nolo contendere to that charge and received a four-year suspended sentence.', 'Before the trial in the present case, defendant filed motions in limine to preclude the state from introducing evidence or testimony concerning the child pornography case against defendant in accordance with Rule 403, Rule 404, and Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence and, further, to preclude the state from introducing the statements made by defendant to Det. Petit in the course of the child pornography investigation. The state countered that statements made by the accused were admissible because they were admissions, and that the child pornography evidence was admissible under Rule 404(b) to establish intent, absence of mistake, and defendant’s lewd disposition toward Veronica. The trial justice ruled that defendant’s prior conviction of possession of child pornography was admissible to show intent under Rule 404(b), but reserved ruling on the remaining evidence in defendant’s motions in limine.', 'The parties thereafter filed a written stipulation concerning defendant’s plea of nolo contendere to the possession of child pornography charge. During trial, the trial justice read the stipulation to the jury:', '“So the stipulation is: ‘The parties hereby stipulate to the', 'following:', '“‘(1.) That on May 9, 2016, Henry Bozzo before a justice', 'of the Superior Court pled nolo contendere to one count of', 'possession of child pornography and was sentenced to four years', 'suspended sentence and four years of probation with specific', 'conditions of the sentence and probation.’', '- 12 -', '“It also states, ‘Agreed to by the parties on 10/26/16,’ and', 'it’s signed by both the [s]tate and the defense attorneys. Also', 'attached to that stipulation is a document referred to as a judgment', 'of conviction and commitment, which basically just goes through', 'what I read to you here.” The trial justice then instructed the jury to consider the stipulated evidence only for determining the element of intent. The instruction was as follows:', '“Now, in certain cases the jury is allowed to hear and consider', '[evidence] about a prior conviction of the defendant on trial, but I', 'specifically inform you that you cannot use the fact that someone', 'was convicted on a prior occasion as evidence of what we call', 'propensity, and what that basically means is for the jury to say', 'because someone did something one time, they m[u]st have done it', 'this time as well. So you cannot use it for that purpose. However,', 'the law does allow the jury to use it to make certain determinations', 'in the case. In this case the jury is going to need to determine what', 'is referred to as intent. Intent to commit a crime or intent to', 'commit the acts charged. The jury is permitted to take this into', 'consideration when making their determination in terms of', 'intent[.]”', 'Later at trial, Det. Petit gave lengthy testimony about the child pornography investigation, including the statements made by defendant and the nature of the evidence obtained in the course of the investigation. Detective Petit testified that, at the time of the assault on Veronica, he was assigned to the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (ICAC), an agency made up of local, state, and federal law-enforcement officers charged with investigating crimes against children. He then described how the ICAC investigates child pornography cases.', 'At that point, the trial justice called the parties to sidebar. The defendant objected to the admission of any child pornography evidence, stating:', '“We want to have excluded the fact of exactly that it was not the', 'nature of a video that was found on Mr. Bozzo’s computer. We', 'stipulated to the fact that he admitted to possessing child', 'pornography, but we never said what that child pornography was.” The trial justice disagreed and ruled that the evidence was admissible under Rule 404.', '- 13 -', 'The state proceeded to present detailed and highly prejudicial testimony about this unrelated case. Detective Petit indicated that the ICAC received four tips about a certain IP address that was linked to child pornography, and that they determined that the IP address was linked to defendant, which led to the search of defendant’s residence on September 2, 2015.2 Detective Petit testified that the first interview of defendant occurred at his home after his arrest. Detective Petit then discussed the statements about child pornography made by defendant during that interview. According to Det. Petit, defendant admitted that he was familiar with the child pornography video that led to the tip, which depicted “a little girl in there masturbating[.]” He also testified that defendant admitted that he had watched videos of preteen girls having sex and that he “viewed [child pornography] everyday[.]”', 'When Det. Petit asked him if child pornography was sexually gratifying, defendant responded: “It’s not like I’m masturbating to it every time.” Detective Petit testified that defendant informed him that he frequented illicit websites containing graphic videos and images of minors, and that defendant admitted that he “searches whatever he can for [child pornography].” 2', 'The prosecutor and Det. Petit engaged in the following colloquy:', '“[PROSECUTOR]: What lead you to speak to Mr. Bozzo?', '“[DET. PETIT]: One of the cyber tips that was concerning that', 'involved a toddler female approximately four years old that was', 'described as a file named P.T.H.C., which stands for preteen hard', 'core. Typically those images are illegal.', '“* * *', '“[PROSECUTOR]: You received this image or was it a video?', '“[DET. PETIT]: It was a video.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: Did you talk to Henry about it?', '“[DET. PETIT]: I did.', '“[PROSECUTOR]: And this was a video that led you to sit down', 'and talk to him?', '“[DET. PETIT]: That’s correct.”', '- 14 -', 'At that point, the trial justice provided another cautionary instruction to the jury, and the prosecutor then continued his direct examination of Det. Petit, who proceeded to describe his second interview with defendant. Detective Petit testified that, during that interview, defendant admitted to downloading about a hundred videos of child pornography on his computer and that he had “a lot of fantasies” about those videos. Detective Petit later confirmed the existence of those videos on defendant’s hard drive, including more than one video of girls under the age of ten. According to Det. Petit, defendant stated that he was attracted to girls between seven and fifteen years old.', 'Although these interviews took place before Veronica’s father had reported the incident to law enforcement, Det. Petit testified that defendant talked about Veronica during the second meeting. According to Det. Petit, defendant stated that Veronica “was a beautiful girl[,]” that he was attracted to her, and that he enjoyed when Veronica sat on his lap. Detective Petit testified that defendant told him that it was a “look but don’t touch thing” with Veronica.', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled that we review a trial justice’s decision admitting or excluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.” Clements, 83 A.3d at 561 (brackets omitted) (quoting State v.

The stipulation made clear that defendant was not contesting the issue. This evidence therefore had no bearing on the remaining issues in the case. By contrast, the evidence that was admitted about the child pornography case was highly prejudicial and created a real risk of juror confusion. Detective Petit’s testimony about the child pornography case came in wholesale and placed before the jury extensive evidence of a separate crime.', 'We conclude that the trial justice erred in admitting some, but not all, of the evidence pertaining to the child pornography investigation. The stipulation foreclosed evidence of the child pornography investigation and conviction under Rule 404(b), including the task force, the child pornography videos, and defendant’s prurient interests.', 'We draw a distinction, however, with respect to the statements made by defendant to police about Veronica in the course of the child pornography investigation. The defendant’s statements to Det. Petit are relevant to this case and admissible for the purpose of proving defendant’s intent and lewd disposition toward Veronica. See State v. McVeigh, 660 A.2d 269, 273 (R.I. 1995) (holding that, in a sexual assault case, testimony of statements made by the defendant about prior uncharged sexual assaults of the victim were admissible as “relevant, material, and highly probative of defendant’s lecherous conduct” toward the victim, and as admissions by the defendant). The prosecutor in this case correctly pointed out that defendant’s statements about Veronica are just that—statements by the accused and not prior bad acts.', 'Bikers Against Child Abuse', 'It was not until after Veronica testified at trial that defense counsel objected to the presence of BACA motorcycle group members in the gallery during her testimony as well as to', '- 17 - the display of their colors on their clothing.

We believe there may be an intimidation', 'factor. So we object to them being allowed to wear such materials', 'in the courtroom, just as the [c]ourt would keep anyone from', 'wearing gang material in the courtroom.” The state countered by arguing that the courtroom is open to the public and that the allegation that BACA members were staring at the jury had not been brought to the attention of the state or the court. The trial justice stated:', '“First of all, the [c]ourt will note that no objection was raised', 'during the testimony of the witness as far as any type of looks or', 'intimidation.

The trial justice noted that “[a]s far as what [the BACA members] were wearing yesterday in a very real sense that ship has sailed as far as the [c]ourt is concerned.” The defendant also objected to the presence of BACA members in the courtroom during closing arguments altogether. The trial justice overruled the objection and permitted the BACA members to remain. The defendant did not object, move for a mistrial, or ask for a curative instruction.', 'The issue arose for a third time in defendant’s motion for a new trial. The defendant argued that he was entitled to a new trial because the presence of BACA members in the courtroom during Veronica’s testimony and during closing arguments was so inherently prejudicial that it deprived him of his right to a fair trial. The defendant also took issue with the fact that Veronica wore a BACA vest during her testimony. The trial justice denied the motion and noted that defendant did not object to Veronica wearing a vest herself while she was testifying, nor did he object to the presence of BACA members in the courtroom until after Veronica’s testimony.', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in failing to grant a mistrial, provide a curative instruction, or grant a new trial based on Veronica wearing a BACA vest during her testimony and the presence of BACA members in the courtroom during trial and closing arguments.

The defendant did not move for a mistrial, propose an alternative curative instruction, or provide any substantive feedback on the proposed instruction. Because defendant failed to alert the trial justice to these concerns or press a timely objection, those issues were not properly preserved for appellate review. See State v. Higham, 865 A.2d 1040, 1047 (R.I. 2004) (holding that the defendant waived any issue concerning the adequacy of the curative instruction because he failed to object to the substance of the instruction after it was given).

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 2, 2011, a drive-by shooting occurred near the intersection of Camp Street and Doyle Avenue in Providence. Subsequently, on August 5, 2011, the state filed a multi-count criminal information charging defendant and a codefendant, Jean Sajous, in connection with that', '-1- shooting.1 On May 18, 2012, the state filed a second criminal information against defendant charging him with additional crimes relating to the May 2 shooting incident. Prior to trial, the state dismissed several of the counts against defendant that had been charged in the two criminal informations; and the trial justice consolidated for trial the remaining counts in the two cases stemming from the two separate informations. A trial was held in June of 2012 with respect to the following charges: carrying a handgun in a motor vehicle without a license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-8(a); operating a motor vehicle in an attempt to elude the police in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-27-4; discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle with a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury in violation of § 11-47-51.1; conspiracy to discharge a firearm from a motor vehicle in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6; using a firearm while committing a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b); driving with a suspended license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-11-18; and solicitation in violation of § 11-1-9. Prior to trial, the parties stipulated that, on May 2, 2011, defendant did not have a duly issued license or permit to carry or possess a pistol. We summarize below the salient aspects of what occurred at trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony of Officer David Lorince', 'Providence Police Officer David Lorince testified for the state. He stated that, on May 2, 2011, Officer Donald Castigliego and he had been driving in their patrol car on Camp Street 1', 'On February 6, 2012, Jean Sajous pled nolo contendere to the following offenses stemming from the drive-by shooting: carrying a handgun in a motor vehicle without a license in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-8(a); assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2; conspiracy to discharge a firearm from a motor vehicle in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6; discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle with a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury in violation of § 11-47-51.1. On each of those counts, he was sentenced to six years imprisonment, which sentences were to run concurrently. Mr. Sajous also pled nolo contendere to one count of using a firearm while committing a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b); with respect to that count, Mr. Sajous received a ten-year suspended sentence, with probation. A judgment to that effect was entered on February 22, 2012.', '-2- headed towards Doyle Avenue when he observed a dark-colored Nissan Maxima turn onto Doyle Avenue. Officer Lorince testified that, approximately ten to fifteen seconds later, he “observed a single gunshot out of the passenger side of [the] Maxima.” According to Officer Lorince, the occupants of the Maxima then fled the scene; he added that Officer Castigliego activated the patrol car’s lights and sirens and that the two officers “gave chase to the vehicle.”', 'Officer Lorince testified that the Maxima drove through the intersection of Doyle Avenue and North Main Street and continued onto Randall Street, at which point it “skidded and hit [a] utility pole.” He stated that, as their patrol car was pulling up alongside the passenger’s side of the Maxima, two individuals exited the vehicle. At trial, Officer Lorince identified defendant as the individual who exited from the driver’s side, and he stated that he later learned that the individual who exited from the passenger’s side was Mr. Sajous. It was Officer Lorince’s testimony that, as Mr. Sajous exited the Maxima, he “was holding his waist like he was holding something or his pants were going to fall off when he ran.”2 Officer Lorince testified that he then pursued both individuals on foot and that, assisted by additional officers who had responded to the scene, he apprehended them in the parking lot of a nearby Marriott Hotel. Officer Lorince further testified that, after the two individuals were arrested, the police found a firearm in a trash can which Officer Lorince had seen Mr. Sajous run past during the chase; he acknowledged, however, that he had not seen defendant pass that same trash can while he was being chased. 2', 'The testimony of Providence Police Officer Donald Castigliego with respect to what occurred on the evening of May 2, 2011 was largely consistent with that of Officer Lorince. Notably, Officer Castigliego testified that, as Mr. Sajous was exiting the vehicle, “he was clutching his waist as if he was concealing something;” Officer Castigliego added that, based on his training and experience, he believed that the “something” could be a “firearm or a weapon.”', '-3-', 'B', 'The Testimony of Det. Paul Renzi', 'Detective Paul Renzi of the Providence Police Department’s Bureau of Criminal Identification testified that, on May 2, 2011, he responded to a crime scene at the Marriott Hotel in Providence. He stated that, when he arrived at the hotel, his “attention was directed to the rear of the Marriott to a trash can which was being watched over by a patrolman * * * .” He testified that in that trash can he observed a pistol which had been placed inside of a black sock, with the barrel sticking out of the sock. Detective Renzi further testified that he fingerprinted the firearm, the magazine, and a spent cartridge casing; he acknowledged, however, that, “[b]ecause of [the] sock,” he was not able to recover any fingerprints. The exhibits at trial indicated that the serial number of the gun recovered from the trash can matched that of a gun purchased by one Ronique Perou (to whose testimony we turn next).', 'C', 'The Testimony of Ronique Perou', 'Ronique Perou testified that, having previously obtained a gun permit, she purchased her first gun on April 12, 2011 at a store in Woonsocket called “Bullseye.”', 'Ms. Perou testified that she had met defendant and Mr. Sajous (whom she referred to as “Beans”) approximately three years prior to trial. With respect to her relationship with the two men, she further testified that she had seen defendant visiting the home of a friend of his which was close to where she lived in Providence and that she and defendant had exchanged greetings on several occasions. Ms. Perou stated that, in late April of 2011, defendant came to her home, where he observed an empty box of bullets; she added that, when defendant asked her if she had', '-4- a gun, she told him that she did. She testified that shortly thereafter, on May 2, 2011,3 defendant again visited her home, where she showed him her gun upon his request; she added, however, that, when he asked her if he could borrow her gun, she refused. It was Ms. Perou’s further testimony that defendant then asked her if she could “get [him] one” because, as he informed her, he would not be able to obtain a gun permit due to a previous arrest. She stated that she assented to defendant’s suggestion that she use her permit to purchase a gun and have it “transfer[red] to his name.”', 'Ms. Perou testified that, later that same day (May 2), she drove defendant to the Woonsocket gun store called Bullseye. She further testified that they went into the store together and that defendant gave her one hundred dollars. It was her testimony that she filled out the paperwork relative to the gun purchase, listing herself as the actual buyer of the firearm. She stated that she used the money given to her by defendant to place a deposit on the gun, which could be picked up after a seven-day waiting period.4', 'According to Ms. Perou, she and defendant then returned to her home, where defendant asked her if he could see her gun again.5 Ms. Perou testified that, when she showed defendant 3', 'The reader will recall that the shooting that is at the center of this case occurred on May 2, 2011. 4', 'Ronique Perou testified that, with respect to the trip to the gun store to purchase a second firearm, she was charged by the state with one count of providing false information in securing a firearm in violation of § 11-47-23; it was her testimony that she pled guilty to that charge after entering into a cooperation agreement with the state. Pursuant to the cooperation agreement, Ms. Perou agreed to testify truthfully with respect to the events of May 2, 2011 in exchange for the state’s recommendation that she receive a suspended five-year sentence, with probation. In addition, Ms. Perou acknowledged that, “as part of [her] agreement with the State, [she was] promised that [she] would not be prosecuted by the Federal Government[.]” 5', 'The reader will recall that Ms. Perou had previously purchased a gun on April 12, 2011— which gun is not to be confused with the gun on which she made a deposit on May 2, 2011. The gun purchased in April of 2011 is the one that is at issue in this case.', '-5- her gun, he asked her if he could take it to show to a friend of his. She stated that she told defendant no, but that he then grabbed the gun from her hand and departed. Ms. Perou testified that she followed defendant outside, where he told her that he was not going to do anything with the gun other than show it to a friend; she added that he drove away from her home in a “[b]lack Maxima” that was waiting outside. Ms. Perou testified that she then tried calling defendant by phone but that she was not able to reach him until later that day, at which point he assured her that nothing would happen with her gun. According to Ms. Perou, the next day she attempted unsuccessfully to locate defendant’s friend “Beans” so that he could help her locate defendant.', 'Ms. Perou stated that, on May 4, 2011, she filed a report with the Providence Police Department alleging that the gun had been stolen; she added that, because she did not want to get “in trouble,” she told the police that someone had broken into her home and had stolen the gun. On cross-examination, Ms. Perou acknowledged that, when agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) first questioned her on June 23, 2011, she gave a recorded statement repeating in substance her statement to the Providence Police Department. (That was the first of four recorded statements that Ms. Perou made to ATF that day.) Ms. Perou further testified at trial that, after becoming somewhat “scared” when the ATF agents told her that they thought she was lying to them and that, if she was lying, they would charge her with a crime, she gave a second recorded statement; in that statement she told the ATF agents that her gun could have been stolen by defendant, by “Beans,” or by a third man who wore “braids”—in view of the fact that all three of them had been at her home for a party in April. She stated that the ATF agents again told her that they thought she was lying and that, if she was not telling the truth, she would be charged with a crime; and she acknowledged that the ATF agents also told her that they believed defendant had taken the gun and that she was trying', '-6- to protect him. Ms. Perou testified that, after listening to those statements by the ATF agents, she gave a third recorded statement, in which she admitted that defendant had taken the gun from her. She further testified that she also told the ATF agents about having gone with defendant to purchase a gun for him.6 Ms. Perou also stated that several months later, on February 9, 2012, she was again interviewed by the ATF agents, at which time she told them that defendant had not taken her gun until approximately two to three days after she had gone to the gun store with him—which contrasted with her trial testimony that defendant had taken her gun that same day, May 2, 2011. At trial, Ms. Perou explained that she made the February 9, 2012 statement only because the ATF agents told her that defendant could not have taken her gun on May 2.', 'D', 'The Testimony of Paul Connolly', 'Paul Connolly, the owner of Bullseye Shooting Supply in Woonsocket, testified that he was familiar with Ms. Perou because she had purchased firearms from his store, whereas he stated that he did not recognize defendant. At trial, he identified a form that Ms. Perou had filled out on May 2, 2011 in connection with her purchase of a firearm (which would have been her second firearm); and he further testified that she came into the store by herself on that date. It was Mr. Connolly’s testimony that he had previously refused to sell firearms to customers whom he suspected of attempting to make a “straw purchase,” and he stated that he would not have sold the firearm to Ms. Perou if, when she was filling out the just-referenced form, “there was another gentleman standing with her that then gave her $100 to pay for that firearm * * * .” 6', 'Although Ms. Perou testified that she gave a fourth recorded statement to the ATF agents on June 23, 2011, she did not testify with specificity as to the contents thereof.', '-7-', 'Mr. Connolly acknowledged that, in October of 2011, ATF agents came to his store and asked him questions about purchases made there; he stated that he “cooperated with them.” He also stated that he “do[es] everything [he] can to assist law enforcement * * * .”', 'E', 'The Verdict, the Motion for a New Trial, and the Sentencing', 'After the parties had rested, the trial justice instructed the jury. On June 12, 2012, the jury convicted defendant of carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle without a license and attempting to elude a police officer, while it acquitted him of the remaining charges.7', 'The defendant then moved for a new trial with respect to both convictions pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice granted the motion for a new trial on the charge of attempting to elude a police officer, but he denied defendant’s motion with respect to the charge of carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle without a license.8 In due course, the trial justice sentenced defendant to seven years imprisonment, with eighteen months to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation. A timely appeal was filed.', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice should have granted his motion for a new trial as to the charge of carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle without a license because, in his view, there was no evidence that he was aware that his codefendant was in possession of a gun until the gun was fired on Doyle Avenue. 7', 'After both parties had rested, the trial justice dismissed the charge of driving with a suspended license, leaving six counts to go to the jury (see infra). 8', 'In ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice ruled that, based on the evidence presented at trial, a fair inference could be drawn that defendant had sole possession of the firearm at issue in this case when he entered the vehicle on May 2, 2011. It follows from that ruling that the trial justice concluded that the jury had an adequate evidentiary basis on which to convict defendant of possession of a firearm in the motor vehicle—despite the fact that Mr. Sajous had pled nolo contendere to discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle on the day in question.', '-8-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When a trial justice considers a motion for a new trial, he or she “acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v.

In fulfilling his or her role as the thirteenth juror, “the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Espinal, 943 A.2d 1052, 1058 (R.I. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Baker, 79 A.3d 1267, 1273 (R.I. 2013); State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013).

However, we have also indicated that “the trial justice need not refer to all the evidence supporting the decision * * * .” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). In ruling on a new trial motion, “[t]he trial justice need only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the justice has applied the appropriate standards.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', '-9-', 'When we review the trial justice’s denial of a motion for a new trial, “we do not focus on whether this Court simply agrees or disagrees with [his or her] credibility determinations,” but rather we are “deferential to those determinations.” State v.

Accordingly, “[i]f the trial justice has complied with [the requisite] procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, his or her decision will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Clay, 79 A.3d at 842.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'It is our judgment that the trial justice conducted the appropriate three-step analysis before denying defendant’s motion for a new trial with respect to the charge of carrying a firearm in a motor vehicle without a license. The record indicates that the trial justice first properly considered the evidence in light of the jury charge. Moving next to the second step, the trial justice proceeded to independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. With respect to the credibility of Ms. Perou, the trial justice stated as follows:', '“I recognize that Miss Perou [gave] inconsistent statements, but', 'I’m satisfied that as she went through the testimony, she did', 'explain why they were inconsistent, and when she got to the', 'bottom line, it was clear to me, as a front-row observer, of', 'watching her and listening to her, that her inconsistent statements', 'were really borne [sic] of a concern for her own situation with', 'immigration or with the ATF. She didn’t want to get herself in', 'trouble. She obviously didn’t want to get [defendant] in trouble', 'either, at least not at first.”', '- 10 - In contrast, the trial justice found Mr. Connolly to be an “overearnest witness looking too hard to please law enforcement, particularly the ATF.” The trial justice further found that Ms. Perou’s testimony “reflected * * * defendant’s clear desire to get his hands on a handgun,” and he stated that he had “no difficulty in accepting her rendition that it was [defendant] who had [her] gun and introduced that gun into the vehicle that night.” Based on the evidence presented at trial, it was the opinion of the trial justice that a fair inference could be drawn that, when defendant entered the vehicle, he had sole possession of the firearm at issue in this case; and, although he noted that, “at one point, [Mr.] Sajous picked it up and used it,” he found that “the gun was shared by both of them that night.” The trial justice then concluded, pursuant to the third step in the analytical process, that he would have reached the same result as the jury, stating:', '“I’m well satisfied that * * * defendant was properly convicted', 'beyond a reasonable doubt of unlawfully carrying a firearm in a', 'motor vehicle without a duly-issued license or permit * * * .” Accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial with respect to that charge. See State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765 (R.I. 2011) (stating that if, after conducting the required three-step analysis, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict, “then the inquiry is at an end and the motion for a new trial should be denied”).', 'The defendant contends that, without the testimony of Ms. Perou, whose testimony he asserts was lacking in credibility, “[t]here was absolutely no evidence of any statements or conversations which indicated [that the defendant had actual possession of the gun or] that [he] was aware that [Mr.] Sajous possessed a gun prior to [Mr.] Sajous’ discharge of the weapon.” After a careful review of the record in this case, it is clear to us that the defendant’s contention on appeal amounts to nothing more than a disagreement with the trial justice’s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. See State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96,', '- 11 - 103 (R.I. 2012) (stating that “[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Clay, 79 A.3d at 842; State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 367 (R.I. 2011). The trial justice recognized that Ms. Perou had given inconsistent statements to the police and the ATF; however, he was satisfied by her explanation as to why she had done so, and he ultimately chose to accept her in-court testimony with respect to the events of May 2, 2011. We have stated on more than one occasion that “the presence of some inconsistencies between or among utterances of a witness or witnesses at different points in time does not ipso facto render the testimony unworthy of belief.” State v. Jensen, 40 A.3d 771, 781 (R.I. 2012); see also Rosario, 35 A.3d at 948-49. We are unable to conclude that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was clearly wrong in crediting Ms. Perou’s testimony that the defendant had taken her handgun. See Paola, 59 A.3d at 106 (“[T]his Court affords a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 872 (R.I. 2010).

10,State : v. : Francisco Maria.,reversal,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Francisco Maria, was found guilty by a jury of possession of cocaine with intent to deliver. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction sentencing him to a term of fifteen years’ incarceration, with five years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation. He argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as well as by not instructing the jury on the lesser-included offense of simple possession. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On February 7, 2012, defendant was charged with one count of possessing cocaine with the intent to deliver it. The defendant was tried by a jury over three consecutive days in March', '-1- and April 2014 in the Providence County Superior Court. The state presented six witnesses; their pertinent testimony and the evidence admitted at trial are summarized below.', 'In June 2011, Michael Naylor was a detective with a local Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) task force. Sergeant Naylor 1 testified that, during May and June 2011, he conducted surveillance of an apartment building located on First Avenue in East Greenwich. Sergeant Naylor testified that, on June 1, 2011, he observed a “Hispanic male arrive in a gold Acura,” enter the specific apartment under surveillance, “stay[] for awhile,” and then exit the apartment with a female who had been the target of the surveillance at that apartment. Sergeant Naylor identified defendant as the Hispanic male whom he had seen at the apartment building on First Avenue on June 1, 2011. However, Sgt. Naylor also testified that, on June 1, 2011, he had not known defendant’s identity. To ascertain the identity of the Hispanic male he had observed at the East Greenwich apartment building, Sgt. Naylor testified, he had “requested that one of the East Greenwich police officers stop the vehicle and identify the driver.” Sergeant Naylor admitted that defendant’s vehicle was subsequently pulled over using a “pretext stop” for the sole purpose of ascertaining defendant’s identity. He further testified that he subsequently confirmed that the gold Acura was registered to defendant and that defendant owned residential property located on Montgomery Avenue in Providence (the target property). Sergeant Naylor also testified that, from May 18, 2011, through June 2011, he observed defendant at the East Greenwich property approximately fifteen times and that he was in contact with detectives from the Cranston Police Department during the surveillance operations conducted in June 2011. Sergeant Naylor also testified that the female target of the East Greenwich apartment’s surveillance drove a Nissan Maxima. 1', 'At the time of the trial, Sgt. Naylor was working as a police sergeant with the patrol division of the Newport Police Department.', '-2-', 'Warren Henseler, a detective in the special investigations unit of the Cranston Police Department and a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s “Safe Streets Violent Crimes Task Force,” testified that, in June 2011, he was investigating the distribution of cocaine in the city of Providence.', 'On June 3, 2011, based on information received from a confidential informant (CI), Det. Henseler conducted undercover surveillance of the target property. Detective Henseler testified that, during the surveillance, he saw an individual known to him as Michael White exit a vehicle that was driven by the CI and parked near the target property. Detective Henseler saw White meet with defendant in front of the house, walk up the driveway towards the house, then disappear from his view for approximately five minutes before both men returned to the detective’s line of vision. Detective Henseler further testified that he then saw White depart in the vehicle driven by the CI and defendant remain at the target property. Detective Henseler testified that he had seen defendant and White walk and talk only, and that he had not observed an actual transaction for the sale of drugs. When the vehicle with the CI and White drove away from the target property, Det. Henseler followed it to the City of Warwick. Detective Henseler testified that White was dropped off at a residence and that he continued following the CI’s vehicle to the DEA’s office in Providence.', 'Ronald Fuoroli, a detective in the narcotics unit of the Cranston Police Department, testified regarding his undercover surveillance of the target property on June 23, 2011. Detective Fuoroli testified that he saw defendant arrive at the target property in a gold Acura, park across the street, and walk up the driveway towards the house with a cooler on his shoulder. Detective Fuoroli further testified that he saw defendant leave the target property half an hour later in the same vehicle, then return to the target property approximately five minutes later. Detective Fuoroli then saw defendant exit the gold Acura and meet up with White—who had arrived in a', '-3- vehicle driven by a CI shortly before defendant returned. The two men met on the street, then proceeded to walk together up the driveway of the target property towards the house. Detective Fuoroli lost sight of the two men for “two to three minutes” before White reappeared into his view and White and the CI drove away. After White and the CI drove away, Det. Fuoroli observed defendant departing in the gold Acura. Detective Fuoroli further testified that he followed the gold Acura and he saw the vehicle pull over to the side of a road where he met with someone in “either a green or gray Maxima.”', 'Kevin Antonucci, a detective sergeant and commanding officer of the narcotics unit with the Cranston Police Department, testified about the execution of a search warrant for the target property on June 29, 2011. Detective Antonucci testified that he was one of the law-enforcement officers who had conducted the search of the master bedroom in the residence. From the master bedroom, Det. Antonucci seized a passport issued by the Dominican Republic to defendant, bank statements with defendant’s name and address, and a digital scale. From a dresser drawer, Det. Antonucci seized “nine clear plastic bags containing what [he] believed to be cocaine” as well as “some empty bags.” Detective Antonucci also seized a “large machete-type knife” from under the bed. He further testified that he turned over all of the items seized to Det. Juan Robles of the Providence Police Department, who, according to Det. Antonucci, served as the “evidence custodian” during the execution of the search warrant. Although Det. Antonucci testified that he had searched for physical evidence or records of sale, he stated that he had not found any evidence of the actual sale of illegal substances such as ledgers or receipts.', 'Juan Robles, a police officer with the Providence Police Department’s narcotics unit and part-time member of the DEA’s task force, testified that he was also present on June 29, 2011, during the execution of the search warrant at the target property. Officer Robles testified that his', '-4- role during the execution of the search warrant was to “keep[] an eye on everybody while the search was being done, and at the same time try[] to speak with [defendant].” Officer Robles further testified that he observed a detective conduct a search of defendant’s person and seize narcotics from defendant’s pocket. One of the bags seized from defendant’s pocket contained a straw within it. Officer Robles also testified that he performed a chemical field test on the narcotics seized from defendant’s pocket and that the test result was positive for cocaine.', 'Michael Liberto, a principal forensic chemist at the Rhode Island Department of Health Forensic Drug Chemistry Laboratory, was the last witness to testify. Mr. Liberto was qualified to testify as an expert witness in the field of narcotics analysis and identification. He testified that the Providence Police Department had submitted a total of fourteen bags of suspected narcotics in July 2011 and that the suspected narcotics had tested positive for cocaine salts. Mr. Liberto further testified that the combined weight of the cocaine salts that he received from the Providence Police Department for testing totaled 33.43 grams.', 'At the close of the state’s evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the basis that there was insufficient evidence of defendant’s intent to deliver. After the trial justice summarized the evidence presented by the state for each of the elements required to prove the charge of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion, concluding that there was “sufficient evidence which a jury could find the [s]tate proved the four elements of this offense.” The trial justice then heard defendant’s objection to the state’s previously submitted request to include “simple possession of cocaine” as a lesser-included offense in the instructions to the jury. The defendant objected to instructing the jury on this lesser-included offense because he had not anticipated the state’s request during his preparation for trial and had focused his defense strategy on the sufficiency of the evidence', '-5- regarding the intent element of the offense charged. The trial justice acknowledged defendant’s chosen trial strategy and denied the state’s request.', 'The jury returned a guilty verdict on April 2, 2014, on the one charge of possession of cocaine with the intent to deliver it. On May 22, 2014, the trial justice sentenced defendant to fifteen years’ imprisonment with five years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation, as well as drug abuse treatment, 200 hours of community service and a $5,000 fine.

Discussion', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of the state’s evidence because the state failed to present sufficient evidence of defendant’s intent to deliver. The defendant was convicted of violating G.L. 1956 § 21-28- 4.01(a)(1), which states in pertinent part that “it shall be unlawful for any person to * * * possess with intent to * * * deliver a controlled substance.” We have previously stated that, pursuant to this statute, an individual is guilty of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver when the state proves beyond a reasonable doubt that “a defendant was in possession of drugs, had the requisite control over them, and intended to deliver the drugs to others.” State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1112 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Williams, 656 A.2d 975, 978 (R.I. 1995)). Since defendant’s appeal from the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal is based solely on his assertion that the state provided insufficient evidence of the intent element of the crime charged, we will limit our review of the evidence to that from which a jury could have inferred that defendant intended to deliver the cocaine found in his possession. See Rolon, 45 A.3d at 524.', 'With respect to the intent element of defendant’s charge, we have previously held that a jury may “infer an intent to deliver illegal narcotics solely on the basis of the amount of the drugs found.” State v. Rodriguez, 10 A.3d 431, 435 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Williams, 656 A.2d at 978). Nevertheless, we have also deemed 34.5 grams of cocaine, without any other evidence of intent to deliver, such as scales or packaging materials, to be insufficient to sustain a conviction for', '-7- possession with intent to deliver. State v. Eiseman, 461 A.2d 369, 381, 383 (R.I. 1983), abrogated on other grounds by, Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990). “By so holding, however, we in no way intimate[d] that possession of a large amount of a controlled substance may not suffice to justify an inference of intent to deliver beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. at 383.', 'We also bear in mind that “circumstantial and direct evidence should be given equal weight.” State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1232, 1237 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Wilshire, 509 A.2d 444, 452 (R.I. 1986)). Accordingly, we have held that, when “police conducted surveillance of [a] defendant and observed individuals arriving at [the] defendant’s apartment, staying for a few moments, and then leaving,” “were aware that neighbors had complained about visitors coming and going from the apartment at all hours,” and had “two confidential informants [telling them] that [the] defendant was selling crack cocaine at his apartment,” “combined with [thirty-seven] individually wrapped cocaine packets seized from the defendant’s apartment,” there was sufficient evidence to withstand a motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause on a charge for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. State v. Reed, 764 A.2d 144, 147 (R.I. 2001).', 'Here, five law enforcement officers who were directly involved in the investigation of defendant and one expert in the field of narcotics analysis and identification testified during the trial. Two of the law enforcement officers testified to observing defendant meeting with the same individual on two separate days outside of defendant’s residence and then disappearing from view for only a few minutes before that individual departed. One of the law enforcement officers testified that, on approximately fifteen occasions in less than a two-month period, he had observed defendant visiting an apartment in East Greenwich that had been under investigation for selling narcotics. In addition, the exhibits presented at trial included a digital scale, nine clear', '-8- plastic bags containing cocaine and some empty clear plastic bags that had been seized from defendant’s bedroom during the execution of the search warrant at defendant’s residence. The state also presented a bag of cocaine with a straw inside that had been seized from defendant’s pocket during the search of his house as an exhibit. The expert witness testified that the substances submitted to the state laboratory all tested positive for cocaine salts. Based on the expert witness’s testimony regarding the weight of cocaine that had been seized from both defendant’s person and from his dresser drawer during the execution of the search warrant and subsequently submitted for testing, the total weight of cocaine seized during the search on June 29, 2011 was 33.43 grams. According to testimony from Det. Antonucci that one gram of cocaine had an estimated street value of $100, approximately $3,300 worth of cocaine was seized from defendant and his residence during the search.', 'Reviewing all of the testimony and considering the direct and circumstantial evidence in the light most favorable to the state, giving full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt, we conclude that the state presented sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to deliver the cocaine. See Gomez, 116 A.3d at 225. We therefore discern no error in the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal.', 'B', 'Jury Instructions', 'Notwithstanding defendant’s objection during trial to the state’s request to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of possession of cocaine, defendant also argues before us that the trial justice erred by failing to instruct the jury on this lesser-included offense. The state replies that this issue is waived because defendant objected to this instruction during trial and the', '-9- trial justice accordingly denied the state’s request. According to Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “[n]o party may assign as error any portion of the [jury instructions] or omission therefrom unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the party’s objection.” We have previously commented that “[t]he purpose of Rule 30 is to notify the trial justice, with clarity and specificity, of any deficiencies in the [jury instructions] so that the alleged error may be cured before the jury retires for deliberations.” State v.

Brown, 898 A.2d 69, 83 (R.I. 2006)). “As a result, ‘if an objection to a jury instruction is not effectively raised below, it is waived on appeal.’” Id. (quoting State v. Crow, 871 A.2d 930, 935 (R.I. 2005)).', 'The defendant’s argument before us provides an unusual twist on our long-established raise-or-waive rule. Here, the issue was thoroughly discussed during the trial after the defendant objected to the state’s request to include simple possession of cocaine as a lesser-included offense in the jury’s instructions. The record before us reflects that, since trial, the defendant has completely reversed his position regarding the desirability of the lesser-included offense of simple possession. As such, this issue is not properly before us for review, and we decline to consider the defendant’s argument on its merits.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

He argues that his attorney posed the question in order to challenge Jacob’s credibility and that the trial justice’s ruling was incorrectly based on the trial justice’s view that counsel could have obtained that information by taking a deposition of Jacob. We note initially that defendant is correct in contending that the trial justice erred in stating that defense counsel could have taken a', '-7- deposition of Jacob before trial.4', 'However, after careful review of the record, we have determined that this error was not prejudicial.', 'We have stated that “[i]nquiries that are potentially misleading or irrelevant, that offer little or no probative value, or that exceed the scope of the direct examination are objectionable, and may be restricted by the trial justice.” State v. Porter, 179 A.3d 1218, 1228-29 (R.I. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). In Porter, this Court affirmed a trial justice’s decision to limit the scope of cross-examination during a trial for second-degree murder when “defendant could not point to even a scintilla of evidence” that there was a possibility of an unknown second assailant and weapon. Porter, 179 A.3d at 1229; see State v. Alston, 47 A.3d 234, 249 (R.I. 2012) (holding that “when the state objected to defendant’s question, defendant did not make any offer of proof that the examination he intended to embark upon could lead to relevant evidence” and that, therefore, the trial justice did not commit prejudicial error in limiting defendant’s cross- examination of a witness); see also State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 474 (R.I. 1998).', 'In the instant case, defense counsel acknowledged at sidebar that he had received from the state before trial the name of one counselor from whom Jacob had sought treatment and stated that he “just wanted to make sure [he had] all the correct information * * *.

Allowing defense counsel to question Jacob in this manner would have constituted an inquiry that was irrelevant and offered little probative value. See Porter, 179 A.3d at 1228-29. Therefore, the trial justice’s ruling is not reversible; he did not allow further investigation to occur in the middle of a cross- examination, a decision entirely within his discretion. See State v. Lynch, 770 A.2d 840, 847 (R.I. 2001) (stating that “this Court can affirm the judgment of the Superior Court on grounds not actually relied upon by the trial court to justify its ruling”); cf.

As noted above, at trial, the prosecutor asked Mr. MacNeil’s wife: “You live across from an elementary school; correct?” Mrs. MacNeil responded: “On the side.” Defense counsel objected: “Objection, relevance.” The trial justice overruled the objection, stating: “It’s already in evidence. The answer will stand.” At trial, defendant raised a relevance objection to the testimony, and the trial justice overruled it. He may not now raise an objection based on improper inference.', 'In addition, the testimony that defendant and his wife lived near an elementary school had already been admitted into evidence without objection before Mrs. MacNeil testified to that fact;6 therefore, the objection is unavailing.

Tarini, 15 A.3d 968, 976 (R.I. 2011)). “We will, however, review questions of law de novo.” Id.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the findings of the magistrate and the hearing justice “were clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record * * * .” According to defendant, the financial statement introduced into evidence at the hearing showed that defendant’s only source of income was from her social security and pension benefits, and she contends that this proved her inability to pay more than the amount of the pension benefit. The defendant avers that “there was no evidence in the record that established that [she] had such other assets that would fund $500.00 per month in restitution,” and that most of the monthly expenses listed on the financial statement were being paid by her husband.', 'The state argues that there was “ample evidence in the record to support” the decisions of the magistrate and the hearing justice. The state asserts that the magistrate and the hearing justice did not err in concluding that defendant had sufficient sources of income, aside from her social security benefit, to make $500 monthly restitution payments. The state also notes that “defendant’s continued expenditure of money to litigate the restitution obligations she incurred as a result of her [nolo contendere] plea would seemingly belie her claim that she worries continually about having money to feed herself and her husband.”', '-8-', 'We have previously held that a defendant who claims an inability to comply with a restitution order bears the burden of proving that he or she has made sufficient efforts to acquire the necessary funds. See State v. LaRoche, 883 A.2d 1151, 1155 (R.I. 2005). We are convinced that the hearing justice did not err in determining that the defendant has failed to meet this burden of proof.', 'As described above, her testimony revealed numerous assets that could potentially be liquidated and significant expenses that could be reduced in order to direct more funds toward her restitution obligation. When asked about these expenses and assets, she responded elusively, at no time presenting the court with evidence that she had made a good- faith effort to procure the additional $263 that was purportedly missing from her monthly budget. Similarly, she now makes a vague claim that her husband is paying her monthly expenses, but she has not supported this assertion with any evidence. Indeed, the financial statement upon which she relied below does not indicate how she is paying any of her enumerated expenses. 15 Additionally, she failed to provide the court with tax returns for any years after 2007, despite being instructed to do so on January 25, 2011; nor did she provide any documents to support the various expenses listed on her financial statement. After reviewing the record of this case, we think it is clear that the defendant has patently failed to meet her burden of proving an inability to maintain payments of $500 per month. 15', 'Furthermore, it became apparent at the hearing that the financial statement was not entirely accurate. Although the financial statement was dated and notarized on January 17, 2013 and included the expenses of a mortgage payment, property taxes, and an installment payment to Harris Furs, defendant revealed at the hearing that she and her husband were not actually making payments on any of these obligations.', '-9-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

13,State : v. : Mark Ceppi.,reversal,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Mark Ceppi, appeals from a judgment of conviction on one count of domestic felony assault, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 and G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5, and one count of domestic simple assault, pursuant to § 11-5-3 and § 12-29-5, which judgment was entered on August 5, 2010, following a jury-waived trial in the Newport County Superior Court. The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to dismiss a criminal information, which motion invoked Rule 9.1 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and G.L. 1956 § 12-12-1.7. The criminal information at issue contained two counts, on both of which the defendant was eventually convicted; he posits that the criminal information package was not sufficient to establish probable cause for either of the two counts. He further contends that the trial justice committed a number of evidentiary errors during the course of the trial. Those errors, according to the defendant, were as follows: (1) finding that certain portions of the testimony of Newport Detective Christopher Hayes were not hearsay and allowing improper bolstering of the testimony of Heather King (the complaining witness) by the', '-1- testimony of Det. Hayes; (2) improperly allowing questioning of the defendant with respect to an alleged past incident of violence involving his former wife; (3) impermissibly restricting the defendant’s testimony with respect to Ms. King’s alleged intoxication; and (4) wrongly allowing Stephanie Bacon, the complaining witness’s twin sister, to testify with respect to the complaining witness’s injuries.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 6, 2009, defendant was charged by criminal information with domestic felony assault, pursuant to § 11-5-2 and § 12-29-5 (Count One), and domestic simple assault, pursuant to § 11-5-3 and § 12-29-5 (Count Two). Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to dismiss the criminal information pursuant to Rule 9.1 and § 12-12-1.7, alleging that the criminal information package “failed to establish probable cause.” On May 19, 2010, a hearing was held in Superior Court, at the close of which the trial justice denied defendant’s motion to dismiss.1 In due course, a jury-waived trial was held over six days in July and August of 2010. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial', '1.', 'The Testimony of the Complaining Witness', 'Heather King, the complaining witness, testified first at the trial. Ms. King testified that she had dated defendant from “either the end of July, 2007 or very early August, 2007” until 1', 'A more detailed discussion of the contents of the criminal information, the documents attached to it, and the hearing pertaining to the motion to dismiss is provided in Part II.A.1, infra.', '-2- May 3, 2009. She further testified that she began living with defendant in January or February of 2009. According to Ms. King’s testimony, “a couple of days before” March 17, 2009, she and defendant had an argument; she did not recall what that particular argument was about, but she acknowledged that her arguments with defendant were “usually over jealousy or controlling issues.” It was her testimony that, during the course of the March 2009 argument, defendant “punched [her] twice in [her] rib cage.”2 She stated that she heard a “crack” when she was punched in the ribs, and she added that it was confirmed that she had fractured a rib when she eventually had x-rays taken in “early May” of 2009. The March 2009 incident formed the basis of Count Two.', 'Ms. King next testified that, on May 2, 2009, she and defendant attended a charity event in Boston. It was her testimony that, during the drive home to their residence in Newport, they “pulled over” at a location “close to [Boston],” at which time they were arguing; she added that defendant “hit [her] in the head” in the course of their argument. Ms. King stated that the next morning (May 3, 2009), before defendant woke up, she deleted from his phone the name and phone number of a woman with whom defendant had been talking at the charity event which they had attended the night before. It was her testimony that later that morning defendant asked if she had deleted “numbers from [his] phone” and that she replied in the affirmative. She further testified that, later that same day, after taking one of defendant’s sons out for breakfast, she and defendant had a “conversation” about her deletion of the phone number. She stated that “at one point, [she] got upset, [and] walked away and into the bathroom” but that defendant “followed [her] into the bathroom,” “locked” the door, and “cornered” her. It was her testimony that defendant “looked at [her] with these crazy eyes” and proceeded to “hit” her “in the 2', 'Ms. King proceeded in her testimony to provide a very detailed account of the March 2009 argument, which we need not narrate for the purposes of this appeal.', '-3- stomach, the arm, the leg, and then * * * [the] head;” she added that she was hit “five to seven” times and that afterwards she felt as though her head was “going to explode.” It was this second incident which formed the basis of Count One.', 'According to Ms. King’s testimony, after the May 3 assault, she felt lethargic and was just “lying in bed” “all day long;” she added, however, that the May 3 incident prompted her to decide to leave defendant.3 With respect to her injuries, it was her testimony that the symptoms worsened and that, on May 9, 2009, she “woke up, and * * * couldn’t lift [her] head up,” at which time she went to Newport Hospital. She stated that personnel at Newport Hospital indicated that she had a “brain bleed;” she further stated that she was also told by personnel at Newport Hospital that she was “lucky to be alive” since most people with “the size of [her] hematoma * * * die within twenty-four hours of that injury.” Ms. King added that she was told that she would be “rush[ed]” to Rhode Island Hospital. It was her testimony that, at Rhode Island Hospital, she was given the option of going home, which she did, leaving Rhode Island Hospital “late” on May 9, 2009—only to return at 6 a.m. the next morning because she “couldn’t stop throwing up.” At trial, she remembered spending “more than one day” at Rhode Island Hospital before being released to stay with her sister, Stephanie Bacon, in Rutland, Massachusetts.', 'Ms. King testified that her symptoms continued to worsen4 while she was staying with her sister; she stated that she ultimately called her “doctor [in] Rhode Island” and that he said: 3', 'It was Ms. King’s testimony that, with the help of a friend, she found a place to live and that, on May 4, 2009, she moved out of the residence which she had been sharing with defendant. Jennifer Caffrey, Ms. King’s friend, testified at trial and confirmed that she helped Ms. King on May 4, 2009. 4', 'Specifically, Ms. King stated: “[M]y symptoms exacerbated, I was so violently ill, I could not stop throwing up, I couldn’t sit [up], I couldn’t [lie down], I couldn’t do anything.”', '-4- “‘Rush her to [the University of Massachusetts Medical Center] because it’s the only level one trauma near you.’” It was her further testimony that, at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center (U. Mass. Medical) located in Worcester, she was diagnosed with a “[s]ubdural hematoma;” she added that she spent “more than a day” at U. Mass. Medical and thereafter returned to work about one month after she was discharged.5', 'We note that the prosecutor submitted into evidence Ms. King’s medical records (including her records from Newport Hospital, Rhode Island Hospital, and U. Mass. Medical); and defense counsel, rather than simply acquiescing to their admission by remaining silent, specifically stated to the trial justice that he had no objection. We also note that, at trial, the parties stipulated that Ms. King’s subdural hematoma constituted a “serious bodily injury” under § 11-5-2.', '2.', 'The Testimony of Stephanie Bacon', 'Stephanie Bacon, Ms. King’s identical twin sister, testified at trial that she visited Ms. King in the hospital in Newport in May of 2009. In her testimony, Ms. Bacon confirmed that her sister’s symptoms intensified while she was staying with her in Rutland. Specifically, Ms. Bacon testified that Ms. King was “vomiting uncontrollably” and that her head was filled with pressure “which now we know was the blood on the brain.” Her testimony went on to confirm Ms. King’s testimony with respect to being admitted to U. Mass. Medical.', 'During the course of Ms. Bacon’s testimony, the prosecutor asked her: “Did you come to find out what kind of injury [your sister] sustained that she needed treatment at the hospital?” 5', 'Ms. King’s testimony and the testimony of other witnesses at the trial referenced incidences of violence between defendant and Ms. King other than the two for which defendant was charged. For the purposes of this opinion we need not discuss that testimony.', '-5- Ms. Bacon responded: “Yes. She had a brain bleed.” Defense counsel then said: “Objection to the relevance.” The trial justice stated: “It’s all right.”', '3.', 'The Testimony of Det. Christopher Hayes', 'Detective Christopher Hayes of the Newport Police Department testified that on or about May 9, 2009, he learned of an alleged assault on Ms. King; he added that he thereafter drove to Worcester to speak with her while she was at U. Mass. Medical. It was his further testimony that during his visit to U. Mass. Medical he spoke with one of Ms. King’s physicians, who told him that Ms. King had a subdural hematoma and that the possibility of performing surgery on her was being debated. During his testimony, Det. Hayes also indicated that Ms. King named defendant as her assailant.', 'After Det. Hayes had testified that one of Ms. King’s physicians told him she had a subdural hematoma, the following exchange took place:', '“[The State]: Did you, during your investigation, have a chance to', 'inquire as to what injuries she, Ms. King, was diagnosed with', 'when you went to see her?', '“[Detective Hayes]: Yes.', '“[The State]: What injuries?', '“[Detective Hayes]: We were told by her physician –', '“[Defense Counsel]: Objection', '“[The Court]: There is going to be medical evidence, so you may', 'answer, Detective Hayes.” Detective Hayes proceeded to indicate in his testimony that, in addition to the just-referenced statements made to him by Ms. King’s physician with respect to her medical condition, Ms. King herself told him, when he took her statement at U. Mass. Medical, that, in addition to the', '-6- subdural hematoma, she had “sustained some fractured ribs.” The direct examination then proceeded as follows:', '“[The State]: Did she give you a time frame or marker as to when', 'allegedly this occurred?', '“[Defense Counsel]: Objection.', '“[The Court]: On that point, it’s all right. You may answer,', 'Detective.', '“[Detective Hayes]: Within the last several months.', '“[The State]: And did she tell you as to how she sustained those', 'injuries?', '“[Detective Hayes]: Yes.', '“[The State]: Did she tell you who did those injuries to her?', '“[Detective Hayes]: She said Mark had assaulted her.', '“[Defense Counsel]: Same objection, Your Honor.', '“[The Court]: Understood. So noted.”', '4.', 'The Testimony of Defendant', 'The defendant was the final witness to testify. He testified that, at some point in time after about the first eight months of his relationship with Ms. King, she became very “controlling” and “jealous.”', 'He replied in the affirmative when asked if “Ms. King’s jealousy * * * manifest[ed] itself into anything physical against [him].”', 'He proceeded to testify with respect to an incident between Ms. King and him that allegedly took place at some time on the evening of September 11, 2008 or the early morning hours of September 12 of that year (dates which do not relate to Count One or Count Two in the instant case). Defense counsel asked: “Had you observed Ms. King become intoxicated from alcohol before September 12th, 2008?” The prosecutor objected and the trial justice told defense', '-7- counsel that he was asking defendant “for a conclusion” and that he needed to refine his question. After a few more questions were posed, the following exchange took place:', '“[Defense Counsel]: Okay. And after consuming these vodka', 'drinks, could you notice with Heather King, that evening, whether', 'or not she was under the influence from alcohol.', '“[The State]: Objection.', '“[The Court]: It’s the same objection, asking for conclusion. What', 'he observed, please.” Subsequently, defendant testified that, after Ms. King consumed the above-referenced drinks on September 11, 2008, she became “very aggressive,” “very controlling,” and “would easily get mad about little things.”', 'Defense counsel’s questioning eventually moved to the events in March of 2009 that gave rise to the domestic simple assault charge. The defendant testified that he and Ms. King had gone to a “restaurant/bar” across the street from their residence, where Ms. King started arguing with a woman who she believed was “flirting with” defendant. It was defendant’s testimony that he left the restaurant and returned to the residence which he shared with Ms. King. He added that she also came back to the residence about five to ten minutes later and was “yelling, [and] screaming”—only to leave again to return to the previously mentioned bar/restaurant. It was defendant’s further testimony that, another five to ten minutes later, Ms. King once again appeared at their residence. The defendant stated that, at that time, he was in the “spare bedroom” and that he locked the door of that room. According to defendant’s testimony, Ms. King started “yelling, screaming, and ramming the door;” he stated that she rammed the door about ten times before he opened it.6 He added that the next day Ms. King complained that her ribs were hurting. On cross-examination, defendant acknowledged that Ms. 6', 'Ms. King, in her testimony, denied having rammed the door.', '-8- King did not complain of shoulder, elbow, wrist, or arm pain, despite the fact that she had allegedly sustained a fractured rib due to ramming the “spare room” door.', 'Addressing next the events of May 2 and 3, 2009 which gave rise to the felony assault charge, defendant testified that Ms. King had been drinking during the charity event in Boston and became “angry” due to the fact that he talked to two women at the event and exchanged phone numbers with one of them. He testified that, on the drive back to Newport, he and Ms. King stopped at a McDonald’s to get some food and that, during a “struggle over the keys,” Ms. King bit his thumb. The defendant acknowledged that the next day Ms. King complained of a headache. However, he denied ever hitting Ms. King in the bathroom. 7 He stated that he spoke to Ms. King on the phone on the night of May 3, 2009 and that he told her that they should not see each other anymore; he added that Ms. King was “very upset” by what he said.', 'During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked defendant: “And according to your testimony is that [sic] you never laid a hand on Ms. King, right?” The defendant responded to that question in the negative. The prosecutor then asked defendant if he was “not violent,” and he replied that he was not violent. The prosecutor then proceeded to question defendant with respect to an “altercation” that he once had with his former wife. The defendant admitted to the altercation with his former wife. Defense counsel seasonably objected to the questions regarding Mr. Ceppi’s “altercation” with his former wife and made a “general objection” to any questioning related to any incidents of violence between defendant and his former wife, stating that “there’s no [R.I. R. Evid.] 404(b) exception, I believe, that fits into this evidence.” Over defense counsel’s objection, the trial justice permitted questions about the altercation as long as they did not make reference to observations made by Mr. Ceppi’s two children. The prosecutor 7', 'The defendant denied that any physical confrontation had taken place between him and Ms. King on May 3, 2009.', '-9- continued to question defendant regarding any arguments with his former wife which had become physical. In answering those questions, defendant denied kicking or hitting his former wife; he stated: “I never touched her in eighteen years.” On redirect, defendant stated that his former wife was charged with assault and battery against him in connection with an altercation that took place on March 10, 2009.', 'B', 'The Ensuing Verdict and Sentencing', 'On August 5, 2010, the trial justice issued her bench decision; she found Ms. King to be “candid,” “forthright,” and “totally credible.” As a result, she found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on both Count One and Count Two. On March 8, 2011, defendant was sentenced on Count One to ten years with two years to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation. The trial justice also sentenced him to a concurrent term of one year to serve on Count Two. The defendant filed a notice of appeal on the same day. Judgment of conviction was entered on March 29, 2011.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Motion to Dismiss the Criminal Information', '1.', 'The Criminal Information & The Trial Justice’s Denial of Defendant’s Motion to', 'Dismiss', 'The criminal information charged defendant with one count of “assault and battery upon Heather King resulting in serious bodily injury” and one count of assaulting Ms. King.

On October 20, 2009, defendant filed a motion to dismiss Count One in the criminal information; his motion invoked Rule 9.1 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure8 and § 12-12-1.7.9 In that motion, defendant contended that 8', 'Rule 9.1 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:', '“A defendant who has been charged by information may, within', 'thirty (30) days after he or she has been served with a copy of the', 'information, or at such later time as the court may permit, move to', 'dismiss on the ground that the information and exhibits appended', 'thereto do not demonstrate the existence of probable cause to', 'believe that the offense charged has been committed or that the', 'defendant committed it.

In his memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss, defendant argued that the “nature and extent of the injuries specified in the information package [did] not constitute ‘serious bodily injury,’” (which is required under § 11-5-2, the violation of which was alleged in Count One). The defendant’s memorandum stated: “Even if [the court] assumes that Ms. King sustained a subdural hematoma as a result of the alleged May 3, 2009 assault, there is nothing within the witness statements, police reports or medical records to suggest that [that] injury constituted” serious bodily injury. 11 With respect to Count Two, defendant argued that the criminal information package lacked any “reference to an assault taking place on March 17, 2009” or any “eyewitness accounts.”', 'The trial justice conducted a hearing on May 19, 2010, at which the attorneys for both the state and defendant presented arguments; at the end of that hearing, the trial justice rendered a', '“Within thirty (30) days after a defendant is served with a', 'copy of an information charging him or her with an offense, he or', 'she may move in the superior court to dismiss the information on', 'the ground that the information and exhibits appended to it do not', 'demonstrate the existence of probable cause to believe that the', 'offense charged has been committed or that the defendant', 'committed it.” 10', 'Neither party has contested the timeliness vel non of the amended motion to dismiss; and, therefore, we do not address that issue. 11', 'In his memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss the criminal information, defendant specifically referenced the medical records which he contends should have been attached to the information. In that memorandum, he began his discussion of one particular issue with the following introductory clause: “According to the medical records contained in Exhibit 8 * * * .” Thus, it is clear defendant had access to the medical records either when the criminal information was filed or soon thereafter.', '- 12 - decision from the bench denying defendant’s motion. In her thorough decision, the trial justice began by observing that the “threshold to support probable cause is very low” and stating that she must “draw inferences * * * in the light most favorable to the State.” She held, with respect to Count Two, that there was “a substantial credibility issue” because the only account of the alleged assault contained in the criminal information package was from Stephanie Bacon, the sister of the complaining witness. However, according to the trial justice, “it is permissible for an information package to include and to rely upon an assessment of probable cause hearsay information from identified or otherwise reliable sources.” Accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion to dismiss with respect to Count Two.', 'Moving on to Count One, the trial justice, relying on this Court’s opinion in State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558 (R.I. 2009), stated that this Court has held that “factual matters must be imposed [on] a factfinder who is hearing evidence.” She proceeded to deny defendant’s motion to dismiss, ruling as follows:', '“So the [c]ourt feels that because of the dictates of the Supreme', 'Court’s allocation of proof, if you will, and a determination that', 'certain issues must be heard and can only be heard by the', 'factfinder in an evidentiary setting, the [c]ourt is compelled to', 'deny the motion to dismiss for lack of probable cause.”', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice’s decision to deny his motion to dismiss was in error.', '2.', 'Standard of Review', 'When confronted with a motion to dismiss a criminal information, the Superior Court is “‘required to examine the information and any attached exhibits to determine whether the state has satisfied its burden to establish probable cause * * * .’” State v.

Under that standard, “[p]robable cause exists when the facts and circumstances within the police officer’s knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person’s belief that a crime has been committed and that the person to be arrested has committed the crime.” Baillargeron, 58 A.3d at 197-98 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'When reviewing a decision by a trial justice on a motion to dismiss a criminal information, we determine whether the trial justice’s “findings are supported by the evidence or whether, in making those findings, the [trial] justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence.” Martini, 860 A.2d at 691 (internal quotation marks omitted); see State v. Ouimette, 415 A.2d 1052, 1053 (R.I. 1980).

The defendant relies heavily on State v. Aponte, 649 A.2d 219 (R.I. 1994) in support of his contention.', 'In order to properly address defendant’s argument, we deem it necessary to discuss the well-established law in this jurisdiction relative to this Court’s review of a motion to dismiss a grand jury indictment.', 'We have stated that “dismissal of an indictment on review is an extraordinary sanction” and that, therefore, it is “reserved for very limited and extreme circumstances.” State v.

In so holding, we followed a conceptual route that paralleled the one followed by the United States Supreme Court in United States v. Mechanik, 475 U.S. 66, 70 (1986). In that decision the Supreme Court held that a subsequent guilty verdict “means not only that there was probable cause to believe that the defendants were guilty as charged, but also that they are in fact guilty as charged beyond a reasonable doubt” and that, therefore, the guilty verdict rendered “any error in the grand jury proceeding * * * harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id.', 'The state contends that our case law with respect to the dismissal of a grand jury indictment should also be applied to a motion to dismiss a criminal information.', 'In our judgment, the state’s argument in this regard is eminently sensible, and we shall hew to it. If, as is the well-established rule, errors in a grand jury proceeding are rendered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt by a subsequent guilty verdict on the same charge, it follows inexorably that errors in a criminal information should be rendered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt by a subsequent guilty verdict on the same charge. That conclusion seems even more appropriate in light of the fact that a trial justice, ruling on a Rule 9.1 motion to dismiss a criminal information, is performing essentially the same function as a grand jury—namely, assessing whether or not there is probable cause to believe that the defendant committed the crime being charged. We are convinced that, since the same function is being performed in each instance, the same legal principles should be applicable.15 discrimination in the grand jury selection process, require automatic dismissal of an indictment”) (internal quotation marks omitted). 15', 'The defendant suggests that a motion to dismiss a criminal information is more aptly compared to a motion to suppress evidence than to a motion to dismiss a grand jury indictment.', '- 16 -', 'Our conclusion is not altered by the case on which defendant relies so heavily, State v. Aponte, 649 A.2d 219 (R.I. 1994). Contrary to defendant’s contention, Aponte does not stand for the proposition that a defect in a criminal information is not rendered harmless even when there is a subsequent guilty verdict on the same charge following a trial. Id. at 222. In Aponte, the defendant was charged by criminal information with assault with intent to rob and possession of a weapon not a firearm, and eventually he was convicted on both charges after a jury trial. Id. at 221. On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial justice erred by denying his Rule 9.1 motion to dismiss the charge of possession of a weapon not a firearm contained in the criminal information filed against him. Aponte, 649 A.2d at 222. This Court quickly disposed of the defendant’s contention (in a single paragraph) by holding that “[t]he evidence clearly established probable cause.” Id. We made no determination in Aponte as to whether or not this Court’s precedent with respect to a motion to dismiss a grand jury indictment and a subsequent guilty verdict should be applied to a motion to dismiss a criminal information. Id. Consequently, defendant’s reliance on Aponte is unavailing.', 'Accordingly, it is our holding that any deficiency that may have existed in the criminal information package (including a lack of medical records) in this case does not rise to the level of an absence of probable cause and was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt—in light of the fact that, following a trial, defendant was eventually found guilty on both counts charged in the criminal information.16 However, we can perceive no reason why a comparison to a motion to suppress would be the more appropriate analytical approach. 16', 'The defendant also makes a number of arguments with respect to the alleged lack of probable cause to support the criminal information. Given our holding that the guilty verdicts on Count One and Count Two cured any defect in the criminal information package, we need not examine the merits of the Superior Court’s probable cause determination.', '- 17 -', 'B', 'Evidentiary Issues', 'The defendant contends that there were a number of evidentiary rulings that were in error at his trial. It is a general rule that “[w]e will not disturb a trial justice’s evidentiary ruling without first determining that the ruling constitutes a clear abuse of his or her discretion.” State v.

Christopher Hayes', 'The defendant first contends that portions of the testimony of Det. Hayes were both hearsay and impermissible bolstering. Specifically, he argues that it was error on the part of the trial justice not to sustain defense counsel’s objection to the testimony of Det. Hayes with respect to what Ms. King’s physician told him about her condition and with respect to what Ms. King told him about who was responsible for the injuries she sustained as a result of the assault forming the basis of Count Two.17 17', 'We refer the reader to Part I.A.3, supra, for a detailed account of the testimony of Det. Hayes that is being challenged by defendant.', '- 18 -', 'The state counters that, although the statements by Det. Hayes with respect to what he was told by Ms. King and her physician would “appear to constitute hearsay,” their admission was “harmless error at best” because the same information was admitted as a part of Ms. King’s testimony and was contained in her medical records, which were entered as an exhibit at trial. The state also points out that the fact that this was a jury-waived trial “substantially diminished” the risk of unfair prejudice. Moreover, the state argues that the testimony of Det. Hayes was clearly not bolstering because he never testified regarding any determination on his part as to the credibility of either Ms. King or her physician.18', 'We address first the issue of hearsay. It has long been established in this jurisdiction that “the admission of hearsay evidence is not prejudicial when the evidence is merely cumulative and when defendant’s guilt is sufficiently established by proper evidence.” State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1032 (R.I. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); see State v. Micheli, 656 A.2d 980, 982 (R.I. 1995). We have defined “cumulative evidence as evidence that tends to prove the same point to which other evidence has been offered.” State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 622 n. 7 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). When assessing whether or not a piece of evidence is cumulative, “the test is a retrospective one, administered at the close of all the evidence to determine whether the admission of certain evidence was harmless in light of all the evidence admitted on that point.” State v. Robinson, 989 A.2d 965, 979 (R.I. 2010).', 'Our review of the record confirms the state’s contention that, even if the testimony of Det. Hayes was hearsay, it was merely cumulative and therefore harmless. Ms. King herself testified with respect to her injuries that resulted from the incident which formed the basis of 18', 'The state argues that defendant may not raise the bolstering issue on appeal because at trial his objections failed to mention bolstering, and it contends that defendant’s “non-specific” objection was not sufficient to preserve the issue for appeal. We need not even address this issue, given that Det. Hayes’s testimony was so clearly not improper bolstering.', '- 19 - Count Two and with respect to the fact that defendant was the individual who she alleged inflicted those injuries. Moreover, any testimony by Det. Hayes with respect to the statements of Ms. King’s physicians was clearly cumulative since exactly the same information was admitted when Ms. King’s medical records were entered as an exhibit. The state is also correct that any potential prejudice would have been “substantially diminished” by the fact that this was a jury- waived trial. State v. Medeiros, 996 A.2d 115, 121 (R.I. 2010).', 'We next turn to the issue of bolstering. Impermissible bolstering occurs typically “when one witness offers an opinion concerning the truthfulness of the testimony of another witness.” State v. Hazard, 797 A.2d 448, 470 (R.I. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, impermissible bolstering can also occur “[e]ven when a witness does not literally state an opinion concerning the credibility of another witness but his or her testimony would have the same substantive import.” State v. Richardson, 47 A.3d 305, 315 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). We recognize that a police officer’s testimony may be given more credence by some jurors than the testimony of a lay person; however, we are simply unable to detect any reason why the testimony of Det. Hayes in this case could be considered improper bolstering. Detective Hayes merely repeated what was told to him by Ms. King and her physician. He did not make any indication of any kind (even of the most minor variety) with respect to his personal opinion about the veracity of their statements. Thus, we hold that no improper bolstering occurred.', 'Accordingly, defendant’s contentions of error with respect to the testimony of Det. Hayes do not carry the day.', '- 20 -', '2.', 'The Testimony of the Defendant', 'i.', 'Questions Regarding Defendant’s Conduct with his Former Wife', 'The defendant’s next contention is that he was improperly asked a number of questions about an alleged past incident of violence involving his former wife.

The defendant avers that “[t]he prosecutor was in effect accusing [him] of an assault on his former wife, even though the prosecution’s offer of proof included a police report which contained an admission by the defendant’s former wife that she assaulted the defendant.” He posits that the “impermissible implication that [defendant] had engaged in violent conduct with his former wife” was inadmissible under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', 'In accordance with Rule 404(b), any evidence of “other crimes, wrongs, or acts” committed by defendant was not admissible to prove that defendant had a certain character and acted in accordance with his character (i.e., propensity evidence) when allegedly committing the crimes with which he was charged.19 Our thorough review of the record indicates that, even if 19', 'Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence reads, in its entirety, as follows:', '- 23 - the questions with respect to defendant’s former wife were in violation of Rule 404(b), such a violation would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See State v. Clements, 83 A.3d 553, 563 (R.I. 2014) (concluding that, even if there had been a violation of Rule 404(b), it would have been “harmless beyond a reasonable doubt”); see also State v. Bailey, 677 A.2d 407, 411 (R.I. 1996). No documents with respect to any altercation between defendant and his former wife were admitted into evidence; and, in his testimony, defendant repeatedly denied ever kicking or hitting his former wife. Importantly, defendant was also given an opportunity during re-direct examination to testify that it was his then-wife, and not he, who was charged with respect to the alleged violent confrontation at issue. Additionally, as the state points out, this was a jury-waived trial—and the risk of prejudice is significantly reduced in that context. See Medeiros, 996 A.2d at 121. Moreover, the above-quoted comments by the trial justice make it clear that she understood that it was not defendant who had been charged with respect to the incident involving his former wife. Taking all those facts into account, we hold that, even if the questioning with respect to defendant’s former wife and any violent altercations between them had been in violation of Rule 404(b), such error would have been harmless.', 'ii.', 'The Opinion of Defendant as to the Intoxication of the Complaining Witness', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice “erroneously refused to allow him to testify that [Ms. King] was under the influence of alcohol” on direct examination. He refers specifically to questions asked by defense counsel with respect to whether or not defendant had observed Ms.', '“Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts. Evidence of other crimes,', 'wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person', 'in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.

That requirement imposed by the trial justice was consistent with the relevant case law from this Court cited by defendant. See State v. Bruskie, 536 A.2d 522, 524 (R.I. 1988); State v. Fogarty, 433 A.2d 972, 975-76 (R.I. 1981). In our decision in Fogarty, we held that a lay witness may testify with respect to whether or not someone was intoxicated if the witness “had an opportunity to observe the person and [can provide] the concrete details on which the inference or description is founded.” Fogarty, 433 A.2d at 976. The trial justice in the instant case was merely requiring defense counsel to ask about the “concrete details” which formed the basis of his conclusion that Ms. King was intoxicated. Id.; see also State v. Gomes, 604 A.2d 1249, 1258-59 (R.I. 1992) (holding that a portion of a deposition which was not read into evidence at trial due to the fact that the trial justice sustained the prosecutor’s objection to that portion, in which the witness stated that a certain individual 20', 'See Part I.A.4, supra.', '- 25 - was intoxicated, was properly excluded because the witness failed to provide any concrete “details” on which his determination was based).', 'Moreover, defense counsel was permitted to continue asking questions about defendant’s observations of Ms. King’s behavior after she was drinking, and defendant was permitted to testify with respect to Ms. King’s behavior when she had been drinking.

As a result, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in allowing Ms. Bacon to testify regarding her sister’s injury.22 21', 'Defense counsel specifically stated: “Objection to the relevance.” See Part I.A.2, supra, for further details relative to the testimony by the complaining witness’s sister. 22', 'The defendant has raised two additional contentions on appeal.

On February 17, 2014 at 1:24 a.m., the Town of Bristol (the town) police were dispatched to a motor vehicle accident near 85 Broad Common Road. The vehicle—a 2004 Volvo—had veered off the road and severed a telephone pole, then continued until it hit a tree approximately fifteen feet away. A front-seat passenger suffered injuries to his head and legs, while the suspected operator— identified by the passenger as Minior—had a head laceration. Minior was arrested and taken to Rhode Island Hospital on suspicion of driving under the influence, where a blood test revealed a blood-alcohol content of 0.153 mg/dl.', 'That night, Bristol police cited him with the civil violation of reasonable and prudent speeds. He was also issued a summons to appear at an arraignment for a driving under the influence, serious bodily injury resulting charge, to which he entered no plea and was released on bail.', 'The defendant appeared before the Traffic Tribunal to answer his civil violation on April 28, 2014. There, Bristol Officer Kevin Kitchen, who was dispatched to the accident, testified as to his observations at the scene. After Officer Kitchen concluded his testimony, Bristol Officer Timothy Gallison, who was also dispatched to the scene, testified as well. Officer Gallison recalled that upon approaching the vehicle, he witnessed a male sitting in the driver’s seat.', '-2-', 'After both officers testified, defendant’s attorney moved to dismiss the violation. The defendant asserted that, based on a lack of evidence as to both the posted speed limit and defendant’s operation of the vehicle, the town failed to satisfy the requisite clear and convincing standard. Significant to Minior’s argument before us is the magistrate’s admonition to one of the officers that “there was no testimony as to observation of the motor vehicle at the time of the accident, as to who was driving it. You’re indicating and coming to the presumption as to who was operating the vehicle.” In conclusion, the magistrate said “there was no observation of who was operating the vehicle * * *, so the [c]ourt finds that the [t]own has not sustained the violation for reasonable and prudent speed[s].”', 'On December 5, 2014, the state filed a criminal information charging defendant with two driving-related counts: (1) driving under the influence, serious bodily injury resulting; and (2) reckless driving. On August 4, 2015, Minior moved pursuant to Rule 9.1 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure to dismiss the criminal charges, arguing that the Traffic Tribunal’s dismissal collaterally estopped the criminal charges from proceeding. The motion to dismiss was heard by a Superior Court magistrate on September 14, 2015. The Superior Court magistrate granted the motion based primarily on a decision he had rendered in a previous case.', 'Soon after, the state appealed the Superior Court magistrate’s decision per G.L. 1956 § 8- 2-11.1(d) and a Superior Court justice heard the matter on December 15, 2015. The justice reversed the Superior Court magistrate’s decision, emphasizing the distinction between “what the Traffic Tribunal [magistrate] did and [what he] did not do when he rendered his decision.” Continuing, she noted that “a careful review of the transcript” revealed that the Traffic Tribunal magistrate did not make a specific finding about whether defendant was operating the vehicle at the time of the accident. Instead, the Traffic Tribunal magistrate “merely found that the [t]own', '-3- had not sustained the violation,” and did not decide whether defendant was operating the vehicle. “[The Traffic Tribunal magistrate] merely commented on the absence of evidence and found only that the [t]own had not sustained its burden.” The justice ultimately determined that collateral estoppel did not apply, reversed the Superior Court magistrate’s decision, and reinstated the charges.

There, a defendant sought to dismiss a criminal charge of chemical refusal second offense based on collateral estoppel after the Traffic Tribunal had dismissed his civil violation for refusing to submit to a preliminary breath test.

In Gautier, we held that collateral estoppel did not apply to a probation-violation hearing because “further application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel to bar relitigation of a criminal charge, following a determination during a [civil] probation-revocation hearing that is adverse to the state, inequitably overlooks and misconceives the inherent and important differences between those proceedings and criminal trials.” Gautier, 871 A.2d at 358.

Ultimately, we determined that “it is neither the purpose nor the intended function of probation-revocation hearings to ‘serve as a final arbiter of an individual’s guilt or innocence of criminal charges’” and it would therefore be inequitable to estop the state from pursuing a criminal charge based on an unfavorable probation-revocation', '-7- decision.

Though the distinctions are plentiful, perhaps the most persuasive is the overall formality of a Traffic Tribunal proceeding versus a criminal trial.

The defendant argues that our holding in Gautier rested on reasoning that a probation-revocation hearing is less formal than a trial on the merits, whereas a Traffic Tribunal proceeding is formal. We respond that in Gautier, 871 A.2d at 359, we focused not on a superficial distinction between trials and probation- revocation hearings, but instead remained “[m]indful of the critical differences in both the purposes of and procedures employed during probation-revocation hearings and criminal trials.” With an eye to such “critical differences” between criminal trials and Traffic Tribunal proceedings, our reasoning today is in accordance with Gautier. Id.', 'Moreover, the following resonates:', '“‘[T]he government is not statutorily or constitutionally obligated', 'to put forth all its evidence at a probation[-]revocation hearing', '* * *.’ However, application of collateral estoppel to probation-', 'revocation hearings inevitably thwarts this principle of criminal', 'jurisprudence by forcing the state to expedite discovery and', 'present any and all of its evidence and witnesses well in advance of', '-8-', 'trial.

Miller, 797 F.2d 336, 342', '(6th Cir. 1986)) (emphasis added). We believe that the same can be said of the Traffic Tribunal. The present case is an example of a traffic violation that is “only a small part of a larger, ongoing criminal investigation.” Id. To require the state to “complete its entire investigation” before resolving the violation “can effectively hinder its ability to carefully strategize the prosecution of criminal suspects and, consequently, provide for public safety.” Id.

See id.', 'In Pacheco, 161 A.3d at 1176-77, we also acknowledged that various jurisdictions have decided the issue as we do today. For example, in State v. Walker, 768 P.2d 668 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1989), the Court of Appeals in Arizona recognized that “[c]ollateral estoppel effect is generally denied to traffic convictions and minor offenses under accepted common law principles * * *[,] [therefore,] because of the relative insignificance of the charges, [the] defendants have no constitutional right to a jury trial in traffic cases, as they would in a true criminal prosecution, and cannot reasonably be expected to defend with the same vigor.” Id. at 671; cf.

In doing so, the magistrate found as a fact that there was insufficient evidence to prove that defendant had been driving. In my view, it is significant that the state had prior notice of the hearing that was to take place on that charge. 3 It is also significant to me that there was no appeal of the magistrate’s finding that there was insufficient evidence that defendant had been operating a motor vehicle—an essential element of both speeding and driving under the influence, serious bodily injury resulting. I can reach no other conclusion than in privity when ‘there is a commonality of interest between the two entities’ and when they ‘sufficiently represent’ each other’s interests.” (quoting Commercial Union Insurance Co. v.

Indeed, it seems to me to be far more inequitable to require a defendant to defend twice for essentially the same conduct than to apply collateral estoppel to a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. For those reasons, it is my opinion that the state’s opportunity to contest whether defendant was operating the motor vehicle had closed. Because “an issue of ultimate fact”—that is, whether defendant was driving—was “determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated * * *.” State v.

15,State : v. : Tory Lussier. :,reversal,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Tory Lussier, appeals from a judgment of conviction on one count of felony assault following a jury-waived trial in the Superior Court. A group consisting of the defendant, his friends, and his brother—most of whom were off-duty Marines—was involved in a late-night melee with some students from Brown University. After the brawl had subsided and the groups were heading their separate ways, the defendant ripped off his shirt, ran back toward the site of the donnybrook, and landed a punch to the head of Joseph Sharkey. According to the defendant, that punch was in defense of himself and his companions; according to the state, it was an uncalled-for sucker punch. The trial justice agreed with the state’s theory and found the defendant guilty.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The defendant contends that there was sufficient evidence of self-defense to require a finding of not guilty. The defendant further argues that the trial justice overlooked material evidence in', '-1- carrying out his fact-finding function.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant and his friends Joseph Ryan, Joseph Parrish, and Andrew Parrish were all United States Marines who had served in the same unit, and they had been deployed to Afghanistan together. They considered themselves to be brothers, and each knew the importance of always having each other’s back. Unfortunately, during the early morning hours of May 12, 2013, they became brothers in arms in a manner that they did not anticipate.', 'After the four Marines returned from active duty, they made plans to get together and enjoy a night socializing in Providence. The defendant, Ryan, Joseph, Andrew, and defendant’s younger brother, Derek, first convened for dinner. 1 Eventually, they made their way to the East Side of the city, where the comrades spent the remainder of their night drinking at a bar located near Brown University. The defendant estimated that he had consumed at least seven drinks at the bar, and he described himself as having been intoxicated that night. The defendant was known to his friends to sometimes become irritable and angry when he was drinking. Shortly before the 2:00 a.m. closing time, the group left the establishment in search of late-night food. Trouble ensued, however, while they were en route to their vehicles. 1', 'Due to the commonalities of both first and last names in this case, we will refer to the Parrish brothers and defendant’s brother by their first names and Joseph Ryan by his last name. We intend no disrespect to anyone involved.', '-2-', 'As the group walked on Thayer Street, in the vicinity of George Street, they passed by two individuals. The larger of the two, Dillon Ingham, a Brown University football player, somehow insulted Ryan. Joseph intervened, and a fight erupted. Ingham punched Joseph and knocked him out. Either Ingham or his cohort rendered Ryan unconscious as well. Indeed, Ryan suffered a concussion and broken orbital bone, nose, and tooth. 2 Andrew and Derek then jumped into the fray to battle with Ingham.', 'Meanwhile, defendant had engaged in fisticuffs with the other individual who had been standing with Ingham. The defendant, Ryan, and Derek all identified that second individual as Sharkey, a Brown University basketball player who would ultimately become the complaining witness at trial. 3 Soon enough, the melee petered out. Andrew pulled Derek away from Ingham, who raised his hands and began to back away. At that point, the police arrived, and the crowd scattered.', 'The defendant was later seen on surveillance video pulling his shirt off and walking back in the direction of the initial confrontation as the first police cruiser arrived at the scene. By the time the camera panned in that direction, an individual—later identified as Sharkey—could be seen lying motionless on the ground, his body half in the street and half on the sidewalk. Sharkey had been badly injured and he had apparently collapsed and hit his head on the concrete. 2', 'At trial, Ryan was unable to say definitively which of the two had hit him. However, it was Ingham who was charged with felony assault of Ryan and misdemeanor simple assault of Joseph. Ingham’s felony-assault charge was later reduced to a simple assault in exchange for his pleading nolo contendere to both misdemeanor counts. He received one year of probation. 3', 'As a result of the injuries that he suffered, Sharkey could not remember what transpired that night. He did, however, testify that he and Ingham were “acquaintances” who were in the same fraternity. Sharkey explained that, because “Brown doesn’t recognize Greek life,” “[i]t’s not really a fraternity, just a house where everybody lives.” Theirs was a dorm that housed football and basketball players, but, according to Sharkey, he and Ingham were not all that close and did not hang out socially. In fact, Sharkey did not know Ingham’s actual first name, but only his nickname, until after the unfortunate events that precipitated this trial.', '-3- To save his life, it was necessary to remove a portion of his skull to stop his brain from swelling. 4 In fact, Sharkey’s injuries were so severe that Providence police initially treated the case as a homicide investigation.', 'Numerous witnesses testified to what had transpired in the seconds between the time that defendant was seen heading back toward the scene of the initial confrontation and the time that Sharkey was grievously injured. Katherine Mahoney said that she had been out with Sharkey that night; they were merely friends at the time, although the relationship did ripen into romance at a later time. Mahoney explained that she and Sharkey had just left an on-campus bar and that they were walking on Thayer Street when they saw a commotion. According to Mahoney, Sharkey then walked over to the “late night brawl” while she remained on the sidewalk. She testified that she was watching him the whole time and that she did not see him throw any punches or touch anyone whatsoever. Sharkey was in the middle of the fighting for ten seconds at most, Mahoney said, before she called for him to get out of there and, whether her entreaty was the reason or not, he did so. Mahoney said that, less than a minute later, she and Sharkey were talking on the sidewalk approximately thirty feet away from where the fighting had taken place. Mahoney testified that Sharkey had his back turned to the fight and that defendant ran toward them from that direction. It was then that Mahoney saw defendant punch Sharkey in the side of his face from behind, and she watched as Sharkey “fell and smashed his head on the concrete.” The defendant ran away, leaving Mahoney with the unresponsive and bleeding Sharkey. The police arrived within seconds.', 'Wooyoung Moon, a student at Brown University, also testified to what he witnessed. Moon said that he had been out with some friends that night and that he was sober. He related 4', 'Sharkey testified that, ever since his injury, he has been prone to seizures.', '-4- that he was walking on Thayer Street when he heard a commotion. Moon testified that he looked up and saw a brawl going on, although it appeared to him to be “a gang of people ganging up on this one guy and punching him.” Moon said that he watched the fight for ten to twenty seconds and that he was about fifteen to twenty yards away from it. He then looked down at his phone, struggling to find the phone number for the Brown University police, and by the time he looked back up, the fight had settled down. He said that there was still some jawing going on, but no punches were being thrown. Moon then watched as defendant walked along Thayer Street, and Moon presumed he was going to his car. Moon also saw “this guy and this girl standing * * * on the sidewalk north of this clump of people.” Moon testified that he thought defendant would simply walk past the couple, but instead defendant suddenly punched the man. As the man fell to the ground, Moon heard defendant yelling expletives at the man while the woman screamed for defendant to stop. The defendant then continued walking on Thayer Street, but when the police arrived just seconds later, Moon testified that defendant ran right past him and ducked down a side street.', 'When defendant testified, he painted quite a different picture. The defendant said that Sharkey was with Ingham, that it was they who had initiated the scuffle, and that he saw Sharkey kicking Ryan. At that time, defendant testified, he jumped into the ruckus and he and Sharkey actually exchanged blows for about twenty seconds.', 'After Sharkey landed a punch to defendant’s face, defendant said that he put Sharkey in a headlock until a woman came along and pulled Sharkey out of the brawl by his belt. Meanwhile, Derek was still engaged with Ingham farther down Thayer Street, so defendant ran to his brother’s aid. He said that that was when the surveillance video captured Ingham backing away from the group of Marines with his hands raised, seemingly in a gesture of surrender. The defendant testified that he then saw Sharkey', '-5- walking in his direction and “[f]ully looking” at him, and defendant “felt like it was him or me that was going to be hit * * *.” And, defendant said, if it was not him who Sharkey was going to assault, it would have been one of his fellow Marines or his brother. The defendant said that he punched Sharkey but once. The defendant testified that it was simply a “reaction[,]” that he “felt like it was fight or flight * * *.”', 'The trial justice did not see it that way. The trial justice found Moon to be the most credible witness because he was the only person testifying who was completely disinterested and because he had not been drinking that night. The trial justice also held that the testimony of Moon and Mahoney and the events depicted in the surveillance video were corroborative of each other. The trial justice did not find any credible evidence that supported defendant’s story, and he determined that the initial confrontation had concluded before defendant punched Sharkey. Based on those findings, the trial justice said that he was “constrained to conclude that this was not a case of self-defense or defense of others, rather it was an act of retribution to even the score for what happened earlier to [defendant’s] friends at the hands of the other Brown University student, Dillon Ingham.” Therefore, the trial justice found defendant guilty of felony assault. 5 5', 'At the time the criminal information was filed in this case, G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 defined felony assault as follows:', '“(a) Every person who shall make an assault or battery, or both,', 'with a dangerous weapon, or with acid or other dangerous', 'substance, or by fire, or an assault or battery which results in', 'serious bodily injury, shall be punished by imprisonment for not', 'more than twenty (20) years.', '“* * *', '“(c) ‘Serious bodily injury’ means physical injury that:', '“(1) Creates a substantial risk of death;', '“(2) Causes protracted loss or impairment of the function of any', 'bodily part, member or organ; or', '-6- The trial justice sentenced defendant to seven years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, all suspended with probation; 1,000 hours of community service; weekly counseling for two years for treatment for his anger issues, PTSD-related symptoms, and alcohol abuse; and weekly random substance abuse screenings.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“In a jury-waived criminal proceeding, this Court gives deference to a trial justice’s finding[s] of fact[]” and determinations of credibility.

The defendant contends that, because the trial justice did not recite or summarize Andrew’s testimony when delivering his bench decision, he must have overlooked it, and, according to defendant, consideration of that testimony would have swung the weight of the evidence back in his direction. In our opinion, that argument misses the mark.', 'It is significant that, as he rendered his decision, the trial justice explained:', '“I have reviewed all of the witnesses who testified in this case, but', 'the most relevant and most significant testimony which I have just', 'placed on the record is from those witnesses that I’ve just recited', 'testimony from.

We do not agree. Simply because the trial justice did not go through each painstaking detail of every witness’s testimony, it cannot be concluded that he did not consider it.

See Forand, 958 A.2d at 138. The trial justice had ample evidence before him to support both the state’s theory of the case as well as defendant’s. The trial justice discussed and analyzed both theories, and he made factual findings and credibility assessments that led him to side with the state in concluding that defendant had not assaulted Sharkey in an effort to defend himself, his friends, or his brother. Moreover, even if we were to disagree with that outcome, we are not in the business of replacing the trial justice’s view of the evidence with our own. See Van Dongen, 132 A.3d at 1079.', 'It seems to us that the defendant’s twofold argument—that the evidence of self-defense negated a guilty finding, and that the trial justice overlooked evidence in finding defendant guilty—is nothing more than a manifestation of the defendant’s disagreement with the findings of fact and determinations of credibility that the trial justice did place on the record. That, certainly, “is a most difficult hurdle to overcome in a jury-waived trial.” Van Dongen, 132 A.3d at 1079. It was the defendant’s considered decision to waive his right to a trial by jury and put his fate in the hands of a seasoned justice of the Superior Court, who, it turned out, did not see things the way the defendant would have wished.

We affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In the early morning hours of May 19, 2013, a violent home invasion occurred at 112 Dawson Street in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. According to the description related by the', '-1- complainant, Jeffrey Lebrun (Jeffrey),1 to the responding officers of the Pawtucket Police Department,2 the invasion was perpetrated by two males, dressed in black and wearing ski masks. Armed with a knife, the shorter of the two perpetrators grabbed Jeffrey’s neck from behind while he was sitting on his couch and began choking him. As Jeffrey struggled with his attacker for possession of the knife, the second assailant, whom Jeffrey later described as approximately five-feet-eight inches to five-feet-ten inches in height, pushed Jeffrey’s head down on the couch. During this struggle, Jeffrey called out to awaken his wife, Sheri, for help. Sheri got out of bed and ran down the stairs in time to see Jeffrey struggling with one of the intruders.3 Sheri then called 911, and the assailants fled.4', 'Shortly after Sheri’s 911 call, then-Pawtucket Police Patrolman (now Sergeant) Eric Bucka (Sgt. Bucka) received a radio description of the suspects, indicating that the perpetrators were “two males dressed in all black, with masks, black sweatshirts, black pants, black shoes.” Approximately one block from the crime scene, Sgt. Bucka encountered Gibson, who was wearing black sneakers, black pants, and a white shirt, but no sweatshirt. In response to Sgt. Bucka’s questioning, Gibson stated that he was coming from his girlfriend’s house in Attleboro, Massachusetts. After a few minutes, Sgt. Bucka and Gibson parted ways. 1', 'To distinguish Jeffrey Lebrun from his wife, we refer to the Lebruns by their first names. 2', 'By the time of defendant’s probation violation hearing, Jeffrey Lebrun had died. 3', 'Sheri testified that, unlike Jeffrey, she saw only one intruder. 4', 'A recording of Sheri’s 911 call was played for the trial justice, and both that recording and a transcript of it were admitted as full exhibits at Gibson’s probation violation hearing. However, after the hearing, the exhibits were permanently withdrawn for use at future proceedings. Consequently, the record before this Court contains neither the recording of the 911 call nor the transcript of that recording.', '-2-', 'In the aftermath of the tumultuous events at the Lebrun residence, several items attributable to the perpetrators were uncovered at the scene and in the surrounding neighborhood. Police obtained latex gloves outside of the home at 112 Dawson Street, and a backpack containing various break-in tools was found inside the dwelling. Additionally, police found the knife wielded by one of the assailants inside the home. Later that morning, Patrolman Carl Barovier (Ptlm. Barovier) was summoned to a home one and a half blocks away from the crime scene at 90 County Street, the same street on which Sgt. Bucka had stopped Gibson earlier that morning. When Ptlm. Barovier arrived, the residents informed him that, when they awoke that morning, a black sweatshirt was discovered on their lawn, inside their six-foot stockade fence. The sweatshirt was tossed back over the fence by the homeowners and was situated between the road and the fence at 90 County Street. Patrolman Barovier placed the sweatshirt into an evidence bag and returned to 112 Dawson Street to show it to the Lebruns. Both Jeffrey and Sheri confirmed that the black sweatshirt looked like the sweatshirt that one of the intruders was wearing.', 'All the evidence recovered by the Pawtucket Police investigators was sent to the Rhode Island Department of Health (DOH) for DNA testing.5 Tamara Wong (Wong), a forensic biologist employed by the DOH and an expert in DNA testing, explained the results of the DNA 5', 'The road to DNA testing of this evidence was a somewhat winding one. Shortly after the break-in in May 2013, the gloves found outside 112 Dawson Street were sent to the DOH. In July 2013, Jeffrey was murdered in his home, and, in August 2013, Pawtucket Police Detective Charles Devine (Det. Devine) was assigned to investigate both the murder and the home invasion. In connection with the investigation, Det. Devine ordered the transfer of the remaining items of evidence from the home invasion—the black sweatshirt, the knife, and the break-in tools from the backpack found at the crime scene—to the DOH. After Det. Devine learned that DNA extracted from the collar of the sweatshirt matched the DNA profile of a convicted offender named Juan A. Gibson from a DNA indexing system known as CODIS (Combined DNA Index System), he apprehended Gibson. A buccal swab was then taken from Gibson and transferred to the DOH for comparison analysis.', '-3- testing of this evidence. Wong testified that a saliva stain on the right shoulder of the black sweatshirt matched Jeffrey’s DNA profile. Additionally, DNA was extracted from the collar of the sweatshirt, and this extracted DNA matched Gibson’s DNA profile.6 Wong also testified that she examined other items found at the scene—the glove and a piece of cord or clothesline found in the backpack—and that the DNA profiles were consistent with Gibson’s DNA profile; she elaborated that twenty-one of the twenty-three loci in the profile found on both the glove and the piece of cord or clothesline matched Gibson’s DNA profile. During questioning from Det. Devine following Gibson’s apprehension in March 2014, Gibson told Det. Devine that, on the night of the home invasion, his car broke down while he was coming back from North Attleborough,7 he was walking home, and he had to call AAA to take care of the car.', 'Gibson was serving suspended sentences for three separate drug convictions and was on probation as a result. First, in 2005, Gibson entered a plea of nolo contendere to possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver and was sentenced to ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), two years to serve and the remaining eight years suspended, with probation.8 Second, in 2010, Gibson entered a plea of nolo contendere to possession of cocaine and possession of marijuana, and he was sentenced to six years at the ACI, one year to serve and 6', 'Wong testified that there is a mere one-in-fifty-six-trillion chance that the DNA from the sweatshirt collar does not belong to Gibson. On cross-examination, Wong testified that the DNA extracted from the sweatshirt collar was so-called “touch DNA,” which consists of “anything that comes in contact with skin or epithelial cells that can be shedded.” Wong acknowledged that the presence of Gibson’s touch DNA on the sweatshirt collar did not necessarily mean that he ever wore the sweatshirt; if he simply touched the collar, his touch DNA could have transferred to the collar. 7', 'Although Det. Devine remembers Gibson saying that he was coming back from North Attleborough, he acknowledged that Gibson could have said Attleboro instead. 8', 'Gibson had previously been adjudicated a probation violator on this sentence; at the time of the probation violation hearing in this case, eighty-two months remained on the 2005 sentence.', '-4- five years suspended, with probation. Finally, in 2012, Gibson entered a plea of nolo contendere to possession of an enumerated quantity of cocaine and was sentenced to nine years at the ACI, eighteen months to serve and ninety months suspended, with probation. Accordingly, on March 27, 2014, the state filed, pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, notices of probation violation in each of these three cases. At the probation violation hearing, in addition to the evidence recounted above, Sheri testified that she knew Gibson through a friendship with his wife and that, although Gibson had been to the back porch of the Lebrun home at 112 Dawson Street, he had never been inside the residence.', 'After considering the evidence, the trial justice was “more than reasonably satisfied” that Gibson violated the terms and conditions of his probation. The trial justice found that two aspects of the black sweatshirt that police had recovered—and that Sheri and Jeffrey identified as similar to the sweatshirts worn by the perpetrators—were indicative of defendant’s involvement in the break-in: (1) the discovery of the sweatshirt close to the crime scene, evidently discarded over a fence by one of the perpetrators; and (2) the fact that both Gibson’s and Jeffrey’s DNA were found on the sweatshirt. The trial justice was also “trouble[d]” that Gibson “told [Sgt.] Bucka one story and [Det.] Devine a different one.” He reasoned that, if Gibson’s car had broken down and he was waiting for AAA to assist him, then it was “odd” that he had not relayed these important facts to Sgt. Bucka. Although acknowledging Sheri’s testimony that she saw only one intruder, the trial justice found that there were two intruders. He noted that Sheri’s “911 recording makes it quite clear that she is speaking of two assailants.” Additionally, the trial justice did not deem the discrepancy between Gibson’s height—somewhere between six-feet-one and six-feet-two—and Jeffrey’s estimation of the height of the taller intruder—approximately five-feet-eight to five-feet-ten—to be significant. He noted the approximate nature of Jeffrey’s', '-5- estimation and reasoned that gauging an individual’s height while simultaneously fending off armed home invaders is a difficult task.', 'The trial justice (1) ordered that the eighty-two months that remained on the suspended sentence imposed in 2005 be served at the ACI; (2) removed the five years remaining on the suspended sentence imposed in 2010 and ordered that Gibson serve that time at the ACI, concurrent with the time to be served on the 2005 sentence; and (3) ordered that the ninety- month suspended sentence imposed in 2012 be continued, with the same conditions and terms. Gibson timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'A probation violation hearing has a singular focus: determining whether the conditions of probation—namely, “[k]eeping the peace and remaining on good behavior—have been violated.” State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 499 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d 45, 48 (R.I. 2012)). Unlike the burden of proof at a criminal trial, the state’s burden in the probation violation context is far less exacting; the state need only “prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the [trial] justice that the defendant has violated the terms and conditions of the previously imposed probation.”9 Id. (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48). We review a trial justice’s adjudication of probation violation deferentially, reversing only where the trial justice “acted arbitrarily or capriciously in finding a violation.” Id. (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48). Challenges to a trial justice’s credibility determinations typically are unavailing in this Court because the assessment of witness credibility “in a probation violation hearing is a function of the [trial] justice, not this Court.” Id. (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 49). 9', 'Consistent with the sole purpose of a probation violation hearing, the reasonable-satisfaction standard is employed to determine only whether the terms and conditions of probation were violated, not whether defendant is guilty of the offenses that form the basis of the violation allegation. See State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 499 (R.I. 2013).', '-6-', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, Gibson offers several reasons why, in his view, the trial justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding him to be a probation violator. None is persuasive. First, Gibson argues that the trial justice erroneously credited Jeffrey’s statements that there were two perpetrators over Sheri’s testimony that she saw only one. We discern no error in this regard. Jeffrey struggled with the two intruders from the outset of the home invasion, while Sheri witnessed the break-in only after Jeffrey awakened her with his calls for help. By the time Sheri arrived downstairs, one of the perpetrators may have fled, as did the assailant Sheri saw soon after she came downstairs. Additionally, in his decision, the trial justice did address Sheri’s testimony that she saw only one intruder, but he noted that she referred to two perpetrators in her 911 call. Because the trial justice considered all of the evidence, accepted Jeffrey’s version for plausible reasons, and rationally rejected the inference that Gibson sought to draw from Sheri’s testimony that she saw only one intruder, he did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding that there were two intruders. See Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 49.', 'Gibson next claims that, because he is at least four inches taller than the taller of the two intruders that Jeffrey identified, he could not have been involved in the break-in. The trial justice considered this argument and rejected it because of the approximate nature of Jeffrey’s height estimation and the difficulty in accurately pinpointing a person’s height in the midst of a frantic struggle. We are satisfied that discounting the significance of the height discrepancy for the reasons articulated by the trial justice does not lead to an arbitrary or capricious conclusion.', 'Gibson also faults the trial justice for placing too much reliance on the DNA evidence found on the black sweatshirt and on Gibson’s statements to Sgt. Bucka and Det. Devine; he contends that this evidence, although incriminating at first blush, does not establish that Gibson', '-7- was one of the intruders. With respect to the DNA found on the sweatshirt, Gibson argues that the touch DNA “might * * * have been transferred to the sweatshirt unremarkably, and innocently, in any number of different exchanges” between Gibson and Jeffrey prior to the night of the home invasion.', 'Finally, with respect to his statements, Gibson contends that the statements he gave to Sgt. Bucka and Det. Devine were not inconsistent: he was walking home from his girlfriend’s house in Attleboro, as he told Sgt. Bucka, because his car broke down on his way home, as he told Det. Devine. These contentions are unavailing. The weight of the evidence in a probation hearing rests with the trial justice.', 'Gibson was found approximately one block from the crime scene shortly after the police were called, and he was wearing black pants and black sneakers and no jacket or outerwear. However, a black sweatshirt—matching the description of the clothing worn by the suspects— was found within the same proximity of the crime scene, apparently thrown over a fence on the night of the break-in. That sweatshirt, which matched the sweatshirts worn by the perpetrators, contained Gibson’s DNA on the collar and Jeffrey’s DNA on the right shoulder. Although it is possible that there is an unremarkable and innocent explanation for how this evidence— containing both Gibson’s and the victim’s DNA—wound up behind a stockade fence near the crime scene, the trial justice properly rejected that speculation. He was not required to turn a blind eye to the highly probative and incriminating nature of this evidence. His conclusion that this evidence pointed towards Gibson’s involvement in the home invasion was neither arbitrary nor capricious. See State v. McLaughlin, 935 A.2d 938, 942 (R.I. 2007) (“The hearing justice can draw reasonable inferences from the evidence presented to determine whether the defendant violated the terms of his probation.” (quoting State v. Seamans, 935 A.2d 618, 621-22 (R.I. 2007))).', '-8-', 'The same can be said for the discrepancy between Gibson’s statements to the investigating officers. He told Det. Devine that his car broke down and that he needed to call AAA. The trial justice found it “odd” that, if car failure was the true reason for Gibson’s presence in the vicinity of the crime scene in the early morning hours of May 19, 2013, Gibson did not report his car troubles to Sgt. Bucka. Although one could reconcile Gibson’s statements to Sgt. Bucka and Det. Devine, the trial justice’s conclusion that Gibson told different stories to the two officers is reasonable. See McLaughlin, 935 A.2d at 942.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not act arbitrarily or capriciously in finding that the defendant violated the terms of his probation.

17,State : v. : James Oliveira. :,reversal,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Court on October 3, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'The defendant, James Oliveira, appeals from a Superior Court order that denied his motion to reduce a sentence, filed in accordance with Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. After a thorough review of the record and consideration of the parties’ arguments, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court denying defendant’s motion to reduce sentence.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of the underlying case are set forth in detail in State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299 (R.I. 2008) (Oliveira I), and State v. Oliveira, 127 A.3d 65 (R.I. 2015) (Oliveira II). Accordingly, the Court recites only those facts relevant to this appeal.', 'On October 29, 2004, a grand jury indicted defendant on two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1, for sexually assaulting his six-', '-1- year-old grandson by anal penetration. On September 19, 2006, a Superior Court jury convicted defendant on one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault and acquitted defendant on the second count. The trial justice sentenced defendant to sixty years’ imprisonment, with forty years to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation. This conviction was vacated on appeal, and the case was remanded for a new trial. Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 319. At a second trial, before a different trial justice, defendant again was convicted on one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and this Court affirmed the conviction. Oliveira II, 127 A.3d at 85.1', 'Subsequently, defendant filed a Rule 35 motion to reduce the sentence, on the ground that the life sentence imposed after the second trial was unconstitutional. The defendant argued that it was improper for a second trial justice to depart from the original forty-year term to serve due to defendant’s disciplinary record at the Adult Correctional Institutions. The defendant also argued that the trial justice erred because, while he commented upon defendant’s disciplinary record, the trial justice failed to make clear “that [the record] was the reason why he imposed a life sentence.” The state disagreed, and argued in opposition to the motion to reduce that there was ample evidence in the record to support the trial justice’s sentencing decision, including conduct by defendant that occurred after the first conviction was vacated.', 'In denying defendant’s Rule 35 motion, the trial justice acknowledged that, although he “could have been more explicit in using * * * direct language” when departing from defendant’s first sentence and imposing a life sentence following his second conviction, this omission was 1', 'This is not defendant’s first conviction. In State v. Oliveira, 576 A.2d 111 (R.I. 1990), defendant’s convictions for first-degree and second-degree child molestation sexual assault in 1988 were vacated, and defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to two counts of second- degree child molestation sexual assault. He was sentenced to two eight-year sentences, to run concurrently, with two years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation.', '-2- not fatal to his sentencing decision.', 'The trial justice found that the fourteen disciplinary infractions that defendant had committed between defendant’s first conviction and his second trial were “very disturbing” because every infraction “fell into the moderate to high category of disciplinary violations according to the Department of Corrections Code of Conduct.” The trial justice also explained that, during the sentencing hearing, he had “clearly characterized that collection of infractions as demonstrating * * * that this defendant, in the [c]ourt’s view, was antisocial, disrespectful of authority, rules, and boundaries.” Finally, the trial justice recounted his sentencing remarks about the impact this crime has had on the young complainant’s life. The defendant’s grandson was six years of age at the time of the offense.', 'The defendant timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'A motion to reduce a sentence under Rule 35 “is essentially a plea for leniency[.]” State v. Rivera, 64 A.3d 742, 745 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1253 (R.I. 2010)). “The motion is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice, who may grant it if he or she decides on reflection or on the basis of changed circumstances that the sentence originally imposed was, for any reason, unduly severe.” State v. Mlyniec, 78 A.3d 769, 771 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Mendoza, 958 A.2d 1159, 1161 (R.I. 2008)). We have a “strong policy against interfering with a trial justice’s discretion in sentencing matters,” and thus “our review of a trial justice’s ruling on a Rule 35 motion is extremely limited.” Rivera, 64 A.3d at 745 (quoting State v. Snell, 11 A.3d 97, 101 (R.I. 2011)). Accordingly, we will interfere with that discretion only in “rare instances when the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” Id. (quoting Snell, 11 A.3d at 101).', '-3-', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, defendant contends, as he did below, that the trial justice abused his discretion by imposing a sentence significantly longer than the sentence imposed after defendant’s first conviction. Specifically, defendant claims that, when the trial justice departed from the first sentence after retrial, imposing a sentence of life imprisonment, he violated defendant’s right to due process because the court essentially punished defendant for successfully appealing his first conviction. This argument is without merit.', 'It is well established that “a corollary of the power to retry a defendant is the power, upon the defendant’s reconviction, to impose whatever sentence may be legally authorized, whether or not it is greater than the sentence imposed after the first conviction.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 720 (1969); see State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1118 (R.I. 1992) (“Reversal of the original conviction nullifies the previous sentence, thereby clearing the slate for the imposition of a completely new sentence.”). This is because, by vacating the first conviction, the sentence that was imposed is also vacated, thus allowing for the imposition of a completely new sentence following a new conviction. State v. Simpson, 520 A.2d 1281, 1285 (R.I. 1987) (citing Pearce, 395 U.S. at 721). The trial justice on retrial may depart from the original sentence and impose a harsher sentence based on “events subsequent to the first trial that may have thrown new light upon the defendant’s life, health, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities.” Id. (quoting Pearce, 395 U.S. at 723); see also Mattatall, 603 A.2d at 1118-19.', 'We hasten to add, however, that the United States Supreme Court has declared that “[d]ue process of law * * * requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.” Pearce, 395 U.S. at 725. The record in the case at bar discloses that defendant', '-4- conceded that there was no vindictiveness by the trial justice when he imposed the life sentence after the second trial. Indeed, there is no evidence of vengeful or spiteful sentencing on the part of the second trial justice when he departed from the first sentence. Rather, the second trial justice affirmatively placed his reasons for imposing the longer sentence on the record. Furthermore, in the context of the second trial, which, again, was presided over by a different trial justice than the first trial, any suggestion of vindictiveness based on the successful appeal of the first conviction would be entirely speculative. See Texas v. McCullough, 475 U.S. 134, 139 (1986) (explaining that the possibility of vindictiveness is speculative where the second sentence is imposed by a different trial justice who has “no motivation to engage in self-vindication” (quoting Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, 27 (1973))). We therefore are satisfied that the sentence imposed by the trial justice in this case was not motivated by vindictiveness.', 'A thorough examination of the record also reveals that the trial justice gave ample consideration to events that occurred after the first trial that shed light upon defendant’s “life, health, habits, conduct, and mental and moral propensities.” Pearce, 395 U.S. at 723 (quoting Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 245 (1949)).', 'Specifically, at the February 6, 2013 sentencing hearing, the trial justice cited fourteen separate instances of misconduct by defendant at the ACI and in the Superior Court cellblock. Before he imposed the sentence, the trial justice concluded that “defendant’s conduct while housed at the ACI demonstrates that he is antisocial and disrespectful of authority, rules, and boundaries”; the trial justice proceeded to delve into a description of each infraction, noting that all fourteen fell into the “moderate to high” category as to the seriousness of disciplinary violations.', 'Accordingly, after due consideration of all the Pearce factors, we are of the opinion that the trial justice properly decided to impose the maximum sentence permitted under the statute in', '-5- this case.2 The defendant has failed to demonstrate that the trial justice imposed the sentence without justification, or that the sentence was “grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” Snell, 11 A.3d at 101 (quoting State v. Coleman, 984 A.2d 650, 654 (R.I. 2009)). We hold that the trial justice was “well within his discretion to give and then confirm the instant punishment for [defendant.]” Id. at 102.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.

At the time, twenty- four-year-old Jonathan worked part-time as security at a hospital, attended school for HVAC technician training, and was a member of the Army National Guard. When the group of friends left for Newport at around 8 a.m., Jonathan had just ended a shift at the hospital, which had started at midnight.', 'The group arrived in Newport around 11 a.m. and went to lunch at a local restaurant. After lunch, the group split up; the women went shopping, and the men went to an Irish pub a couple of blocks away. A few hours later, the group convened again and decided to drive to a nearby beach. Amanda drove Jonathan and three other friends. On the way, Jonathan and Amanda quarreled. Jonathan testified that, when the car stopped at a red light, he “exited the vehicle to cool down.” Not familiar with the area, he started walking “aimlessly” because he did not know where he was and then stopped at a liquor store and bought a beer and a “nip” of alcohol.', 'Around 3 p.m., Jonathan sat down to cool off in a park. Jonathan testified that families and dogs were running around in the park and people were playing tennis at courts nearby. He drank the nip and the beer, which brought his total alcohol consumption that day to approximately six drinks. Tired from his late-night hospital security shift, Jonathan pulled his hat over his head and fell asleep under a tree. 1', 'We will refer to the complaining witness and his girlfriend by their first names to protect their privacy; no disrespect is intended.', '-2-', 'When Jonathan woke up, it was nighttime.

As he shoved defendant, Jonathan saw that defendant had been touching his genitals, with his hands in his own pants, while fondling Jonathan.2 Jonathan testified that defendant began to run away from him, towards the tennis courts. Jonathan tackled defendant to the ground, punched him in the head several times, and yelled, “Call the cops.” Jonathan testified that defendant was trying to talk to him, telling Jonathan that he was just trying to wake him up. Two people playing tennis at the nearby court heard Jonathan and called the police.', 'A few minutes later, the police arrived, one of whom was Russell Carlone, who was at that time a captain with the Newport Police Department.3 Jonathan told the police officers what had happened at the park, and he was brought to the police station to write a witness statement. Carlone testified that, when he and a fellow police officer first arrived at the scene, he initially heard yelling, and then as he got closer, he observed a younger man holding down an older man. As the officers approached the two men, Carlone testified, the younger man was “very, very upset” and was “crying and screaming[.]” Carlone and the other officer separated the two men. Carlone spoke with Jonathan. Carlone testified that Jonathan said repeatedly, “He touched me.” 2', 'The transcript indicates that Jonathan testified that defendant had his “hands” down Jonathan’s shorts, and also that defendant had his “hands” down his own pants. No explanation for the use of the plural is given. 3', 'Although he was still on the job at the time of defendant’s arrest, Carlone was retired from the police department when he testified at trial.', '-3- When Carlone asked Jonathan what happened, Jonathan said he was sleeping in the park and woke up to defendant “on top of him” with “his hand down his pants” and said continually, “Oh yeah, mother[fucker].”', 'Carlone also questioned defendant at the scene. From that conversation, Carlone learned that defendant had seen a person lying down in the park, left his car to check on the person, tried giving the person verbal commands, and when that was unsuccessful, tried to wake the person by shaking him. The defendant also told Carlone that, when Jonathan woke up, Jonathan attacked defendant, placed him in a headlock, and pinned him to the ground. The defendant, in his conversation with Carlone, denied touching Jonathan inappropriately or putting his hands down Jonathan’s pants. After speaking to defendant, Carlone asked Jonathan to tell his story once again. Carlone testified that Jonathan’s second telling was consistent with the first. Carlone testified that, although Jonathan was emotional the entire time they were speaking, Carlone was able to understand his story.', 'After a two-day trial, the jury found defendant guilty on the single count charged: second-degree sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4. On January 18, 2017, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. On April 6, 2017, the trial justice sentenced defendant to ten years, suspended, with probation, and ordered defendant to register as a sex offender and receive appropriate counseling.

The defendant argues that the nature of his objection was clear from the context because he objected at the precise moment that bolstering or vouching occurred.', 'After reviewing the record, however, we are of the opinion that the basis for defendant’s objection was not clear from the context of the state’s questioning. Merely objecting at the precise point of testimony at which the alleged impermissible bolstering or vouching occurred— without more—does not sufficiently alert a trial justice to a potentially prejudicial evidentiary issue. See Pona, 66 A.3d at 469; but cf. State v. Offley, 131 A.3d 663, 670 (R.I. 2016) (finding counsel’s repeated attempts to explain his objection’s rationale, despite never actually articulating them, to be sufficiently focused in context of that case to preserve evidentiary objections for review).', 'Here, defendant objected after Carlone had responded, “it was my judgment that he had just woken up from a deep sleep and been assaulted[,]” to the state’s unrelated question, “Did you detect anything on him with regard to alcohol?” Significantly, following his objection, defendant did not move to strike Carlone’s answer or pass the case. If a general objection at a precise moment were sufficient to constitute a “specific objection,” a trial justice would be required to divine the reason for the objection, essentially reading the mind of the objecting counsel. Also, if every well-timed “Objection” could be considered as a specific objection, the', '-7- specificity requirement would be rendered meaningless. We therefore conclude that defendant’s mere “Objection,” without providing any detail as to its basis, did not suffice to preserve the issue of the admissibility of Carlone’s testimony for our substantive review.', 'Even if the issue had been properly preserved, however, we would conclude that the admission of Carlone’s testimony did not constitute prejudicial error.', 'As noted above, to successfully challenge a trial justice’s admission of evidence as impermissibly bolstering or vouching, a party must demonstrate not only that such bolstering or vouching actually occurred, but also that it “constituted prejudicial error with respect to the defendant.” State v.

The state was not asking whether Carlone thought Jonathan had been assaulted.', 'Moreover, Jonathan was subject to intense cross-examination at trial, providing the jury with its own opportunity to assess Jonathan’s credibility. See Rushlow, 32 A.3d at 900 (holding that the admission of impermissible vouching or bolstering was not prejudicial error because of “the jurors’ sufficient opportunity to judge [the complaining witness’s] truthfulness” through cross-examination).', 'Also, the trial justice provided detailed jury instructions, including a reference to Carlone’s testimony, with specific instructions that the jury not afford a police', '-8- officer’s testimony “any more credibility or less credibility merely because that person is a police officer.”', 'Thus, the jury had “ample opportunity to form an independent opinion about [Jonathan’s] credibility[.]” State v.

19,State : v. : Jose A. Breton.,reversal,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Early in the morning of October 25, 2011, as she was leaving for work, the complaining witness, Dilcia Lora, was viciously attacked by a masked assailant in the front hall of her home and was severely cut on her face with a small blade. Ms. Lora subsequently identified her attacker as the defendant, Jose A. Breton a.k.a. Pappi Valdez, a man with whom she had previously had a two-year-long romantic relationship. In a three-count information, the defendant was charged with one count of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of simple assault on Ms. Lora. The third count was for a simple assault against Ms. Lora’s daughter, Jani Tolentino, which was alleged to have occurred on May 26, 2010. When the case was reached for trial, the defendant was convicted of the two counts of assault against Ms. Lora, but he was acquitted of the third count against Ms. Tolentino. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial justice denied. 1 It is from that ruling that the defendant has timely appealed, arguing that the trial justice misconstrued the evidence when 1', 'On count 1 defendant was sentenced to twenty years, eleven to serve, nine years suspended, with nine years of probation. On count 2, he was sentenced to one year to serve, suspended with probation to run concurrently with count 1.', '-1- he found Ms. Lora to be a more credible witness than the alibi witnesses produced by the defendant. We have examined the record and have considered the written submissions and oral arguments advanced by the parties. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 26, 2010, Ms. Lora and defendant had an argument, during the course of which defendant struck and pushed Ms. Lora’s daughter, Jani Tolentino. The police were called, but when they arrived, Ms. Lora told them that she did not know defendant’s real name, only his alias, “Pappi Valdez,” and that they had been dating for only three months when in fact they had been dating for two years. At trial, Ms. Lora explained that she had not been truthful with the police because she was afraid of what defendant would do if she reported him to law enforcement.', 'According to Ms. Lora, she and defendant had been in a two-year relationship that had been replete with assaults and threats. The romance, she said, came to an end in December 2010. However, Ms. Lora said that she never explained to defendant that the relationship was over and that she never “officially” broke up with him, but instead she simply left the country. Ms. Lora said that she went to the Dominican Republic to stay with her mother, remaining there for approximately two months. Ms. Lora did not tell defendant she was leaving the country or where she would be going, nor did she inform her mother why she had come to stay. However, shortly after she got to the Dominican Republic, defendant showed up at her mother’s house, unexpected and uninvited. The defendant repeatedly asked Ms. Lora to resume their relationship and he promised to enter counseling. But Ms. Lora was unmoved, and, when she refused to get back together with him, he left.', '-2-', 'Ms. Lora moved to Florida and then back to Santo Domingo before finally returning to Rhode Island in August 2011. In Rhode Island, she lived with her brother, her sister, her daughter, and her niece and nephew. Eventually, Ms. Lora secured employment at Kenny Manufacturing, where she worked with the mother of defendant’s children. Occasionally, she saw defendant as he brought that woman to work but, she explained, she avoided interacting with either of them.', 'On October 25, 2011, as she was leaving her apartment to go to work, Ms. Lora was accosted by a hooded and masked assailant. Ms. Lora made an effort to defend herself with her hands “so he wouldn’t cut [her]” and, during the course of the struggle, she was able to pull part of the mask up. When she did, she recognized defendant’s nose and chin. Ms. Lora also recognized the ski mask as belonging to defendant. Ms. Lora screamed for help and attempted to defend herself as the attacker kept slashing at her with the knife. Ms. Lora’s brother, niece, daughter, and sister, hearing her screams, rushed to her aid. When they arrived, the assailant ceased attacking Ms. Lora, fled the apartment building and ran down the street. Lisandro, Ms. Lora’s brother, chased the assailant out of the building but was unable to catch him. Ms. Lora immediately told her family that “Pappi” had cut her.', 'At the hospital, Ms. Lora informed the doctors that Jose Breton had cut her face, that she had been in a relationship with him for a long time, that he “always threatened [her]” and that she had never before reported the abuse because she feared that he “would leave [her] paralyzed.” She also told the medical personnel that defendant had followed her to the Dominican Republic and had confronted her at her mother’s house. Although Ms. Lora related these events to the doctors, she did not immediately notify the police about who had attacked her because she was still afraid of defendant.', 'However, the following day Ms. Lora advised', '-3- Det. Emilio Matos of the Providence police department that defendant had assaulted her, that she knew it was him because of his height and build, and that she recognized the “little bit” of his face that had become uncovered when she tugged on the mask. She also explained that “the only person threatening [her] was [defendant]. And he was always threatening [her] if [she] left him he was going to kill [her], this that [sic], that he was going to take [her] eyes out, that he was going to leave [her] paralyzed.”', 'At trial, the attending emergency room physician, Dr. Leo Kowayashi, testified that Ms. Lora presented with three lacerations above her right eye as well as a large deep laceration to the left side of her face, and that these wounds would result in permanent scarring. Ana Cruz, defendant’s mother, testified for her son. She said that she had brought defendant to New York City on October 24, 2011, the day before the assault, dropping him off there as she traveled to Virginia for a funeral service for a recently deceased family member. She said that she rented a minivan at the T.F. Green Airport in Warwick, on October 24, 2011, traveled to New York City with defendant, and arrived in Manhattan around 3:30 a.m. on October 25, 2011. Ms. Cruz testified that she left defendant in Manhattan and picked up other family members who were going to the funeral, and that defendant went to stay with her brother’s former girlfriend, “Fam,” for the day in Brooklyn. Ms. Cruz produced receipts for the rental car, gas, and tolls for the trip to Virginia. She testified that she returned the rental van on October 26, 2011.', 'Femije Tairi, or “Fam,” testified that defendant’s mother called her on October 24, and asked if defendant could stay with her because there were too many people going to the funeral and not everyone could afford to go. She said that she met Ms. Cruz and defendant in Manhattan early in the morning on October 25, 2011, and Ms. Cruz picked up other family members; Ms. Tairi said that she then drove with defendant back to her home in Brooklyn, where she lived', '-4- with her daughter and two small sons. She testified that she and defendant arrived at her home around 4 a.m., at which point they started talking about the deceased family member and “goofing around like normal families” before making breakfast at about 6 a.m. The defendant’s aunt, Marilyn Castillo, arrived around 6:15 a.m. “to grieve,” and Ms. Tairi explained that “[w]e have our own way of grieving.” According to Ms. Tairi, defendant stayed in Brooklyn until after 10 p.m., at which point she transported him back to Manhattan to meet his mother for the return trip to Rhode Island. 2', 'The jury returned a guilty verdict on counts 1 and 2, but acquitted defendant on count 3. When defendant was heard on his motion for a new trial, he argued that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence because it was based primarily on the credibility and reliability of Ms. Lora in identifying defendant as her assailant. The defendant challenged Ms. Lora’s ability to identify her attacker, arguing that an accurate identification was impossible given that the attack began and ended in a matter of seconds in a poorly lit stairwell. Additionally, he pointed to the fact that it took her over a day to identify defendant as her assailant to the police after she initially lied to them. And when she finally did, he argued, she did not describe defendant’s specific facial features to them. Finally, defendant argued that the state was unable to cast doubt on the unimpeached testimony of his alibi witnesses. 3', 'Standard of Review', 'Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[o]n motion of the defendant the court may grant a new trial to the defendant if required in the interest of 2', 'Ms. Castillo testified that Ms. Tairi had invited her to have breakfast on October 24 as a “family reunion[] [on] the occurrences of my cousin’s death.” She arrived there with her two children around 6 a.m., when she had breakfast with Ms. Tairi, her nieces, and defendant. 3', 'The defendant argued for the first time, in his supplemental Rule 12A statement and at oral arguments before this Court, that the trial justice’s decision demonstrated “a cultural bias or ignorance.” After reviewing the record, we see no merit to this argument.', '-5- justice.” The trial justice’s role in reviewing a motion for a new trial is that of the proverbial “superjuror” who independently weighs the evidence and assesses the credibility of the witnesses. Battle v. State, 125 A.3d 130, 132 (R.I. 2015). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” State v. Offley, 131 A.3d 663, 674 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)). “If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” State v. Gregson, 113 A.3d 393, 398 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Mathews, 88 A.3d 375, 388 (R.I. 2014)). In the end, we will not disturb the decision of a trial justice on a motion for a new trial unless the decision is clearly wrong or “the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence * * *.” Battle, 125 A.3d at 132 (quoting Gomes v. Rosario, 79 A.3d 1262, 1265 (R.I. 2013)).', 'Analysis', 'At the outset of his decision, the trial justice acknowledged that the state’s “case rises and falls on the shoulders of the [s]tate’s first witness Dilcia Lora.” He also said that he had “listened carefully” to defense counsel’s arguments and that he did not “overlook the various points made” by him. These included the poor lighting, the fact the assailant was wearing a mask during an attack that occurred in a matter of seconds, Ms. Lora’s inability to identify the weapon used, and her refusal to identify defendant or reveal her prior relationship with him. Nonetheless, the trial justice found her to be a credible witness. In so doing, the trial justice, in evaluating her testimony, said he sought to “understand the circumstances, the background, the', '-6- relationship, between Ms. Lora and this defendant in weighing, sifting, and evaluating some of the contradictions and omissions * * *.”', 'For that, he looked to Ms. Tolentino’s testimony, which he also found credible. Even though defendant was acquitted of the assault charge related to her, the trial justice said that it was helpful that she “did describe the nature of [the relationship between Ms. Lora and defendant] and the dynamics of that relationship and the conduct exhibited by this defendant towards her mother in the period of time leading up to the events related to these specific charges.” Finding their testimony to be genuine, he summarized,', '“[t]here is no question in observing those two cases, mother and', 'daughter on this witness stand either it was an academy award', 'acting performance or it was a legitimate and sincere display of', 'fear but there is no question in this [c]ourt’s mind, I have not seen', 'witnesses testify in the manner that they testified aside from what', 'they said but the manner of delivery how they positioned', 'themselves on the witness stand, it didn’t strike me as contrived or', 'an act. It seemed like a sincere display of their feeling towards this', 'defendant.”', 'The trial justice did not stop there, however, and he went on to address the credibility of the defendant’s alibi witnesses, all of whom placed him in New York at the time of the attack. During the defendant’s argument on his motion for a new trial, the trial justice specifically questioned the alibi testimony regarding having the family gathering at 6 to 7 a.m. to memorialize a decedent.', 'The trial justice asked defense counsel to address the timing, commenting specifically:', '“[It] just so happened that is exactly the time that this assault', 'occurred. And, of course, they identified the defendant as sitting at', 'the table. I mean, I mean, I know there are different cultures and', 'different ways that people do things and [sic] but isn’t that an odd', 'time of day to gather little children and let’s all sit around and that', 'is the time you pick to memorialize this person who died.', '“* * *', '-7-', '“I just thought it peaked [sic] my interest at the time of the day that', 'took place.” In response, defense counsel dismissed any suggestion that the time of day was odd, reasoning that it was natural under the circumstances to hold a family gathering at that time of the day:', '“So if he arrives 3:30, 4:00 in the morning what is he', 'supposed to go to sleep at four a.m. or something. Of course they', 'are going to be up, and you cook breakfast, you know, young kids', 'have breakfast 6:30 seven in the morning. They get up early. So,', 'again, it was not just, not just a gathering for the memorial it was', 'also to see my client, too. Because the mother was coming into', 'town and they needed to pick my client up. She wasn’t going to be', 'staying at the house in Brooklyn. She was driving through. So', 'that is the reason for that time so the time is the trip for Rhode', 'Island time it takes to get to New York, meet them over in', 'Manhattan and instead of more driving to Brooklyn and Manhattan', 'because other people were meeting 191st Street the trip from 191st', 'Street goes back over to Brooklyn and the other aunt came over a', 'little bit later on to meet for breakfast time. I think she arrived', 'little after six she said.” However, the trial justice rejected the testimony of the alibi witnesses when he weighed it against the testimony of Ms. Lora, Ms. Tolentino, and the history of Ms. Lora’s relationship with the defendant. The trial justice opined that', '“[w]hen you take that testimony and weigh it against what', 'Ms. Lora and her daughter had to say and the history of that', 'relationship up to that point, I can’t say I disagree with the jury’s', 'conclusion that the alibi would not be accepted based on the', 'recitation of those witnesses.” We are of the opinion that the trial justice satisfied his obligations when he considered and decided the defendant’s motion for a new trial, and that he was well within his discretion when he found the state’s witnesses to be credible, despite any inconsistencies in their testimony. See State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96, 103 (R.I. 2012) (“Even taking into account [the trial justice’s] own observations that something was ‘being left out,’ the trial justice found that the witnesses', '-8- were credible * * *.”); State v.

20,State : v. : Ricardo Florez. :,reversal,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. On March 31, 2014, a Providence County Superior Court jury found the defendant, Ricardo Florez (defendant or Florez), guilty of one count of second-degree child molestation sexual assault (sexual contact with a person fourteen years of age or under) in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.3 and 11-37-8.4. On July 29, 2014, the trial justice sentenced the defendant to twenty years’ imprisonment, with eight years to serve and the remaining time suspended with probation.1 On appeal, the defendant asserts a variety of issues before this Court. First, he contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. Next, he asserts that the trial justice’s jury charge and verdict sheet were flawed in that they permitted the jury to return a non-unanimous guilty verdict. Third, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred by allowing the state to improperly refresh the complainant’s recollection. Finally, he contends that the trial justice committed reversible error by declining to admit parts of the witness statement of the complainant’s father into evidence. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'In addition, defendant’s sentence included a requirement to attend sex offender treatment program and to register as a sex offender upon release, and a no-contact order was entered with regard to the complainant.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', ""The incident giving rise to defendant's conviction occurred on August 1, 2010 at a McDonald’s restaurant in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

He further testified that he was scared because he did not know defendant but did not want to be rude by not responding.', 'Joshua next testified that he got up from his seat and told his father that he was going to the bathroom. He recounted that he was washing his hands at the sink when “[t]he defendant came out [of the stall] with his pants down and came over to me and grabbed my unit.” He further elaborated that defendant grabbed his penis over his clothing. He testified that defendant 2', 'At trial, the state called three witnesses: the complainant, his father, and the detective who investigated the sexual assault, Det. Charles Devine (Det.

Joshua further recounted that the police arrived, he explained to them what had happened, and he provided a description of defendant. He further reported that he spoke to Det. Charles Devine (Det. Devine) of the Pawtucket Police Department on August 5, 2010, at which time he provided a statement and identified defendant from a photo array.', 'As part of his direct examination, Joshua was asked: “at any point in time before leaving the bathroom, did you ever touch any part of the defendant?” to which he answered, “No.” As a result, the state handed Joshua the statement that he had provided to police. The state then asked Joshua if he “recall[ed] describing any other type of contact between [him] and the defendant that day in the bathroom in your statement to Detective Devine?” Again, Joshua answered, “No.” After the state directed Joshua’s attention to a specific portion of his witness statement, it asked, over defendant’s continued objection, “Tell me what it is you told Detective Devine.” Joshua answered, “That he grabbed my hand and made me touch his exposed penis.” The state then asked if there was “some reason [he] didn’t want to tell us that?” Joshua responded, “Um, I was just scared to tell you.”', 'The state also called Glenn as a witness. He testified that, as he was ordering lunch, Joshua approached him and told him that he had to use the bathroom. He further testified that Joshua was still in the bathroom when he got back to the table with the food. According to Glenn’s testimony, Joshua left the bathroom, came up to him, and told him “that man touched me;” and, when Glenn asked what he meant, Joshua replied “sexually.” Glenn recounted that Joshua pointed to defendant when he walked out of the bathroom. Glenn testified that he 4', 'Notably, on cross-examination Joshua testified that he was the first person to leave the bathroom; however, in the witness statement he gave to police, he stated that he followed defendant out of the bathroom.', '-3- approached defendant, but defendant replied that Joshua was lying. At that point, defendant “jumped on his bike and took off.” Glenn called 911 and the police responded. Four days later, Glenn and his son went to the Pawtucket police station, where he provided a witness statement and identified defendant from a photo array.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', ""Given the variety of claims on appeal, our standard of review varies with respect to each of the different issues.

Kizekai, 19 A.3d 583, 589 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 766 (R.I. 2011)). “If the trial justice has articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion, his or her decision is entitled to great weight and will not be overturned by this Court unless he or she has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 233 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v.

Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1031 (R.I. 2007). “[A]n erroneous charge warrants reversal only if it can be shown that the jury ‘could have been misled’ to the resultant prejudice of the complaining party.” State v.

Grullon, 984 A.2d 46, 53 (R.I. 2009))."", 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant first attacks the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial. Before reaching the merits of his contention, however, we must first confront a procedural hurdle. Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[a] motion for a new trial based on any * * * grounds [other than newly discovered evidence] shall be made within ten (10) days after the verdict or finding of guilty or within such further time as the court may fix during the ten-day period.” Importantly, we have held that “[t]he time limit set forth in Rule 33 is jurisdictional and cannot be waived.” State v. Champion, 873 A.2d 92, 94 (R.I. 2005); State v. Rodriguez, 742 A.2d 728, 733 (R.I. 1999).', 'Here, the jury returned a verdict on Monday, March 31, 2014. Thus, the deadline for filing a motion for a new trial in accordance with Rule 33 was Thursday, April 10, 2014. However, defendant’s attorney did not file the handwritten motion until the date of the hearing', '-5- on Monday, April 14, 2014. 5 As such, the motion for a new trial was untimely and should not have been considered by the trial justice, and, accordingly, is beyond our review on appeal.', 'To be sure, at the hearing, the trial justice considered whether the motion was filed in a timely manner. However, the state mistakenly represented that the deadline was April 14, 2014. Thus, the trial justice issued a warning that he “would suggest that [defendant] file it today.” Even considering such a warning, however, we reiterate that “[t]he time limit set forth in Rule 33 is jurisdictional and cannot be waived.” Champion, 873 A.2d at 94. Rule 33 specifically provides that any further time for filing a motion for a new trial must be fixed by the trial justice within the ten-day period. Accordingly, the fact that the parties and the trial justice mistakenly believed that the time to file such a motion had not lapsed is of no consequence.', 'The motion was untimely and thus not properly before the trial justice.', 'Nevertheless, even if we were to consider defendant’s argument with regard to his motion for a new trial, it is devoid of any merit. In essence, defendant’s argument is that the trial justice erred by crediting Joshua’s testimony in denying his motion for a new trial because (i) the trial justice specifically acknowledged certain shortcomings of Joshua’s testimony; and (ii) the surveillance videotape from McDonald’s contradicted Joshua’s testimony with regard to whether Joshua or defendant exited the bathroom first.', '“We accord great deference when we review the decision of a trial justice on a motion for new trial ‘because a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.’” State v. Whitaker, 79 A.3d 795, 804 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 948 (R.I. 2012)). 5', 'After the jury returned its verdict on March 31, 2014, defendant’s counsel indicated that he “anticipate[d] filing a motion for new trial” and sought to schedule a hearing on the motion. At that time, the hearing was scheduled for April 7, 2014, but it did not actually occur until April 14, 2014.', ""-6- In addition, “[w]e have repeatedly held that ‘neither a witness's prior contradictory statements nor the inconsistencies in his testimony inhibit a fact finder's right to accept the witness as credible, and to pick and choose from his testimony what portions he deems worthy of belief.’” King v.

While a trial justice “commits clear error when he or she completely overlooks testimony which is materially contradictory to the testimony on which the justice bases his or her determination[,]” id., that did not occur in this case. Indeed, the trial justice noted the inconsistencies in Joshua’s testimony in excruciating detail and after “[h]aving acknowledged that his testimony was not perfect nor crystal clear,” he found that “his difficulties in relating what happened to him * * * does not significantly erode the case built by the [s]tate.” Viewing Joshua’s testimony “through the lenses of a 13 year old, confronted with a situation that he was confronted with in that men’s room,” he specifically found the testimony “to be credible and trustworthy and sufficient to meet the elements of second degree sexual assault child molestation * * *.”"", 'The trial justice undertook a detailed review of Joshua’s testimony, acknowledged its shortcomings, but nevertheless found his testimony to be credible. After carefully reviewing the record before us, we conclude that, even if properly before us, the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. See State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 106 (R.I. 2013).', 'B', 'Jury Instructions and Verdict Sheet', 'The defendant’s next attack sets its crosshairs at the jury instructions and verdict sheet, claiming that they permitted the jury to return a non-unanimous guilty verdict, thus running afoul of this Court’s holding in State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1254-55 (R.I. 1998). Specifically,', '-7- defendant contends that the trial justice incorrectly applied Saluter when he instructed the jury and failed to specifically state that the jury was required to unanimously find that defendant committed one or the other of the alleged sexual contacts, or both. That is, according to defendant, the verdict was unclear because “there is a question in the present case as to whether the jury unanimously found that [defendant] touched [Joshua] over his clothing, whether the jury unanimously found that [defendant] forced [Joshua’s] hand to touch his penis, or both, or whether the jury was split between the two allegations.” In response, the state suggests that defendant failed to object below and, therefore, his claim on appeal should be deemed waived.', '“The term ‘duplicity’ refers to the joining of two or more offenses, however numerous, in a single count of an indictment.” Saluter, 715 A.2d at 1253. We have consistently held that “a motion to dismiss based on a duplicitous complaint is * * * an objection [based on a defect of the complaint].” 6 Id. at 1254 (quoting State v. LaPlante, 122 R.I. 446, 449, 409 A.2d 130, 131 (1979)); State v. Roberts, 420 A.2d 837, 840 (R.I. 1980) (“[T]he proper way to attack a duplicitous complaint, indictment, or information is by motion pursuant to Super. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(2), (3).”). Thus, by failing to file a motion to dismiss, defendant waived his claim of duplicity. See Saluter, 715 A.2d at 1254; Roberts, 420 A.2d at 840.', 'Having failed to avail himself of this procedural tool, defendant attempts to raise his duplicity claim by asserting error in the jury instructions and verdict form. This attempt fails because it falls squarely within this Court’s “raise-or-waive” rule. In accordance with such rule, “a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.” State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 829 (R.I. 2008). In the present matter, defendant 6', 'We also note that an appropriate bill of particulars could have been used to cure any potential duplicity issue, see State v. DaSilva, 742 A.2d 721, 727 (R.I. 1999); however, defendant failed to file one.', '-8- failed to object to both the jury instructions 7 and the verdict form. In fact, not only did defendant not object at any point with regard to this issue, but, when the trial justice explained his plan to deal with a potential Saluter problem, defense counsel acquiesced in the trial justice’s strategy to neutralize the issue. 8 Thus, defendant cannot now be heard to complain of the error. See Bido, 941 A.2d at 828-29.', ""We also note that the exception to the raise-or-waive rule is not available to defendant. It is well settled that our raise-or-waive rule generally “will not be disturbed unless ‘basic constitutional rights are concerned.’” Bido, 941 A.2d at 829 (quoting State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004)). “[T]o fall within this exception, the defendant must show: (1) that the error complained of amounts to more than harmless error; (2) that a sufficient record exists to permit a determination of the issue; and (3) that ‘counsel's failure to raise the issue [before trial] must be premised upon a novel rule of law that counsel could not reasonably have known during the trial.’” Cronan ex rel. State v. Cronan, 774 A.2d 866, 878 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Donato, 592 A.2d 140, 142 (R.I. 1991)). Even assuming, arguendo, that the error complained of would constitute more than harmless error, the rule of law upon which this argument is premised 7"", 'Following the jury charge, defense counsel did state that “just for the record based on the earlier conference I would ask that my objection be noted to that one issue that we discussed earlier.” However, the basis for defendant’s objection is unclear from the record. Thus, even if this objection were in regard to duplicity, such an objection is not properly preserved for our review. See State v. Fry, 130 A.3d 812, 822 (R.I. 2016). Moreover, at oral argument, defense counsel speculated that such objection was not asserted with regard to duplicity, but, instead, may have been an exception to the trial justice’s denial of an instruction on a lesser included offense. 8', 'Specifically, prior to Joshua’s anticipated testimony with respect to a second touching, defendant objected pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and the parties went off the record to discuss a possible limiting instruction. When the parties returned to the record, the trial justice noted a potential Saluter issue and stated his intention to “instruct the jury if they find either one of [the two] incidences [of touching] * * * and are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of that, that is sufficient to convict on the one count.” He then asked: “Is that how we are going to proceed, gentlemen?” and defense counsel replied, “Yes, your Honor.”', '-9- is far from novel. 9 Indeed, Saluter was decided by this Court in 1998, and we have, on several occasions, expounded upon the applicability of its holding. See State v. Davis, 877 A.2d 642, 649 (R.I. 2005) (declining to apply our holding in Saluter where the “jury unanimously found the defendant guilty of two of the crimes charged, each of which constituted one offense charged in separate counts of the indictment”); State v. DaSilva, 742 A.2d 721, 727 (R.I. 1999) (declining to apply the Saluter rule where the “bill of particulars, together with the jury instructions and the verdict form, adequately clarified the counts before the jury and negated any potential duplicity in the indictment”). Accordingly, counsel could (and should) reasonably have known of the rule of law pronounced by this Court in Saluter at the time of trial, and, thus, the exception to the “raise-or-waive” rule is inapplicable.', 'The defendant presents two additional last-ditch arguments to attempt to save his claim. First, he suggests that the fact that “the trial judge seemed to represent himself as the expert in the subject” should warrant an exception from the raise-or-waive rule.', ""We have never recognized such an exception and decline to do so today. Second, defendant attempts to liken his case to State v. Dennis, 893 A.2d 250, 263 (R.I. 2006), to argue that we should find the same “circumstances peculiar” in that case and relax the raise-or-waive rule in the current instance. There, however, we declined to deem the defendant’s argument as waived “because of the trial justice's explicit statement that he would not give ‘any instructions * * * regarding Miranda rights to [the] jury.’” Id. at 264. Such circumstances simply do not exist in the case before us. Accordingly, we conclude that defendant’s multiple attempts to bypass this Court’s “raise-or- waive” rule are unavailing, and, thus, we do not consider his Saluter argument on appeal. 9"", 'Notably, defendant asks this Court to “revisit its present incarnation of the ‘raise-or-waive’ rule[,]” and, instead, adopt a framework similar to the four-principle test used by the First Circuit with regard to waiver. See United States v. Krynicki, 689 F.2d 289 (1st Cir. 1982). We decline to do so.', '- 10 -', 'C', 'Joshua’s Witness Statement', 'In his next assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by improperly allowing the state to “refresh [Joshua’s] recollection” of the second touching by using his witness statement. He contends that Joshua did not testify to a lack of memory, but, instead, testified that he omitted the second touching from his testimony because he was scared; thus, according to defendant, a proper foundation for refreshing Joshua’s recollection had not been formed.', ""However, in ruling on defendant’s objection to Joshua’s anticipated testimony, the trial justice stated: “If he says no then he could impeach him with his own statement assuming that * * * statement is inconsistent or if he says I’m not sure I don’t remember why can’t he refresh his recollection with his own statement about something that he just can’t recall on the stand.” Although he does not cite to a specific Rule of Evidence by number, this ruling makes clear that, when Joshua answered that there had not been a second touching, the trial justice’s reasoning for allowing use of the witness statement was based on a prior inconsistent statement under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Pursuant to that rule, the prior statement (Joshua’s witness statement) is admissible if “[t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is inconsistent with the declarant's testimony[.]” Id. To admit a prior statement into evidence under Rule 801(d)(1)(A), “there must be two statements and each must be sufficiently inconsistent to render the prior statement admissible.” State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984, 988 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1111 (R.I. 1999))."", ""“The determination of whether a pretrial statement is * * * inconsistent with the witness's in-court testimony is [within] the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Id. (quoting Bettencourt, 723 A.2d at 1111). Notably, unlike the"", ""- 11 - federal rule concerning the substantive admissibility of prior inconsistent statements, “the inconsistent statement need not have been made while under oath subject to penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, deposition or other proceeding.” Id. (quoting Advisory Committee's Notes to Rule 801 at 1052)."", 'Here, Joshua’s testimony at trial that there was no second touching was contrary to the account that he had given in his witness statement, “[t]hat [defendant] grabbed [Joshua’s] hand and made [him] touch [defendant’s] exposed penis.” Rule 607 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides, in pertinent part, that “[t]he credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including the party calling the witness * * *.” Given the inconsistency between Joshua’s testimony at trial and his witness statement, it was within the trial justice’s discretion to allow the state to impeach him with his prior statement. Accordingly, defendant’s argument with regard to the state improperly refreshing Joshua’s recollection must fail.', 'D', 'Glenn’s Witness Statement', 'The defendant’s final point of contention concerns the trial justice limiting his use of the following portion of Glenn’s witness statement:', '“I called the police and an officer came to speak to us. I then found out', 'that the male tried to touch [Joshua’s] penis and the male tried to have [Joshua]', 'touch his penis. [Joshua] told the officer that the male asked [Joshua] to suck his', 'penis.” (Emphasis added.) The defendant suggests that the word “tried” within this statement would have aided him in casting doubt as to the act of touching and that, had the word “tried” been entered into evidence, the trial justice would not have refused to give an instruction on a lesser included offense. 10 In 10', 'While defendant suggests in his brief that the trial justice would not have refused to give a lesser included instruction had this evidence been admitted, he cites no case law and presents no', '- 12 - addition, defendant contends that this statement contradicts Glenn’s testimony at trial when he stated that he did not learn much additional information as a result of Joshua’s interview with police.', 'The defendant points to two places where he contends the trial justice improperly prevented him from using this statement. First, he suggests that the trial justice improperly denied defendant’s use of the written statement during his cross-examination of Glenn. Second, he asserts that, during Officer Slack’s testimony, the trial justice improperly excluded the statement based on his unfounded conclusion that the statement was already before the jury “by implication.” We consider each of these contentions in turn.', 'With regard to defendant’s assertion that the trial justice excluded defendant’s use of the written statement on cross-examination of Glenn, such a suggestion is belied by the record. When defendant attempted to use Glenn’s witness statement during his questioning, the state objected and a discussion at sidebar ensued.', 'Contrary to defendant’s assertion on appeal, however, the trial justice did not preclude defendant’s use of the statement in cross-examination, argument to challenge the trial justice’s refusal to give such an instruction. We have held that this Court “consider[s] an issue to be waived when a party ‘[s]imply stat[es] an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues * * *.’” Bucci v. Hurd Buick Pontiac GMC Truck, LLC, 85 A.3d 1160, 1170 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1256 (R.I. 2010)).

Thus, we do not consider defendant’s argument to the extent that it may suggest that a lesser included instruction was warranted.', '- 13 - but, rather, corrected defense counsel’s form of the question. Specifically, the trial justice expressed the following:', '“I’m okay with that question. * * * I was okay with you asking him that. * * *', 'Let’s clearly show that you are using it to show that he said something different in', 'that statement than he said either previously or on this witness stand. So, that is', 'all I’m asking. I just don’t want you to read line by line to him and did you say', 'that did you say that. I don’t think that is proper use of that statement. I’m not', 'aware of any rule that permits that.” In response, defense counsel stated: “That is fair enough. I can call the patrolman, Judge.” Thus, the record makes pellucid that defense counsel was not precluded from questioning Glenn with regard to his witness statement. Instead, defense counsel abandoned his strategy to question Glenn with respect to this statement, and, instead, opted to use it to question Officer Slack. Accordingly, defendant’s argument with respect to the use of Glenn’s witness statement during his cross-examination must fail.', 'We turn next to defendant’s assertion that the trial justice improperly excluded the statement during the examination of Officer Slack. On direct examination of the officer, defense counsel asked: “I understand that you say that [Joshua] never said the man tried to touch me, but in the statement that I show you—[.]” At that point, he was interrupted by an objection by the state, and the parties engaged in a discussion at sidebar. Defense counsel argued:', '“Judge, the witness just testified that at no point in time did [Joshua] ever say to', 'him that the man tried to touch [him]. Recognizing that the statement I’m citing', 'is the statement purportedly prepared by the Pawtucket Police after speaking to', '[Glenn], I’m merely asking this particular witness if this statement says that the', 'male tried to touch [Joshua’s] penis and the male tried to have [Joshua] touch his', 'penis. I’m not even offering it for the truth of the matter asserted[;] merely these', 'words appear in this document.” After this discussion, the trial justice sustained the state’s objection, and defense counsel reiterated: “I would just ask my exception to be noted specifically on the grounds that I would', '- 14 - submit it is not hearsay because it is not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted merely that the words appear in a statement * * *.”', 'The defendant’s basis for objection before this Court is unclear. He appears to assert that the statement should have been permitted under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) as a prior inconsistent statement. However, the trial record makes clear that such an argument was not advanced below and, therefore, is deemed to be waived. See Bido, 941 A.2d at 828-29. Indeed, defense counsel set forth but one argument below: that the statement was not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Nevertheless, he abandons this argument before us and, therefore, we do not consider it. 11 See State v. Giordano, 413 A.2d 93, 94 (R.I. 1980). Thus, there is no argument with respect to the use of Glenn’s witness statement in the examination of Officer Slack that is properly before this Court.

Her fiancé had left for work, and she was expecting her sister to arrive soon. She decided to watch TV while waiting for her sister but fell asleep while on her bed.', '-1-', 'Ms. Negron was awoken at some time after that when she heard the door open and saw a “dark-skinned man” walk into the apartment. She testified at trial that, from her bed, she had a “perfect view” to the apartment door.', 'The intruder told Ms. Negron not to move, picked up a coat from the kitchen chair, climbed on top of her, covered her face with the coat and began to suffocate her. At trial, Ms. Negron demonstrated how the intruder was choking her by putting her right hand around her neck in a choking fashion. 1 Ms. Negron testified that she struggled and scratched the intruder’s arms and that, at some point during the struggle, she felt his hands at her waist. The intruder threatened her, saying, “Don’t move or I’ll kill you.” During the struggle, the coat came off her face, allowing her to see. She then grabbed a plastic water bottle from beside the bed and hit the intruder with it, striking him on the side of the neck. Ms. Negron stated that, at this point in the struggle, she was briefly face to face with the intruder.

Ms. Negron described the intruder as being an “average-size man, dark skin, short hair” and wearing “a short-sleeved shirt and light blue jeans.” The Central Falls Police did not dust for fingerprints at the apartment nor did they obtain any DNA evidence from Ms. Negron’s fingernails. 2 Detective Jeff Araujo of 1', 'We note that in testifying, Ms. Negron stated that the intruder used his “hands” in choking her but when asked to demonstrate, the record reflected that she put only her right hand around her neck. 2', 'Ms. Negron testified that, during the struggle with the intruder, she had purposely scratched his arms in an effort to collect his DNA under her fingernails.', '-2- the Central Falls Police testified that Ms. Negron did not mention at that time that the intruder spoke with an accent.', 'A few days later, on April 20, 2008, Ms. Negron was on the porch of her apartment overlooking the driveway to the house. A car drove in and parked in the driveway and the driver passed by Ms. Negron’s door wearing a “sweater” with a hood over his head. Ms. Negron identified the driver, who she later discovered lived above her in the same building, as being the intruder who had entered her apartment. She called the police immediately to inform them.', 'Detective Araujo put together a photo array that included a Department of Motor Vehicles license picture of defendant. Prior to being shown the photos, Ms. Negron was given an instruction form informing her that she was not obligated to identify anyone from the photo array.', 'Nevertheless, Ms. Negron identified defendant’s picture from it.', 'Detective Araujo testified that, upon being shown the array, Ms. Negron immediately began to shake and cry and seemed “almost like she was afraid of the photographs.”', 'Detective Araujo learned that defendant worked at Chili’s Bar & Grill in Lincoln, about four and a half miles away from Ms. Negron’s apartment.', 'According to Detective Araujo, the distance between Ms. Negron’s apartment and Chili’s could be traveled by car in approximately eleven to fifteen minutes. Detective Araujo secured an arrest warrant but he was unable to locate defendant on April 22, 2008. Lopez, however, turned himself in to the police later that night.', 'According to Richard Sliwinski, Jr., defendant’s manager at Chili’s at the time, the restaurant’s computerized time records showed that defendant clocked into work at 8:30 a.m. on the morning of April 15, 2008. Sliwinski, who was called as a witness by defendant, explained that the restaurant’s computer that records employees’ hours does not permit employees to clock in prior to their scheduled start time, regardless of when they arrive. Sliwinski testified that it', '-3- was defendant’s usual habit at the time to arrive at least half an hour prior to his scheduled time because he took the bus to work. Sliwinski said that defendant is bilingual but speaks English with a definite “Spanish accent.” He admitted that he had no specific recollection of defendant’s arrival or conduct on April 15, 2008, but stated that if he had observed any scratches on defendant’s hands, he would have addressed the issue as to “whether it was reasonable for him [defendant] to work or not” because of “a possible * * * food issue.”', 'Criminal Information No. P2/08-1764A charged Lopez with four criminal offenses: count 1, breaking and entering in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-2; count 2, assault with intent to murder in violation of G.L. § 11-5-1; count 3, felony assault in violation of § 11-5-2; and count 4, assault in violation of § 11-5-3. 3 The state dismissed counts 2 and 4 prior to jury selection.', 'Jury impaneling took place on February 11 and 12, 2010, and the trial took place on February 12 and 15, 2010.

The defendant argued that he had an “imperfect” alibi for the time the crime took place because he had clocked in to work by 8:30 a.m. and he was in the habit of arriving at least half an hour before his shift was due to begin, which gave him very little time after the assault on Ms. Negron in which to get to work. He also emphasized that no one at work on April 15, 2008 noticed anything unusual about him, such as any marks or scratches on his face or hands that would be consistent with the struggle that took place with Ms. Negron. The defendant further contended that his actions in turning himself in to the police a few days later were not the actions of a guilty man. Finally, Lopez focused on the lack of physical evidence to tie him to the crime and argued that eyewitness testimony such as Ms. Negron’s is unreliable.', 'The trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial, finding that Ms. Negron’s testimony was “extremely credible” and noting that “no evidence * * * has been uncovered to shake the confidence of the Court in her identification.” The trial justice recalled that “all of the individuals in that photo-pack look amazingly alike” and noted that Ms. Negron identified 4', 'The defendant renewed the motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence.

Lastly, Lopez maintains that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon because the evidence was insufficient to prove that the intruder’s hands were used as a dangerous weapon as required by § 11-5-2.

During voir dire, defense counsel began to question potential jurors about their opinions of the reliability of eyewitness testimony, using the example of Super Bowl referees. After a sidebar discussion with counsel, the trial justice curtailed defense counsel’s line of questioning, stating that the reliability of the complaining witness’s identification could more properly be questioned during argument.', 'We discern no error in the trial justice’s decision.

Zangrilli, 440 A.2d 710, 711 (R.I. 1982). This Court has never stated that any specific duration or intensity is necessary for choking with a person’s hands to constitute assault with a dangerous weapon. In this case, the complainant testified and described at trial how the intruder straddled her as he had his hand around her neck in a choking fashion. We are satisfied that the complainant’s testimony is sufficient to support the conviction on the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon. Regardless of the injuries actually suffered by the complainant, this Court agrees with the trial justice’s statement that “a choke, if carried to its natural conclusion, would probably cause death.” This Court has repeatedly held that “[t]he test is not whether serious bodily injury results from the assault, but whether the object was so used that serious bodily injury may have resulted.” State v.

Roger Morin (Morin or defendant) appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction for first-degree child molestation.', 'On appeal, he contends that the trial justice erred in refusing to suppress a statement he made to the Warren police following his arrest. He also ascribes error to the trial justice‟s decision to admit that statement without first redacting certain portions. Finally, he argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In December 2008, a grand jury returned a secret indictment charging Morin with sixteen counts of child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.1 and 11-37-8.3.1 1', 'Under G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1, “[a] person is guilty of first degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” Under § 11-37-8.3, “[a] person is guilty of a second degree child molestation sexual', '-1- Sally,2 Morin‟s stepdaughter, was identified as the victim in count 1 (first-degree child molestation sexual assault), count 2 (second-degree child molestation sexual assault), and count 3 (second-degree child molestation sexual assault), all of which concerned conduct that allegedly occurred between September 28, 1989, and September 28, 1992.3 Four additional victims were identified in the remaining counts.', 'Before trial, Morin successfully moved to sever counts 1 through 3 from the remaining thirteen counts, pursuant to Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. This appeal concerns only counts 1 through 3. His motion in limine to preclude the introduction of evidence related to the remaining thirteen counts was also granted.', 'Morin also moved to suppress a statement he made to the Warren police on September 28, 1992.4 A hearing on that motion was held before a justice of the Superior Court on October 29-30, 2009.5 Two witnesses testified at the suppression hearing: Marta Brandstromskelding, a child protective investigator employed by the Department of Children, Youth & Families assault if he or she engages in sexual contact with another person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” 2', 'Because the victim was a minor when the alleged offenses occurred, we use a pseudonym to protect her privacy.

Christopher J. Dicomitis, a former member of the Warren police.6 Below, we summarize the testimony adduced at that hearing.', 'A', 'Motion to Suppress', 'Brandstromskelding testified that DCYF received a call in September 1992 from an anonymous woman who reported concerns about Morin‟s behavior.', 'To investigate this information, Brandstromskelding went to Morin‟s home in Warren on September 25, 1992. That day, she interviewed Morin, his wife, Elizabeth, and their children, including Sally.', 'According to Brandstromskelding, DCYF received a phone call from a police officer on the following day “notifying us of concerns that a mother and daughter had brought to his attention.” Two days later, on September 28, 1992, Brandstromskelding returned to Morin‟s home.', 'She first spoke with Sally, who told her that Morin had molested her. Brandstromskelding then asked Morin if this was true. Morin eventually admitted to her that “he had done some of these things to [Sally]” and described this behavior as a “habit.”', 'Brandstromskelding testified that, during this conversation with Morin, his wife was “in and out of the kitchen,” where they were speaking, and that she was listening in from time to time. At some point, Brandstromskelding called the police to report that Morin had admitted to molesting Sally. After Morin‟s wife became “agitated” and slammed the blade of a “very large butcher knife” into the kitchen table in front of Morin, Brandstromskelding called the police a second time and asked them to come immediately. 6', 'At the time of the suppression hearing, Det. Dicomitis was employed as a detective with the Rhode Island State Police.', '-3-', 'About two minutes after Brandstromskelding placed the second phone call to the police, Officer Green arrived at Morin‟s home.7 Brandstromskelding greeted him at the front door and spoke with him outside. She told him about what Sally and Morin had both revealed to her and about how Morin‟s wife had reacted by slamming the knife into the table. Officer Green then entered the residence and placed Morin under arrest. According to Brandstromskelding, Officer Green read Morin his Miranda rights upon arresting him.', 'Detective Dicomitis testified that, in 1992, he was a detective with the Warren police department. On September 28, 1992, Det. Dicomitis advised Morin of his Miranda rights by having him read and sign a standardized form. After Morin waived his Miranda rights, Det. Dicomitis took a statement from him at the police station. In that statement, which was admitted into evidence at the suppression hearing, Morin said that he had touched Sally‟s vagina on several occasions over the previous six months. He explained that he had stopped doing this “sometime [sic] ago” because “[t]here was no thrill” in it for him.', 'At the conclusion of the testimony, Morin argued that his statement to police should be suppressed as the fruit of an illegal arrest. He urged the trial justice to reject New York v. Harris, 495 U.S. 14, 21 (1990), in which the United States Supreme Court declined to apply the exclusionary rule to statements obtained after a warrantless arrest in a home. In response, the prosecutor argued that Harris should control the trial justice‟s decision. He also suggested that, under the factors articulated in State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I. 1983), the exclusionary rule should not apply to Morin‟s statement to police. 7', 'It appears that Officer Green was identified only by his surname in the record. He did not testify at the suppression hearing; the prosecutor advised the court that “without refreshing his recollection from documents,” Officer Green was unable to remember “anything” about Morin‟s arrest.', '-4-', 'The trial justice stated that Harris “ought to control.” He found that Officer Green “[p]lainly” had “probable cause to arrest [Morin].” Crediting Brandstromskelding‟s testimony regarding the confrontation between Morin and his wife, the trial justice found that Officer Green “would have truly been derelict in his responsibilities if he did not act as he acted [in arresting Morin].” Having concluded that Morin was legally arrested, the trial justice heard argument regarding whether Morin had knowingly and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. He then concluded that the prosecution', '“ha[d] satisfied its burden [to prove] by clear and convincing', 'evidence that [Morin] comprehended all of his Miranda rights and', 'voluntarily, without coercion of any kind on the part of the police,', 'decided to speak with the [police], and that his decision was a', 'product of his free and intelligent choice.” Accordingly, he denied Morin‟s motion to suppress his statement to the police.', 'Morin then moved to redact certain portions of that statement. Specifically, he sought to redact the portion of the statement in which he had told police that he had sought counseling in the past and that he “wish[ed] to seek further counseling” in connection with his sexual habits. Additionally, he also asked the trial justice to redact two lines of the statement containing extremely crude language.8 The trial justice rejected Morin‟s argument that he would be unfairly prejudiced if the jury were allowed to consider the statement in its entirety. The case then proceeded to trial.', 'B', 'Trial', 'Jury selection began and concluded on November 2, 2009. That day, the state dismissed count 3 under Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.

The state presented testimony from three witnesses: Sally, Brandstromskelding, and Det. Dicomitis.', 'Sally was the first witness to testify. In September 1992, she was eight years old and lived with her mother, her younger siblings, and her stepfather, Morin. She testified that she and her siblings would sometimes play “the naked game,” which she described as “just get[ting] naked and run[ning] around like, you know, kids do.” She described an incident that occurred sometime in or around September 1992, when she was playing the naked game with her siblings in the living room. That day, when she was naked and sitting on Morin‟s lap, Morin touched her vagina and digitally penetrated her.', 'Sally described another incident that occurred around the same time period. After she had a bad dream, Morin got into bed with her. At first, Sally testified that she “[didn‟t] really -- know if [Morin] touched [her] or not.” When asked where Morin‟s hands were during that incident, Sally said that she “[didn‟t] really remember too much, but maybe like around my waist.” Later, however, she testified that he had rubbed her vagina over her undergarments.', 'In September 1992, Sally testified, she told her babysitter (whose name she could not recall) about what had happened with Morin. She also remembered speaking with someone named Marta about the abuse. She testified that she did not tell her mother about the incidents of molestation because she “didn‟t think that [her mother] would believe [her].”', 'On cross-examination, Sally stated that she did not remember anything about meeting with Brandstromskelding, even after Morin‟s counsel attempted to refresh her recollection by having her review Brandstromskelding‟s notes of their conversation. Sally also admitted that,', '-6- during a pretrial proceeding, she had not mentioned the incident in the bedroom. She did not recall going to the police station and speaking with Det. Dicomitis on September 28, 1992.', 'Because the trial testimony of Brandstromskelding and Det. Dicomitis largely mirrored their testimony at the suppression hearing, we discuss the relevant portions of their trial testimony in our analysis rather than summarize their testimony in this portion of the opinion. On cross-examination, both Brandstromskelding and Det. Dicomitis testified that Sally had not told them about the incident in which Morin touched her in her bedroom.', 'Over Morin‟s objection, his statement to police was admitted as a full exhibit through Det. Dicomitis.', 'The state then rested. After the trial justice denied Morin‟s motion for a judgment of acquittal, pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, Morin rested as well. On November 4, 2009, the jury returned a verdict, finding Morin guilty on count 1 and not guilty on count 2.', 'Morin filed a motion for a new trial on November 17, 2009, pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.9 The trial justice heard arguments on that motion on January 27, 2010. Morin argued that the jury‟s verdict—guilty on count 1 and not guilty on count 2—was “confused * * * and perhaps * * * logically inconsistent.” In response, the prosecutor suggested that Morin‟s “acquittal on count 2 provides an additional measure of comfort in the verdict itself.”', 'The trial justice stated that he was “well satisfied that [Sally‟s] claim of digital penetration was truthful.”', 'He also indicated that he was “completely satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that [Morin] engaged in this activity specifically for the purpose of sexual 9', 'On December 17, 2009, one month after filing his original motion for a new trial, Morin filed an amended motion for a new trial. Because Morin withdrew this amended motion on January 27, 2010, when the trial justice heard arguments on his original motion for a new trial, we do not address it.', '-7- gratification or arousal.” Furthermore, he agreed with the prosecutor that Morin‟s acquittal on count 2 strengthened, rather than weakened, his confidence in the verdict. The trial justice concluded that, “based upon [his] independent assessment of the evidence, * * * [Morin] was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt as to the charge of first-degree child molestation as alleged.” Accordingly, he denied Morin‟s motion for a new trial.', 'At a hearing on March 24, 2010, the trial justice sentenced Morin to forty years imprisonment, with fifteen years to serve and twenty-five years suspended, with probation. Judgment of conviction entered on June 14, 2010. Morin timely appealed to this Court.10', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Morin raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, which was directed at the statement he gave to Det. Dicomitis. As he did below, he contends that this statement should be suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful arrest.', 'Second, he maintains that the trial justice should have redacted a portion of that statement, which he describes as “irrelevant and highly prejudicial.” Lastly, Morin argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. We address each of his contentions in turn. 10', 'Appeals filed prior to the entry of final judgment are considered timely. See State v. DeRobbio, 62 A.3d 1113, 1118 n.7 (R.I. 2013) (citing Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 n.1 (R.I. 2011)).', '-8-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Motion to Suppress', 'In Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 576 (1980), the United States Supreme Court held that “the Fourth Amendment * * * prohibits the police from making a warrantless and nonconsensual entry into a suspect‟s home in order to make a routine felony arrest.” Relying on Payton, Morin argues that the trial justice should have suppressed his statement to police as the fruit of an illegal arrest. Although Payton, 445 U.S. at 590, explicitly authorized warrantless in- home arrests made under “exigent circumstances,” Morin contends that the trial justice did not “explicitly” find that exigent circumstances justified his arrest.', 'Although the trial justice did not make an explicit finding of exigent circumstances, our review of the record shows that this finding was implicit in his decision to deny Morin‟s motion to suppress. The trial justice characterized Brandstromskelding as “a detached state officer” and credited her description of the confrontation that ensued at Morin‟s residence after his wife learned that he had admitted to molesting Sally. He also credited her testimony that she called police and requested them to come immediately after Morin‟s wife slammed a butcher knife into the kitchen table. He found that “with the overall heightened concern that had arisen out of violence, * * * [Officer Green] would have truly been derelict in his responsibilities if he did not act as he acted [in arresting Morin].”', 'Likewise, we conclude that exigent circumstances justified Morin‟s warrantless arrest in his home. Officer Green had received information that a violent confrontation had taken place and that Morin‟s wife was (quite understandably) enraged after finding out that Morin had', '-9- molested Sally. As the trial justice noted, Morin‟s admissions to Brandstromskelding, which she relayed to police, “[p]lainly” furnished probable cause to arrest him. The trial justice further observed that “if anybody was to be removed [from the house] at that point, it seems to me it would have been [Morin], who had caused the escalation of the violence as a result of [his] statements * * *.” In these circumstances, Officer Green must have “ha[d] a reasonable belief that his assistance [was] required to avert a crisis.”11 See State v. Goulet, 21 A.3d 302, 313 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Duquette v. Godbout, 471 A.2d 1359, 1362 (R.I. 1984)); see also State v. Portes, 840 A.2d 1131, 1137 (R.I. 2004) (“This Court is mindful that police are in the emergency service business and they usually have little or no time to leisurely consider their options or engage in protracted evaluation.”).', 'Morin also urges this Court to reject New York v. Harris, 495 U.S. 14, 21 (1990), in which the United States Supreme Court declined to apply the exclusionary rule to statements obtained after a warrantless arrest in violation of Payton. In light of our conclusion that Morin was validly arrested under Payton because exigent circumstances existed, we need not consider whether the Rhode Island constitution requires us to apply a broader exclusionary rule. See In re Brown, 903 A.2d 147, 151 (R.I. 2006) (“Neither this Court nor the Superior Court should decide constitutional issues unless it is absolutely necessary to do so.”); see also State v. Werner, 615 A.2d 1010, 1014 (R.I. 1992) (“[S]tate courts should respect the manner in which [the Fourth Amendment] is interpreted by the Supreme Court.”). 11', 'In most cases, the testimony of the arresting officer should provide the basis for the conclusion that he or she reasonably believed that exigent circumstances existed. Under the facts of this case, we conclude that, although Officer Green did not testify at the suppression hearing, “the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [his] action[s]” because Brandstromskelding‟s testimony sufficiently demonstrated the existence of exigent circumstances. See Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398, 404 (2006) (quoting Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 138 (1978)).', '- 10 -', 'Although Morin argues that the trial justice should have suppressed his statement to police as the fruit of an unlawful arrest, he has not pressed on appeal any additional grounds for suppression. Because we hold that Morin was validly arrested, and because we perceive no error with the trial justice‟s conclusion that Morin knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his Miranda rights, we affirm his decision to deny Morin‟s suppression motion.', 'B', 'Redaction', 'Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence allows a trial justice to exclude relevant evidence “if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * * *.” “[A] trial justice‟s discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be used sparingly.” State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008). He or she must exclude evidence that is “marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial.” Id. This Court will affirm a trial justice‟s evidentiary ruling under Rule 403 “absent an abuse of discretion.” DeJesus, 947 A.2d at 883.', 'Morin moved to redact portions of his statement which contained references to counseling; he also requested redaction of two lines which contained crude language. The pertinent portion of his statement, including those two lines, is below:', '“Q: You freely admit that you have sexually touched your', 'daughter [Sally] and you feel that it is a problem that you', 'have. Is this statement correct [?]', '“A: Yes. And that I wish to seek further counseling.', '“ * * *', '“Q: Have you ever sort [sic] counseling before [?]', '“A: Yes, through the mental health center.

I just wanted to stop it. I stopped it all on my own.”', 'After Morin argued that he would be unfairly prejudiced if the trial justice admitted his statement to police without redacting the portion of his statement reproduced above, the trial justice stated:', '“I think it‟s part and parcel and relevant to what he', 'says. He * * * says the reason [he sought] counseling was,', '* * * for „paper pussy‟ magazines; and, the officer says,', 'what do you mean by that? He says, it‟s to cut out and', 'masturbate with them. And, in the same breath he says, I', 'wanted to stop that and I stopped it on my own. The officer', 'says, why did you touch the children? And, he says,', 'because it was something new.', '“I think these statements are quite relevant to the', 'rest of the statement; I‟m not going to redact them at all.', 'The motion to redact is denied.”', 'Having considered the contested portion in the context of Morin‟s entire statement, as well as the remainder of the evidence against him—including Sally‟s damning testimony—we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the statement in its entirety. Regarding the reference to “paper pussy,” any prejudice that may have inhered to Morin from that crass and offensive phrase was undoubtedly overshadowed by the most prejudicial aspect of his statement: his admission that he had molested his stepdaughter. While that phrase may well have raised some eyebrows among the jury, Morin‟s explanation of why he molested Sally— because “[i]t was something new” after he stopped masturbating to pornographic magazines— was highly relevant evidence. Furthermore, as the trial justice recognized, the references to counseling were “part and parcel” of Morin‟s explanation of his behavior.', 'Morin claims that “[t]he distinct possibility existed that the jurors would be so disturbed by learning of [his] private sexual activities, legal though they might be, that they would be unfairly prejudiced against him and fail to analyze the evidence in an objective manner.”', '- 12 - However, his acquittal on count 2 proves that the jury did, in fact, analyze the evidence objectively. The trial justice did not err in refusing to redact Morin‟s statement to police.', 'C', 'Motion for a New Trial', '“When deciding whether to grant or deny a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror.” State v. Navarro, 33 A.3d 147, 156 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 640-41 (R.I. 2011)). “The trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 641). If the trial justice has set forth sufficient reasoning to support his or her ruling, this Court “accord[s] great weight” to that ruling on appeal. Id. (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 641). We will not reverse the trial justice‟s decision unless “we are convinced that [he or she] committed clear error or * * * overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case.” Id. at 156- 57 (quoting Pineda, 13 A.3d at 641).', 'Morin argues that “[Sally‟s] testimony as to the first[-]degree molestation was too vague to support a conviction” and that she “was not a credible witness.” We disagree. Sally did have some difficulty remembering the details of the bedroom incident; presumably, this is why the jury acquitted Morin on count 2. However, her testimony regarding the first molestation incident in the living room reflected a painfully clear memory. She clearly stated that Morin “put them [his fingers] in [her].”', 'We discern no error with the trial justice‟s decision to deny Morin‟s motion for a new trial. The trial justice correctly articulated and thoughtfully applied the applicable standard for', '- 13 - that decision. He credited Sally‟s testimony that Morin had digitally penetrated her and found that he had done so “specifically for the purpose of sexual gratification or arousal.” He also noted that Morin‟s acquittal on count 2 strengthened his confidence in the verdict.

The defendant, Richard Paiva, appeals pro se from a September 20, 2017 decision and an April 2, 2018 order of the Providence County Superior Court denying his motion to correct his sentence. He contends on appeal that his sentence was illegal in that it did not comply with the language of the habitual offender statute. See G.L. 1956 § 12-19- 21(b). This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In September of 2010, Mr. Paiva pled nolo contendere to a charge of domestic murder in the first degree and agreed to habitual offender status in exchange for the dismissal of two other counts against him. He was sentenced to life on the domestic murder count. In addition, he was sentenced to a term of fifteen years as a habitual offender, ten years of which sentence were non-parolable', '-1- with five years suspended and five years probation, to be served consecutively to his sentence on the domestic murder count.1', 'On September 6, 2017, Mr. Paiva filed the instant motion to correct his sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. On September 20, 2017, his motion was denied in a bench decision rendered by a justice of the Superior Court, which denial was then reflected in the April 2, 2018 order entered in this case. Mr. Paiva has appealed that denial.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Mr. Paiva argued below and argues before this Court in his “Statement of Case and Summary of Issue” that his plea agreement was “illegal” because “[t]he Habitual offender statute clearly and unambiguously mandates that the court shall announce a parole eligibility date * * *.” He asks this Court to “announc[e] parole eligibility at 1/3 of the 10 year sentence; or in the alternative, to vacate his plea and sentences, in whole.”2 In his “Supplemental Memorandum,” he adds that he “unknowingly entered into a plea agreement, which * * * included an illegal non- parolable ten (10) year sentence.” He asserts in that memorandum that his entire plea should be vacated because his sentence “was the result of a plea agreement, and not a sentence following a conviction after a trial * * *.” 1', 'We note that Mr. Paiva did file a motion for postconviction relief, which was ultimately withdrawn and was dismissed with prejudice by the Superior Court on May 3, 2016. 2', 'Mr. Paiva filed a document before this Court entitled “Statement of Case and Summary of Issue” as well as a document entitled “Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant’s Supplemental Statement of the Case and a Summary of the Issue.” We have considered the contentions made in both of those documents and in his “Supplemental Memorandum.” We add that we decline Mr. Paiva’s invitation in his “Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant’s Supplemental Statement of the Case and a Summary of the Issue” to “clarif[y] * * * the ambiguity of his sentence.”', '-2-', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'Rule 35 permits a court to “correct an illegal sentence at any time.” It has been “well established that [d]ecisions concerning Rule 35 motions are within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Roberts, 59 A.3d 693, 697 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). As such, “[o]ur authority to review a trial justice’s decision on such a motion is extremely limited and should be exercised only when the sentence is without justification * * * and grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). However, this Court has stated that, “[w]hen faced with the interpretation of statutes and court rules upon review of a Rule 35 motion * * * we apply a de novo standard.” Id.

Given that Mr. Paiva’s contentions in this case require this Court to interpret § 12-19- 21(b), we shall do so in a de novo manner.', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'Mr. Paiva moved, pursuant to Rule 35, to correct what he contends was an illegal sentence. In this appeal of the denial of that Rule 35 motion, Mr. Paiva specifically calls into question the interpretation of the habitual offender statute—§ 12-19-21(b). The particular statutory language in the habitual offender statute to which Mr. Paiva directs this Court’s attention provides as follows:', '“If it appears by a preponderance of the evidence presented that the', 'defendant is a habitual criminal under this section, he or she shall', 'be sentenced by the court to an additional consecutive term of', 'imprisonment not exceeding twenty-five (25) years; and provided', 'further, that the court shall order the defendant to serve a', 'minimum number of years of the sentence before he or she', 'becomes eligible for parole.” Section 12-19-21(b) (emphasis', 'added).', '-3- In focusing on this statutory provision, we are guided by the following important axiom: “It is a fundamental principle that, when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” State v. Diamante, 83 A.3d 546, 548 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Only when a statute is ambiguous do we “apply the rules of statutory construction and examine the statute in its entirety to determine the intent and purpose of the Legislature.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Upon careful consideration of the statutory language at issue, this Court concludes that that language is clear and unambiguous. The statutory language does not require that a sentencing justice set a particular date when a defendant will be eligible for parole. The statute simply provides that a defendant must serve a minimum number of years (to be determined by the sentencing justice) before being eligible for parole. Mr. Paiva was sentenced under the statute to fifteen years, with ten years thereof being non-parolable. In so doing, the sentencing justice correctly complied with the statute at issue by ordering Mr. Paiva to “serve a minimum number of years of the sentence before he * * * becomes eligible for parole.” Section 12-19-21(b). What is more, even though the statute does not require the sentencing justice to issue a specific parole eligibility date as Mr. Paiva contends, in this case it is in fact clear that the parole eligibility date on Mr. Paiva’s habitual offender sentence is the date on which ten years of that sentence will have been served.', 'Accordingly, we perceive no error on the part of the hearing justice in denying Mr. Paiva’s motion to correct his sentence.', '-4-', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the above-stated reasons, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.

24,No. 2017-216-M.P. (P1/06-2054A) State : v. : Michael D’Amico. :,reversal,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This case is before the Court pursuant to writs of certiorari. On June 19, 2007, the defendant, Michael D’Amico, pled nolo contendere to charges brought in P1-2006-2054A and P2-2006-1662A, which included two counts of first degree robbery, one count of conspiracy, and three counts of felony assault. He was sentenced to ten years to serve for the conspiracy charge and twenty years for each robbery and assault charge, with ten years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation. All sentences were to run concurrently. 1 D’Amico now seeks review of two Superior Court judgments, entered in 2012, adjudging him to be a violator of his probation. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on November 27, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed on behalf of the parties, we conclude that cause 1', 'It appears from the record that D’Amico was released from prison in September 2011, although the basis for his release, whether on parole or at the expiration of his sentence, remains unclear.', '-1- has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Around 11:30 on the morning of November 23, 2011, Khurshid Siddiq and Edwin Cowgen were enjoying a smoke break outside a 7-Eleven convenience store on Charles Street in Providence. Siddiq, the franchisee and manager of the store, and Cowgen, a 7-Eleven “field consultant,” noticed a man wearing sweatpants and a hooded sweatshirt enter the 7-Eleven and grab a drink from the cooler. The man’s hood was pulled tightly about his face, leaving only the area between his eyebrows and upper lip visible. Siddiq later testified that, despite the man’s garb, he could see that the man had a “light moustache” and “sunken eyes.” Siddiq testified that, from inside the store, the man pointed at them and gestured for them to come inside. They did so, believing that the man was a customer. To their chagrin, however, the hooded man was not in the store to make a purchase, and he soon proclaimed his intentions with the blunt, straightforward announcement: “This is a robbery.”', 'Cowgen immediately stepped aside and told the robber that he was not an employee of the establishment. The man displayed what Siddiq and Cowgen both believed to be a handgun and demanded all the cash in the register, roughly $400, as well as some cigars and cigarettes. During the encounter, a customer approached the counter to make a purchase, but was rebuffed by the hooded character, who, according to Cowgen, told the customer, “turn the f around or I’ll rob you old man.” All told, the robbery lasted between two and four minutes, and it was recorded in its entirety from several angles by the store’s surveillance cameras.', '-2-', 'Eventually, the cowled figure concluded the heist, and Siddiq watched him on a video camera as he walked away from the store. As soon as the robber left the premises, Cowgen “hit the panic button” to call the police. When the police arrived, Cowgen and Siddiq provided statements to the responding officers, and Cowgen gave police a basic description of the culprit.', 'The Providence police officers circulated an email throughout the department containing a photograph of the unknown robber, that had been harvested from surveillance video at the 7- Eleven.', 'After two officers suggested that the hooded figure in the photograph might be D’Amico, police responded to his residence, which was, coincidentally, but a short distance from the crime scene.', 'In January 2012, the state filed a Rule 32(f) violation report in the Superior Court, alleging that D’Amico had violated the terms and conditions of his probation in the two underlying criminal cases by robbing the 7-Eleven convenience store two months earlier. 2 A two-day violation hearing was held in May 2012, at which both Siddiq and Cowgen testified for the state. Also, D’Amico presented testimony by a Providence police detective who investigated the robbery.', 'Siddiq testified that, sometime after the robbery occurred, Providence police showed him a photographic array consisting of pictures of six different individuals.', 'A photograph of D’Amico was included in the array. Siddiq said that, after he examined the photographs one by one, he circled the photograph of D’Amico, signed his name, and wrote “This is the guy who has robbed us.” He also testified that he had seen the hooded man in the store on one or two prior occasions. Siddiq also identified D’Amico, from the witness stand, as the man who had held up the store. When pressed to explain the level of confidence he had in his identification, he 2', 'A separate criminal complaint filed against D’Amico relating to the November 23, 2011 robbery was later dismissed.', '-3- testified that, although he was not one hundred percent sure, “one cannot be a hundred percent sure of anything”; but he also said that there was no doubt in his mind that D’Amico was the person who had robbed the 7-Eleven.', 'When Cowgen took the stand, he testified that, when police asked him to pick the robber out of a photo array, he remembered identifying one of the individuals in the array who he believed closely resembled the 7-Eleven robber, but that his identification had not been positive or conclusive because “they did have a hoody on, it was scrunched up pretty tight.” When pressed on cross-examination, Cowgen was unable to determine which photograph in the array he had previously identified for police as possibly being the assailant. When asked whether Cowgen recognized D’Amico as he appeared in the courtroom, Cowgen testified that he did not. According to Cowgen, 7-Eleven employees are instructed that “you’re not suppose[d] to look into a robber’s eyes because that’s an indication that you’re being confrontational.”', 'The state also introduced several exhibits for the hearing justice’s consideration, including the six-photograph array presented to Siddiq, video surveillance that captured the robbery as it happened, and two still photographs taken from video surveillance recordings—one of the hooded robber’s body and face in profile and another of his partially obscured facial features as he faced the camera.', 'The hearing justice credited Siddiq’s identification and further opined that the photograph of the robber’s face was a “dead ringer” for D’Amico.', 'He concluded: “I have no question in my mind that the [s]tate has proved its case that Mr. D’Amico has clearly violated his terms and conditions of his suspended/probationary sentence[.]” Accordingly, the hearing justice removed the suspended portion of the sentences previously imposed for D’Amico’s 2007 conspiracy,', '-4- assault, and robbery convictions, and ordered that he serve ten years’ incarceration on the previously imposed concurrent sentences.', 'D’Amico did not appeal from the resulting judgments of conviction and commitment. Five years later, however, D’Amico filed petitions for the issuance of writs of certiorari with this Court, claiming that his attorney had failed to inform him that he had a right to appeal the violation hearing. We granted certiorari on September 11, 2017, and ordered that the certiorari petitions be consolidated on October 27, 2017.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“‘Keeping the peace and remaining on good behavior are conditions of probation,’ and the sole purpose of a probation violation hearing is for the [hearing] justice to determine whether the conditions of probation have been violated.” State v. Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d 45, 48 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Waite, 813 A.2d 982, 985 (R.I. 2003)). “In determining whether or not a defendant has committed a probation violation, the hearing justice is charged with weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses.” State v.

We afford great deference to the hearing justice’s adjudication of a probation violation, and our review of such an adjudication “is restricted to considering ‘whether the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in finding a violation.’” Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48 (quoting State v. Seamans, 935 A.2d 618, 621 (R.I. 2007)). “Challenges to a trial justice’s credibility determinations typically are unavailing in this Court because the assessment of witness credibility ‘in a probation violation hearing is a function of the', '-5- [trial] justice, not this Court.’” State v. Gibson, 126 A.3d 427, 431 (R.I. 2015) (alteration in original) (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 49); see Waite, 813 A.2d at 985.', 'At the time of the violation hearing in this case, the state had only to “prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the hearing justice that the defendant [had] violated the terms and conditions of the previously imposed probation.” State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 499 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48). Significantly, a 2016 amendment to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure increased the state’s burden of proof such that it must now establish “by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant breached a condition of the defendant’s probation or deferred sentence or failed to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” Super. R. Crim. P. 32(f). However, even with that change, the state’s burden of proof in a probation violation hearing remains “far less exacting” than that required for a conviction in a criminal trial. Gibson, 126 A.3d at 431.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, D’Amico argues that the hearing justice ascribed undeserved evidentiary weight to the photograph of the robber and to Siddiq’s testimony and, in doing so, acted arbitrarily and capriciously in finding that D’Amico had violated the conditions of his probation. Alternatively, he argues that his case should be remanded to the Superior Court for a new probation violation hearing in accordance with the June 21, 2016 amendment to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Because the proper standard for determining whether a violation has occurred is a threshold matter, we discuss D’Amico’s alternative argument first.', '-6-', 'A', 'Rule 32(f)', 'D’Amico’s probation violation hearing took place in May 2012. At that time, Rule 32(f) required only that the state “prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the hearing justice” that D’Amico had violated the terms and conditions of his probation. Hazard, 68 A.3d at 499. That rule was amended a full four years later to require a higher burden of proof. In re Amendments to Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and Sentencing Benchmarks, at 1 (R.I., filed June 16, 2016) (mem.). In accordance with that amendment, the state is now required to establish “by a fair preponderance of the evidence” that a probationer has violated the terms and conditions of his probation. Super. R. Crim. P. 32(f). D’Amico argues that his case should be remanded for a new probation violation hearing under the new standard because, he avers, his “violation appeal was still pending” at the time the amendment was enacted “because it had not been properly made[,]” and, therefore, “[t]he judgment below was, and still is, not final.”', 'We do not agree. It is true that “[t]ypically, when a new rule of criminal procedure is announced during the pendency of a defendant’s direct appeal, the defendant will benefit from a retroactive application of that rule.” State v. Pona, 926 A.2d 592, 605 (R.I. 2007).', 'The judgments in this case, however, were not pending direct review when Rule 32(f) was amended—not “because it had not been properly made” as D’Amico claims, but rather because the judgments had not been appealed at all. It is here that we diverge from D’Amico’s argument; in our opinion, the judgments were final.', 'Judgment in these cases was entered on May 22, 2012. From that date, D’Amico had twenty days to file an appeal under Article I, Rule 4 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, but he did not do so. As a result of his failure to take a timely appeal, the judgments', '-7- became final. See Marcello v. Neves, 912 A.2d 420, 420 (R.I. 2006) (mem.); Bilotti v. LaSalle, 506 A.2d 1362, 1365 (R.I. 1986). The judgments were final in 2016 when Rule 32(f) was amended, and they remain final today. 3 This Court’s grant of certiorari to review the judgments did not act in any way to transmute the judgments from final to “pending appeal,” because there was no appeal. A writ of certiorari is a matter of judicial grace and cannot be used as an end-run around a final judgment for the purpose of exploiting favorable changes to the Rules of Criminal Procedure made years after that judgment was entered. 4', 'B', 'Sufficiency of the Evidence', 'D’Amico argues that the evidence presented at his probation violation hearing was insufficient to support the hearing justice’s conclusion that D’Amico had breached the terms and conditions of his probation and, as such, the hearing justice acted arbitrarily and capriciously when he found that he had violated the terms of his probation. After closely examining the record in this case, we can discern no error by the hearing justice.', 'The evidence in this case was more than enough to “prove to the reasonable satisfaction of the hearing justice that the defendant [had] violated the terms and conditions of the previously imposed probation.” Hazard, 68 A.3d at 499 (quoting Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48). Siddiq testified that a distance of only three feet separated him from the hooded figure during the 3', 'We are mindful of D’Amico’s claim that his failure to timely appeal could be attributed to his attorney’s failure to inform him of his right to appeal. Indeed, it was this claim that formed the basis of his petitions for certiorari. Nevertheless, whether or not D’Amico’s failure to take a timely appeal was a consequence of his attorney’s advice, or lack thereof, the judgments “became final upon expiration of the period allowed for appeals[.]” Marcello v. Neves, 912 A.2d 420, 420 (R.I. 2006) (mem.). 4', 'Further, the committee notes for the 2016 amendment to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure make it clear that the heightened burden of proof was intended to be applied prospectively only.

His vantage point and the amount of time that elapsed during the encounter provided ample opportunity for Siddiq to identify his assailant when he later viewed the photo array.', 'Moreover, the state presented photographs of the suspect—both in profile and looking toward the camera—to the hearing justice, who had the benefit of studying the photographs after having heard and observed Siddiq testify.', 'D’Amico makes much of the stressful nature of the robbery, that the robber was wearing a hood that obscured a significant portion of his face, the fact that Cowgen was unable to identify D’Amico in the photo array or at the violation hearing, that 7-Eleven employees are trained to avoid eye contact with those holding up stores, and that the photographs presented to the hearing justice were of less than pristine quality. Nevertheless, “[i]t is the duty of the hearing justice to weigh the relevant, material evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” Jackson, 966 A.2d at 1229. In this case, the hearing justice heard the testimony of Siddiq and Cowgen and compared pictures of the robber to D’Amico’s visage as he appeared in the courtroom. It was the hearing justice’s confident opinion that the individual depicted in the photographs before him, despite their grainy quality, was a “dead ringer” for D’Amico, and he chose to credit Siddiq’s identification of D’Amico over Cowgen’s failure to make an identification.', 'It is not a function of this Court to “second-guess” the supportable credibility assessment of the hearing justice at a probation violation hearing.', 'Jackson, 966 A.2d at 1229.', 'The deference we afford to the hearing justice is not simply theoretical, but “is premised upon our realization that we lack ‘the same vantage point as the presiding judge, and we are unable to assess the witness[es]’ demeanor, tone of voice, and body language.’” State v.

This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On November 29, 2011, defendant was charged by criminal information with five counts of embezzlement in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-41-3 1 and one count of conspiracy to commit 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-41-3 states, in pertinent part, that:', '-1- embezzlement in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6. 2 The criminal information alleged that, between June 1, 2007, and December 31, 2008, defendant colluded with Kimberly Gostomski to embezzle funds totaling $166,303. 3 These funds were entrusted to defendant in his capacity as a real estate attorney; Gostomski worked as defendant’s paralegal. 4 A jury trial was held in January 2014. The evidence adduced at trial may be summarized as follows.', 'Martin Aguilar was the first witness to testify. Aguilar testified that, on July 24, 2008, he purchased real estate in Coventry from E.M.C. Mortgage Group (E.M.C. Mortgage) for $140,000, which he financed through Sun Trust Mortgage, Inc.

Mortgage after the closing. Aguilar ostensibly purchased title insurance from defendant underwritten by Mortgage Guarantee & Title Insurance Company (Mortgage Guarantee & Title). Aguilar stated that, at the closing, defendant gave him a commitment for title insurance, which defendant had signed, and a closing protection letter, which insured Sun Trust Mortgage against loss arising out of “[f]raud or dishonesty of the * * * [a]pproved [a]ttorney in handling [its] funds.” E.M.C. Mortgage never received the sales proceeds from defendant. Aguilar testified that, approximately one month after the closing, E.M.C. Mortgage’s attorney notified him that defendant had never disbursed any funds. Aguilar further testified that he met with Chief Disciplinary Counsel David Curtin and also filed an insurance claim with Mortgage Guarantee & Title. According to Aguilar, however, Mortgage Guarantee & Title informed him that his title insurance policy was “null and void.”', 'Next, the jury heard testimony from Joseph Tavarozzi. Tavarozzi explained that, in February 2008, he refinanced two existing mortgage loans on his real estate located in Warwick through IndyMac Bank (IndyMac). The defendant was the settlement agent for the refinancing transaction; and, on February 29, 2008, IndyMac wired $147,862.27 to defendant’s IOLTA account. The defendant was expected to disburse a total of $137,916.13 to Countrywide Home Loans (Countrywide) on February 29—$101,691.35 to pay off Tavarozzi’s first Countrywide loan and $36,224.78 to pay off Tavarozzi’s second Countrywide loan. Tavarozzi also purchased title insurance from defendant underwritten by Mortgage Guarantee & Title. Tavarozzi attested 5', 'Article V, Rule 1.15(f) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct requires an attorney to deposit client or third-party funds into an interest-bearing trust account, the interest proceeds of which are payable to the Rhode Island Bar Foundation. These accounts are referred to as Interest on Lawyers’ Trust Accounts or “IOLTA” accounts.', '-3- that, at the time of the closing, he was three months ahead on his mortgage payments to Countrywide.', 'According to Tavarozzi, approximately four months after the closing, Countrywide notified him that his mortgages had not been paid. Tavarozzi testified that, upon receiving this notification from Countrywide, he attempted to contact defendant, but was never able to reach him. Instead, he spoke to Gostomski about the unpaid loans. Tavarozzi attested that, in June 2008, Gostomski called him to inform him that the first loan had been paid. Tavarozzi further testified that he received another call from Countrywide in August 2008 notifying him that the second loan for $36,224.78 was still outstanding. Tavarozzi explained that he again attempted to contact defendant, and, unable to reach either defendant or Gostomski, contacted Mortgage Guarantee & Title to file a claim under his title insurance policy. Tavarozzi attested that Mortgage Guarantee & Title paid Countrywide the outstanding balance on his second loan. The defendant never paid Countrywide the $36,224.78 on Tavarozzi’s second loan.', 'The jury also heard testimony from Michele Green, Senior Corporate Underwriter and Vice President of First American Title Insurance Company—formerly known as Mortgage Guarantee & Title. Green testified that defendant was an agent with Mortgage Guarantee & Title from January 2007 through May 2008. On May 9, 2008, however, Mortgage Guarantee & Title terminated its agency agreement with defendant because, as it explained in its correspondence to defendant, he failed to complete an “escrow review.” According to Green, an escrow review monitors for agent fraud and includes examining attorneys’ IOLTA accounts, real estate closing documents, and cross-referencing policies issued with premiums collected. Green testified that, upon defendant’s termination from Mortgage Guarantee & Title, the company promptly blocked defendant’s access to its computer systems and notified all lenders to which it had issued closing protection letters, and whose transactions were still pending with defendant, that it was revoking', '-4- the closing protection letters because defendant was no longer an active agent.', 'Green further recalled that, in August 2008, Tavarozzi contacted her to file a claim under his title insurance policy. According to Green, on Friday, August 29, she attempted to contact defendant about Tavarozzi and left defendant a voice mail saying, “We have somebody in our office who is making extremely serious allegations about a closing that you conducted. This is very[,] very serious. I need to speak to you right away. Please call me or e-mail me.” In response, defendant emailed Green, notifying her that he was on his way to his office to “get [her] the information A.S.A.P.”', 'Green testified, though, that she did not hear back from defendant until Tuesday, September 2, despite “dozens” of attempts to contact him over the holiday weekend. At 9:47 a.m. on September 2, defendant sent Green an email reading, in part, “The loan was not paid off. First thing this morning I requested an up-to-date payoff and will be wiring out the funds as soon as I receive it [sic] * * *.” The subject line read “15 Chelmsford Avenue Warwick”—Tavarozzi’s address.', 'According to Green, however, she had never disclosed to defendant which client she was contacting him about.', 'On Wednesday, September 3, defendant sent Green and her supervisor an email informing them that, prior to Green’s contact on August 29, 2008, he was not aware that Tavarozzi’s first loan had been paid late and that the second loan had not been paid at all. In the email, defendant acknowledged that Gostomski was informed of this and that she had “numerous phone conversations” with Tavarozzi. In the email, defendant also wrote that he “ordered the payoff [on] the second mortgage [and that it would] be paid today or tomorrow” and that he had “taken steps to ensure that this [did] not happen again.” Green replied by sending defendant a fax questioning his version of events, writing in part:', '“The series of events you describe [do] not make a lot of sense, or', 'stand up to scrutiny. Your recitation of events seems to suggest', '-5-', 'that your paralegal Kim either misappropriated the funds from this', 'closing or, for some unknown reason, failed to make the', 'disbursements even when numerous calls from the client were', 'made. She further, according to you, failed to notify you of any of', 'these events.', '“It is my understanding that, despite her having committed these', 'grievous errors in judgment, she is still in your employ.', '“In any scenario of events, had no misappropriation taken place,', 'your client account would have had nearly $138,000 in it for 5-6', 'months that you would have no accounting for. How would that', 'have escaped your notice?', '“In any event, since you have chosen to ignore our numerous', 'phone calls of this morning seeking an explanation of these', 'discrepancies, or proof that these funds have indeed been in your', 'client account for these entire six months, you can expect to be', 'required to deliver such explanations and proof to Rhode Island', 'Disciplinary Counsel and the Rhode Island State Police, both of', 'whom have now been notified.”', 'Green testified that defendant never responded to her fax. Green further testified that she knew defendant had not paid off Tavarozzi’s second loan with Countrywide. Green attested that, with respect to Tavarozzi’s insurance claim, Mortgage Guarantee & Title paid off his second Countrywide loan.', 'Green also attested that Mortgage Guarantee & Title received a title insurance claim from Aguilar alleging that defendant never disbursed the sales proceeds after Aguilar’s closing. Green testified, however, that Mortgage Guarantee & Title had never issued a title insurance policy to Aguilar and that the closing protection letter and title insurance commitment defendant gave to Aguilar were forged.', 'Next, the jury heard testimony from defendant’s alleged co-conspirator, Gostomski. Gostomski explained that she met defendant while she was working for another real estate attorney and that, after leaving that attorney’s office, she remained in contact with defendant. Gostomski testified that, in or around January 2007, Gostomski and defendant began a romantic', '-6- relationship. Gostomski further attested that, by that time, defendant had opened his own real estate law office and, in March or April of that year, she began working for him. Gostomski testified that she was defendant’s only employee, and that her position included preparing all pre-and-post-closing documents for the office’s real estate transactions. Gostomski attested that, at some point during the course of her employment, she began doing “some,” but not “all,” of the bookkeeping. According to Gostomski, although she was not listed as a signatory on either defendant’s IOLTA or business-operating account, she, with defendant’s permission, issued and signed checks from both of these accounts. Gostomski testified that she did not have the ability to access defendant’s accounts online, but that defendant monitored both accounts’ activities regularly. She recounted that she “would come in usually in the morning and that was usually up on the computer[;] what the balances were, what transactions had transpired in both accounts * * *.” Gostomski also testified that defendant had what she believed to be the business- operating account’s only ATM card.', 'According to Gostomski, in February and March 2008, the office began to unravel, meaning that “a lot of things got overlooked” and “were not being handled correctly.” At this time, she explained that defendant’s business-operating account was frequently overdrawn, and, on occasion, she had transferred unearned legal fees from defendant’s IOLTA account to his business-operating account. Gostomski testified that, even as the number of real estate closings continued to decrease, defendant never changed his spending habits. Gostomski attested that, when the business-operating account balance was really low, defendant would ask her “[w]hat do we have in the pipeline?”', 'Gostomski further testified about defendant’s working relationship with Mortgage Guarantee & Title. Gostomski testified that, during Mortgage Guarantee & Title’s repeated', '-7- attempts to audit defendant, defendant instructed her to withhold certain IOLTA account statements. According to Gostomski, during this time, defendant considered becoming an agent with another title insurance company, but did not pursue the matter any further after the company requested to review defendant’s IOLTA account statements. Gostomski testified that defendant “kept saying that [they] needed to open a new IOLTA account and start fresh so that there was [sic] no discrepancies.” She further attested that defendant would intentionally avoid Mortgage Guarantee & Title’s representative saying, “[H]ere comes [a representative] from Mortgage Guarantee. I’m going to go out the back door * * *.” Gostomski also testified that she believed that she saw the cancellation notice from Mortgage Guarantee & Title on defendant’s desk.', 'Gostomski also testified about the Aguilar closing. According to Gostomski, because Mortgage Guarantee & Title terminated defendant as an agent, she prepared the closing protection letter for Aguilar’s closing by copying and pasting the letter together from previously authorized letters because defendant told her that “all closings had to close.” Gostomski also testified that defendant gave Aguilar the forged closing protection letter.', 'According to Gostomski, defendant withdrew his legal fee for the Aguilar closing thirteen days before the closing date because defendant needed money. Moreover, Gostomski also testified regarding Tavarozzi’s refinancing transaction. Gostomski stated that, on July 31, 2008, after Tavarozzi contacted her, she initiated a wire transfer to pay off Tavarozzi’s first Countrywide loan— approximately five months after the closing in February 2008. She explained that funds from real estate closings are typically, in the case of a sale, disbursed immediately after the closing and, in the case of a refinance, disbursed three days after the closing. Gostomski testified that, after Mortgage Guarantee & Title contacted defendant about Tavarozzi, “[i]t did [not] seem like [defendant] took it as serious as [she] did” because he left the office that day as usual.', '-8- Gostomski also acknowledged that she had a criminal record and that defendant learned about this in December 2007. 6', 'Lori Tellier, a certified public accountant, certified fraud examiner, and civilian investigator in the state police’s financial crimes unit, was the final witness to testify. As part of the state police’s investigation into the allegations against defendant, Tellier conducted a forensic audit of defendant’s IOLTA and business-operating accounts. Tellier testified that this audit revealed that defendant, in fact, on several occasions did not disburse funds to the proper payees, despite having received sufficient funds from each lender prior to each transaction. Tellier further testified that defendant made improper disbursements from his IOLTA account. According to Tellier, total outflows from defendant’s IOLTA account to defendant, between January 2007 and September 2008, totaled approximately $496,000. Tellier attested that, out of the $496,000 withdrawn from defendant’s IOLTA account, only $386,678.35 was legal fees earned by defendant. Tellier testified that her analysis revealed a pattern wherein transfers, including online transfers, were made from defendant’s IOLTA account to his business-operating account to prevent the operating account from being overdrawn.', 'Tellier determined that approximately $168,000 entrusted to defendant was not remitted to the proper payees. Tellier testified that defendant spent this missing client money on personal expenses. She explained that defendant made over $87,000 in ATM withdrawals from his business-operating account. Tellier further explained that, from his business-operating account, defendant used the missing client money to pay the following estimated personal expenses: 6', 'On direct examination, Gostomski acknowledged that, in 1995, she pled nolo contendere to embezzlement and was sentenced to an eight-year suspended term of incarceration with probation. Further, in 1998, she pled nolo contendere to the fraudulent use of credit cards and was sentenced to a three-year term, with two years to serve in home confinement and the remainder to serve on probation. And, in 2001 and 2002, she pled nolo contendere to the fraudulent use of checks and was sentenced to a one-year suspended term of incarceration and one-year probation.', '-9- $30,000 in mortgage payments; $13,000 in car payments; $6,700 in grocery purchases; $8,600 in clothing purchases; $14,000 in household purchases; $9,600 in entertainment purchases; $1,800 in restaurant charges; $2,800 in furniture purchases; and $11,000 to Gostomski in addition to her weekly payroll. Tellier also testified about a $5,000 internet transfer from defendant’s IOLTA to his business-operating account that, according to the state, coincided with his vacation to Pennsylvania.', 'Additionally, the parties stipulated to the following facts. On June 21, 2007, defendant was the settlement agent in a real estate transaction involving Frank Hennessey and Normand LeClair. Hennessey and LeClair, as Trustees of the Hennessey/LeClair Trust, sold real estate located in Exeter for $35,000, and, on June 21, the sales proceeds were deposited into defendant’s IOLTA account. Because Hennessey and LeClair were not Rhode Island residents at the time of the sale, defendant was required to withhold a total of $2,100 to pay the nonresident real-estate-sales tax due to the Rhode Island Division of Taxation. The defendant never made any payments to the Division of Taxation to satisfy Hennesey and LeClair’s tax obligation and, as a result, the state withheld the taxes due from Hennesey and LeClair’s income tax refunds that tax year. Further, on March 17, 2008, defendant was the settlement agent in a real estate transaction involving Kevin Williams, who purchased real estate located in Providence. Wachovia Mortgage Funding, Williams’ lender, wired funds into defendant’s IOLTA account on March 17 and 18 of 2008. Out of these funds, defendant withheld $1,115.58 to pay real estate property taxes due to the City of Providence, but he never made the payment to the city.', 'At the close of the state’s case-in-chief, defendant filed a motion for judgment of acquittal, which was heard and denied on January 15, 2014. The defendant did not present any witnesses. After deliberation, the jury found defendant guilty of three counts of embezzlement', '- 10 - (counts 3, 4, and 5) and of conspiracy to commit embezzlement (count 6), but acquitted defendant of two other counts of embezzlement (counts 1 and 2). Thereafter, defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which was heard on February 10, 2014. The defendant argued that “the evidence presented by the [s]tate at trial was not sufficient * * * to prove * * * guilt beyond a reasonable doubt * * *.” In denying the motion, the trial justice agreed with the jury’s verdict, finding that the evidence of defendant’s knowledge and intent was “overwhelming.” On April 30, 2014, the trial justice sentenced defendant to a fifteen-year term of incarceration for counts 3, 4, and 5, to run concurrently, with four and a half years to serve, the balance suspended, with probation. On the conviction for conspiracy, the trial justice sentenced defendant to a five-year suspended term of incarceration, with probation, to run consecutively. Subsequently, defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. 7', 'II', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because there was insufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict and in “fail[ing] in his role as the thirteenth juror by misconceiving the evidence.” Additionally, he argues that the trial justice erred in admitting Green’s fax correspondence because it was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.

He asserts that the evidence adduced at trial proves only that he was negligent in monitoring his IOLTA account and in supervising Gostomski. Indeed, as defendant sees it, the trial justice was clearly wrong in crediting Gostomski—whom he described as a “jilted girlfriend and veteran embezzler”—when there was evidence to suggest that she was directly responsible for these crimes.', 'It is well-settled that a defendant arguing a motion for a new trial may do so on two bases: (1) insufficiency of the evidence and (2) weight of the evidence. State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 570-71 (R.I. 2009). Although defendant challenges the “sufficiency” of the evidence on appeal, which would require an examination of the trial evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235 (R.I. 2011), “[defendant’s] arguments and presentation of the law * * * to the trial justice * * * ask[ed] that his appeal be viewed through the prism of the more traditional, weight-of-the-evidence standard.” State v. Fleck, 81 A.3d 1129, 1133 (R.I. 2014). Specifically, at the hearing on his motion for a new trial, although defendant articulated that the evidence was insufficient, he nevertheless asked the trial justice, “sitting as * * * a thirteenth juror,” to weigh the evidence. Accordingly, we deem his argument as it relates to sufficiency of the evidence to be waived, and we limit our review to his weight-of- the-evidence argument. See id. 8 8', 'In any event, even if we were to deem defendant’s sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument to be preserved (despite his asking the trial justice to weigh the evidence), “a defendant seeking to prevail on a motion for a new trial based on the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavier burden than does a defendant seeking to prevail on a weight of the evidence argument * * *.” State v. Mendez, 116 A.3d 228, 246 (R.I. 2015). Because we affirm the trial justice’s finding that defendant failed to meet the lesser burden, we need not go further.', '- 12 -', '1. Standard of Review', 'When deciding a motion for a new trial based on the weight-of-the-evidence standard, “the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v.

Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 841 (R.I. 2013)). “In so deciding, ‘the trial justice must consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, then independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and also ultimately determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 841- 42). “If, after conducting this independent review, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Id.

The fourth step of the analysis requires the trial justice to “determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice. If the verdict meets this standard, then a new trial may be granted.” State v. Guerra, 12 A.3d 759, 765-66 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v.

McKone, 673 A.2d 1068, 1073 (R.I. 1996) (quoting State v. Oliveira, 432 A.2d 664, 666 (R.I. 1981)). The defendant contends that the state failed to prove that he intentionally converted his clients’ property.', 'After a careful review of the trial transcript and exhibits, it is our opinion that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence, and that he articulated sufficient grounds for denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice found that the evidence of defendant’s knowledge and intent was “overwhelming.” He described the “significant paper trail” introduced through Tellier’s extensive testimony.', 'Further, he considered Tellier’s testimony that transfers from defendant’s IOLTA to his business-operating account coincided with vacations and that the amount of income defendant received significantly exceeded the legal fees he earned. He determined that the witness testimony and documentary evidence were sufficient to support defendant’s convictions. The trial justice’s findings were all supported by the record, and the evidence presented at trial met the necessary elements to convict defendant of', '- 14 - embezzlement.', 'With respect to counts 3, 4, and 5, defendant was the settlement agent for each transaction and, accordingly, he was entrusted with funds for the specific purpose of disbursing those funds after each closing. As Tellier testified, defendant’s bank records showed that, prior to each transaction, he received sufficient funds to make the required disbursements. Tellier further testified that defendant’s bank records showed that, in each of these transactions, he never disbursed the funds to the proper payee. In the case of Aguilar (count 5), defendant received $126,215.97 from Aguilar’s lender, which he was required to disburse to the seller after the closing. The defendant never made this disbursement. In the case of Tavarozzi (count 3), defendant received $147,862.27 from Tavarozzi’s lender—$36,224.78 of which should have been disbursed to Countrywide to pay off Tavarozzi’s second mortgage loan. The defendant, again, never made this disbursement.', 'And, in the case of Williams (count 4), defendant stipulated that he never disbursed $1,115.58 to the City of Providence on behalf of Williams.', 'It is also our opinion that the trial justice did not overlook material evidence when deciding that the evidence adduced at trial established the intent element of embezzlement. The trial evidence not only established that defendant failed to disburse the monies to the proper payees; it also established that he actually spent much of the money on himself. As previously noted, Tellier specified that defendant was using his business-operating account for personal expenses, from car payments to furniture purchases, totaling roughly $75,000, while at the same time failing to disburse the necessary payments to the proper payees.', 'Therefore, the trial justice’s determination that the evidence adduced at trial supported a finding that defendant “intended to appropriate and convert the [money] to his own use and permanently deprive [another] of the use,” was not clearly wrong. See McKone, 673 A.2d at 1073 (quoting Oliveira,', '- 15 - 432 A.2d at 666).', 'It is this Court’s opinion that the record established each element of embezzlement as alleged in counts 3, 4, and 5. 9', 'Moreover, the evidence also showed that Mortgage Guarantee & Title terminated its agency agreement with defendant because he failed to complete its annual escrow review. Further, Green testified about defendant’s evasive and misleading responses to her inquiries. The defendant’s uncooperativeness in completing Mortgage Guarantee & Title’s escrow review, and his attempts to avoid Green, coupled with the evidence of how he handled the money entrusted to him, all support the basis for the inference that he acted with the requisite intent to embezzle. It is clear to us, therefore, that the trial justice conducted the appropriate analysis and was not clearly wrong in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'B', 'The Admissibility of Green’s Correspondence', 'The defendant further maintains that the trial justice erred in admitting into evidence Green’s fax correspondence expressing her opinion about his veracity and credibility because it was both irrelevant and prejudicial. The trial justice found that Green’s correspondence was relevant to the issue of intent and that its probative value “outweighed its prejudicial effect.” In our opinion, the admission of Green’s correspondence at trial was a sustainable exercise of the trial justice’s considerable discretion in evidentiary rulings. 10 9', 'The defendant makes no argument to this Court that the evidence was insufficient to meet the conspiracy charge; accordingly, we do not address count 6. 10', 'The trial justice admitted Green’s correspondence under the business record exception to hearsay.

Thus, “absent a showing of abuse of this discretion, this Court will not disturb a ruling concerning the admissibility of evidence.” Id. (quoting Calenda, 787 A.2d at 1199). Further, Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides for the exclusion of relevant evidence “if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.” This Court has stated that “determinations of relevance and prejudice are within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and such determinations will be upheld absent a showing of an abuse of this discretion.” DiPetrillo v.

Green’s fax correspondence is the final communication from Green to defendant in a chain of communications between the two. The communication is relevant, as it created a timeline of events that led to defendant’s ultimate prosecution. It also made it more probable that defendant had notice of the misappropriations of funds or, at a minimum, of the severe allegations that Green was making regarding such misappropriations. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in finding that the evidence was relevant.', 'Moreover, Rule 403 provides that “evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice * * *.” “It is within the sound discretion of the trial justice whether to admit or exclude evidence under Rule 403.” State v. Mlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 997 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 927 (R.I. 2005)). We have “said that ‘a trial justice’s discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be used sparingly,’ and ‘[i]t is only when evidence is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that a trial justice must exclude it.’” Mlyniec, 15 A.3d at 997 (quoting State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008)).', 'In reviewing the trial justice’s Rule 403 balancing, it is our opinion that he was not clearly wrong in finding that the probative value of Green’s correspondence outweighed its prejudicial effect. Green’s correspondence, as discussed herein, was more than “marginally relevant.” Moreover, in light of the abundant inculpatory evidence against the defendant, both through trial testimony and exhibits, the defendant failed to show how Green’s correspondence was “enormously prejudicial” to him. In our opinion, while the correspondence was clearly unfavorable to the defendant, it did not reach the level of being unfairly prejudicial. We also note that to the extent that Green’s correspondence improperly gave an opinion regarding the', '- 18 - defendant’s credibility—a function solely for the jury—the defendant did not request that the correspondence be redacted to remove such characterizations of credibility.

On appeal, the defendant presents two claims of error: (1) that the trial justice improperly excluded testimony from one of the responding police officers which concluded that the defendant was afraid of the complaining witness; and (2) that the trial justice erred in denying her motion for a new trial. This matter came before the Supreme Court on February 25, 2016, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided.', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant’s conviction arises from an incident that occurred on the afternoon of August 10, 2012, between her and the complaining witness, Rick Butler (Butler). At that time,', '-1- Butler and defendant were living with defendant’s mother, Brenda Washington, who is Butler’s cousin, and defendant’s sister, G’tobia Washington, 1 in a three-story, townhouse-style apartment located at 214 Hillside Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island. 2 Brenda and defendant each occupied separate bedrooms on the second floor of the apartment and shared the second-floor bathroom, while Butler and G’tobia each occupied separate bedrooms on the third floor and shared the third-floor bathroom.', 'As Butler tells the story, on the afternoon of the altercation, he was between shifts at his jobs at Burger King and Walmart. He was in a hurry and wanted to take a shower, but both bathrooms were occupied—the second-floor bathroom by defendant and the third-floor bathroom by G’tobia. Butler testified that he asked Brenda if she could “talk to one of the girls and let [him] use the restroom” so he could get ready for work. Brenda went upstairs to ask defendant how much longer she would be occupying the bathroom, to which she responded: “Not too long, Mom.” According to Butler, fearing that he would be late, he reluctantly opted to skip the shower and instead decided to just put on his uniform and go to his shift at Walmart.', 'Butler further testified that at this point, he told G’tobia that he felt as though he “was being nit-picked” and that the sisters had set him up to be late by purposely occupying both bathrooms at a time when they knew he needed to get ready for work.', 'According to Butler, an argument then ensued between him and defendant on the second- floor “landing area” of the apartment. Butler testified that defendant put her hand in his face twice and that, at one point, her hand “touched his nose.” Butler “removed” defendant’s hand from his face, and the two “got into it.” Butler testified that defendant pushed him, he pushed her back, and then defendant “left the scene and went in her room and came out with a box cutter 1', 'To avoid confusion, we will refer to Brenda and G’tobia by their first names. 2', 'Butler moved in with Washington in late 2011.', '-2- * * * and started just swinging it.” Butler went on to testify that defendant was “just like cutting * * * just was going everywhere” and demonstrated for the jury a “vigorous slashing motion.” Butler testified that he felt a cut across his left bicep and inner forearm. He stated that the incident ended shortly thereafter because G’tobia had called the police.', 'Butler added that the police took a photograph of the cut on his forearm and that this was the only photograph of his injuries taken at that time. Butler testified that afterwards, he left the house to go to Walmart to explain to his managers what had transpired. After leaving Walmart, Butler testified that he came back to the apartment and then took a walk “to clear [his] mind.” He then went back home, went upstairs to take a “bath;” and, “when [he] went into the bathroom, [he] noticed that there was a big gash up on [his] arm.” Thereafter, Butler took Brenda’s cell phone, walked up the street, and called the police, who arrived that evening and took a photograph of the newly-discovered cut on his left bicep.', 'Aside from Butler, the state called only one other witness, Officer Stephen Carrig (Officer Carrig) of the Newport Police Department, who, along with another officer, initially responded to the altercation. Officer Carrig testified that he spoke to “all the parties involved,” including both Butler and defendant, and photographed the scene, Butler, and defendant. Officer Carrig further stated that he was also one of the officers who responded to Butler’s call later that evening.', 'G’tobia, Brenda, and defendant all testified for the defense. G’tobia took the stand first. She testified that, at the time of the incident, Butler had not been getting along with anyone in the house. She recounted that, on the day of the incident, Butler was upset because defendant went to his place of work and took the car that they shared because she needed to use it. She testified that, after Butler came home from work that afternoon and after she thought he was done using', '-3- the third-floor bathroom, she went into the bathroom to take a shower. She then recalled that Butler came upstairs and started banging on the door, saying he needed to use the bathroom. She said she tried to calm him down by indicating she would be out of the bathroom soon, but that Butler kept banging on the door saying, “[t]hese bitches, they keep playing * * * I’m going to show them I’m not playing.” G’tobia recounted that she came out of the bathroom shortly thereafter and saw Butler and defendant “arguing back and forth”—defendant was standing in front of the closet doors on the second floor, and Butler was standing on the second step going up to the third floor.', 'She testified that Butler turned the altercation into a physical one when he “jumped” on defendant and was “just punching her.” G’tobia stated that defendant “started to fight back” and hit Butler and that Brenda tried to break up the altercation. After deducing that Brenda was not going to be able to break up the fight, G’tobia stated that she went into Brenda’s room to call the police. G’tobia testified that she never saw defendant holding a box cutter, but that she heard a box cutter was involved and relayed that over the phone to the police dispatcher. She stated that she did not see any injuries on Butler and that the altercation ended shortly after she announced the police were on their way.', 'Brenda was the next to testify, and she too stated that Butler was not getting along very well in her home, especially with her daughters. Her version of events was similar to that of G’tobia’s and also indicated that it was Butler who turned the altercation physical. She testified that she saw defendant with a box cutter and that defendant cut Butler on the arm when “he [went to] swing at her face again[.]” She further narrated that, after the police had come and gone, she gave Butler a ride to Walmart, picked him up about ten minutes later, and when they returned home, he asked to borrow her cell phone and left the house. She stated that when Butler', '-4- returned, he first went upstairs, and then came back downstairs and told her “I just found another cut on me[.]”', 'The defendant was the last to take the stand. She testified that, on the afternoon in question, Butler was banging on the door of the third-floor bathroom while G’tobia was occupying it. The defendant recalled that she tried yelling up the stairs to calm Butler down and that, in response, Butler ran down the stairs “charging at [her]” and “got in [her] face and started yelling at [her].” The defendant next testified that “out of nowhere” Butler punched her in the face and she pushed him in an effort to get him off her. She further stated that, during the altercation, her back was to her bedroom door and, at some point, Butler “pushed [her] or punched [her]” and she “kind of * * * lost [her] balance.” The defendant said that, when she regained her balance, she saw the box cutter3 within arm’s reach on her bedroom dresser, grabbed it, and swung it at Butler because she thought “he’d get out of [her] face and leave [her] alone.” The defendant testified that she saw two cuts on Butler’s forearm, but did not see them until after the police arrived and the altercation had ended.', 'After the defense rested, the trial justice—without objection from either party—instructed the jury, including an explanation of the law as it pertained to self-defense and the duty to retreat. 4 On February 11, 2014, the jury found defendant guilty of the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon, a box cutter.', 'The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Defense counsel argued that the motion was not a typical “pro forma motion” for the purposes of appeal, but that “[t]he jury got [it] wrong.” The defense relied on the 3', 'The defendant testified that she used the box cutter at her job at Walmart. 4', 'During deliberation, the jury submitted a specific question regarding the law of self-defense and the duty to retreat. In response, the parties agreed that the trial justice would reread the self- defense instruction that had been previously given.', '-5- question the jury asked during deliberation that related to the retreat doctrine to support its contention that the jury “did not buy [Butler’s] testimony in toto”—specifically, the portion of his testimony that suggested defendant was the initial aggressor. In ruling on the motion, the trial justice noted that it was undisputed that defendant was “wielding” a box cutter and that Butler was in fear for his safety at that time. He also noted that, while portions of Butler’s testimony “stretch[ed] his credibility[,]” the jury was entitled to disregard those portions it considered non-believable and credit those portions it found to be believable. As such, the trial justice found that the portions of Butler’s testimony the jury found to be believable supported a conviction of felony assault, and he denied defendant’s motion.', 'On April 21, 2014, defendant was sentenced to five years imprisonment, suspended, with five years of probation. 5 A judgment of conviction was entered on April 24, 2014; defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standards of Review', '“We will not disturb a trial justice’s evidentiary ruling without first determining that the ruling constitutes a clear abuse of his or her discretion.” State v.

First, she claims that the trial justice abused his discretion by not allowing Officer Carrig to testify that she was “scared” of Butler, which she argues was “extremely relevant” to her defense. She also claims that the trial justice erred in denying her motion for a new trial. We discuss each claim of error in turn.', 'A. Officer Carrig’s Testimony', 'On cross-examination, Officer Carrig was questioned about defendant’s demeanor on the day of the altercation. Officer Carrig testified that defendant was “cooperative” and that she “wasn’t agitated.” When Officer Carrig stated that he “d[id not] recall” any other observations pertaining to defendant’s demeanor, defense counsel attempted to refresh his recollection by having him review a copy of the Domestic Violence & Sexual Assault/Child Molestation (DV/SA) form that was filled out by another officer in connection with the incident. When he was asked if the DV/SA prompted any further recollection as to defendant’s demeanor on the day of the altercation, the state objected. The trial justice then heard the attorneys at sidebar. As', '-7- grounds for the objection, the state argued that the DV/SA form included the phrase “scared of Butler[,]” which the state posited did not refer to the officer’s observation of defendant’s demeanor, but rather memorialized a statement defendant made to the reporting officer. The trial justice indicated that the statement was a conclusion either based on Officer Carrig’s observations or based on a statement made by defendant, and that, if it were the latter, then the statement was inadmissible hearsay under State v. Harnois, 638 A.2d 532 (R.I. 1994). Nevertheless, the trial justice gave defense counsel the opportunity to lay a foundation for the admissibility of Officer Carrig’s testimony that defendant was “scared of Butler.”', 'Defense counsel then tried to broach the topic of how Officer Carrig came to the conclusion that defendant was scared, and the state lodged another objection. The jury was removed from the courtroom, and a voir dire of the witness commenced. During the voir dire, Officer Carrig confirmed that he did not fill out the DV/SA form; rather, his colleague, Officer Nick St. Lawrence (Officer St. Lawrence), completed the form, and he was not consulted. Officer Carrig also testified that he did not recall seeing Officer St. Lawrence fill out the form. Defense counsel asked Officer Carrig if reviewing the form helped him to recall that defendant “was scared of Mr. Butler,” to which Officer Carrig responded in the affirmative. Officer Carrig testified that he came to this conclusion based in part on defendant’s body language and the way she was acting, but also that he could not recall if his conclusion was based on “physical signs [of fear] or if she verbally stated it.”', 'The state fleshed out its objection to Officer Carrig’s testifying that defendant was “scared of Butler” and argued that, absent an accompanying statement, one’s body language or demeanor alone does not indicate fear of a particular individual or object. The trial justice determined that Officer Carrig’s recollection had not been refreshed by the DV/SA form because', '-8- he could not remember whether the statement “scared of Butler” was derived from defendant’s demeanor and/or an accompanying verbal statement, and he ultimately disallowed the testimony.', 'The jury returned, and defense counsel continued to ask Officer Carrig about defendant’s demeanor based solely on his observations and not on any statements made by defendant. Officer Carrig stated that defendant “was upset and seemed to be pretty nervous.” When defense counsel pressed and asked if defendant “was nervous because Mr. Butler was still in the house[,]” the state objected, and the trial justice sustained the objection on the basis of lack of personal knowledge. Officer Carrig’s testimony concluded shortly thereafter.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice was “misguided” in thinking that Officer Carrig’s testimony that she was “scared of Butler” was inadmissible hearsay and implicated our holding in Harnois. In that case, we held that a defendant who did not testify and was not subject to cross-examination could not then “manipulate[]” the rules of evidence by introducing exculpatory statements he made through the testimony of police officers via the “catchall” exception to the hearsay rule, Rule 803(24) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Harnois, 638 A.2d at 535-36. Here, defendant argues that Officer Carrig’s testimony that she was “scared of Butler” was not based on a statement she made, but rather was based solely on Officer Carrig’s observations of her demeanor following the altercation. However, despite being given ample opportunity to do so, defense counsel failed to lay a foundation to demonstrate that Officer Carrig knew defendant was scared of Butler specifically and that his conclusion was based solely on his observations.', 'To begin, we note that Officer Carrig was permitted to testify as to what he observed following the altercation, which included any observations pertaining to defendant’s demeanor. See State v. Bruskie, 536 A.2d 522, 522, 523 (R.I. 1988) (state troopers permitted to testify as to', '-9- their observation that a defendant suspected of driving under the influence appeared to be “belligerent” and “dis-arranged”). Indeed, he testified without objection that defendant was “cooperative” and “wasn’t agitated[;]” and, likewise, he was permitted to testify that she appeared “upset” and “nervous.” Officer Carrig’s testimony became problematic, though, when he attempted to identify Butler as the source of defendant’s fear.', 'We have said that “a witness may not give an opinion as to the inner thoughts or feelings of another person * * *.” State v. Covington, 69 A.3d 855, 866 (R.I. 2013); see State v. Ellis, 619 A.2d 418, 423 (R.I. 1993) (“[I]t can scarcely be contended that in the ordinary course of events a lay witness is able to determine such inner feelings as might arise if a person was threatened. This is a question that a lay witness (and probably most expert witnesses) would be totally unqualified to answer.”). That afternoon, defendant could have exhibited an “upset” or “nervous” demeanor for any number of reasons, not the least of which being that the police were in her mother’s home as a result of a violent altercation she was involved in.', 'Despite being given leeway to do so, defense counsel declined to ask any questions to elicit specific observations made by Officer Carrig that would support his conclusion that the source of defendant’s nervousness or fear was Butler. Additionally, Officer Carrig testified that he could not recall whether his conclusion that defendant was “scared of Butler” was based on physical signs of fear or based on a statement made by defendant. He also testified that he did not author the DV/SA form, nor was he consulted during the process. 6', 'As such, it is questionable that Officer Carrig knew that defendant was in fact scared of Butler in particular. See Rule 602 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“A witness may not testify to a matter 6', ""To be sure, the fact that Officer Carrig did not author the DV/SA form does not bar the defense from using it to refresh his recollection. See State v. Presler, 731 A.2d 699, 704 (R.I. 1999) (noting that “any writing or object may be used in an effort to refresh a witness's recollection * * *” quoting State v. Souza, 708 A.2d 899, 903 (R.I. 1998))."", '-10- unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.”).', 'Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in barring the testimony.', 'B. Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred in denying her motion for a new trial because he overlooked and misconceived material evidence by failing to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and failing to address her self-defense argument. She also takes issue with the fact that the trial justice “disposed of [her] motion for new trial in only six pages of transcript.” However, we have said that “[i]n setting forth the rationale for a decision [on a motion for a new trial], ‘the trial justice need not refer to all the evidence supporting the decision,’ rather he ‘need only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the trial justice applied the appropriate standards.’” State v. Swiridowsky, 126 A.3d 436, 442 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Kizekai, 19 A.3d 583, 589 (R.I. 2011)). We “accord[] great weight to a trial justice’s ruling on [such a motion] if he or she has articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” Id. (quoting Kizekai, 19 A.3d at 589).', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice articulated such reasoning in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial and that he applied the appropriate standard. He correctly assumed the role of the “legendary thirteenth juror,” and exercised his independent judgment when weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses. Karngar, 29 A.3d at 1235 (quoting Clark, 974 A.2d at 569). The trial justice’s decision includes a fairly extensive review of the testimony presented by both sides, and ultimately found that the jury “followed the evidence and', '-11- followed the law as given to it by [the court].” 7 While he noted that portions of Butler’s testimony “stretch[ed] his credibility,” he concluded that the jury was nevertheless “entitled to disregard that portion [of Butler’s testimony] which they found was non-believable, but accept that portion that was believable.” The defendant has not convinced us that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or that he otherwise clearly erred. Thus, we decline to disturb his ruling. See Mendez, 116 A.3d at 247.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction. The record in this case may be returned to that tribunal. 7', 'The defendant also argues that the jury instruction given with regard to her duty to retreat was incorrect. However, the record reveals that defense counsel failed to object to the instruction at the time it was given and even agreed to the same instruction being reread in response to a question submitted by the jury. As such, we need not address this assignment of error. See State v. Whitaker, 79 A.3d 795, 806 (R.I. 2013) (objections to a jury charge that are raised for the first time on appeal are deemed to be waived).', '-12-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

His parents, defendant and Rabiaa Madouch (Rabiaa), were separated in 2006 and their divorce was finalized in 2009. John resided primarily with his mother and had regularly scheduled visitation with his father.', 'In June 2014, after John completed the third grade, he and his mother traveled to Morocco to visit her family for the summer. While spending time with his relatives, John observed how his cousins interacted with other family members and later testified at trial that “[t]hey were all happy, and if something [was] bothering them, they [would] tell their mother or their grandpa or their uncle or whoever.”', 'Rabiaa and John returned to Rhode Island in August 2014; and, soon thereafter, John began the fourth grade. According to Rabiaa, his first homework assignment was to compose ten good things about himself, but John instead wrote about his father.', 'Notably, this essay assignment was the impetus for the charges and ultimate conviction in this case.', 'John, who was nine years old at the time, used the assignment as an opportunity to disclose some of the troubling incidents involving his father that he had been harboring. He wrote as follows, on lined paper marked with his name and dated “8-28-2014”:', '“What I think about my dad', 'He talks about women boobs and daddy gets naked in front of me.', 'My dad watches movies on sex and he does not change the chanal', '[sic]. and I don’t like him.” Rabiaa asked to look at his assignment and was shocked by what her son had written. She met with the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF), and an investigation ensued, which led to John’s disclosures that he had been sexually molested by his father between August 8, 2012, and August 8, 2013, when John was seven and eight years of age.', '-2-', 'The defendant was charged by criminal information with two counts of engaging in sexual contact with John in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3, and a two-day jury trial commenced in January 2017.

Aubin, Sr. Child Protection Center; and Yael Bat-Shimon (Bat-Shimon), a licensed mental-health clinician at Gateway Healthcare.', 'In his testimony, John recounted several incidents that occurred while he was at defendant’s apartment for scheduled visitation.3 John testified that, when he was between the ages of seven and eight, defendant talked to him about women’s breasts and forced him to watch sexually explicit movies. He testified, in response to a question as to what would happen if he did not want to watch them, that “[i]f I tried to leave, he grabbed me by the arm and he forces me to watch them.”', 'John also recalled incidents that took place when he showered at defendant’s apartment. He testified that defendant would order him to take showers and that, when he was in the shower, defendant would enter the bathroom, perform personal grooming tasks, and, when finished, would join John in the shower. John testified that his father “would act like he is scrubbing my body with soap, and then once he gets down to my private, he starts rubbing it.” John testified that defendant would use his own hand while performing this act and that defendant’s penis became erect when defendant touched John’s penis. According to John, defendant responded to John’s pleas to stop by slapping him, and defendant also threatened to kill John if he told anyone. 3', 'The evidence disclosed that defendant originally had visitation rights with John every Wednesday and every other weekend; that schedule was later adjusted to just every weekend, and no Wednesdays.

She had examined John at the request of DCYF for concerns of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and exposure to domestic violence. Doctor Adewusi testified about her examination of John, including disclosures that he had made to her regarding his father.

Thereafter, defendant was sentenced to two concurrent terms of twenty-five years in prison, with fifteen years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation. Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial.', 'Standard of Review', 'When presented with a motion for a new trial, it is well settled that “the trial justice must determine whether the evidence adduced at trial is sufficient for the jury to conclude guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Baptista, 79 A.3d 24, 29 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Staffier, 21 A.3d 287, 290 (R.I. 2011)). Accordingly, “the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the', '-4- evidence.” State v. Baker, 79 A.3d 1267, 1273 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. LaPierre, 57 A.3d 305, 310 (R.I. 2012)). “In this determination, the trial justice must consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, then independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and also ultimately determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” LaPierre, 57 A.3d at 310 (quoting State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 232 (R.I. 2012)).', '“If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)). Alternatively, “if the trial justice does not agree with the jury verdict, ‘he or she is required to proceed to a fourth step * * * to determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.’” Baptista, 79 A.3d at 29 (quoting Staffier, 21 A.3d at 290-91). “If the verdict meets this standard, then a new trial may be granted.” Id. (quoting Staffier, 21 A.3d at 291).', 'Accordingly, “[i]f the trial justice has complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, his or her decision will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (quoting State v. Smith, 39 A.3d 669, 673 (R.I. 2012)). On appeal, we apply this deferential standard of review because “a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Id. (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 141 (R.I. 2008)).', '-5-', 'Analysis', 'The defendant’s sole challenge on appeal to this Court is that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. He argues that the evidence presented at trial raised serious doubt about the allegations and that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence. Specifically, defendant argues that John’s testimony was neither credible nor reliable and that the testimony of the other witnesses failed to corroborate John’s assertions, but instead contradicted critical aspects of his testimony. For this reason, defendant contends that the verdict returned by the jury was against the weight of the evidence and failed to serve the interests of justice.', 'By calling into question the trial justice’s assessment of the testimony and the weight of the evidence, defendant effectively challenges the trial justice’s credibility determinations. However, “[t]his Court has stated that ‘[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.’” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (quoting State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 903 (R.I. 2010)). As we have elucidated on numerous occasions, “the trial justice * * * has [had] the opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testify and therefore is in a better position [than this Court] to weigh the evidence and to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses than is this [C]ourt.” Rivera, 987 A.2d at 903 (quoting State v. Luanglath, 749 A.2d 1, 5-6 (R.I. 2000)). For this reason, we will not disturb the trial justice’s determination on appeal “unless the trial justice clearly erred in his credibility determinations or ‘overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence[.]’” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (quoting State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1368 (R.I. 1994)).', 'A careful review of the record reveals that the trial justice, when considering defendant’s motion for a new trial, articulated the correct analysis to be undertaken, recounted his', '-6- independent observations from trial, and carefully assessed the credibility of the witnesses and weight of the evidence. The trial justice comprehensively articulated his reasons for denying the motion for a new trial. His conclusion—that the overwhelming and credible evidence of sexual contact between defendant and John supported the jury’s finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt—is clear and reflects thoughtful deliberation.', 'Furthermore, in assessing the credibility of the witnesses, the trial justice found John in particular to be “a very nervous ten-year[-]old boy on the stand and some of his answers were contradictory especially when the [c]ourt found he was nervous during cross-examination and began answering correct to just about every question. But with respect to his testimony as a whole, the [c]ourt [found John] to be a very credible witness.” Thus, the trial justice concluded that, based on John’s testimony, the jury could conclude that the requisite elements of the charged offense were proven “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Accordingly, after reviewing the evidence adduced at trial, the trial justice concluded that he agreed with the verdict on all three elements of the charge, and he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Having carefully reviewed the record before us, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive any material evidence. The trial justice conducted an appropriate analysis of the evidence presented, evaluated the credibility of the witnesses, and assessed the weight of the evidence; and, having done so, he determined that sufficient credible evidence was submitted to support the verdict on both counts. We therefore hold that the trial justice did not err in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.

Hey. Why are you looking at me?” Mr. Diop testified that the three men on the wall asked defendant to whom he was speaking and that defendant pointed at Mr. Diop and said: “You. You know who I’m talking to. You. Why are you looking at me? You know I don’t like you.” Mr. Diop testified that he responded to defendant: “Do you own my eyes?

Mr. Diop further testified that, after defendant had stabbed him in the stomach, defendant also stabbed him in his left leg.

The Testimony of Francisco Guerrero', 'The defendant testified3 that, prior to September 1, he had seen Mr. Diop in “different places where you would pick up people” because they had both been employed as taxi drivers in Providence for some time.

First, the trial justice considered the evidence in light of the jury charge; he discussed the lengthy instruction that he had given to the jury regarding self-defense, including his specific instruction to the jury that one may not use excessive force. He also noted that he had “indicated there is a duty to retreat * * *. And there is a test of the defendant’s state of mind, and it is in the consideration as to whether or not defendant’s actions were justified.” He concluded 6', 'It is our considered judgment that defendant’s contention on appeal that the trial justice did not properly consider the excessive force question has been waived. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n.19 (R.I. 2007); Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n.1 (R.I. 2002) (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”). Although defendant alludes to that issue in his briefing before this Court, he makes no meaningful argument with respect to the excessive force issue; instead, he limits himself to challenging the trial justice’s discussion of the duty to retreat. See State v. Mendez, 116 A.3d 228, 242 n.19 (R.I. 2015).', '8 this step of the analysis by noting that he had given an additional instruction as to the state’s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not act in self-defense.', 'Proceeding to the second step in the analytical process, the trial justice independently evaluated the evidence and weighed the credibility of the witnesses. He explained that the video “was a little grainy, and it was sometimes from a distance, but it depicted the entire confrontation at the Providence Train Station that occurred on the date this offense happened.” The trial justice explained:', '“Mr. Guerrero stated * * * ‘I tried to get away, but he cornered me.’', 'That’s my note that I wrote in my trial notebook. The Court did not', 'see that on the video. I didn’t see any cornering.', '“Mr. Guerrero testified, I didn’t feel good. All he kept saying is,', 'I’m going to kill you, and I felt horrible.', '“Now, the Court has considered that, and that differs from Mr. Diop,', 'who was the victim, his version of the events.” Thereafter, the trial justice expressed his disbelief in defendant’s testimony regarding the threats which he alleged Mr. Diop had made, which conclusion, the trial justice stated, was reinforced by the fact that neither Mr. Toribio nor Mr. Lizardo had testified that they heard those statements or threats.', 'The trial justice also stated that, although Mr. Diop was the initial aggressor, defendant had a duty to retreat before acting in self-defense. In State v. Garrett, 91 A.3d 793 (R.I. 2014), this Court noted our well-established doctrine that, before an individual who perceives himself threatened by another may resort to using deadly force, he or she “must attempt to retreat if [he or she is] consciously aware of an open, safe and available avenue of escape.” Garrett, 91 A.3d at 801 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Garrett, this Court upheld the denial of a motion for a new trial because there existed a duty to retreat even when the defendant’s avenue of escape would', '9 have required her to walk over debris and proceed up a set of stairs—even though that avenue of escape involved turning her back to the aggressor. Id. at 804-05.', 'In the course of his ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice determined that defendant did not satisfy that duty to retreat before responding with deadly force (his knife). In our judgment, defendant’s challenge to the trial justice’s determination with respect to defendant’s duty to retreat is unavailing. In reaching his conclusion, the trial justice considered the avenues of retreat available to defendant and noted: “at a minimum, there was an opportunity to back up a few more steps, put some space between Diop and [defendant], and see if Diop advanced further.” The trial justice additionally stated:', '“[I]ndependently, looking at this evidence, the Court feels that, one,', 'the amount of force and the immediate nature of that force was', 'excessive, that there was an opportunity to retreat, and, at the very', 'minimum, there was an opportunity that retreat would have included', 'backing up a few more steps and would allow any observer to see if', 'Mr. Diop was going to continue his aggressions towards Mr.', 'Guerrero.”', 'Additionally, because defendant was familiar with the Amtrak station, having worked as a taxi driver there for some years, the jury was (and the trial justice was) entitled to draw the inference that he was aware of the available avenues of escape in that area. See State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1012 (R.I. 2005) (noting that the jury was entitled to draw an inference as to the defendant’s awareness of an avenue of escape).', 'On certiorari, defendant also emphasizes the short time span within which the scuffle occurred. Notably however, the trial justice expressly recognized “the speed with which this event was unfolding,” and noted that it “is not something that the Court takes lightly.” It is clear to us that the trial justice addressed all of the relevant evidentiary issues, and we perceive no reversible error in his ruling with respect to conducting the second step in the analytical process.', '10', 'Upon concluding the above analyses, the trial justice reached the third step in the analytical process and stated that he would have reached the same result as the jury did. See Silva, 84 A.3d at 416. We note that the trial justice’s conclusion that he would have reached the same result as the jury “is a significant consideration in this Court’s review of a denial of a motion for [a] new trial * * *.” Id. at 418. Because the trial justice would have reached the same conclusion as the jury, he properly concluded his analysis at that point and denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. See Prout, 996 A.2d at 645; Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1028.', 'Accordingly, after a thorough review of the record in this case, it is our judgment that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the trial justice clearly erred or overlooked or misconceived relevant or material evidence in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial. See State v. Yon, 161 A.3d 1118, 1130 (R.I. 2017). We are satisfied that the trial justice more than adequately performed his role under each step of the analysis of the defendant’s motion for a new trial.

A jury in Providence County Superior Court found the defendant, Joseph Silva (Silva or defendant), guilty of reckless driving, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-27-4, which was count two of the original five counts of a criminal information brought against him. Following the jury verdict and the denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice sentenced him. The defendant filed his timely notice of appeal on May 17, 2017. This matter came before the Supreme Court on December 4, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised on appeal should not be summarily decided. After reviewing their submitted memoranda, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and further briefing or argument is therefore not required. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The events giving rise to this case occurred on November 13, 2014. There are two competing versions of what transpired on that day, both of which were presented at a four-day', '-1- jury trial.1 Devin Smith (Smith) testified for the state that he left a restaurant that afternoon and was driving his mother’s car eastbound on Putnam Pike in Smithfield, with three friends in the vehicle, when he approached a red light next to a vehicle, later identified as defendant’s, in the lane to his left. Smith testified that defendant asked him, through their open car windows, if Smith “wanted to see a frog leap.” Smith testified that he was unsure what defendant meant, but responded by saying, “Whatever, Buddy[.]”', 'When the light turned green, both vehicles continued down the road, and, Smith testified, defendant began swerving into Smith’s lane three or four times, forcing Smith to swerve into the far right portion of the roadway, until they eventually reached the traffic light at Esmond Street. Smith testified that, at that light, he came to a stop in the “left only” lane and defendant was in the right “straight only” lane, to Smith’s right. Additionally, Smith testified that, when the light turned green, he attempted to turn left onto Esmond Street, at which time defendant also turned left from his straight-only lane and struck Smith’s car in the rear-passenger side, causing Smith to drive over a mulched area and into a gas station parking lot.', 'Smith further testified that, as he drove to the exit of the gas station parking lot to pull back onto Putnam Pike, defendant again hit Smith’s car, this time in the rear. Smith described that it was “not a bad hit” but “[j]ust, like, a tap.” Smith also testified that, after he left the gas station, defendant followed him down Esmond Street and again hit the back of his car, this time at the intersection of Dean Avenue. Smith explained that, as he drove down Dean Avenue, he was in the right lane and defendant continued on the side of his car “trying to cut in front of [him] to slow [him] down.” Smith testified that, at that point, defendant got out of his vehicle and “threw his hands up”; it looked to Smith as though defendant threw something at Smith’s 1', 'For the purposes of this opinion, we will only discuss the witnesses’ testimony at trial that pertains to the reckless driving charge.', '-2- vehicle. Then, Smith explained, he put his car in reverse, drove home, told his mother what had happened, and called the police. Smith testified that his vehicle never struck defendant’s vehicle. Finally, Smith testified regarding the details of the damage to his vehicle, and photographs depicting that damage were admitted into evidence.', 'The state called Aaron Mazzulla (Mazzulla) to testify next. Mazzulla was one of the three passengers in Smith’s vehicle during the incident; he was sitting in the back seat behind Smith. Mazzulla’s account of the events corroborated Smith’s testimony. William Achille (Achille), the gas station clerk on duty that night, also testified for the state and described that, at around 5:00 p.m., he saw two vehicles speed through the parking lot, stop at the furthest exit, and then get back onto the road. Achille also testified that he did not hear or see any collision take place at the station; rather, he merely heard “[a] little bit of beeping.”', 'The defendant also testified at trial. According to defendant, he was driving home from work when he stopped to pick up dinner for his children. When he left the restaurant, defendant testified, he was traveling on Putnam Pike when he approached a red light near the above- mentioned gas station, and he observed that his mirror had become dislodged and he heard “the sound of change hitting the door, or rocks or sand[.]” The defendant testified that, after his car was struck, he looked to his left and saw a car pulling into the gas station. Thereafter, defendant testified that he used his left directional and pulled into the gas station behind the vehicle because he “figured they knew they hit [his] vehicle, and that’s why they were parking.” The defendant stated that he pulled directly behind the vehicle, at which point the other vehicle reversed and struck defendant’s vehicle, leaving a dent on the front driver’s side above the headlight. Subsequently, the other vehicle pulled westbound onto Putnam Pike and took an immediate right onto Esmond Street. The defendant testified that he followed the vehicle as far as he could', '-3- before losing it. He then returned to the gas station with the hope that someone had seen something or that a police officer would be there. The defendant denied any other interaction with Smith or his passengers.', 'Both Smith and defendant reported their versions of the events to the Smithfield police department. After taking statements and investigating, the Smithfield police arrested defendant on November 20, 2014, and he was ultimately charged by information on May 28, 2015, with assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (count one); reckless driving, in violation of § 31-27-4 (count two); leaving the scene of an accident, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-26-2 (count three); falsely reporting a crime, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-32-2 (count four); and disorderly conduct, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-45-1(a) (count five). Prior to trial, the state dismissed count three pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', 'Subsequently, on April 20, 2017, defendant was convicted by a jury of count two, reckless driving, and acquitted of the remaining counts. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convict him of reckless driving and further contending that the jury did not note the specific location where defendant’s alleged reckless driving took place. On May 15, 2017, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial and sentenced defendant to one year at the Adult Correctional Institutions, the entirety of which was suspended, with probation. The trial justice further ordered defendant to complete anger-management counseling.

Subsequently, defendant twice pled nolo contendere, in 2010 and 2012, to charges of failing to register as a sex offender, for which he was also sentenced to terms of imprisonment and probation.', 'On July 8, 2015, the state filed a probation-violation report in the Newport County Superior Court, pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, alleging that defendant had violated his probation in all three cases by failing to keep the peace and be of good behavior.

The motion was heard before a second hearing justice, sitting in Providence County, who, in response, read from the Rule 48(a) dismissal filed by the state in that underlying case, which stated: “[T]he [s]tate is dismissing these charges in the interest of sparing the victim any further trauma from repeated court appearances. This dismissal shall in no way be construed to imply that the [s]tate indicates a lack of probable cause or any doubt of the culpability of the defendant.” The state objected to defendant’s motion, arguing at that initial hearing that the underlying District Court charges against defendant were dismissed because the state was “satisfied with the sentence as well as sparing the victim of [sic] any further hearing.” The state further argued that defendant had not', '-5- demonstrated any of the five reasons enumerated in § 12-19-18(b) that would mandate that his imprisonment be terminated.', 'The court eventually held an evidentiary hearing.', 'The first witness to testify was assistant attorney general Roger Demers, who was the prosecutor at defendant’s probation- violation hearing.

He did, however, “remember seeing that [there was no probable cause to charge him with a crime] in one of her early reports.”', 'After identifying the Rule 48(a) dismissal filed in the District Court case, Demers testified that the state had dismissed the charges against defendant to ensure that the complaining witness would not be put through any more trauma, including, according to Demers, the “trauma of being sexually assaulted by the defendant and the trauma of having to testify about that sexual assault and undergo a fairly lengthy cross-examination, much of it having to do with irrelevant questions.” He testified further that the “main input was from the victim herself” in the state’s decision to dismiss the underlying charges against defendant; according to Demers, the complaining witness “did not want to continue to have to suffer through this.” He testified that there was no doubt in his mind that there was probable cause in the underlying case and that defendant was culpable for the acts alleged.', 'The defendant then called Det. Wuest as a witness, to which the state objected, arguing that only the state had the discretion to dismiss the charges, and, therefore, the testimony of Det.', '-6- Wuest was not relevant. The hearing justice sustained the state’s objection, but he allowed defendant to examine Det.

Wuest did testify in the offer of proof that, prior to a full investigation of the case, there was a lack of probable cause to arrest defendant, she clearly also testified that, after further investigation, including interviewing witnesses and gathering evidence, there was sufficient probable cause and therefore defendant was subsequently arrested.', 'Section 12-19-18(b)(5) requires that “[t]he charge fails to proceed in the District * * * Court under circumstances where the state is indicating a lack of probable cause[.]” The fact that probable cause may have been lacking preliminarily does not mean that § 12-19-18(b)(5) is applicable, especially when future investigations establish the existence of probable cause.

The defendant, Mario Souto, appeals from a judgment of conviction on three counts—assault of a police officer, resisting arrest, and disorderly conduct—following a two-day jury trial in Providence County Superior Court. The defendant represented himself at trial after the trial justice determined that the defendant had waived his constitutional right to counsel. On appeal, the defendant contends that he did not voluntarily, knowingly, or intelligently waive his right to counsel. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'Pretrial', 'In November 2012, defendant was charged with assault of a police officer (count 1), simple assault (count 2), resisting arrest (count 3), and disorderly conduct (count 4) following an incident with Pawtucket police officers on May 28, 2012. The details of that incident are not necessary for the resolution of this appeal.', '-1-', 'Following his arrest, defendant reached out to the Public Defender’s office for legal representation, but was deemed ineligible for services. By January 2013, defendant had engaged Attorney Thomas Connors (Connors) to represent him, and the case progressed toward trial for over a year. On March 13, 2014, however, Connors moved to withdraw, citing a breakdown in the attorney-client relationship and defendant’s desire to hire a different attorney.', 'After confirming that defendant wanted to dismiss Connors from his representation, and that defendant had the funds to hire a new attorney, the hearing justice granted the motion to withdraw.1 At that 1', 'At the hearing during which the hearing justice considered Connors’ motion to withdraw, the hearing justice’s colloquy with defendant proceeded, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“THE COURT:', 'Is that true, you can’t work with Mr.', 'Connors anymore?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'Yes, Your Honor.', '“THE COURT:', 'And you want to get a new attorney?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'Yes, Your Honor.', '“* * *', '“THE COURT:', 'Can you afford an attorney?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'Yes, I can.', '“* * *', '“THE COURT:', 'Any objection to my letting Mr.', 'Connors go and you will be', 'representing yourself all alone?

At each hearing, defendant represented to the hearing justice that he had attempted to communicate with attorneys to establish representation, but had not yet retained counsel. The defendant also stated at those hearings that he was financially able to retain counsel, but that he was uncomfortable with paying a large sum of money upfront, given his experience with his former attorneys. The defendant further made clear that he did not want to proceed to trial pro se. During a hearing on May 15, 2014, the hearing justice set a status conference for September 2014, and instructed the parties to be ready for trial on or after October 1, 2014.', 'The defendant still had not retained an attorney by the status conference on September 15, 2014.', 'The defendant indicated that he had faced some unforeseen financial issues in the intervening months.

At that time, defendant had not retained counsel and further stated that he could no longer afford to hire an attorney. The second hearing justice continued the case for one week to give defendant time to make an appointment with the Public Defender’s office to determine if he would be eligible for its services. In the week that followed, defendant met with a representative from the Public Defender’s office, but, again, he was deemed ineligible for services. The defendant appeared before the second hearing justice for determination of attorney three more times, and he was granted three more continuances on February 11, February 13, and February 20, until the second hearing justice scheduled a March 11, 2015 trial calendar call with a trial date certain on April 1, 2015.4', 'On April 1, 2015, a private attorney stood with defendant after discussing possible representation, and the second hearing justice, again, continued the matter, this time so the attorney and defendant could meet to determine whether the attorney would be retained. The defendant did not retain that attorney, however, and instead appeared before the first hearing justice again on May 4, 2015, without representation.

You are forcing me to do something I don’t want to do.” The trial justice proceeded with selection of the jury, and, after the jurors were duly sworn, the state gave its opening statement. The trial justice offered defendant the opportunity to give an opening statement, but defendant instead responded: “I take the Fifth. * * * I don’t want to go forward', '-5- because I don’t have an attorney. You guys are forcing me.” The trial justice struck defendant’s comments from the record, informed the jury that “[t]he [c]ourt has determined that this case will go forward with this gentleman being given the opportunity to represent himself[,]” and instructed the state to call its first witness.', 'The state presented three witnesses: former Pawtucket police officer Michael Lajoie, Pawtucket police officer John Donley, and Pawtucket police officer Mark Ramos.', 'Officer Lajoie testified to an encounter with defendant on May 28, 2012, which resulted in a physical altercation between the two during which Officer Lajoie suffered significant injuries. At some point, Officer Lajoie noticed that his “right foot was turned around 180 degrees the wrong direction.” By that time, other officers had arrived for backup, and those officers took defendant into custody while Officer Lajoie was transported to the hospital.', 'Following Officer Lajoie’s testimony, the trial justice asked defendant if he had any questions for the witness, to which defendant replied: “No, because I want to talk to the jurors.”', 'Officer Donley testified next. According to Officer Donley, he and Officer Ramos responded to a call for backup to a store parking lot, and as the two arrived, he observed Officer Lajoie and defendant yelling at each other in a “heated verbal argument.” Officer Donley testified that he then “observed [defendant] push Officer Lajoie to the ground.” When the officers caught up to defendant and Officer Lajoie, they attempted to take defendant into custody, but he resisted. Officer Donley testified that he used pepper spray and an “open hand slap to the side of his face * * * [a]s a distraction technique” to “successfully handcuff [defendant] without further incident.”', 'Officer Donley testified that he observed Officer Lajoie’s foot to be “dangling abnormally[,]” and called a rescue.

However, defendant had difficulty forming questions for the witness and instead began testifying.5 After several unsuccessful attempts at cross-examination, defendant expressed his confusion about the process to the trial justice, and then stated:', '“I don’t want to go forward because I’m not a lawyer or anything.', 'You just handed me the form this morning, and now I went home', 'and that was it.

He gave a similar account to Officer Donley’s testimony.', 'The defendant also attempted to cross-examine Officer Ramos, but was again unsuccessful. The defendant told the trial justice, in the presence of the jury, that he felt unqualified to represent himself, and that the trial justice “forced [him] to go forward.” After the state rested, the trial justice gave defendant the opportunity to testify in narrative form, but defendant declined. The defendant also refused to give a closing statement, saying, “at this point, I don’t know what is going on.” After the prosecutor gave a closing statement, the trial justice charged the jury with instructions and excused them for the day.', 'The following morning, Attorney Thomas DeSimone (DeSimone) entered his appearance for defendant on the record, stating that defendant had retained him around nine o’clock the previous night. DeSimone asked that the “case go back to the beginning so that [defendant] can actually have a lawyer represent him.” The trial justice denied that request.', 'The jury found defendant guilty as to all pending charges: assault of a police officer (count 1), resisting arrest (count 3), and disorderly conduct (count 4).6 6', 'The state dismissed the charge for simple assault (count 2) prior to jury deliberations.', '-8-', 'C', 'Posttrial', 'On May 28, 2015, defendant, who remained represented by counsel, filed a motion for a new trial.

The trial justice concluded that, prior to beginning trial, she had “found that the Defendant willfully and intentionally entered into a strategy to manipulate the system and delay trial indefinitely. And in doing so, he knew he ran the risk of a trial without a lawyer. His strategy was knowing and voluntary and intelligent * * *.”7 Additionally, the trial justice noted that, “[t]he fact that Defendant hired Mr. DeSimone so expeditiously on the night of May 18th demonstrates further, speaks volumes, as to the extent to which Defendant misled the [c]ourt about his inability to engage counsel.” The trial justice further determined that the jury followed the instructions she had given, and that, if she had been sitting without a jury, she would have come to the same conclusion based on the evidence presented at trial.', 'The defendant was sentenced on count 1 to three years’ imprisonment, with fifteen months to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation. As to count 3, defendant was sentenced to one year suspended, with probation, to run consecutively to the sentence for count 1. As to count 7', 'At the hearing on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice agreed that she had not specifically used the words “knowing, intelligent, and voluntary” waiver of counsel on record prior to trial. However, the trial justice emphasized that she denied defendant’s request for a continuance prior to trial after she had determined that defendant’s failure to engage counsel “constituted an intelligent, intentional strategy on the part of the Defendant and an effort to manipulate the system by * * * stalling * * * trial[.]” Moreover, defendant concedes that “[w]hile [the trial justice] did not make this specific finding before the trial began, her ruling made clear that she considered [defendant’s] actions to be tantamount to a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel.”', '-9- 4, defendant was sentenced to six months suspended, with probation, to run concurrently to the count 3 sentence.

Bluitt, 850 A.2d 83, 87 (R.I. 2004).', 'A', 'Voluntary', 'First, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in finding a voluntary waiver of counsel without first independently inquiring into defendant’s indigency status. Specifically, defendant argues that a trial justice is required to “determine whether a defendant is constitutionally entitled to court-appointed counsel, regardless of his or her statutory eligibility for Public Defender representation.” Conversely, the state responds that the Public Defender’s office, alone, is vested with the authority to make indigency determinations under the eligibility statute, G.L. 1956 § 12- 15-9. Furthermore, the state argues that, even if the trial justice was required to inquire about defendant’s eligibility for representation, defendant has not demonstrated that he could not afford an attorney, and in fact, had continuously represented that he was financially able to hire his own representation during pretrial proceedings.', 'In support of his position, defendant cites to cases from other jurisdictions which have held that a defendant is entitled to a separate judicial determination of indigency when the public defender has determined that the defendant is not eligible for services. For example, in People v. Steinbeck, 186 P.3d 54 (Colo. App. 2007), a defendant, whose private counsel withdrew after part of the proceedings, was found to be ineligible for services by the state public defender’s office. Steinbeck, 186 P.3d at 57, 58. The Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that the defendant had been denied his statutory right to judicial review of the indigency determination, and further, his constitutional right to court-appointed counsel. Id. at 59, 60. In so deciding, the court in Steinbeck noted that the mandate for judicial review of indigency determinations was “grounded in a long', '- 12 - history of inherent judicial power to appoint counsel for a defendant without the means to afford counsel in order to ensure a fair trial for the defendant.” Id. at 57. In State v. Dean, 471 N.W.2d 310 (Wis. Ct. App. 1991), the Wisconsin Court of Appeals stated that Wisconsin’s eligibility statute permitted judicial review of an indigency determination, but further commented that “[t]here are situations, as here, where a defendant does not meet certain indigency criteria, but nevertheless is unable to afford counsel.” Dean, 471 N.W.2d at 313, 314. The court in Dean further concluded that a trial justice “is required to go beyond the public defender’s determination that a defendant does not meet the legislative criteria and determine whether the ‘necessities of the case’ and the demands of ‘public justice and sound policy’ require appointing counsel.” Id. at 314.', 'The defendant also relies on Ingram v. Justice Court for Lake Valley Judicial District of El Dorado County, 447 P.2d 650 (Cal. 1968), to support his position that the constitution requires this independent inquiry. In Ingram, the Supreme Court of California was tasked with determining the opposite situation to the case at bar—whether a court may review a public defender’s determination that a defendant was indigent and eligible for services. Ingram, 447 P.2d at 651. The court ultimately held that judicial review of this determination was inappropriate. Id. at 655. Nevertheless, in dicta, the court discussed a scenario similar to the case at bar, and commented that a defendant would be “entitled to judicial review of a determination of nonindigence not because of any language in [California’s eligibility statute] but because of the fundamental constitutional guarantee of counsel to all persons accused of crime.” Id. at 654.', 'However, all three of the cases defendant cites for support are distinguishable from the case before us. Ingram, as we have stated, involved the opposite set of facts to the case before us. See Ingram, 447 P.2d at 651. Furthermore, in Steinbeck, the Colorado Court of Appeals held that “a defendant bears the initial burden of raising his claim of indigency to the court[,]” and that the', '- 13 - defendant in that case had “provided the trial court on more than one occasion with facts indicating that he could not afford to retain counsel.” Steinbeck, 186 P.3d at 56, 59. Similarly, in Dean, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals stated that “[a] defendant who seeks appointed counsel must present evidence to the trial court of his or her assets, income, liabilities and attempts to retain counsel.” Dean, 471 N.W.2d at 315. In that case, the defendant had claimed indigency on multiple occasions, the state had stipulated to the defendant’s indigent status at a postconviction-relief hearing, and one of the judges presiding over the defendant’s proceedings had “specifically stated that [the defendant] could not afford an attorney.” Id. at 312, 315. Conversely, here, defendant continuously maintained before the Superior Court hearing justices that he had funds to hire an attorney. Even after defendant claimed that he was indigent but was deemed ineligible by the Public Defender, defendant again represented to the hearing justices that he would be able to raise funds to hire an attorney.', 'Additionally, the defendants in Steinbeck and Dean were entitled to a statutory right of review of a public defender’s indigency determination under the laws of Colorado and Wisconsin, respectively. Steinbeck, 186 P.3d at 56; Dean, 471 N.W.2d at 313. In Rhode Island, the statute defining eligibility requirements for indigent representation does not expressly mandate or permit a trial justice to review the Public Defender’s determination of ineligibility. See G.L. 1956 § 12- 15-9.9 9', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-15-9 reads, in pertinent part:', '“If the public defender, after examination and investigation of the', 'financial statement, is satisfied that the person submitting it is an', 'indigent defendant, the public defender or one of his or her assistants', 'shall defend the person; provided, that if the public defender is', 'satisfied that the person is not an indigent defendant, he or she shall', 'notify the court which referred the person to the public defender’s', '- 14 -', 'Moreover, this Court has held that a defendant may demonstrate a voluntary waiver of the constitutional right to counsel by his or her actions. See Laurence, 848 A.2d at 254. For example, in Laurence, we determined that a defendant who repeatedly rejected the services of court- appointed counsel had voluntarily waived his right to an attorney, even though that defendant “asserted many times at trial that it was not his desire to represent himself and that he felt coerced into doing so[.]” Id. at 254, 255; see also State v. Thornton, 800 A.2d 1016, 1026 (R.I. 2002) (“[The defendant’s] repeated refusal to accept the services of competent court-appointed defense counsel demonstrates clearly the voluntary waiver of his right to counsel, and that he was not in any way unconstitutionally ‘forced’ to proceed pro se.”).', 'Here, we are of the opinion that, despite defendant’s claims that he was forced to proceed to trial without counsel, defendant’s continuous failure to obtain representation demonstrates a voluntary waiver of counsel. As set forth above, defendant repeatedly represented to two justices of the Superior Court that he was able to afford counsel, but that he was not comfortable with the retainer payment system after his experience with his prior attorneys. Moreover, defendant was generously granted more than ten continuances over the course of fourteen months, yet he still failed to procure representation, notwithstanding his many assurances to the court that he would hire an attorney. As this Court concluded in Laurence, to allow defendant to continue this pattern “would be to prevent any trial whatever until the accused person himself should be pleased to', 'office of the determination that the person is not an indigent', 'defendant.” Furthermore, § 12-15-8 defines an “indigent defendant” as', '“a person who after payment of necessary expenses for food, shelter', 'and medical care, does not have sufficient income or assets to enable', 'him or her to retain counsel nor is there any one to whom he or she', 'is entitled to look for support who has that income or assets.”', '- 15 - permit it.” Laurence, 848 A.2d at 255 (quoting Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 349 (1970)). Thus, as we have held, it is clear that “[t]he defendant’s actions, rather than his words, demonstrate that he waived his right to counsel.” Id. at 254.', 'Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in determining that defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel prior to trial.', 'B', 'Knowing and Intelligent', 'The defendant also argues that he did not knowingly or intelligently waive his right to counsel. The defendant contends that the trial justice did not consider defendant’s lack of understanding that, upon assenting to the motion to withdraw, he would be required to proceed to trial pro se if he did not secure other representation. The defendant asserts that the trial justice looked only to defendant’s actions following the withdrawal and that, therefore, the trial justice’s finding “was based on an incomplete assessment of the circumstances[.]” The state counters that, upon withdrawal of defendant’s retained attorney and over the course of the many subsequent pretrial hearings, “defendant was warned that his two options were to hire a replacement attorney or to represent himself.” Consequently, the state contends, defendant’s waiver of counsel, “by virtue of his refusal to hire counsel for over a year despite repeated opportunities and warnings, was voluntary, knowing and intelligent.”', 'This Court has held that “[a] valid waiver is effective only if a ‘defendant knows what he or she is doing and his or her choice is made with eyes open.’” Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390 (brackets omitted) (quoting Chabot, 682 A.2d at 1380). “A criminal defendant, therefore, should be ‘made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.’” Id. (quoting Chabot, 682 A.2d at 1380). However, this Court has also stated that, while “a detailed colloquy between a trial justice', '- 16 - and a defendant on the record assists the trial justice in ascertaining the knowing and intelligent nature of a defendant’s waiver[,] * * * ‘such an inquiry is not constitutionally required.’” Id. (quoting State v. Spencer, 783 A.2d 413, 416 (R.I. 2001)).', 'The defendant contends that the first hearing justice’s colloquy with defendant prior to granting the motion to withdraw was “clearly insufficient” to enable the hearing justice to be certain that defendant “fully understood the potential consequences of his actions.” A review of the record shows that, at the hearing during which the motion to withdraw was granted, the first hearing justice informed defendant of the seriousness of his situation prior to granting the motion. The hearing justice stated: “Mr. Souto, this is a critical situation as you are facing a felony charge, facing a trial, facing an offer. * * * What you really need right now is an attorney.” The hearing justice further informed defendant that he had a right to represent himself during the legal process. It is also true that the hearing justice did not expressly tell defendant that he would be required to proceed pro se if he did not secure representation prior to trial.', 'However, even if we assume that, at the time of Connors’ withdrawal, defendant did not understand that he might be required to proceed to trial pro se if he did not hire an attorney, this fact does not demonstrate a constitutionally inadequate waiver of counsel. The relevant inquiry here is whether the trial justice erred in finding that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel prior to trial. As we have stated, in the fourteen months following Connors’ withdrawal from defendant’s representation on March 13, 2014, and prior to the May 18, 2015 trial, defendant appeared before two justices of the Superior Court at least a dozen times. At each hearing, the hearing justices emphasized the critical need for defendant to retain an attorney as soon as possible. The hearing justices also made it clear to defendant that the case needed to move to trial, and on several occasions, set trial dates. Importantly, defendant was expressly warned at', '- 17 - several of those hearings that he would represent himself at trial if he did not obtain an attorney, and his responses suggested that he understood this possibility.10 10', 'For example, on May 1, 2014, more than a year before trial, defendant was warned at a pretrial conference that he would be representing himself at trial. The following colloquy took place at that hearing:', '“THE COURT:', 'I’d love to hear the side of your story.', 'For you to say it here is to put you at', 'risk because they’re going to use what', 'you say against you at trial, and you', 'have a right not to incriminate', 'yourself. If we get you to an attorney,', 'you’re protected.', 'I’m trying to protect you. So if you', 'get an attorney, fine. Otherwise, by', 'then, I will read the -- I will read the', 'police report. I will consider that', 'offer, and I’ll hear from you if you’re', 'going to represent yourself.', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'I’m not going to represent myself.', 'How are you going to try to force', 'something?', '“THE COURT:', 'If you’re not going to represent', 'yourself then please do something', 'about it for the sixth time, the sixth', 'time. Do something about it. Get an', 'attorney.” The defendant also would have been aware of this possibility after a brief discussion between counsel for the state and the hearing justice on September 15, 2014, which proceeded as follows:', '“[THE STATE]:', 'This case was already set down for', 'trial on or after October 1st; I ask that', 'it remain. The defendant can', 'represent himself at this point.', '“THE COURT:', 'Even though he’s representing', 'himself, are you going to give any', 'offers?', '“* * *', '“THE COURT:', 'Ready trial after October 1st?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'No, I’m not.”', '- 18 -', 'Moreover, we give deference to the trial justice’s finding that defendant intentionally manipulated the proceedings by “stalling trial perhaps indefinitely or at least until [defendant] totally succeeded in wearing down the resolve of the State and its witnesses * * *.” See Thornton, 800 A.2d at 1030 (“We accord great deference to the trial justice’s factual determination that [the defendant’s] requests for new counsel had been strategically motivated to manipulate and delay the start of his trial, and it is reasonable for us to weigh the manipulative intent factor heavily against [the defendant].”). On the first morning of trial, the trial justice carefully reviewed the travel of the case, noted a defendant’s critical right to be able to choose his or her counsel, and When the matter was set for trial before the second hearing justice, defendant made a representation that he could not afford a lawyer at that time. The hearing justice expressly informed defendant of the consequences of failure to obtain representation:', '“THE COURT:', 'Mr. Souto, you’ve had more than', 'enough time. If you are indigent as', 'you claim you are, you don’t have any', 'money, then you might be eligible for', 'the Public Defender’s office services,', 'but you have to apply. * * *', '“* * *', '“THE COURT:', 'Do you think you can just keep', 'getting this case continued and', 'continued because you say you don’t', 'have a lawyer when it’s called ready', 'for trial back in September?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'No.', '“* * *', '“THE COURT:', 'Either you’re going to the Public', 'Defender’s office or you’re going to', 'represent yourself.', '“* * *', '“THE COURT:', '* * * You are to go see [the public', 'defender],', 'make', 'your', 'own', 'appointment, meet with them, give', 'them the information necessary.

One week from', 'today.”', '- 19 - decided to proceed with defendant representing himself after considering the totality of the circumstances of the case. We see no reason to conclude that this decision was in error or a violation of defendant’s constitutional rights.', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice failed to address the remainder of the Chabot factors, and that these factors would cut in favor of the conclusion that defendant did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to counsel. The defendant argues that his background and experience rendered him incompetent to present his own defense, that he was not afforded standby counsel, and that he did not have any prior “useful experience with the criminal justice system.”', 'First, this Court has been clear that a trial justice is not required to consider all of the Chabot factors absent an issue with defendant’s mental competency. See Laurence, 848 A.2d at 254. There is no suggestion here that mental competency was at issue. Furthermore, we have held that “a trial justice ‘need not make any assessment of the extent of the defendant’s technical legal knowledge in determining the defendant’s knowing exercise of the right to defend himself.’” Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390 (quoting State v. Briggs, 787 A.2d 479, 485 (R.I. 2001)). It is true that defendant did not have standby counsel at the proceedings, and, for the sake of this discussion, we also assume that defendant is relatively unfamiliar with the judicial system. However, given the hearing justices’ clear warnings to defendant at the numerous pretrial hearings about the dangers of proceeding pro se, in addition to the trial justice’s finding that defendant manipulated the proceedings by intentionally delaying his quest to engage an attorney, we cannot say that the trial justice erred in finding that defendant knowingly and intentionally waived his right to counsel.', 'Thus, after careful consideration of the totality of the circumstances, it is our opinion that the defendant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to counsel.', '- 20 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.

32,Anthony Perkins : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,reversal,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Anthony Perkins’s application for postconviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel was denied in the Superior Court, and he appealed to this Court, contending that the trial justice’s decision was in error. This case came before the Supreme Court on October 2, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. We have considered the record and the written and oral submissions of the parties, conclude that cause has not been shown, and proceed to decide the appeal without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 15, 1999, applicant, Anthony Perkins, entered a plea of nolo contendere to a charge of first-degree robbery and was sentenced to twenty years with nine years to serve and eleven years suspended, with probation. While he was on parole from that sentence, applicant was charged with second-degree child molestation. Of relevance to this appeal, the acts on', '-1- which the child-molestation charges were based occurred before applicant was convicted of robbery.', 'On July 25, 2003, applicant pleaded nolo contendere to two counts of second-degree child molestation. Under the terms of a plea agreement, he received a ten-year suspended sentence with ten years probation, both of which would run concurrently with his ongoing sentence on the robbery conviction. Perkins was also required to register as a sex offender and to undergo sex-offender treatment counseling as determined by the probation department.', 'On September 14, 2006, Perkins filed an application for postconviction relief. In that application, he alleged that the attorney who had represented him in the child-molestation case had provided him with ineffective assistance. The applicant alleged that his former attorney advised him that if he had not pleaded to the child-molestation charges, the state would have sought to revoke his probation stemming from the robbery conviction. He further alleged that his counsel told him that the state would then seek the revocation of his suspended sentence and that he would be incarcerated for eleven years, starting immediately. Perkins said that this advice was erroneous because he could not have been found to have violated the terms of his probation based on conduct that occurred before he was on probation. The erroneous advice, applicant claimed, denied him the effective assistance of counsel.', 'The same Superior Court justice who accepted applicant’s nolo contendere plea to the child-molestation charges held a hearing on applicant’s postconviction-relief application. In his decision denying the application, the trial justice said that applicant had presented no evidence that his former attorney gave him erroneous advice except for applicant’s own “self-serving statements and allegations” and that, even if he had been provided with erroneous advice, applicant nonetheless had failed to demonstrate that the result of the earlier proceedings would', '-2- have been different. As a result, the trial justice denied the application, and Perkins timely appealed to this Court.', 'On appeal, applicant argues that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel because of his former attorney’s guidance that, if he did not plead guilty to the child-molestation charges, then the state would have sought to revoke his probation. He also argues that the trial justice abused his discretion when he denied the application in the face of applicant’s uncontroverted testimony during the postconviction-relief hearing.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Postconviction relief is available pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1(a)(1), which provides a remedy to a person who has been convicted of a crime and who demonstrates “[t]hat the conviction or the sentence was in violation of the constitution of the United States or the constitution or laws of this state[.]” See also Hazard v. State, 64 A.3d 749, 756 (R.I. 2013). An applicant for postconviction relief must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the relief should be granted. Id.', 'On appeal, “this Court affords great deference to the hearing justice’s findings of fact and will not disturb his or her ruling ‘absent clear error or a showing that the [hearing] justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.’” Hazard, 64 A.3d at 756 (quoting Higham v. State, 45 A.3d 1180, 1183 (R.I. 2012)).', '“When a postconviction relief decision involves ‘questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights[,]’ we review those issues de novo.” Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 610 (R.I. 2011).', '-3-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'When we evaluate a postconviction-relief application based on an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel, this Court employs the well-known standard articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Hazard, 64 A.3d at 756. Under that exacting standard, applicants must demonstrate both that “counsel’s performance was deficient in that it fell below an objective standard of reasonableness” and that “such deficient performance was so prejudicial to the defense and the errors were so serious as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.” Id. (quoting Tassone v. State, 42 A.3d 1277, 1284-85 (R.I. 2012)).', 'The first prong of the Strickland analysis requires an applicant to show “that counsel’s performance was deficient[, which] requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.” Neufville, 13 A.3d at 610 (quoting Powers v. State, 734 A.2d 508, 522 (R.I. 1999)). To overcome this obstacle, there must be a showing that “‘counsel’s advice was not within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases * * * .’” Id. (quoting Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 315 (R.I. 2009)). There is, however, “a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the permissible range of assistance.” Id. (citing Hazard v. State, 968 A.2d 886, 892 (R.I. 2009)).', 'The Strickland test’s second prong is satisfied by a showing of prejudice resulting from counsel’s deficient performance. Hazard, 64 A.3d at 757. In this context, prejudice is defined as “‘a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different[,]’” id., which, in a plea context, means that the applicant', '-4- “‘would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial’ and, importantly, that the outcome of the trial would have been different.” Neufville, 13 A.3d at 611 (quoting State v. Figueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 500 (R.I. 1994)). Notably, we have said that “when counsel has secured a shorter sentence than what the defendant could have received had he gone to trial, the [applicant] has an almost insurmountable burden to establish prejudice.” Id. at 614 (citing Rodrigues, 985 A.3d at 317).', 'In Figueroa, 639 A.2d at 500, we considered the misrepresentations by counsel to a defendant who had pleaded nolo contendere. There, there was no question that the defendant had been given erroneous advice by his attorney: he was told that his nolo contendere plea was not a conviction under Rhode Island law and that the Spanish-language plea form was identical to the English-language form. Id. We held that “[a]lthough th[e] misrepresentations may have fallen below acceptable standards of attorney performance, [the applicant] did not satisfactorily prove that the outcome would have been different if he had proceeded to trial.” Id. Because the applicant admitted that he committed the gun offense for which he was charged, we said that a trial likely would have resulted in a conviction and sentence of imprisonment. Id. at 500-01.', 'In the case presently before us, the trial justice determined that applicant had failed to demonstrate that he had received the advice that he claims was constitutionally deficient. In his decision, the trial justice recounted that applicant had failed to directly answer questions about whether he had been advised to lie during the plea colloquy and that he also had testified inconsistently about how much he and his attorney had discussed the potential plea. The trial justice also observed that applicant was attempting to persuade the trial justice that he had lied during the plea colloquy but that he was testifying truthfully at the postconviction-relief hearing. Because the trial justice determined that applicant had failed to submit “a scintilla of evidence”', '-5- beyond his own “self-serving statements and allegations,” and because those statements and allegations had failed to persuade him, the trial justice denied the application. 1', 'Although applicant argues to this Court that the advice that probation could be revoked based on conduct that predated the probation would amount to a legal impossibility, and therefore was clearly deficient, he is unable to articulate why we should reject the trial justice’s finding that applicant did not receive that advice from his attorney. See Pelletier v. Laureanno, 46 A.3d 28, 39 (R.I. 2012) (viewing with deference a trial justice’s decision to reject uncontroverted testimony of a party to the litigation and interested witness because he found that it was “not credible,” “self-serving,” and “biased”). Indeed, the trial justice concluded that the advice would have been erroneous if it had been given, but he also found that applicant had failed to satisfy his burden that the advice was in fact given. 2 We cannot say that the trial justice was clearly wrong or that he overlooked or misconceived material evidence when he found that applicant failed to satisfy his burden. See Hazard, 64 A.3d at 756.', 'We are also of the opinion that, even if he had somehow been able to satisfy the first prong of the Strickland analysis, applicant has failed to show that prejudice resulted from any erroneous advice that he may have received. See Neufville, 13 A.3d at 610-11, 614. Other than his own conclusion that he would have been acquitted, Perkins failed to provide any reason why the outcome of a trial would have been more favorable to him than was his disposition. See id. 1', 'The attorney who represented applicant in the child-molestation information and subsequent plea to that charge was not called to testify during the postconviction-relief proceedings. 2', 'Although the determination is not necessary to decide this case, we agree with the trial justice that such advice would have been erroneous. In State v. Bergevine, 883 A.2d 1158, 1158-59 (R.I. 2005) (mem.), we considered “[t]he notion of a defendant being on probation with respect to a criminal offense before being convicted of the crime itself * * * .” We held that it “defies common sense,” “is not legally viable,” and “quite apart from being illogical, is rife with practical problems,” such as the fact that a person could be violated before he or she was sentenced to the probation. Id. at 1158, 1159.', '-6- Indeed, there is nothing on which this Court could base a conclusion that a different outcome would have resulted from a trial. See Figueroa, 639 A.2d at 500-01 (noting the absence of anything that might show an applicant’s innocence and concluding that a trial “most probabl[y]” would have led to a conviction).', 'In Neufville, 13 A.3d at 614, we said that the burden of showing prejudice is “almost insurmountable” when the sentence received after a plea is shorter than the sentence that an applicant could have received had he proceeded to trial. The applicant here was charged with second-degree child molestation under G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3. Pursuant to § 11-37-8.4, the applicant could have been sentenced to between six and thirty years for each count if he was convicted after trial, and those sentences could have been imposed consecutively and even consecutive to the robbery sentence he was already serving. See State v. Fuentes, 433 A.2d 184, 192 (R.I. 1981). By striking a favorable agreement with the state and pleading nolo contendere, he received only a ten-year sentence, all of which was suspended and ran concurrently with his robbery sentence.', 'The applicant has failed to demonstrate that he suffered any prejudice whatsoever from the advice that he contends he received, and his application thus falls short on the Strickland test’s second prong as well.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant, Luis Padilla (defendant or Padilla), appeals his conviction of first-degree robbery1 following a Superior Court jury-waived trial in Providence County.', 'This matter came before the Supreme Court on September 26, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, the Superior Court’s judgment is affirmed. 1', 'Padilla was convicted of first-degree robbery under G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a) after the trial justice determined that he “aid[ed], abet[ted] and assist[ed] Mr. Lugo and Mr. Rivera in the commission of first degree robbery of Justin McFadden on July 24[ ], 2010, and he is therefore guilty as a principal.” See State v. Long, 61 A.3d 439, 447 (R.I. 2013) (“The law is well settled that one who aids and abets in the commission of the crime and is also present at the scene may be charged and convicted as a principal.” (quoting State v. Davis, 877 A.2d 642, 648 (R.I. 2005))).', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This appeal arises from an incident that occurred on July 24, 2010. On that date, Justin McFadden (complainant or McFadden), as he had in the past, went to the Crossroads’2 clinic for medical services. The events that followed his arrival, however, interrupted his purpose and instigated the criminal prosecution that is at issue in this case.', 'McFadden testified that, when he arrived at Crossroads, he carried in his pockets his bank cards, bus pass, approximately $500 in cash, a necklace, and a bag of medication.', 'He immediately went downstairs to the clinic, but learned that he could not be seen for at least another hour. He left and waited his turn in an outdoor locker area, sitting on the concrete floor with his back against a wall. He reported seeing two people, later identified as Juan Lugo (Lugo) and Jackson Rivera (Rivera),3 about five to eight feet away, huddled together and conversing in Spanish. McFadden observed them for a short while before they turned to speak with a third man, later identified as Padilla, waiting outside the gate.4 One of the men walked over to Padilla, who remained outside the gate, and both looked over at McFadden. At that point, they were approximately seventeen feet away from McFadden. From five to eight feet away, the third man continued to look “right at” him.', 'At this point, all three men came together and “came at [McFadden].” Approximately four feet before reaching him, Padilla “broke off” from the group. Rivera and Lugo continued 2', 'Crossroads is an organization in Providence that offers shelter and other services to homeless individuals. 3', 'Lugo and Rivera pled nolo contendere to their charges resulting from this incident and are not involved in this appeal. 4', 'We recognize that the term “gate” is subject to multiple interpretations and, as such, it caused some confusion during trial. The trial justice addressed the confusion, saying “[o]ne thing we can call it is a door. We can call it a gate because it is attached to a fence. Usually when something opens attached to a fence you often call it a gate, but we can call it a door as well.”', '-2- towards McFadden, and Lugo “pulled out a Rambo style knife and charged at [him].” After Lugo pulled out the knife, McFadden recalled him saying “I’m going to stab you” or “[g]ive what you have, your money.” Rivera reiterated that sentiment, telling McFadden “[g]ive him the money.”', 'Within a few seconds of these statements, Lugo stabbed McFadden in his arm. Padilla then “rushed at [McFadden].” McFadden remembered “[p]unching, kicking, whatever [he] could do” to protect himself. He testified that he tried to grab Lugo’s arm. He remembered he “had a good grip on [Lugo],” but Padilla “hit [him] and [he] got turned around.” Lugo then stabbed him multiple times in the back. McFadden testified that he felt “[o]ne gigantic [incision] and one not so gigantic [incision].” Rivera then “was trying to go in [McFadden’s] pockets.” Though in and out of consciousness at that point, McFadden felt his belongings being removed from his pockets. McFadden testified at trial that Padilla was the one who “hit [him] like a linebacker” before going through his pockets while he was on the ground. In his statement to the grand jury six months after the incident, McFadden had testified that Padilla “came up from behind [him] pretty quickly” after he was stabbed in the arm.', 'He also noted that, while he wrestled Padilla, he “got a good look at his face.”', 'At trial, McFadden testified that, following the stabbing, he chased after the three men. As he ran, he recalled seeing and hearing a woman, later identified as Frances Paban, who was “very upset” “screaming” at Lugo, “not in so many words saying you are an idiot, what are you doing.” McFadden recalled that a person grabbed him from behind, attempting to stop his bleeding. Fire and rescue soon arrived and transported him to the hospital. He awoke a day or so later to learn that his kidney had been lacerated. In addition, he had superficial wounds on his arm and back, and an interior mesh had been inserted into his abdomen. He was initially', '-3- released from the hospital after one week, but later hospitalized a second time after developing an infection. He also spent six months using a walker upon his release.', 'The day after the attack, McFadden gave the police a recorded statement wherein he reviewed three photo arrays to identify his attackers. The police instructed McFadden to circle anyone who participated in the attack, and to write the nature of that person’s involvement under his picture. McFadden identified Rivera as the man who said “give me the money” while approaching him alongside Lugo. In a second photo array, McFadden selected Lugo as the man who stabbed him.', 'Finally, in a third photo array, McFadden recognized Padilla, who he acknowledged “was there.” The police returned three days later to take another statement, at which time McFadden confirmed the previous photo identifications.', 'A. Paban’s Testimony', 'In addition to McFadden, Frances Paban also testified as a state’s witness at trial.5 Paban – fifteen years old on the date of the attack – frequently stayed with her boyfriend, Lugo, at Crossroads, and on July 24, 2010 spent the morning outside Crossroads’ locker area doing drugs with him. Despite her altered state, Paban recalled seeing Lugo, Rivera, and Padilla in the locker area that day.', 'While in the locker area, Paban heard Lugo and Rivera tell each other in Spanish,6 in the presence of McFadden, that they wanted to rob him. When she heard this, Paban had lost sight of Padilla, though she had previously seen him sitting silently atop a crate shaving his legs about thirty feet away from Lugo and Rivera. Paban “went to go see what was going on,” and testified that, when she reached Lugo, she did not see anyone besides Rivera in his immediate vicinity. 5', 'The state called two other witnesses to testify as well: Officer Jose Deschamps and Det. Emilio Matos, Jr. The defense called one witness, Lugo, who testified that Padilla was not involved in the robbery and, instead, that he acted alone. 6', 'Paban testified to her belief that Lugo and Rivera knew the victim did not understand Spanish.', '-4- After Lugo told her to sit back down, she returned to her previous spot, from which she could no longer see Lugo and Rivera, and she “sat on a crate, * * * put [her] headphones * * * on” and “zoned out.” Approximately five to ten minutes later, Paban saw Lugo come “outside of the locker, behind from where the locker was[,] with blood on his hands and on his clothes.” Temporarily deafened by her headphones, Paban said she had not heard any commotion, nor had she seen Padilla move from the crate.', 'Amid the chaos, Paban and Lugo agreed to meet at Amos House.7 She rode a bicycle to the agreed place. Paban, unaware of Rivera’s location, met Lugo at Amos House; and, as Lugo sat down at a picnic table, she saw the handle of a knife and blood dripping down his pants leg. Shortly thereafter, Rivera arrived, followed by Padilla. The police interrupted their rendezvous moments later, “thr[owing] [Lugo] to the floor, lift[ing] up his shirt and f[inding] his knife.”8 Meanwhile, Rivera was about six picnic tables away.', 'After the police arrested Lugo, Paban went to the police station with Det. Emilio Matos and gave a full recounting of the morning’s events. Later that evening, however, Paban returned to the station seeking to change her statement. While her second statement references Padilla’s involvement, her first statement makes no mention of him. In her second statement to Det. Matos, Paban, in describing the events, said “[Padilla] got involved in it and [he] said I will watch but I want half and they said all right.” She elaborated that “[Padilla] was at the end of it, 7', 'Amos House is an organization that offers food, shelter, and social services to those in need in the Providence area. 8', 'During trial, Officer Jose Deschamps testified about his experience escorting Lugo to the police station. Deschamps recalled Lugo telling him: “I know who took the money. It was two of my fam. They are probably going back to Crossroads. Oh, shit, there they are.” Deschamps then saw “two male subjects,” later identified as Rivera and Padilla, walking down the street. Lugo, with his hands cuffed behind his back, motioned his head in Rivera and Padilla’s direction. Deschamps broadcast a description of Rivera and Padilla over his radio, and officers arrived and arrested them.', '-5- at the end of the gate watching it * * * he was very aware of [what was going on] * * * he * * * [w]anted a cut.” At trial, Paban again switched her story, testifying that Padilla had nothing to do with the incident and instead helped the victim tend to his wounds. In addition, she testified that, following her first statement to police but before her second, she used drugs.', 'Toward the end of her trial testimony, Paban asked the trial justice if she could “come up and talk to [him] * * * away from everybody else.” He denied her request, but directed the prosecutor to bring her issue to his attention if necessary. Later in her testimony, Padilla’s attorney asked Paban to read her witness statement aloud, to which she responded “[I] can’t read. I can follow along if you read but I can’t read it.” Upon further inquiry, she clarified that she had a limited reading ability such that she can read names and can “follow along if [someone] read[s] it out loud.”', 'Throughout her trial testimony, each time counsel for either side referred Paban to her witness statements, they either read her the statement or played her a recording of it. Moreover, prior to testifying, Paban was both permitted to listen to a recording of her statement and provided with a transcript of it. When asked if she recognized the transcript of her statement, she indicated that she did; she said she followed along with the transcript while listening to the recording at the station.', ""Padilla moved to dismiss his charge pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure after the state rested, but the trial justice reserved his decision until the defense presented its case. At the conclusion of all evidence, the trial justice denied the motion to dismiss. In so doing, the trial justice quoted State v. McKone, 673 A.2d 1068 (R.I. 1996), which allows that “if the trial justice in a criminal case setting concludes that the trial evidence is sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he or she denies the defendant's motion to"", '-6- dismiss and, if both sides have rested, enters decision and judgment of conviction thereon.” Id. at 1073. He ultimately determined that the evidence proved Padilla guilty of first-degree robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. On April 14, 2014, he sentenced Padilla to fifteen years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with four years to serve and eleven years suspended with probation. Padilla filed a notice of appeal on April 15, 2014.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“[T]his Court affords great deference to a trial justice’s credibility determinations when sitting without a jury.” State v. Edwards, 147 A.3d 982, 987 (R.I. 2016). “When reviewing determinations of credibility and findings of fact by a trial justice sitting without a jury, this Court will not disturb the trial justice’s findings unless they are clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” State v. Erminelli, 991 A.2d 1064, 1069 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1222 (R.I. 2009)). “When the record indicates that competent evidence supports the trial justice’s findings, we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for his [or hers] even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.” Edwards, 147 A.3d at 987 (quoting State v. Van Dongen, 132 A.3d 1070, 1076 (R.I. 2016)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Padilla argues that the trial justice committed two errors warranting reversal of his conviction: (1) that the trial justice misconstrued McFadden’s testimony as to who confronted him; and (2) that the trial justice erred in relying on Paban’s witness statements where', '-7- her inability to read rendered her unable to acknowledge them. We will discuss each issue in turn.', 'A. McFadden’s Testimony', 'Padilla first challenges the trial justice’s characterization of the attack, arguing that he inaccurately recounted McFadden’s testimony and, specifically, that he erred in saying that “all three men approached [McFadden]” and “all three confronted [McFadden].” Padilla argues that, rather than “all three” approaching the complainant, McFadden actually testified that only Lugo and Rivera approached and confronted him. We disagree and instead hold that the trial justice, in summarizing McFadden’s testimony, accurately recounted it.', 'In describing the complainant’s testimony, the trial justice highlighted that “Mr. McFadden then testified that all three men approached him. He could tell from their demeanor as they approached that ‘something bad was going to happen close.’” Padilla primarily takes issue with the trial justice’s statement that he “confronted” McFadden along with Lugo and Rivera. However, we do not find the trial justice’s indication that Padilla participated in the initial confrontation inconsistent with the record. During his testimony, McFadden narrated that the “man that was standing [ten] feet away was joined by the other two and they came at me.” When asked specifically by the trial justice whether “all three c[a]me towards you,” he answered in the affirmative.', 'We believe, contrary to Padilla’s argument, that “confront” accurately describes McFadden’s narration of Padilla’s actions – that Padilla “c[a]me towards” McFadden with Lugo and Rivera before retreating.', 'Furthermore, it is clear that Padilla takes the trial justice’s summary out of context. While he is correct that McFadden testified that Padilla “broke off and was near the [gate] area” after approaching the complainant, the trial justice also spoke of Padilla’s departure from the', '-8- group. The trial justice, after saying that “all three men approached [McFadden],” continued that “[s]hortly after all three confronted him one of the men who he later identified as Mr. Padilla broke off from the confrontation * * *.” Later, the trial justice reiterated that “[McFadden] recalled all three men approaching and he sensed something bad was about to happen. As the confrontation between Mr. McFadden and these men began, he recalled Mr. Padilla breaking off from the group and taking a position near the gate area or the entrance to that locker area.” This Court has said that a trial justice should not “pick one isolated statement in a witness’s testimony out of context from the whole of it.” State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 481 (R.I. 1998). It follows, then, that counsel should refrain from doing the same. See Deatte v. Duxbury, 66 R.I. 1, 9, 17 A.2d 24, 27 (1940) (“The suggestion of the trial justice to which the complainant objects must be read with what precedes and follows; it should not be isolated from its context * * *.”).', 'The trial justice did not “misconceive[ ] or overlook[ ] material evidence” sufficient to warrant reversal. Erminelli, 991 A.2d at 1069. Rather, Padilla has sequestered one sentence of the trial justice’s bench decision without relating it back to the whole. Thus, we accept the trial justice’s summary as accurate.', 'B. Paban’s Prior Statements', 'Next, Padilla challenges Paban’s recognition of her prior witness statements during her testimony. He argues that Paban’s concession late in her testimony that she could not read rendered her unable to effectively acknowledge her prior statements, which the trial justice relied on in finding him guilty. Padilla’s argument, however, is unpersuasive.', 'In light of the trial justice’s revelation that Paban’s testimony was “the most enlightening and damaging * * * which clearly implicates and explains in detail Mr. Padilla’s participation in this robbery,” it is not surprising that Padilla seeks to undermine it. “However, as we have stated', ""-9- many times, this Court's ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes our consideration of an issue that has not been raised and articulated at trial. * * * It is well settled that a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.” State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008). Padilla did not take issue with the prosecutor’s use of Paban’s prior statements at trial, and his failure to challenge it then precludes him from now raising the argument on appeal. As such, having failed to preserve it, Padilla has waived his objection."", 'Nevertheless, even if we were to overlook the “raise-or-waive” rule, we still would not be inclined to hold that the trial justice erred in relying on Paban’s testimony regarding her prior statements. In his bench decision, the trial justice recalled that, during her testimony, “[Paban] was confronted with the inculpatory statements she attributed to Mr. Padilla that were contained in her second taped statement * * *. Those statements from her recorded statement were placed in front of her in the courtroom and she in her statement acknowledged all of these statements were made in her presence according to that recorded statement.” Padilla argues that Paban’s inability to read means she was unable to recognize her prior statements. However, his argument relies on the misconception that the prosecutor asked Paban to read her statements before she acknowledged them as her own.', 'Instead, before asking Paban if she recalled a specific statement, the prosecutor either read it to her aloud or played her a recording of it, in which she recognized her voice.9 Moreover, during her testimony, Paban had a copy of the transcript in front of her, and she told Padilla’s counsel that she could “follow along if [someone] read[s] it out loud,” which is precisely what the prosecutor did. 9', 'In fact, after Paban’s disclosure, Padilla’s counsel offered to utilize the same method as the prosecutor by reading Paban her statement – the same procedure with which Padilla now takes issue.', '- 10 -', 'A review of Paban’s testimony reveals that she was capable of recognizing her prior statements, and could do so through the means the prosecutor used.', 'So, “[r]ather than misconceive or overlook evidence, the trial justice duly considered” Paban’s testimony and statements. Edwards, 147 A.3d at 987. Padilla’s contention that “the trial record indicates that she had no ability to recognize [her July 24, 2010 statement’s] accuracy or inaccuracy” reflects a distorted view of the record and one that we reject.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the aforementioned reasons, the Superior Court’s judgment is affirmed. The record may be returned to that tribunal.', '- 11 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'State v.

34,State : v. : Harold T. Drew.,reversal,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Harold T. Drew, appeals from a Superior Court order denying his motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. After a jury trial, the defendant was convicted on one count of first-degree murder, one count of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, and three counts of entering a dwelling with the intent to commit a larceny therein. This Court affirmed the defendant’s conviction on appeal, State v. Drew, 919 A.2d 397 (R.I. 2007), and he then filed the instant motion for a new trial. 1 The defendant now argues that a recently discovered police narrative discloses new, material evidence concerning a cooperation agreement between the Swansea (Massachusetts) Police Department, the Rhode Island State Police, and a prominent state’s witness in the defendant’s murder trial, Bobbie-Jo Dumont. 2 The defendant also claims that the prosecution violated the defendant’s constitutional due-process rights by failing to disclose the full extent of the cooperation agreement. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal 1', 'This is defendant’s second motion for a new trial. His first motion was made on November 18, 2004, and denied on December 1, 2004. 2', 'The spelling of Dumont’s first name is not consistent throughout the record. It appears in various documents as “Bobbie Jo,” “Bobbie Joe,” “Bobbie-Jo,” and “Bobbi-Jo.” We shall refer to her as Bobbie-Jo.', '-1- should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'This Court is familiar with the underlying facts of this case from defendant’s first appeal, State v. Drew, 919 A.2d 397 (R.I. 2007), in which his conviction was affirmed. Three people were primarily involved in the events leading to defendant’s arrest: Bobbie-Jo Dumont, Harold Andrews, 3 and defendant. Dumont and Andrews became acquainted in 2000 at a Providence strip club, where Dumont was employed as a stripper and Andrews was a customer. Id. at 400. Their relationship soon changed from a casual acquaintanceship to one in which Dumont relied on Andrews for money to support her drug addiction and to pay her bills, in exchange for which she obliged his sexual demands. Id. at 400-01.', 'Dumont met defendant in the fall of 2002, after she was admitted to a detoxification facility in North Kingstown. Drew, 919 A.2d at 401. The defendant and Dumont developed a romantic relationship, and both were prematurely expelled from the detoxification program after they were discovered having sexual relations on the premises. Id. The defendant and Dumont then continued to stay together in abandoned buildings and cars, while Andrews provided support for Dumont until Andrews became unemployed in October 2002. Id.', 'Dumont testified at defendant’s trial that she, defendant, and Andrews perpetrated a string of breaking-and-entering crimes between November 2002 and June 2003, usually with 3', 'Andrews is sometimes referred to as “Jack” in the record.', '-2- Andrews providing transportation while Dumont and defendant entered the residences. 4 On or around May 12, 2003, however, Andrews told Dumont that he no longer wished to participate in the break-ins, and the two engaged in a physical altercation. Dumont testified that, on the day after this altercation, she and defendant asked Andrews to drive them to a remote field in the Town of Exeter, where the three had previously stashed a gun locker, and Andrews agreed. Dumont further testified that, while she and Andrews were attempting to wipe fingerprints off the gun locker, she saw defendant shoot and kill Andrews.', 'The defendant and Dumont were arrested for Andrews’s murder on June 6, 2003. Drew, 919 A.2d at 402. On July 31, 2003, Dumont entered into a cooperation agreement with the state, in which she agreed to plead to one charge of possession of heroin and two counts of breaking and entering committed within the state of Rhode Island. The agreement provided for Dumont to receive sentences of three years suspended/three years probation for the heroin possession charge and five years suspended/five years probation for the breaking-and-entering charges. The state also agreed to withdraw a pending bail-violation notice that had been filed pursuant to Rule 46(g) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure in an unrelated matter. The agreement was executed in exchange for Dumont’s past and future cooperation and testimony in connection with the prosecution of all criminal cases brought as a result of Andrews’s murder.', 'It is undisputed that the state provided defendant with the following documents prior to trial: Dumont’s cooperation agreement, Dumont’s witness statements, and a narrative written by 4', 'The exact number of breaking and enterings is not clear. On direct examination at trial, Dumont testified that she, defendant, and Andrews broke into houses “just about every day” between November 2002 and June 2003. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Dumont if she had committed “around 18 breaking and enterings,” and she answered affirmatively. According to a narrative written by Det. Gregory T. Ryan of the Swansea Police Department, Dumont said “she had committed approximately 80 house breaks and larcenies.” Dumont’s witness statement from August 7, 2003, lists seventeen specific addresses that she identified as part of the break-ins in which she participated.', '-3- Det. Arthur J. Kershaw of the Rhode Island State Police that described Dumont’s cooperation with the state.', 'The defendant’s trial began in October 2004, and included three days of testimony from Dumont. Detective Kershaw also testified, stating that he investigated a number of “B & E’s” in the “South County” area in May 2003, and that he was thereafter assigned to the homicide investigation concerning Andrews’s death in June 2003. On cross-examination, Det. Kershaw testified that he was aware that Dumont was involved in numerous breaking and enterings in Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and that she had agreed to cooperate with detectives in both jurisdictions. On November 10, 2004, defendant was convicted on one count of first-degree murder, one count of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, and three counts of entering a dwelling with the intent to commit a larceny therein. Drew, 919 A.2d at 402- 03. Judgment of conviction was entered in the Superior Court on February 7, 2005. The defendant filed a timely appeal on the grounds of evidentiary errors, erroneous jury instructions, and a Confrontation Clause violation; his conviction was affirmed by this Court on May 16, 2007.', 'On January 2, 2008, defendant filed the underlying motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, in which he asserted that, after his conviction in Rhode Island he was taken to Massachusetts to face additional breaking-and- entering charges.', 'The defendant claimed that, during the course of the Massachusetts proceeding, he “discovered details of a cooperation agreement between the State’s main witness, Bobbi Jo Dumont, and Massachusetts authorities.”', 'Specifically, defendant referred to a Supplemental Narrative of Det. Gregory T. Ryan of the Swansea Police Department, dated May', '-4- 17, 2004. 5 Detective Ryan’s narrative reveals that he, Dumont, and Det. Kershaw traveled to the locations of four reported “house breaks” in Swansea, Massachusetts, with Dumont identifying the homes as being those where she, defendant, and Andrews had committed break-ins. 6 The final paragraph of Det. Ryan’s narrative states that “[a]s requested by Det. Arthur Kershaw, as part of her cooperation, Bobbie Jo Dumont will not be charged due to her assistance as a witness.” The state asserted that it was not made aware of Det. Ryan’s narrative until after the close of defendant’s trial, and defendant did not present evidence to challenge this assertion.', 'The defendant argued that Det. Ryan’s narrative evidenced a cooperation agreement that should have been disclosed to defendant prior to trial and that this lack of disclosure prevented defendant from fully presenting his best defense in contravention of his due-process rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). 7 The state filed an objection to defendant’s motion on June 1, 2011, arguing that Det. Ryan’s narrative did not reveal newly discovered evidence. 8 The trial justice conducted an evidentiary hearing on June 1, 2011, with testimony from Dumont, Det. Ryan, and Det. Kershaw. After the hearing, the parties filed additional memoranda, and, on March 23, 2012, the trial court entered an order denying defendant’s motion, accompanied by a seventeen-page decision dated March 8, 2012. The trial justice found no due-process violation and no reason for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33, reasoning that Det. Ryan’s narrative did not 5', 'Although Det. Ryan’s narrative is dated “05/17/2004,” it references break-ins that occurred during the spring of 2003. The narrative states that Dumont recounted these break-ins for Det. Ryan and Det. Kershaw in August 2003, but conflictingly uses the date “Aug 8, 2004” as well. 6', 'Detective Ryan’s narrative also mentions one house identified in Somerset, Massachusetts, but does not provide specific information as to Dumont’s involvement with that location. 7', 'The defendant also argued that Dumont committed perjury by testifying that Det. Kershaw did not make any promises to her and that the state failed to disclose additional promises to not charge Dumont with murder or conspiracy to murder. These arguments are not presented on appeal. 8', 'It is unclear from the record why more than three years passed between defendant’s motion and the state’s objection. The state’s objection was filed in open court, on the same date as the motion hearing.', '-5- present new evidence and that the evidence was merely cumulative and impeachment evidence. 9 The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When reviewing a trial court’s decision denying a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, this Court “will not overturn the trial justice’s decision absent an indication that ‘he or she overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.’” State v. Price, 66 A.3d 406, 418 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Hazard, 797 A.2d 448, 464 (R.I. 2002)). In contrast, “[t]his Court will ‘apply a de novo standard of review * * * to mixed questions of fact and law that purportedly implicate a constitutional right.’” Richards v. Fiore, 57 A.3d 254, 257 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Wiggins, 919 A.2d 987, 989 (R.I. 2007)). “Nevertheless, when we are called upon to conduct such a ‘de novo review with respect to issues of constitutional dimension, we still accord great deference to a hearing justice’s findings of historical fact and to inferences drawn from those facts * * *.’” DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 569 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Page v. State, 995 A.2d 934, 942 n.18 (R.I. 2010)). Accordingly, we will review the trial justice’s Rule 33 decision for clear error, and we will review de novo the constitutional question of whether defendant’s due-process rights were violated by the state’s alleged failure to disclose the full extent of Dumont’s cooperation agreement. 9', 'The trial court also found that Dumont did not commit perjury and that the state did not consider or file charges against Dumont for murder or conspiracy to murder. As previously mentioned, these findings are not challenged on appeal.', '-6-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that he did not receive any information, before or during his trial, regarding an agreement to not charge Dumont with the Massachusetts breaking and enterings. The defendant asserts that the state’s failure to disclose this important information deprived him of the benefit of knowing the full extent of Dumont’s cooperation agreement. The defendant also argues that, under the dictates of Brady, the prosecution had a duty to disclose the information contained in Det. Ryan’s narrative regarding Det. Kershaw’s request to not charge Dumont with the Massachusetts offenses.', 'The defendant first argues that this alleged nondisclosure was deliberate, as evidenced by the fact that Det. Kershaw was the lead detective on defendant’s case and sat at counsel table throughout defendant’s trial.', 'Alternatively, defendant argues that, even if the nondisclosure was not deliberate, a new trial is required because the undisclosed evidence was material.', 'Specifically, defendant explains that the evidence was material because the state’s case was highly dependent on Dumont’s testimony, and knowing the full extent of her agreement with the state was essential to attacking her credibility.', 'The state responds by arguing that defendant’s motion was properly denied because the evidence at issue fails the two-part test established by this Court for deciding new-trial motions based on newly discovered evidence. See Price, 66 A.3d at 417, discussed infra. First, the state argues that the evidence was not newly discovered because Dumont’s cooperation agreement referred to “numerous” break-ins, and both Det. Kershaw’s narrative and Dumont’s witness statement mentioned that Dumont was involved in break-ins in Massachusetts. Further, the state argues that defense counsel demonstrated knowledge of the alleged new evidence by referring to', '-7- the Massachusetts break-ins, as well as the fact that Dumont had not been charged, during the cross-examinations of Dumont and Det. Kershaw at defendant’s trial. Next, the state argues that the alleged new evidence was merely cumulative and impeaching rather than material, because the state disclosed the terms of Dumont’s written cooperation agreement and the extent of Dumont’s criminal activity was fully explored before the jury. Finally, the state argues that the alleged new evidence was not the kind that would likely change the verdict at a new trial because evidence demeaning Dumont’s credibility, such as her significant drug use and criminal activity, was already presented at trial. As to the alleged Brady violation, the state asserts that Det. Ryan’s narrative did not disclose any facts not previously known to defendant, as evidenced by defendant’s trial strategy and the information contained in Det. Kershaw’s narrative.', 'A', 'The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial Based on Newly Discovered Evidence', 'Trial courts use a two-pronged test when considering a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence brought pursuant to Rule 33. See Price, 66 A.3d at 417.', '“The first prong encompasses a four-part inquiry, requiring that the', 'evidence is (1) newly discovered since trial, (2) not discoverable', 'prior to trial with the exercise of due diligence, (3) not merely', 'cumulative or impeaching but rather material to the issue upon', 'which it is admissible, (4) of the type which would probably', 'change the verdict at trial.” Id. (quoting State v. Woods, 936 A.2d', '195, 197 (R.I. 2007)). “The second prong, which is to be addressed only if the requirements set forth in the first prong have been satisfied, requires that the trial justice ‘determine if the evidence presented is credible enough to warrant a new trial.’” Id. (quoting Woods, 936 A.2d at 197).', 'Here, the trial justice first clarified that the evidence at issue was not Det. Ryan’s narrative itself; rather it was “only the possibility that the report contain[ed] evidence of an', '-8- undisclosed agreement that may [have] amount[ed] to evidence of a non-disclosure in violation of due process.” The court did not find evidence to suggest that defendant was anything but diligent in his pretrial efforts to discover information. Next, the court found that defendant was aware, prior to his trial, that Dumont had been involved in break-ins in Massachusetts and that she was not charged in return for her cooperation. Specifically, the trial justice pointed to Det. Kershaw’s narrative, which stated that, as part of her cooperation agreement, Dumont “agreed to identify ‘numerous residences’ in which she was involved in break-ins” and that she did in fact identify residences “throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts.” The trial justice also found that in Dumont’s witness statement dated June 6, 2003, she identified seventeen such addresses, some of which were located in Massachusetts. 10 Further, the court found that defense counsel questioned Dumont about these break-ins during cross-examination at trial, in relation to her cooperation agreement. The court also found that defense counsel questioned Det. Kershaw about the cooperation agreement as referenced in his narrative, including Det. Kershaw’s understanding that the agreement covered break-ins in both Massachusetts and Rhode Island.', 'Next, the trial justice found that, even if more information could have been provided regarding Dumont’s cooperation agreement as it related to the Massachusetts crimes, the evidence would have been merely cumulative and impeaching rather than material and would probably not have changed the verdict at trial. The court found that, “given the amount of impeachment evidence presented to the jury at trial regarding Ms. Dumont’s criminal past, it would have been difficult to show that more information regarding her past would shake any confidence in the verdict.”', 'Thus, the trial court found that the alleged newly discovered evidence failed the first prong of the test to be applied for Rule 33 motions based on newly 10', 'The trial justice’s decision referred to Dumont’s statement dated June 6, 2003, but the August 7, 2003, statement was actually the one that contained the addresses of the various residences.', '-9- discovered evidence. 11 There is no indication that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence while conducting this analysis; we therefore affirm the court’s decision in this regard.', 'B', 'The Defendant’s Due-Process Claim', 'In order to comply with the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, the state must “provide a criminal defendant with certain information.” State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 229 (R.I. 2008) (citing Brady, 373 U.S. at 87). “[I]f a prosecutor has suppressed evidence that would be favorable to the accused and the evidence is material to guilt or punishment, the defendant’s due-process rights have been violated and a new trial must be granted.” Id. at 229- 30. Here, the parties disagree on the threshold issue of whether the state failed to disclose information regarding an agreement not to charge Dumont with the Massachusetts break-ins. The defendant claims that “[n]o information regarding an agreement not to charge Ms. Dumont with the Massachusetts B & E’s was ever provided to [defendant] at any point before or during his trial.” Contrary to defendant’s assertion, however, the state provided defendant with several documents implying that Dumont had participated in, but had not been charged with, the Massachusetts break-ins. First, defendant received Det. Kershaw’s narrative, which stated:', '“As part of a cooperational [sic] agreement with Attorney Generals', '[sic] Department, Bobbie Joe Dumont agreed to identify numerous', 'residences in which she, Harold Drew and Harold Andrews had', 'broken into throughout the year of 2003. Per the agreement,', 'Bobbie Joe Dumont will not be prosecuted for her involvement', 'with the breaks in return for her assistance with the homicide and', 'breaks. At this time, [Rhode Island State Police] detectives', 'travelled throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts where', 'numerous residences were identified by Miss Dumont * * *.” 11', 'Because the evidence failed the first prong of the two-part test, the court did not address the second prong.', '- 10 - Second, defendant received Dumont’s witness statement dated August 7, 2003, in which she identified, as part of her cooperation agreement, seventeen residences that she had broken into. The list of identifications included four residences in Swansea, Massachusetts. Third, defendant received the written cooperation agreement between Dumont and the state of Rhode Island, in which Dumont agreed to plead to one charge of possession of heroin and two counts of breaking and entering in exchange for her “past cooperation and continued full cooperation and truthful testimony * * * in connection with the prosecution of all criminals [sic] cases brought as a result of a murder of Harold Andrews * * * and numerous breaking crimes committed by Harold Drew * * *.”', 'Additionally, defendant’s trial strategy suggests that he believed Dumont was not charged with the Massachusetts crimes in exchange for her cooperation with the state of Rhode Island. The following line of questioning occurred during defense counsel’s cross-examination of Dumont, regarding the break-ins that she identified for the Rhode Island State Police:', '“Q', 'And you told investigators at the [Adult Correctional', 'Institutions], including the Rhode Island State Police who', 'were with you, that you did about 18 -- around 18 breaking', 'and enterings, right?', '“A', 'I don’t remember if I said that.', '“Q', 'You pointed out a lot to them?', '“A', 'Pointed out a lot to them.', '“Q', 'Did you count them?', '“A', 'I didn’t count them, no.', '“Q', '18 sound good to you?', '“A', 'What do you mean sounds good?', '“Q', 'Sound too high or too low?', '“A', 'As many as I pointed out, maybe.', '“Q', 'If I told you, going through your transcript in 2003, that', 'there are 18 different locations that you brought the Rhode', 'Island State Police to, would that be accurate?', '“A', 'Okay.', '“Q', 'Okay.

Kershaw, counsel showed knowledge of the fact that Dumont had cooperated with Massachusetts police:', '“Q', '[Y]ou were aware that Ms. Dumont was involved with a', 'number of B&E’s in different towns throughout Rhode', 'Island and in Massachusetts, nearby Massachusetts,', 'correct?', '“A', 'Yes.', '“Q', 'Okay. So, as part of her deal with the Attorney General’s', 'Office, she agreed to cooperate with detectives in those', 'jurisdictions, correct?', '“A', 'Correct.”', 'The evidence at issue in this appeal is contained in one sentence of Det. Ryan’s newly discovered narrative: “As requested by Det. Arthur Kershaw, as part of her cooperation, Bobbie Jo Dumont will not be charged due to her assistance as a witness.” This statement does not reflect any sort of formal agreement; rather, it illustrates a mere conversation between two detectives. 12 During the defendant’s motion hearing, Det. Kershaw testified that he recalled telling Det. Ryan to “hold off” on charging Dumont with the Massachusetts breaking and enterings.', 'He then stated that he recalled telling Det. Ryan about the agreement between Dumont and the state of Rhode Island and that he may have asked Det. Ryan “not to charge her at that time.” Detective Ryan testified that he did not have any direct contact with Dumont, did not directly promise her anything, and did not make any formal agreements with her. When 12', 'It is important to note that no evidence has been presented to suggest that Dumont executed a formal, written cooperation agreement with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.', '- 12 - viewed in context with the other information the defendant was given prior to trial, it is clear that Det. Ryan’s narrative revealed nothing that the defendant did not already know: Pursuant to her cooperation agreement with the state of Rhode Island, Dumont helped police identify the sites of four burglaries in Swansea, Massachusetts, and Dumont had not been charged with these burglaries at the time of the defendant’s trial. Accordingly, we hold that the defendant’s due- process rights were not violated because the state did not fail to disclose information regarding Dumont’s cooperation agreement.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.

35,State : v. : Tonya Withers. :,reversal,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. Following a jury trial in Providence County Superior Court, the defendant, Tonya Withers (Withers or defendant), was found guilty of one count of simple assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying her motion for a new trial and her request to proceed pro se. This case came before the Supreme Court on September 26, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the parties’ memoranda, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In February 2014, Maria DiPaola owned a rental property located at 167 Admiral Street in Providence. On February 11, 2014, DiPaola was at the property—a “split ranch duplex”— with her employee, Paul Barros, cleaning the property and preparing it for a rental showing to a', '-1- prospective tenant. The previous renter, Withers, had been a tenant for only two months when she left a note indicating that she had moved and would pick her mattress up at a later date.', 'At trial, DiPaola testified that, as she was cleaning, Barros yelled to her that Withers and a man—later identified in the police report as Antonio Bryant—were approaching the property. The property had exterior stairs in the front of the building, and it also had interior stairs leading up to the apartment door. DiPaola instructed Barros to stop Withers from coming into the apartment. In response to “yelling and shouting,” DiPaola recalled that she opened the apartment door to see Withers and Bryant walking up the stairs. DiPaola testified that Withers was walking backwards up the outside stairwell, using a walker, and Bryant was assisting by pushing the walker.', 'DiPaola walked down the interior stairs and began yelling at Withers, “[y]ou can’t come in.” At this point, DiPaola observed Withers “barrelling [sic] up the stairs,” before Withers “grabbed [her] on [her] arm” and “threw [her] down the stairs.” DiPaola tumbled down about four or five stairs and landed at the very bottom of the stairwell. In response, DiPaola called out to Barros, “Help me. She threw me downstairs.” DiPaola testified that Barros was located on the exterior stairs at this time.', 'At trial, Barros recalled walking out of the building to the exterior stairs as Withers and Bryant were walking up those stairs. He called the police to report Withers’ arrival on the property without DiPaola’s consent, and at the same time he noticed DiPaola “on the floor, yelling, Call [sic] the police. She just pushed me down the stairs.” On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Barros whether he had seen Withers walking up the inside stairs, to which Barros responded, “She went passed [sic] me with the other guy * * * and she started going up', '-2- the stairs.” Barros then clarified that he did not actually see Withers going up the stairs because he was looking at his phone, but he stated that he knew she had been walking up the stairs.', 'Officer Brian Auclair responded to DiPaola’s apartment building for a reported assault, and he spoke with DiPaola who “appeared upset. I believe she was crying.” Officer Auclair testified that DiPaola told him she was pushed down the stairs by the second-floor tenant. Officer Auclair took a written statement from DiPaola, who was “shaking” while she wrote. In his police report, Officer Auclair memorialized the events as follows:', '“DiPaola and Barros stated that Tonya Withers * * * and Antonio', 'Bryant * * * came rushing up the stairs and began to force the door', 'open. When DiPaola ran down the stairs telling her to stop,', 'Withers pushed her causing DiPaola to fall down the stairs. Police', 'observed DiPaola holding her left shoulder but she refused', 'Rescue.”', 'In her written statement, DiPaola wrote that Withers “came up to [the] door, and was pushing it in[.] I ran down the stairs to open [the] door. And she grab[ed] me and push[ed] me down outside stairs.” On redirect, the prosecutor asked DiPaola what she considered “outside” stairs, and DiPaola responded that she meant the stairs outside the apartment, meaning the interior stairs.', 'On cross-examination, defense counsel confronted DiPaola with her prior testimony from a housing court hearing a few weeks after the purported assault. In those proceedings, DiPaola described the incident: “I came to the front door, and [Withers] started screaming at me, and I was in front of the door, and she was trying to move me out of the door, and she literally picked me up and threw me down the stairs.” When defense counsel asked DiPaola at trial to what stairs she had been referring, DiPaola clarified that she considered the apartment door the front door, indicating that the stairs she was thrown down were the interior stairs.', '-3-', 'After the close of the trial, the jury found defendant guilty of simple assault. The defendant moved for a new trial, which was denied. The defendant was sentenced to one year of probation, including mental health counseling. The trial justice also ordered no contact between defendant and the victim. The defendant timely appealed to this Court. In her appeal, defendant raises two issues—(1) the trial justice erred in denying a motion for a new trial; and (2) the trial justice erred in not letting defendant proceed pro se, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.1', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'A', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'When this Court reviews a motion for a new trial, we give “great weight” to a trial justice’s ruling when she “articulate[s] sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” State v.

We will disturb a trial justice’s ruling only “if we are convinced that the trial justice committed clear error or that * * * she overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case.” Id. (quoting State v. Cardona, 969 A.2d 667, 672-73 (R.I. 2009)). On appeal, this Court “give[s] great deference” to a trial justice’s “credibility determination” and “will not itself weigh the credibility of the witnesses.” Id. at 590 (quoting State v. Roberts, 705 A.2d 1380, 1380 (R.I. 1997) (mem.)). 1', 'Courts now often refer to pro se parties as “‘self-represented litigants.’” Tworog v.

With respect to the trial justice’s “findings of historical fact, and inferences drawn from those facts,” this Court defers greatly to the trial justice’s determinations. State v. Eddy, 68 A.3d 1089, 1098 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Thornton v. State, 948 A.2d 312, 316 (R.I. 2008)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice should have granted her motion for a new trial because she found the only witness capable of proving that an assault actually happened to be not credible. In determining whether to grant a new trial, “the trial justice must ‘(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” State v. Moore, 154 A.3d 472, 481 (R.I. 2017) 2', 'The state points this Court to a number of federal district court cases in support of its position that this Court’s relevant standard of review should be abuse of discretion. See State v. Winkler, 698 S.E.2d 596, 602 (S.C. 2010) (collecting cases) (stating that a number of jurisdictions have held that a defendant’s right to proceed pro se falls within a trial justice’s discretion once a trial has started). However, in light of our recent decision in Cruz, we review the trial justice’s decision de novo. See State v. Cruz, 109 A.3d 381, 386, 389 (R.I. 2015) (reviewing a trial justice’s grant of a defendant’s request to proceed without counsel once the jury selection had commenced).', '-5- (quoting State v.

(quoting State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 870 (R.I. 2010)).', 'The trial justice cited to her role as the “13th juror” in passing “independent judgment on the credibility of the witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” The trial justice first remarked on her concerns with DiPaola’s credibility as a trial witness, especially given DiPaola’s conflicting statements and “jumbled” version of events. The apartment building had two sets of stairs—one interior and one exterior. DiPaola’s description of Withers’ assault “troubled” the trial justice as DiPaola placed the assault on the interior stairwell, while she had referred to the location in the witness statement as occurring on the “outside stairs.”', 'The trial justice also commented on the trial version of DiPaola’s account of the incident, explaining that she found “the version [DiPaola] offered at trial” was “really difficult to understand logistically how it occurred.” She suggested that the confusing aspect of DiPaola’s testimony was how DiPaola could have been “thrown down the stairs” without “hit[ting] the body of the [d]efendant * * * [or] the walker,” but rather, “she just went down the stairs.” Referring to the housing court transcript, the trial justice also remarked that Barros testified in those proceedings that he found DiPaola on the floor inside the house “pretty upset.” While questioning the portion of DiPaola’s testimony describing how she fell, the trial justice did believe her when she testified that the police came quickly, which the trial justice found to be consistent with the testimony of Officer Auclair. The trial justice again referred to a transcript from housing court proceedings, where Barros testified that the incident occurred inside while he was outside.', '-6-', 'Based on her disbelief of the sequence of events as relayed at trial, the trial justice concluded that she would have found that the state had failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. However, given the standard for a motion for a new trial, the trial justice proceeded to decide whether reasonable minds could have differed. The trial justice ultimately found that there was sufficient evidence, even after discrediting DiPaola’s testimony that defendant committed an assault.3 In making her determination, the trial justice relied on the testimony of Officer Auclair and Barros, both of whom she found credible. Officer Auclair recalled arriving on the scene soon after the incident and found DiPaola “shaking and crying” while she relayed that she had been pushed down the stairs and her arm was sore. Barros stated that he saw DiPaola on the floor, telling him to call the police because Withers had pushed her down the stairs.', 'After a close review of the record, we cannot conclude that the trial justice clearly erred or “overlook[ed] * * * material inconsistencies.” State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 366 (R.I. 2011). Even discounting DiPaola’s testimony at trial, two other witnesses testified that they encountered DiPaola after the incident, visibly upset, and she told them Withers had pushed her—declarations a reasonable jury could have found to have been credible based on the circumstantial evidence presented at trial. Here, the trial justice found that the circumstantial evidence surrounding DiPaola’s fall down the stairs was sufficient to overcome the confusing portion of her testimony regarding the incident. See State v. Whitaker, 79 A.3d 795, 804 (R.I. 2013) (upholding denial of 3', 'A “simple assault [is] an ‘unlawful attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do a corporal hurt to another, whether from malice or wantonness.’” State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 620 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Pope, 414 A.2d 781, 788 (R.I. 1980)). Often charged with assault, a battery is “an act that was intended to cause, and does cause, an offensive contact with or unconsented touching of or trauma upon the body of another, thereby generally resulting in the consummation of the assault.” State v. Albanese, 970 A.2d 1215, 1221 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Messa, 594 A.2d 882, 884 (R.I. 1991)).', '-7- a motion for a new trial where the trial justice found numerous witnesses not credible, but still determined that the testimony was supported by circumstantial evidence). Affording the trial justice great deference in her determination, we conclude that Withers’ assault of DiPaola is supported by the evidence. Therefore, after a close review of the lower court record and the trial justice’s remarks, we are convinced that she did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'We affirm her denial of that motion.', 'B', 'Sixth Amendment Right to Proceed without Counsel', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred in denying defendant the right to proceed pro se at trial. The state counters that defendant’s request to represent herself on the second day of trial was untimely. It is not clear whether defendant expressly requested to proceed pro se at trial; but, in any event, we address defendant’s argument now.', '“[A] [s]tate may [not] constitutionally hale a person into its criminal courts and there force a lawyer upon him, even when he insists that he wants to conduct his own defense.” State v. Kennedy, 586 A.2d 1089, 1091 (R.I. 1991) (quoting Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 807 (1975)). However, a defendant may proceed pro se if he or she wishes only so long as the waiver of his or her right to counsel is valid. Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390. A defendant’s waiver must be made “voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently.”', 'Id.', 'First, the Court must determine whether the waiver was voluntary, and then the Court should proceed to decide whether it was “knowing and intelligent.” Id. (quoting State v. Laurence, 848 A.2d 238, 253 (R.I. 2004)). Where a defendant is competent, we have articulated six factors that the trial justice may use as a', '-8- guide in reviewing a defendant’s request under a totality of the circumstances approach. 4 Id. at 391. The factors are as follows:', '“(1) the background, the experience, and the conduct of the', 'defendant at the hearing, including his age, his education, and his', 'physical and mental health; (2) the extent to which the defendant', 'has had prior contact with lawyers before the hearing; (3) the', 'defendant’s knowledge of the nature of the proceeding and the', 'sentence that may potentially be [ ]imposed; (4) the question of', 'whether standby counsel has been appointed and the extent to', 'which he or she has aided the defendant before or at the hearing;', '(5) the question of whether the waiver of counsel was the result of', 'mistreatment or coercion; and (6) the question of whether the', 'defendant is trying to manipulate the events of the hearing.” State', 'v. Chabot, 682 A.2d 1377, 1380 (R.I. 1996).', 'The defense contends that the trial justice failed to determine whether Withers was knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waiving her right to counsel. We disagree. The trial justice explicitly referenced Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390, and cited the “voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently” test. She expressed the test as follows: “When confronted with a purported waiver of counsel, the [c]ourt applies a two-prong analysis to determine the validity of the waiver. The [c]ourt first determines whether it was voluntary, and then whether it was knowing and intelligent. It must be all three. I have to examine the totality of the circumstances.” Then, “[a] valid waiver of counsel is effective only if a defendant knows what he or she is doing, and his or her choice is made with eyes open. A criminal defendant certainly should be made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.” 4', 'If there is a question of a defendant’s mental competency, a trial justice must consider the six factors in deciding whether a defendant’s waiver of his or her right to counsel is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. See Cruz, 109 A.3d at 391. However, the trial justice need not explicitly apply these six factors when the mental competency of a defendant is not at issue. Id. at 392. Here, neither party addresses Withers’ competency in their briefs, and the trial justice did not indicate any concern on the record regarding Withers’ competency when she denied the defendant’s request to proceed pro se; and so we assume defendant was competent and review the trial justice’s decision accordingly.', '-9-', 'In this case, the trial had already commenced when defendant expressed dissatisfaction with her lawyers. In fact, DiPaola had already testified, and her cross-examination had been completed by defense counsel. As the defense noted, the trial justice did refer to the timing of defendant’s request in relation to the trial proceedings, noting also that defendant had been absent for one-and-one-half days of the trial after the jury was sworn. Although defendant voiced a number of excuses for her absence, the trial justice determined that her failure to show up to court was voluntary.', 'Additionally, defendant stated her desire to avoid the trial entirely:', '“And I still say my lawyers, they don’t—they don’t, um—they', 'don’t impress me.

The trial justice attempted to explain to defendant that there had been no African Americans stricken from the jury because there were simply no African Americans selected—something beyond defense counsel’s control.', 'The trial justice concluded that she did not believe defendant had “made the requisite intelligent and knowing decision to discharge counsel at this stage to meet the standard,” and she gave the defense attorneys an opportunity to address the matter. Defense counsel represented', '- 10 - that they were prepared to continue defending Withers notwithstanding her request for them to withdraw. Subsequently, the trial justice denied Withers’ request to discharge her attorneys.', 'We agree with the trial justice. The defendant’s contentions regarding her counsel elucidated her lack of understanding of the jury selection process, which is evidence that defendant was not knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waiving her right to counsel. Put differently, defendant raised a complaint about her counsel that, had she represented herself, she could not have done better.', 'But see State v. Spencer, 783 A.2d 413, 417-18 (R.I. 2001) (upholding a grant of a defendant’s request to proceed pro se where the defendant explained that there were issues he wished to address with the witnesses that were important to his defense).', 'Furthermore, defendant had not been present for the testimony of key witnesses, including that of DiPaola. As such, her choice to represent herself pro se after a significant absence could certainly not be said to be knowing or intelligent where such nonattendance put her at a substantial disadvantage in completing the trial. See Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390 (“A valid waiver is effective only if a ‘defendant knows what he [or she] is doing and his [or her] choice is made with eyes open.’” (quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835)). It is inconceivable to us that defendant would knowingly put herself at such a disadvantage. Moreover, although the timing of defendant’s midtrial request was not dispositive to the trial justice’s analysis, as the defense suggests, it certainly indicates that defendant’s waiver was not knowing or intelligent. See Spencer, 783 A.2d at 417 (acknowledging that the totality of the circumstances analysis used in determining whether a waiver is knowing, voluntary, and intelligent must be conducted “in light of the particular stage of the proceedings at the time the waiver is proposed”). Likewise, defendant’s stated wish to abandon the trial altogether and “go back to [her] cell” demonstrates a', '- 11 - lack of understanding that firing her attorneys would still result in defendant’s required appearance in court for the remainder of the trial.', 'Although we have expressed a preference for trial justices to have more than a brief discussion with a defendant before deciding whether a waiver of right to counsel is effective, the defendant’s failure to attend the initial portion of the trial indicates that the defendant was not making a knowing and intelligent waiver of her constitutional rights. See Cruz, 109 A.3d at 393 (“[A]lthough an explicit Chabot discussion would have been preferable, the absence of such a colloquy does not infect [a] defendant’s waiver of counsel with any constitutional defect.”). In view of that, we find that the trial justice engaged in an appropriate inquiry with the defendant in order to establish whether her requested waiver of her right to counsel was voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

36,"State v. Jose Gonzalez. ORDER The defendant, Jose Gonzalez, appeals from a Superior Court order denying his motion to reduce sentence. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this order, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. On July 1, 2010, after a jury trial, defendant was convicted of one count of first-degree child molestation and two counts of second-degree child molestation. 1 The defendant was sentenced to forty years, with twenty-two years to serve on the first count and five years to serve on the remaining counts; the sentences were to run concurrently. The defendant appealed the judgment of conviction; and, in December 2012, this Court affirmed the judgment. State v. 1 The facts of this case were detailed in our opinion affirming defendant’s conviction. State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96 (R.I. 2012). It is not necessary for us to repeat them here. - 1- Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96, 104 (R.I. 2012). The defendant then filed a motion to reduce sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 2 On January 16, 2013, at a hearing before the same justice who had presided over his criminal trial, defendant argued that his sentence should be reduced because he had shown “exemplary behavior” while incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions and because the sentence imposed was “not justif[ied]” and “far too heavy in this situation.” The trial justice reviewed the factors she considered when she imposed the sentence and determined that the original sentence was appropriate. Finding no change in circumstances that would entitle defendant to leniency, she denied the motion. The defendant filed a timely appeal. “This Court adheres to a ‘strong policy against interfering with a trial justice’s discretion in sentencing matters.’” State v. Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d 950, 952 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1254 (R.I. 2010)). “As a result, ‘[o]ur review of a trial justice’s decision on a Rule 35 motion is extremely limited.’” Id. (quoting Chase, 9 A.3d at 1254). “We will disturb a trial justice’s ruling on a motion to reduce ‘only when the sentence is without justification.’” Id. (quoting Chase, 9 A.3d at 1254). “Further, ‘[w]e have emphasized that the inherent power to review sentences should be utilized only in the exceptional case * * * when the sentence is without justification and grossly disparate from sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” Id. at 953 (quoting State v. Dyer, 14 A.3d 227, 227 (R.I. 2011) (mem.)). “It is the defendant’s burden to show that the sentence imposed violates this standard.” Id. (quoting Chase, 9 A.3d at 1254). 2 Rule 35(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a court “may reduce any sentence when a motion is filed within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the sentence is imposed, or * * * after receipt by the court of a mandate of the Supreme Court * * * .” - 2- On appeal, defendant argues that “there is nothing to be gained” by keeping him incarcerated for twenty-two years because, in light of his age, this “is essentially a life sentence for him.” 3 Further, while defendant acknowledges that he has a criminal record, he notes that his last conviction was in 1999 and none of his prior convictions involved child molestation. He also contends that his sentence exceeds both the applicable sentencing benchmark and the state’s pretrial offer. Finally, he argues that, because he has always been gainfully employed and has no substance-abuse or mental-health issues and has exhibited exemplary behavior while imprisoned, the sentence is excessive and unwarranted. The trial justice reviewed the factors she considered when she originally imposed the sentence, specifically: “the severity of the offense, the defendant’s personal, educational, and employment background, his criminal record, his potential for rehabilitation, social deterrence, and the appropriateness of the punishment.” The trial justice noted that she did not impose the maximum sentence allowed, and, considering “the seriousness of the offense, [and] the defendant’s criminal record,” the sentence was appropriate. The trial justice also concluded that defendant had presented no evidence that would indicate any change in circumstances. We see no reason to question the trial justice’s well-reasoned decision. We have previously held that a defendant’s age is not a determinative factor in a motion to reduce sentence. See State v. Lynch, 58 A.3d 146, 149 (R.I. 2013). This defendant’s criminal history may not have involved child molestation, but it was nonetheless serious, dating from the early 1970s through the late 1980s and including a twelve-year sentence for attempted murder imposed in 1989. It was certainly reasonable for the trial justice to find that the defendant’s record “does not indicate * * * a great deal of potential for rehabilitation.” Further, the fact that the defendant has maintained good behavior while incarcerated is to be expected. As we stated 3 The defendant’s date of birth is December 22, 1949. - 3- in State v. Guzman, 794 A.2d 474, 476 (R.I. 2002), “demeanor and conduct in prison since the crime are of no moment to [such an] appeal.” Neither are we concerned that the sentence exceeded the applicable benchmark because sentencing benchmarks serve only as “a guide to proportionality” and are not mandatory. State v. Snell, 11A.3d 97, 102 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Coleman, 984 A.2d 650, 655 (R.I. 2009)). In imposing sentence, the court “is bound only by the statutory parameters established by the Legislature.” Barkmeyer, 32 A.3d at 953 (quoting State v. Thornton, 800 A.2d 1016, 1044 (R.I. 2002)). The trial justice gave due consideration to all the factors and chose not to impose the maximum sentence permitted under the statute. 4 We have no cause to disturb her denial of the defendant’s motion. For the reasons stated in this order, we affirm the order of the Superior Court denying the defendant’s motion to reduce sentence. The record in this case may be remanded to the Superior Court. Entered as an Order of this Court on this 24th day of February, 2014.

37,"Raymond Lynch : v. : State of Rhode Island. : ORDER The applicant, Raymond Lynch, appeals pro se from the Superior Court’s dismissal of his second application for postconviction relief. In 1998, the applicant was convicted on three counts of first-degree sexual assault and two counts of second-degree sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-2 and 11-37-4. He was sentenced to a total of sixty years imprisonment, with thirty years to serve on each first-degree count and ten years to serve on each second-degree count, all to run concurrently. This Court affirmed those convictions in 2004. See State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022 (R.I. 2004). Subsequently, in 2011, we affirmed the Superior Court’s denial of the applicant’s first application for postconviction relief. See Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d 603 (R.I. 2011). On November 15, 2011, applicant filed a second application for postconviction relief, which is the subject of the instant appeal. In that application, he contended that: (1) the Superior Court justice who presided over his trial erred in admitting certain evidence in violation of Rule 803(4) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence; (2) his trial counsel was ineffective; (3) his right to an impartial jury was violated; (4) his sentence was disproportionately high in comparison to -1- the sentences meted out in similar cases; 1 (5) his right to a fair trial was violated because the friendly nature of the complaining witness’s interactions with him at trial outside the presence of the jury was not brought to the jury’s attention; (6) there was prosecutorial misconduct; and (7) his right to a fair trial was violated by the jury’s consideration of perjured testimony. The applicant’s court-appointed attorney moved to withdraw from the case and filed a memorandum, pursuant to Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000), in support of that motion. On May 11, 2012, the Superior Court granted the attorney’s motion to withdraw and permitted applicant to proceed pro se. In due course, on August 30, 2012, the hearing justice rendered a bench decision granting the state’s motion to dismiss applicant’s second application for postconviction relief. She found that all of the issues raised by applicant were “barred in their entirety” pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-8, which mandates that “[a]ll grounds for relief available to an applicant * * * must be raised in his or her [direct appeal or] original * * * application [for postconviction relief] * * * unless the court finds that in the interest of justice the applicant should be permitted to assert such a ground for relief;” and she also found, with respect to “the interest of justice” proviso in the statute, that there was no “further issue that has not been fully vetted at this point in time.” The applicant filed a timely appeal to this Court. He contends that the hearing justice erred in summarily dismissing his second application for postconviction relief. The statutory remedy of postconviction relief set forth in § 10–9.1–1 is “available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant's constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material 1 The applicant should have challenged the length of his sentence in a motion made pursuant to Rule 35(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. That issue is not properly before this Court in the existing procedural context. -2- facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interests of justice.” Perez v. State, 57 A.3d 677, 679 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). The applicant’s ability to further pursue postconviction relief is limited to the extent that his application, like those of other applicants, is subject to the doctrine of res judicata. “Section 10–9.1–8, which codifies * * * the doctrine of res judicata within the postconviction-relief context, bars relitigation of the same issues between the same parties after a final judgment has entered in a prior proceeding.” State v. Thornton, 68 A.3d 533, 541 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Anderson v. State, 45 A.3d 594, 602 (R.I. 2012). This Court has repeatedly stated that the doctrine of res judicata “provides a procedural bar not only to issues that have been raised and decided in a previous postconviction-relief proceeding, but also to the relitigation of any issue that could have been litigated in a prior proceeding, even if the particular issue was not raised.” Ferrell v. Wall, 971 A.2d 615, 620 (R.I. 2009) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Price v. Wall, 31 A.3d 995, 999 (R.I. 2011). In our judgment, the Superior Court correctly found that applicant’s second application for postconviction relief was barred by § 10-9.1-8. See Perez, 57 A.3d at 682; Mattatall v. State, 947 A.2d 896, 905 (R.I. 2008). After carefully reviewing the record, this Court is more than convinced that all of applicant’s claims in his second application are matters that have been raised or that could have been raised on direct appeal or in his first application for postconviction relief. The applicant does not present any persuasive explanation as to why the contentions raised in his second application could not have been previously presented. See Brown v. State, 32 A.3d 901, 910 (R.I. 2011). We have recognized a “very limited and narrow exception” to the res judicata bar in the postconviction relief context, pursuant to which “issues which were finally adjudicated or not -3- [previously] raised may nonetheless be the basis for a subsequent application for postconviction relief if the court finds it to be in the interest of justice.” Mattatall, 947 A.2d at 905 (applying § 10-9.1-8) (internal quotation marks omitted). With respect to the case before us, however, we are of the same mind as was the hearing justice in perceiving no reason to invoke that “very limited and narrow exception” so as to permit the applicant to further pursue the claims contained in the second application for postconviction relief. Id. Accordingly, the applicant’s claims in his second application for postconviction relief are barred by res judicata, and we have no hesitation in holding that the hearing justice did not err in denying the applicant’s second application. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. Entered as an Order of this Court this 28th day of February, 2014 .

38,State : v. : Paul Fleck.,reversal,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Paul Fleck, appeals to this Court from a judgment of conviction of one count of simple domestic assault against Kim Dolbec in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3 and G.L. 1956 § 12-29-5. Under the provisions of § 12-29-5(c)(1), the defendant was deemed to be a felon because he had been convicted at least twice previously of domestic-violence offenses. As a result, the trial justice sentenced Fleck to ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), with three and one-half years to serve, and six and one-half years suspended, with probation. Before this Court, the defendant advances two arguments. First, he argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Second, he presses that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial under Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Specifically, and relevant to both arguments, the defendant maintains that the evidence presented at trial did not establish that Fleck and Dolbec were in a domestic', '-1- relationship, as is required under § 12-29-2. After a careful review of the defendant’s arguments, and for the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case arises from an incident that occurred during the course of an argument between defendant, Paul Fleck, and the complaining witness, Kim Dolbec, on September 13, 2009. Although the two were long acquainted, having first met in school nearly thirty years earlier, they had begun to date only some months before, after they were reintroduced by Dolbec’s neighbor, Heidi Leonard. At that time, both were living in East Providence. 1 Dolbec testified that soon after the pair began a relationship, she asked Fleck to move in with her, and that he did so, even though he continued to maintain his own apartment.', 'Dolbec testified that after she made dinner for defendant on September 13, defendant grabbed her by the arm and struck her in the face with a closed fist. Although by all indications this was the first incident of physical violence between the two, the substance of the argument was familiar to this couple because it arose when defendant accused Dolbec of cheating on him. As she did whenever defendant made such accusations, Dolbec denied them because, as she testified, she told him, “[w]hen I’m with somebody, I’m not a slut. Excuse my language.” Dolbec did not report the assault at that time; she testified that she did not do so because she was afraid that Fleck would kill her if she did. However, two nights later, on September 15, defendant made similar accusations, and this time the accusations were coupled with poking 1', 'The precise length of time that defendant and Dolbec dated is unclear because Dolbec testified that she had suffered a brain injury that caused her to forget certain details of her life and of her relationship with defendant. There were indications that Dolbec suffered that injury as a result of her being a victim of a separate domestic-violence incident that did not involve defendant. Dolbec testified that she and defendant had been dating for a few months, but she previously had told a responding police officer that the two had dated for a period of five months.', '-2- Dolbec in the chest. After this second incident, Dolbec left the apartment and went to Leonard’s residence because she could not “take [defendant] hitting [her] anymore.” After listening to Dolbec’s story, Leonard notified the police, who arrived after “just a few minutes.”', 'East Providence Police Officers Ryan Vose and Genevieve Rock responded to a call for a “delayed domestic assault,” and they took a statement from Dolbec. Officer Vose testified that he had observed that Dolbec was visibly shaken and that she had “a black eye that appeared to be coming down” as well as some bruising on her right arm. At the police station, the officers photographed Dolbec’s injuries; the photos eventually were entered into evidence. Dolbec related to Officer Vose that defendant had been her boyfriend for five months and that she had been living with him. Officer Vose noted on the Domestic Violence Sexual Assault Reporting (DVSA) form that Fleck was Dolbec’s “intimate partner.” Officer Rock also spoke with Dolbec at the Leonard residence, noting the bruises and that she appeared to be very nervous out of fear of Mr. Fleck. Officer Rock indicated that Dolbec’s bruises were consistent with her story of the physical abuse that she claimed had occurred two days earlier.', 'The East Providence Police apprehended Fleck on the evening of September 15 without incident, after spotting him on a park bench near Riverside Square in East Providence. Fleck was charged with one count of simple domestic assault on November 6, 2009. The defendant was tried before a jury on March 7-9, 2011.', 'At the conclusion of the prosecution’s case, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29. The defendant argued that the state had introduced insufficient evidence that Fleck and Dolbec had been in a domestic relationship, as that term is defined in § 12-29-2. After reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the state as she was required to do, the trial justice concluded that there had', '-3- been a domestic relationship, and she denied the motion. The defendant then proceeded to present his defense. On March 9, 2011, the jury found defendant guilty of one count of simple domestic assault.', 'The defendant then filed a motion for new trial pursuant to Rule 33, which the trial justice heard and decided on March 25, 2011. The defendant argued that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of guilt because, under § 12-29-2(b), Fleck and Dolbec did not meet the definition of a domestic relationship. Sitting as the thirteenth juror, the trial justice conducted the three analyses as outlined in State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1366-67 (R.I. 1994). The trial justice considered all of the evidence presented by the state and defendant. She found Dolbec credible, remarking that, when Dolbec did not remember something, she did not “pretend she knew it” and noted that her testimony had been corroborated by the responding officers and her neighbor, Heidi Leonard. The trial justice reviewed the evidence, noting that it supported a finding that Fleck and Dolbec were in a domestic relationship. She further found that Fleck had lived with Dolbec, and she noted that Dolbec had referred to defendant as her boyfriend. The trial justice, after assessing the evidence of the relationship between the two, found that they indeed had been in a substantive dating relationship, noting that the length of that relationship had not been clearly established.', 'Finally, the trial justice described the frequency of the relationship noting that the parties had lived together and that defendant visited with Dolbec every evening after his workday ended. The trial justice said that she agreed with the jury’s verdict and, as a result, denied the motion. On June 10, 2011, the trial justice sentenced defendant to ten years at the ACI, three and one-half years to serve and the remainder to be suspended, with probation.', '-4-', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she denied both the Rule 29 and Rule 33 motions. Both arguments are premised on the same grounds: that the state failed to prove that Fleck and Dolbec were in a domestic relationship as that term is defined in § 12-29-2 of the Domestic Violence Prevention Act.', 'Standard of Review', ""It is well settled that a defendant has a higher hurdle to overcome when arguing a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal than when he seeks to prevail on a Rule 33 motion for new trial because when he renews an acquittal motion, the trial justice “must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state's witnesses, and draw[ing] therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” State v. Cardin, 987 A.2d 248, 250 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Caba, 887 A.2d 370, 372 (R.I. 2005)). In the case of a motion for new trial, however, the trial justice does not favor the state’s evidence, but “use[s] independent judgment to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 640 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Dame, 560 A.2d 330, 334 (R.I. 1989)). When faced, as here, with both Rule 29 and Rule 33 motions, “this Court first conducts a review of the new- trial motion.” See State v. Gaffney, 63 A.3d 888, 893 (R.I. 2013) (citing State v. Cardona, 969 A.2d 667, 672 (R.I. 2009)). “[U]nless a defendant can show that the presented evidence failed to support his or her conviction upon the motion-for-a-new-trial standard, a defendant necessarily will be unable to establish he or she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.” Pineda, 13 A.3d at 640 (citing State v. Hesford, 900 A.2d 1194, 1200 (R.I. 2006))."", 'At this juncture, it is important for us to note that a motion for new trial may be argued on two bases. A defendant may claim that the weight of the evidence was not adequate to convict him, or, in the alternative, he may argue that the evidence was legally insufficient to support a', '-5- conviction. State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009). Here, even though defendant casts his appeal as a challenge to the “sufficiency” of the evidence, his arguments and presentation of the law, both to the trial justice and to this Court, ask that his appeal be viewed through the prism of the more traditional, weight-of-the-evidence standard.', 'We previously have articulated the differing standards of review for sufficiency of the evidence versus weight of the evidence when a defendant appeals a trial justice’s denial of a motion for new trial. See State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235-36 (R.I. 2011); see also Clark, 974 A.2d at 569.', 'As set forth above, when a defendant argues that the evidence was legally insufficient to serve as the basis for conviction, the trial justice does not weigh the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses, examining it instead in the light most favorable to the prosecution. See Karngar, 29 A.3d at 1235. To deny the motion, the trial justice need only decide that any rational trier of fact “could have found that the prosecution established the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id.', 'On the other hand, a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence requires that “the trial justice act[] as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007)). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 140 (R.I. 2008)). We will not disturb the decision of a trial justice provided she “has complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion * * * unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise', '-6- was clearly wrong.” State v. Phannavong, 21 A.3d 321, 325 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Peoples, 996 A.2d 660, 664 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Because defendant urged that the trial justice, both in the hearing on the motion for a new trial and in his brief before this Court, act as the “thirteenth juror,” we will therefore consider defendant’s appeal as a challenge to the weight of the evidence, and not as to its legal sufficiency. See Karngar, 29 A.3d at 1235.', 'Discussion', 'Motion for New Trial', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred when she denied the motion for new trial because the evidence that the state presented did not establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant and Dolbec were in a domestic relationship as defined within the “[f]amily or household member” definition in § 12-29-2. That section informs § 12-29-5 which states in paragraph (c)(1):', '“Every person convicted of an offense punishable as a', 'misdemeanor involving domestic violence as defined in § 12-29-2', 'shall:', '“* * *', '“(ii) For a third and subsequent violation be deemed guilty', 'of a felony and be imprisoned for a term of not less than one year', 'and not more than ten (10) years.” The trial justice’s finding that the parties were in fact in a domestic relationship bore particular importance because of defendant’s rather impressive record of earlier domestic violence convictions. The defendant’s criminal record reveals a disturbing pattern of domestic abuse. From 1992 until 1996, defendant had four different domestic-misdemeanor convictions. And from 1997 until 2001, he was convicted of three felony domestic-assault charges. Because of his', '-7- prior domestic-violence convictions, if the parties’ relationship was deemed to be domestic in nature, defendant would be subject to the enhanced sentencing sanctions of the statute.', 'Relevant to our discussion here, § 12-29-2(b) defines a “Family or household member” as “persons who are or have been in a substantive dating or engagement relationship within the past one year which shall be determined by the court’s consideration of the following factors:', '“(1) the length of time of the relationship;', '“(2) the type of the relationship;', '“(3) the frequence [sic] of the interaction between the parties.” 2', 'When the trial justice considered the motion, she analyzed each of the factors outlined in the statute. The evidence supported that the type of relationship was intimate in that Dolbec referred to Fleck as her boyfriend and that they lived together. Dolbec also testified that the relationship was exclusive and that defendant often accused her of being unfaithful. The trial justice noted that there was some inconsistency with the testimony regarding the length of the relationship. Dolbec testified that she was unable to remember how long she and Fleck had lived together, but that they had been together “for a few months,” and initially Dolbec told the responding officer that they had dated for five months, prompting Officer Vose to refer to Fleck as an “intimate partner” on the DVSA form. With regard to the frequency of contact, the trial justice considered that the couple lived together, that Dolbec cooked dinner for defendant every 2', 'Significantly, the definition of family or household member under G.L. 1956 § 12-29-2 also includes “adult persons who are presently residing together or who have resided together in the past three (3) years.” The testimony at trial indicated that, although Fleck maintained his own apartment, there was testimony that he was living with Dolbec at the time of the incident in question. Therefore, the parties may well have qualified as household members under the statute without need for the analysis of the domestic-relationship aspect of the definition. However, the trial justice confined her analysis to the nature of the relationship between defendant and Dolbec. Thus, we will review the appeal based on the analysis and reasoning of the trial justice.', '-8- night, and that the two always had dinner together. After reviewing the statutory factors, the trial justice found that defendant and Dolbec were in a domestic relationship. 3', 'Because the characterization of defendant and Dolbec as being in a domestic relationship was proper, we must next determine if the trial justice appropriately denied the motion for new trial. We hold that that denial was appropriate. After an exacting review of the record, it is clear to us that the trial justice conducted a thorough and complete analysis of defendant’s motion for new trial. Although defendant attempts on appeal to challenge the credibility of the complaining witness due to her cognitive deficiencies, the trial justice came to a different conclusion.', '“This Court is loath to overturn the credibility findings of a trial justice because ‘it is the trial justice who has the opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testify and therefore is in a better position to weigh the evidence and to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses than is this [C]ourt.’” State v. Richardson, 47 A.3d 305, 318 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Penhallow v. Penhallow, 725 A.2d 896, 897 (R.I. 1998) (mem.)). In our opinion, the trial justice followed the proper procedure when considering the motion for new trial and did not overlook or misconceive material evidence. See Phannavong, 21 A.3d at 325. The trial justice’s denial of the motion for new trial was not clearly wrong, and we see no basis for disturbing her decision.', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'The defendant moved for judgment of acquittal at the close of the prosecution’s case, but did not renew that motion after presenting his defense. This Court has held that we will consider an appeal for a denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal only if the matter has been properly preserved. State v. Price, 68 A.3d 440, 444 (R.I. 2013) (citing State v. Tower, 984 A.2d 40, 45 3', 'On appeal, defendant asks this Court to reconsider our holding in State v. Enos, 21 A.3d 326 (R.I. 2011), a recent opinion that prompted two dissents. We decline to do so. In our opinion, this case bears little resemblance to Enos.', '-9- (R.I. 2009)). “We consistently have held that the failure to renew a motion for judgment of acquittal at the close of evidence forecloses the defendant’s right to appeal the denial.” Tower, 984 A.2d at 45. Therefore, the defendant’s Rule 29 motion has been waived. However, even if the motion had been preserved, it would have provided no relief to the defendant because we have affirmed the Superior Court with respect to the Rule 33 motion for new trial. In any event, we would not consider his Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal because any such review is unnecessary. See Pineda, 13 A.3d at 640; see also Cardona, 969 A.2d at 672 (noting that when this Court simultaneously faces a defendant’s challenge to the trial court’s rulings on motions for new trial and judgment of acquittal, we first conduct “the more exacting analysis required for review of a ruling on a motion for a new trial”).', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction in this case.

39,"State : v. : Francisco Pacheco. : ORDER This appeal stems from a jury trial in Providence County Superior Court. Francisco Pacheco, the defendant, appeals from the denial of his motion to dismiss one of the charges against him—namely, a charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test. Mr. Pacheco’s appeal from the denial of that motion came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. On December 28, 2011, during an interaction with officers from the Warren Police Department, Mr. Pacheco refused a preliminary breathalyzer test at the scene and then later refused to submit to a chemical test at the police station. On May 10, 2012, Mr. Pacheco was charged by criminal information with a number of counts, including refusal to submit to a chemical test after having been previously convicted of a chemical test refusal, in violation of -1- G.L. 1956 § 31-27-2.1(b)(2). 1 He was arraigned on June 20, 2012, and entered a plea of not guilty on the charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test. Subsequently, on July 15, 2013, Mr. Pacheco appeared before the Rhode Island Traffic Tribunal on a summons for refusing to submit to a preliminary breath test, in violation of § 31-27-2.3. That violation was dismissed after a brief hearing because the magistrate in the Traffic Tribunal concluded that the police officer who testified had not provided the required “evidentiary foundation” to sustain the violation. Mr. Pacheco thereafter moved in Superior Court to dismiss the charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test which was still pending in that court. He contended then, and he contends again before this Court, that the state was collaterally estopped from proceeding against him on the charge of refusal to submit to a chemical test in violation of § 31-27-2.1(b)(2) because, in his view, that issue had been previously adjudicated and decided in the Traffic Tribunal. On March 5, 2014, the trial justice denied Mr. Pacheco’s motion to dismiss on the grounds that the principle of collateral estoppel was not applicable in the circumstances of this case. The trial justice then proceeded to state the following: “Also, pursuant to the procedural requirements of [Rule] 12(b)(2) [of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure], the Court is also going to deny the motion on those grounds as to timeliness.” Mr. Pacheco was ultimately convicted by a Superior Court jury on the charge of refusing to submit to a chemical test in violation of § 31-27-2.1(b)(2); he was sentenced to five months incarceration, a two-year loss of his driver’s license, an eight hundred dollar fine, and one hundred hours of community service. Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure reads, in pertinent part, as follows: 1 Mr. Pacheco stipulated to the fact that he had previously been convicted of refusal to submit to a chemical test on June 3, 2008. -2- “The defense of double jeopardy and all other defenses and objections based on defects in the institution of the prosecution or in the indictment, information, or complaint other than that it fails to show jurisdiction in the court or to charge an offense may be raised only by motion before trial. The motion shall include all such defenses and objections then available to the defendant. Failure to present any such defense or objection as herein provided constitutes a waiver thereof, but the court for cause shown may grant relief from the waiver.” Additionally, Rule 12(b)(3) states the following: “The motion shall be made no later than thirty (30) days after the plea is entered * * * but in any event the Court may permit the motion to be made within a reasonable time after the plea is entered * * *.” Rule 12(b)(2) sets forth the general rule requiring that a motion to dismiss on collateral estoppel grounds (which would constitute a “defect[] in the institution of the prosecution”) be filed before trial; it appears that, in the instant case, Mr. Pacheco did in fact file his motion to dismiss before the impaneling of the jury began—thus, “before trial.” However, it is important to note that Rule 12(b)(3) proceeds to set forth a more specific requirement—viz. that a motion referenced in Rule 12(b)(2) must be filed within thirty days of the entry of the defendant’s plea. 2 See State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 963 (R.I. 1995) (stating that the temporal requirements set forth in Rule 12(b)(3) apply to the types of motions referenced in Rule 12(b)(2)). Mr. Pacheco pled not guilty on June 20, 2012, whereas the motion to dismiss was not filed until March of 2014—a time span of almost two years. 2 The trial justice accurately referenced Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure in his decision on Mr. Pacheco’s motion to dismiss. He did not mention the more specific terms of Rule 12(b)(3). We do not believe that the trial justice committed an error in referring to only Rule 12(b)(2) because Rule 12(b)(2) necessarily should be read in light of the specific requirement set forth in Rule 12(b)(3). See State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 963 (R.I. 1995). -3- While we remain cognizant of our Rule 12(b) jurisprudence (see Hightower, 661 A.2d at 963), in view of representations made by Mr. Pacheco’s present attorney at oral argument as to the possible health-related reason for the delay in the filing of his motion to dismiss and the fact that the timeliness vel non of the motion was not extensively addressed at the hearing in March of 2014, we have decided to remand the case to the Superior Court for the purpose of conducting an evidentiary hearing concerning the Rule 12(b) issue in this case. 3 For the reasons stated herein, we remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings as explained supra. The record may be returned to that tribunal. Entered as an Order of this Court, this 10th day of November, 2015. By Order, /s/ Clerk 3 Consequently, we need not address at this time the collateral estoppel issues which Mr. Pacheco has raised on appeal. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 41-42 n.4 (R.I. 2009) (referencing “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”). -4- RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE: State v.

40,"State : v. : Michael Rocchio. : ORDER The defendant, Michael Rocchio, appeals from a Superior Court order denying his motion to withdraw his plea of nolo contendere to one count of breaking and entering. On June 2, 2010, the defendant was charged with two counts of unlawful breaking and entering in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-2 and two counts of conspiracy to break and enter in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6. On May 14, 2012, the defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere to one of the breaking and entering counts in exchange for dismissal of the three remaining counts. In addition, the Superior Court agreed to impose a ten-year sentence, the defendant having to serve the first six months 1 and the remaining nine years, six months suspended, during which the defendant would be placed on probation. That same day, the defendant, through counsel, asked the Superior Court to stay execution of sentence until May 23, 2012. In the interim, the defendant filed a motion to withdraw his plea, to which the state objected. The defendant argued that he did not have sufficient time to discuss the consequences of his plea with his family, that he did not fully understand the consequences of an immediate plea of nolo contendere, and that if he had had an opportunity to consult with his family, he would not have entered the plea. The state countered, arguing that the defendant’s motion to 1 The term to serve has been stayed pending the disposition of this appeal. -1- withdraw was untimely because sentence had already been imposed. The state suggested that the proper avenue would be for the defendant to file an application for postconviction relief, but added that, even on the merits, the defendant’s motion to withdraw should be denied. On May 23, 2012, the Superior Court convened a hearing on the motion. Notwithstanding the timeliness argument raised by the state, the hearing justice chose to err on the side of giving the defendant the opportunity to proceed with his motion to withdraw. The hearing justice heard arguments from counsel and testimony from the defendant’s father. Taking all of this into consideration, he denied the motion. As a threshold inquiry, “we must first determine if this matter is properly before us.” State v. Castriotta, 80 A.3d 854, 855-56 (R.I. 2013). Rule 32(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[a] motion to withdraw a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere may be made only before sentence is imposed or deferred or probation is imposed or imposition of sentence is suspended.” As we have explained, “[o]nce a defendant has entered a plea of guilty or of nolo contendere and sentence has been imposed, any issue relating to the validity of the plea must be raised by way of postconviction relief.” Castriotta, 80 A.3d at 856 (quoting State v. Vashey, 912 A.2d 416, 418 (R.I. 2006)). Therefore, because the Superior Court had already accepted the defendant’s plea and sentenced him, but had only stayed the execution of sentence until a later date, the defendant’s appeal is not properly before this Court. However, under a similar set of facts, in Castriotta, despite stating that it was “our firm opinion * * * that [the] defendant's appeal [was] not properly before [the] Court,” we nonetheless discussed the merits of the defendant’s plaint. Castriotta, 80 A.3d at 856. We do the same here, briefly. -2- Our decision in State v. Carroll, 110 R.I. 532, 294 A.2d 187 (1972), focuses withdrawal of pleas on two questions: “[D]id the accused fully understand the consequences of his earlier plea and, if he did, is he now offering to adduce evidence at trial which, if believed, would tend to cast doubt on his guilt?” Id. at 536, 294 A.2d at 189. During the hearing on the motion to withdraw, the hearing justice engaged in a colloquy with the defendant’s father regarding the father’s assertion that he knew his son did not commit the crime pled to. The hearing justice found that the father’s testimony on behalf of his son, though laudable, was essentially devoid of any factual basis. Indeed, such bare assertions do not provide “any factual evidence which would cast doubt on [the defendant’s] guilt.” State v. Sfameni, 113 R.I. 150, 154, 318 A.2d 460, 462 (1974) (holding that the defendant’s mere “statement that he was not guilty” was insufficient “to satisfy the requirement of establishing doubt as to guilt”). Accordingly, after his careful consideration of the arguments raised by defense counsel and testimony from the defendant’s witness, the hearing justice determined that the defendant should not be permitted to withdraw his plea. In support of his determination, the hearing justice noted that, notwithstanding the testimony of the defendant’s father that his son had limited formal education, was unable to hold steady employment, and may have had concentration difficulties, there was “no evidence” introduced that “convince[d] [the] Court that [the defendant] did not knowingly, intelligently and freely understand that he was giving up his right[s] * * * by pleading nolo contendere.” Further, the hearing justice noted that the “defendant ha[d] presented absolutely no information or evidence to [the] Court that * * *, if believed, would tend to cast doubt on his guilt.” We cannot — especially in the absence of a -3- transcript of the underlying plea colloquy — say that the hearing justice abused his discretion in that determination. See Falcone v. State, 871 A.2d 361, 363 (R.I. 2005) (mem.). For the foregoing reasons we affirm the order of the Superior Court. The record in this case may be returned to that tribunal.

41,State : v. : John Whiting.,reversal,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The defendant, John Whiting, appeals from a judgment of conviction for felony larceny in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-41-1 and 11-41-5 and criminal solicitation in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-9. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The critical facts surrounding defendant’s convictions are not in dispute in this appeal. We therefore proceed to trace only the series of events necessary to the disposition of the legal issue at hand.', 'On November 22, 2011, defendant was charged by information with stealing over $500 in violation of §§ 11-41-1 and 11-41-5 (count 1) and soliciting another to receive stolen goods in violation of § 11-1-9 (count 2). 1 The information was later amended on May 11, 2012, to reflect the appropriate dates and locations when and where the alleged criminal activity took place. Subsequently, on June 8, 2012, the Governor signed into law an act amending § 11-41-5 to increase the threshold for felony larceny from $500 to $1,500. See P.L. 2012, ch. 176, §§ 1, 3. 1', 'A third count, soliciting another to obstruct the judicial system in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11- 1-9, was dismissed by the trial justice after the state’s case-in-chief.', '-1-', 'Soon afterwards, defendant’s case proceeded to a bench trial in the Providence County Superior Court starting on June 18, 2012, without either party or the trial justice being aware of the amendment to the statute. After the close of both the state’s and defense’s cases-in-chief, but before the trial justice rendered his decision, defense counsel apprised the trial justice of the amendment to the statute. Defense counsel then sought to have the larceny count amended and the solicitation charge dismissed or, in the alternative, amended. The state demurred, arguing that any change in the law should be applied only prospectively and that defendant, who had already been charged by the time the law was amended, should not benefit from the legislative change.', 'The trial justice agreed with the state and proceeded with the counts as charged. Both parties gave their closing arguments, and the trial justice rendered his decision from the bench on July 2, 2012. The trial justice found that the evidence was clear that the amount of money in question was $714. Accordingly, the trial justice found that defendant was guilty of having committed larceny over $500 (count 1) and having solicited another to commit a felony (i.e., receive stolen goods over $500) (count 2).', 'Just prior to sentencing on September 14, 2012, the trial justice entertained a motion to reconsider his decision denying defendant’s request to amend the charges in light of the changes to § 11-41-5. The motion was denied, and the trial justice proceeded to sentencing. The defendant was sentenced to five years imprisonment, with six months to serve, the remaining four and one-half years suspended with probation on count 1, and the same sentence to run concurrently on count 2. 2 A final judgment of conviction was later entered, and thereafter defendant timely appealed. 2', 'The sentences were stayed pending appeal.', '-2-', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the legislative intent behind the amendment to § 11-41- 5, increasing the threshold for felony larceny from $500 to $1,500 was to reclassify offenses under $1,500 from felonies to misdemeanors. Further, he argues that the amendment was ameliorative in nature and should inure to the benefit of defendants, including those whose cases were still pending on appeal when the statute was amended. The state counters, arguing that the general savings clause, G.L. 1956 § 43-3-23, 3 permits the prosecution and sentencing of defendant in accordance with the pre-amendment version of § 11-41-5.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that “we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.” State v.

In Fletcher, the defendant committed an offense in December of 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 43-3-23 provides:', '“No suit, prosecution, or indictment pending at the time of the repeal of', 'any statute for any offense committed or for the recovery of any fine, forfeiture,', 'or penalty incurred under the statute so repealed shall in any case be affected by', 'the repeal, but the suit, prosecution, or indictment may be proceeded with, and the', 'act shall be deemed to be in force for the purpose of prosecuting the act to final', 'judgment and execution or sentence, as the case may be.”', '-3- 1845, but was not indicted until March of 1846. In the interim, the statute under which the defendant had been charged had been amended. Accordingly, this Court quashed the indictment.', 'In response to the application of the rule of abatement, the General Assembly enacted a general savings clause set forth in § 43-3-23. The effect of Rhode Island’s general savings clause was first examined in State v. Lewis, 91 R.I. 110, 114, 161 A.2d 209, 212 (1960). In Lewis, 91 R.I. at 112, 161 A.2d at 210, the defendant allegedly operated an automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-27-2 on May 22, 1959. On September 1, 1959, § 31-27-2 was amended. In light of this amendment, on September 23, 1959, the defendant moved to dismiss the case arguing that the provisions of the new statute were different from what he had been charged with and pointing out that the repealing act did not contain a specific savings clause. Lewis, 91 R.I. at 112, 161 A.2d at 211. The state argued that the amendment did not create a new and different offense and that, alternatively, § 43-3-23 authorized maintenance of the prosecution under the pre-amended form of the act. Lewis, 91 R.I. at 113-14, 161 A.2d at 211-12.', 'The Court found that the state’s second argument regarding the general savings clause was dispositive and therefore, only addressed that argument. Lewis, 91 R.I. at 114, 161 A.2d at 212. The Court stated that the purpose of a savings clause was to abrogate the common law rule of abatement such that a savings clause “authorize[s] the continuance of prosecutions that were pending at the time of the repeal of the prior act.” Id. at 115, 161 A.2d at 212. In particular, the Court stated that the general savings clause was enacted “to save the necessity of the burdensome formality of attaching an identical saving[s] clause to all repealing legislation.” Id.

Shepherd, 210 N.W. 476, 476 (Iowa 1926)).', '-4-', 'While we have recognized that certain ameliorative statutes may be applied retroactively, such retroactive application may occur only if applying the general savings clause “would be clearly repugnant to the express provisions of the repealing statute.” Lewis, 91 R.I. at 115, 161 A.2d at 212. We have further clarified that such a determination “should be considered on a case-by-case basis.”', 'State v. Mullen, 740 A.2d 783, 786 (R.I. 1999).', 'In making that determination, we must consider the language of the repealing statute and the nature of the amendment.', 'Additionally, we must always be cognizant of the general presumption that “statutes will be given prospective application unless otherwise provided.” State v. Briggs, 58 A.3d 164, 168 (R.I. 2013) (quoting In re Alicia S., 763 A.2d 643, 646 (R.I. 2000)).', 'In State v. Babbitt, 457 A.2d 1049, 1055 (R.I. 1983), the defendant was charged in January of 1980 with transporting another for indecent purposes in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11- 34-5. While his charges were pending, the statute was amended “by adding the requirement that the proscribed conduct be conducted ‘for pecuniary gain.’” Babbitt, 457 A.2d at 1055 (quoting § 11-34-5). Because the scope of the amended statute did not cover the defendant’s conduct, his convictions on those counts were vacated. Id. at 1056.', 'Similarly, in Mullen, 740 A.2d at 784, the defendant was charged with committing abominable and detestable crimes against nature “with mankind” pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-10- 1. While his charges were pending, the statute was amended to remove the “with mankind” component from the ambit of proscribable conduct, thereby effectively decriminalizing sodomy. Mullen, 740 A.2d at 784-85. On appeal, the majority4 held that “the trial justice was correct in determining that it was the manifest intention of the Legislature to decriminalize the act of 4', 'A vigorous dissent by two justices of this Court was put forth in State v. Mullen, 740 A.2d 783 (R.I. 1999). The dissent posited that application of the general savings clause would not have been “inconsistent with nor repugnant to the General Assembly’s manifest intention to decriminalize sodomy as of the effective date of the repeal * * *.” Id. at 787 (Flanders, J., with whom Bourcier, J., joins dissenting).', '-5- sodomy between consenting adults.” Id. at 786. Accordingly, the majority reasoned that it would be “inconsistent with the intent of the Legislature to prosecute acts that are no longer criminal offenses,” and upheld the dismissal of the counts arising under the repealed statute. Id. At bottom, the majority opined that it would be “fundamentally unfair to prosecute an individual for prior conduct that would now not constitute a violation of law.”', 'Id.', 'Unlike the circumstances in Babbitt and Mullen, here, at all relevant times, defendant’s conduct was, and remains, criminal. There was no intention to pardon the type of act committed by defendant.', 'The defendant’s reliance on State v. Macarelli, 118 R.I. 693, 375 A.2d 944 (1977), also misses the mark. In Macarelli, 118 R.I. at 694, 375 A.2d at 945, the defendant had been found guilty by a Superior Court jury of conspiring to corrupt horse trainers.', 'The underlying substantive offense, G.L. 1956 § 11-7-9 “Corruption of sports participant or official,” carried a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment or a fine of $1,000. Macarelli, 118 R.I. at 695, 375 A.2d at 946. Notwithstanding this maximum, the defendant was sentenced to five years imprisonment under G.L. 1956 § 11-1-1, which at the time provided:', '“Every act and omission which is an offense at common law, and for', 'which no punishment is prescribed by this title, may be prosecuted and punished', 'as an offense at common law.

However, because the offense had not been specifically codified, “an indictment for common law conspiracy could', '-6- be obtained only pursuant to the statutory authority set forth in § 11-1-1.” LaPlume, 118 R.I. at 678, 375 A.2d at 942.', 'In 1975, while the defendant’s appeal in Macarelli was pending before this Court, § 11-1- 6 was enacted by P.L. 1975, ch. 283, § 2 which provides:', '“Except as otherwise provided by law, every person who shall conspire with', 'another to commit an offense punishable under the laws of this state shall be', 'subject to the same fine and imprisonment as pertain to the offense which the', 'person shall have conspired to commit, provided that imprisonment for the', 'conspiracy shall not exceed ten (10) years.” Not only did the enactment specifically codify conspiracy offenses, but it also fundamentally altered the sentencing scheme for conspiracy prosecutions. In light of the enactment, the Court determined that “it is apparent that the Legislature thought it inequitable to punish a conspiracy to commit a crime more harshly than the underlying substantive offense itself.” Macarelli, 118 R.I. at 699, 375 A.2d at 947. Consequently, the Court reasoned that the defendant should be afforded “the more lenient treatment.” Id.', 'It is evident that our opinion in Macarelli hinged on equitable considerations unique to the circumstances present in that case.

Id. at 356. The value of the stolen goods was approximately $8,000, which at the time of the offense would have qualified as second-degree larceny. Id.

Additionally, the court pointed out that the amended law did not contain “any express language in the provision referring to its retroactive application.” Id. at 360-61.

42,State : v. : Brian Verry.,reversal,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The defendant, Brian Verry (defendant), is before the Supreme Court on appeal from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury trial in the Superior Court. He was convicted of one count of felony assault, for which he received a twenty-year suspended sentence with twenty years of probation; one count of simple assault, for which he received a one-year sentence to be served concurrently with the other sentence imposed; and one count of first-degree child abuse, for which he received a sentence of twenty years, with fifteen years to serve and five years suspended with five years of probation. In support of his appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice (1) abused his discretion in refusing to grant a continuance, and (2) erred and violated the defendant’s right to present a defense when the trial justice prohibited the defendant’s father from testifying in the defendant’s case-in-chief. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case arose from the assault and abuse of Beth, 1 an infant less than two months of age. Beth was born on January 11, 2006, a premature birth; her parents are defendant and Megan Verry (Megan). On March 8, 2006, after discovering a “monstrous growth coming out of [Beth’s] head[,]” defendant and Megan brought Beth to the Emergency Room (ER) at South County Hospital. At the ER, Beth was seen by a triage nurse and a physician, Dr. William Sabina (Dr. Sabina). Doctor Sabina examined Beth and interviewed defendant and Megan. After ordering a CT scan of Beth’s head and examining her a second time, Dr. Sabina diagnosed Beth with a subdural hematoma with cephalohematoma; she was transferred, by ambulance, to the Emergency Department at Hasbro Children’s Hospital (Hasbro). The Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) was notified that the infant may have been abused. 2', 'At Hasbro, doctors performed a series of tests, which revealed that Beth suffered horrifying injuries, including a large skull fracture with both fresh and old bleeding in the brain. X-rays and an MRI also revealed small fractures near the ends of the infant’s bones, where the bones grow; both collarbones had been fractured and were healing; the child’s ribs were fractured in eighteen places; and her pelvis was cracked. In total, in her brief fifty-five days of life, the infant had sustained between thirty-six and forty bone fractures, including a skull fracture. Because of the number of fractures, Dr. Carol Jenny (Dr. Jenny), the director of the Child Protection Team at Hasbro, consulted a geneticist, Dr. Diane Abuelo (Dr. Abuelo), to recommend testing to determine whether Beth had an underlying bone disease, osteogenesis 1', 'In order to protect her privacy, the infant has been given a pseudonym. 2', 'Doctor Sabina testified that he contacted DCYF because nothing in Beth’s history explained the causation of her brain swelling and because the CT indicated that some of the blood in Beth’s brain could have been there days or weeks earlier.', '-2- imperfecta (OI or brittle bone disease). Hasbro subsequently sent a skin biopsy and blood sample to a laboratory in Seattle, Washington, for genetic testing. 3', 'Doctor Jenny and Dr. Kathleen McCarten (Dr. McCarten), a pediatric radiologist who also examined the child and performed tests, testified that they did not attribute the child’s injuries to an underlying bone disease. According to Dr. Jenny, because of the fact that Beth had not fractured any more bones since the March 8, 2006 incident, coupled with the fact that her bones had healed and developed “beautifully” since the initial trauma, it was Dr. Jenny’s opinion that Beth did not have OI.', 'Doctor Jenny concluded that Beth’s injuries were caused by “excessive” squeezing, “abusive rough handling[,]” and “abusive head trauma.” 4', 'Because child abuse was suspected in this case, DCYF placed a forty-eight-hour hold on Beth, and she was removed from her parents’ custody. The Narragansett Police Department began an investigation; Det. Timothy Lackie (Det. Lackie) went to defendant’s home in order to interview the parents. The defendant was not home when Det. Lackie arrived, and Megan was interviewed first. The next day, on March 10, 2006, Det. Lackie interviewed defendant at the police station, with his attorney present. The defendant told the police that Beth’s head may have hit the arm of a rocking chair while he was holding her on the night of March 8 and that he might have “held her too tight a couple of times.”', 'A DCYF child protective investigator, Katherine Bianchi (Bianchi), also interviewed defendant. Bianchi testified that defendant had stated that “on several occasions, in an effort to make [Beth] stop crying, he squeezed her.” The defendant also reported that he had previously 3', 'Although the genetic testing found a “sequence variant[,]” the results failed to conclude that the infant had OI or any bone disease. 4', 'Doctor Lauren Noel (Dr. Noel), Beth’s pediatrician, testified that, at the time of trial, the infant had not broken a single bone since being discharged from Hasbro in April 2006.', '-3- “hit her * * * on the changing table in an effort to make her stop crying.” The defendant further stated that, on the night Beth was hospitalized, “he had hit [Beth’s] head on the changing table in an effort to have her stop crying and also her head on the side of the rocking chair in an effort * * * to make her stop crying.”', 'The defendant was arrested and subsequently charged, by criminal information, with three felony crimes: two counts of felony assault, serious bodily injury due to Beth’s skull fracture and serious bodily injury due to Beth’s fractured ribs, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2; and one count of first-degree child abuse, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-9-5.3. In April 2010, a jury trial commenced in Superior Court. On April 20, 2010, the trial justice granted a judgment motion of acquittal on count two, reducing the felony assault charge concerning the fractured ribs to the lesser-included offense of a simple assault.

On January 5, 2011, day two of jury selection in defendant’s second trial, the state provided defense counsel with a report discussing results from the requested supplemental testing conducted in the Seattle, Washington laboratory. After receiving the report, defense counsel asked the trial justice for a continuance of at least one week, based on his contention that more time and information were needed in order to retain an expert to testify about the report and explain a sentence in the report that stated, “[g]iven these findings[,] in addition to the report of no signs of OI in your patient, the father, [defendant], we believe it is unlikely that this variant contributes to bone fragility.” Apparently, defense counsel had learned—recently—that when defendant was four months old, he broke his femur and that defendant’s family may have information of “other incidents of broken bones within the family[.]” Defense counsel requested a continuance to determine whether this new information, in conjunction with the recently received laboratory report, could explain Beth’s injuries.

The state appeals from an order of the Superior Court granting the defendant’s motions to suppress and/or exclude evidence obtained by Pawtucket police detectives following the defendant’s arrest in the city of Providence. The defendant Steven B. Morris (Morris or defendant) was indicted for two separate incidents of first-degree robbery committed in Pawtucket in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a). On appeal, the state argues that the hearing justice erred in deciding that evidence stemming from an extra- jurisdictional arrest was subject to the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts in this matter are largely undisputed. The first of the two robberies with which defendant was charged occurred on September 6, 2010 when Alcides Dias, an assistant manager', '-1- at PCX Clothing Store in Pawtucket, was robbed at knifepoint. 1 Detective David Silva of the Pawtucket Police Department testified that Dias described the robber as being a “black male in his forties, or late thirties, * * * heavyset, stocky,” and wearing a red hat, white shirt, black and blue shorts, and black gloves with the tips cut off. A few days later, on September 9, 2010, the Save-a-Lot grocery store in Pawtucket was also robbed at knifepoint. Nicole Cookson, the victim in that robbery, described the robber as being “a black male, forties, stocky build, Hawaiian shirt, yellow hat, running shorts[.]” Two other witnesses said that the robber fled the store in a black Mercedes Benz with a temporary license plate in the rear window of the car. The witnesses also said that the license plate contained the numbers 1367 or 1376. Detectives Silva and Donti Rosciti of the Pawtucket Police Department reviewed the surveillance footage from both robberies and, based on the videos, formed a belief that the person who had robbed the PCX had also committed the Save-a-Lot robbery. They then sent an email to all other police officers in the department with the description of the getaway vehicle.', 'The following day, Officer Mark Ramos identified a car matching that description parked outside of 327 Sayles Avenue in Pawtucket.', 'Officer Ramos notified the detectives and discovered, on speaking to one of the residents, that the car belonged to “a black male * * * who lived on the third floor.” Detective Silva used the vehicle identification number of the car and was informed by the dealer at Class Act Auto Sales that the car had been sold to Morris. Officer Ramos and the detectives then went to the third floor of the building and received the consent of the resident to search the apartment. The resident of the apartment confirmed that Morris sometimes stayed overnight as a guest and directed the police to a storage room in the apartment 1', 'The facts in this section are taken from the testimony of the detectives and other witnesses who testified at the hearing.', '-2- where defendant kept some of his belongings.

The defendant identified the vehicle by asking, “My Mercedes?” Detective Silva told defendant that the detectives needed to speak with him. Although defendant offered to take a bus to the Pawtucket police station, he was eventually convinced by Det. Silva that he be picked up at Crossroads 2 in Providence.', 'On arriving at Crossroads, the detectives saw defendant and recognized him as the person whom they had observed in the surveillance footage from both robberies.', 'After a brief conversation with defendant in which he agreed to accompany the detectives to the police station, Det. Rosciti performed a pat-down search of him. Detective Rosciti testified that the pat- down looking for weapons was standard procedure before any civilian is permitted to enter a police vehicle. On performing the pat-down, Det. Rosciti felt something like paper or plastic in one of defendant’s pockets and removed it. The piece of paper that Det. Rosciti took from defendant’s pocket was later identified as being a U-Haul rental truck receipt. Detective Rosciti testified that he took it out because he believed it might be contraband, such as a small packet of heroin or marijuana.', 'Morris was taken to the Pawtucket police station in the detectives’ car. Morris was not handcuffed while in the car. After arriving at the Pawtucket police station, defendant reviewed and initialed a Miranda rights waiver form. The detectives asked defendant where he had been the previous day, September 9, 2010, and defendant answered that he had been helping his sister move from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. and had rented a U-Haul truck for that purpose. It was at that point 2', 'Crossroads is a facility, located on Broad Street in Providence, that offers shelter and other life services for the homeless.', '-3- that the detectives looked at the U-Haul receipt that had been seized from defendant’s person during the pat-down search.

Following the conversation with Vivian Morris, the detectives then went to the U-Haul franchise in Pawtucket and reviewed the surveillance footage there. This footage showed defendant wearing what appeared to be the same clothing that the suspect in the Save-a-Lot robbery had been wearing.', 'The defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree robbery for the two armed robberies. The defendant filed a number of pretrial motions, including a motion to sever the charges pursuant to Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, as well as several motions to suppress (1) certain clothing and paperwork found in the apartment on Sayles Avenue in Pawtucket, (2) the U-Haul receipt seized from defendant’s person, (3) photographs taken from the surveillance video from the U-Haul franchise in Pawtucket, (4) the statements defendant made to the Pawtucket police, and (5) the testimony of defendant’s sister, Vivian Morris.', 'The pretrial motions were heard in the Providence County Superior Court on February 23, 24, and 27, 2012. The hearing justice granted defendant’s motion to sever the charges, and the state elected to proceed first on the charge involving the Save-a-Lot robbery. 3 After hearing testimony and argument, the hearing justice granted defendant’s motion to suppress the U-Haul receipt, concluding that defendant was under arrest from the moment of the pat-down procedure and that “the arrest was illegal because it was outside [the] jurisdiction [of the detectives].” The hearing justice also granted defendant’s motions to suppress defendant’s statement to the 3', 'The motion to sever is not an issue before this Court.', '-4- Pawtucket police, the testimony of defendant’s sister, and the U-Haul surveillance video photographs as “fruits of the poisonous tree” stemming from defendant’s unauthorized arrest. 4 The hearing justice denied defendant’s motion to suppress the clothing and paperwork seized from the apartment on Sayles Avenue. 5', 'The state timely filed a notice to appeal the hearing justice’s granting of defendant’s various motions to suppress evidence, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-24-32. 6', 'A final order memorializing the hearing justice’s decisions on defendant’s motions to dismiss was entered on May 14, 2012. 7', 'Additional facts will be supplied as necessary to address the issues on appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In reviewing the grant or denial of a motion to suppress, this Court accords deference to the trial justice’s factual findings and accepts those findings unless they are clearly erroneous.

Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 178 (2008), in which the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment “does not require the exclusion of evidence obtained from a constitutionally permissible arrest.” The state contends that the police officers’ actions were reasonable and that consequently, the exclusionary rule is too extreme a remedy under the facts of this case. In contrast, defendant argues that application of the exclusionary rule is the appropriate remedy for a violation of state law and that the circumstances of the instant case did not otherwise justify the detectives’ failure to respect the jurisdictional boundaries of their authority.', 'A', 'The Authority of the Pawtucket Police Officers', 'This Court has repeatedly held to the principle that “[i]n the absence of a statutory or judicially recognized exception, the authority of a local police department is limited to its own jurisdiction.” State v.

The first, known as the “hot pursuit” exception, permits police officers who are in “close pursuit” of a person to cross into another jurisdiction in order to arrest that person.', 'See G.L. 1956 § 12-7-19. 11 “Second, in emergency situations, it may be necessary and appropriate for the police from one jurisdiction to exercise authority in another jurisdiction.” Ceraso, 812 A.2d at 833; see also G.L. 1956 § 45-42-1 (granting officers responding to a request for “emergency police assistance from another police department * * * the same authority, powers, duties, privileges, and immunities as a duly appointed police officer of the city or town making the request”).

Consequently, he concluded that the arrest, although based on probable cause, was unauthorized as a violation of the detectives’ jurisdictional authority.', 'We agree with the hearing justice’s conclusion that neither of the statutory exceptions applies to the case at bar. Detectives Rosciti and Silva were not in hot pursuit of defendant nor were they in Providence at the Providence Police Department’s request.', 'The defendant contends that the detectives had probable cause to arrest him before they arrived at Crossroads and that the detectives had, consequently, traveled to Providence with the specific intention of doing so. We disagree with defendant’s contention. We have held that “[p]robable cause to arrest exists when the facts and circumstances within the police officer’s knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person’s belief that a crime has been committed and that the person to be arrested has committed the crime.” Musterd, 56 A.3d at 936 (quoting State v. Kryla, 742 A.2d 1178, 1182 (R.I. 1999)). We are of the opinion that probable cause for defendant’s arrest did not arise until the detectives arrived at Crossroads and visually identified him as the person they had seen in the surveillance videos of the robberies. Until the detectives matched defendant with the perpetrator of the robberies in the videos, they knew only that defendant was the owner of a car that appeared to match the one used at the Save-a-Lot robbery. Accordingly, we cannot agree with defendant’s contention that the detectives crossed the boundary into Providence with the intent to arrest him. We give credence to Det. Silva’s testimony at the hearing that, at the time, they intended only to transport defendant to the Pawtucket police station to question him about the involvement of defendant’s Mercedes in the robberies.', '-8-', 'The defendant further argues that the Pawtucket detectives should have called the Providence police before they entered Providence. We disagree with defendant’s argument and find our recent opinion in Hagan to be informative. In Hagan, Portsmouth police, having lawfully arrested the defendant in their jurisdiction, drove him to Middletown in order to conduct a Breathalyzer test after discovering that the machine in Portsmouth was malfunctioning. See Hagan, 819 A.2d at 1257. There, we distinguished between the “arrest and seizure of a suspect outside a municipality’s borders * * * and the extraterritorial transport of a prisoner who is in lawful custody, for the performance of legitimate law enforcement duties * * *.” Id. at 1261. We “acknowledge[d] the practical realities of police investigations into unlawful conduct” in holding that “[a] police officer may take a prisoner already in lawful custody to another municipality to carry out legitimate law enforcement duties.” Id. Similarly, in the case at bar, we are satisfied that the Pawtucket police could properly travel outside of their jurisdiction without the accompaniment of Providence police in the course of investigating the robberies. We find no fault with the Pawtucket detectives’ behavior until they arrived at Crossroads.', 'We acknowledge that once the Pawtucket detectives arrived at Crossroads and made their visual identification of defendant as the perpetrator of the robberies, their actions did not follow the mandates for proper law enforcement activities outside of their jurisdiction. The state argues that, upon identifying defendant, the detectives were then justified in immediately arresting him to prevent defendant from “abscond[ing], perhaps to commit a third violent crime before recapture[.]” We do not agree with the state’s argument. Indeed, we find it implausible based on the facts of the case at bar. The defendant’s meeting the detectives at Crossroads and his cooperation with the detectives when they arrived do not indicate to this Court that defendant was a threat to flee from the police. We note that, if defendant had been inclined to flee, he', '-9- would hardly have been waiting at Crossroads to be questioned by the detectives at all. While the detectives may well not have expected defendant to appear, we deem it unreasonable to believe that he presented a risk of flight, once they saw that defendant had, in fact, met them at Crossroads. 13 Accordingly, we are satisfied that, from the moment the detectives arrived at Crossroads and determined they had probable cause to make an arrest, our jurisprudence required that they contact the Providence police department to ask for its assistance in arresting defendant. It was undisputed that Crossroads is located close to the Providence police station. Under the circumstances, we do not believe that requiring the Pawtucket detectives to contact the Providence police in order to make the arrest would have placed an unreasonable burden on them.', 'We emphasize that there is nothing in the record to indicate that contacting the Providence police and then waiting for their assistance would have required unlawfully detaining defendant for any length of time but rather could have been done in a matter of minutes. “[W]e are cognizant of the strong public interest underlying jurisdictional restraints over law enforcement personnel and are mindful that the Legislature has granted limited authority to an officer to arrest a suspect outside his or her jurisdiction * * *.” Hagan, 819 A.2d at 1261. Under the circumstances presented here, we decline to expand the authority which the Legislature has granted to a police officer to arrest a suspect outside of his or her jurisdiction. Consequently, we hold that the Pawtucket detectives’ actions in arresting defendant outside their jurisdiction without even attempting to get the assistance and approval of the Providence police were unauthorized and in excess of their authority. 13', 'We find a belief that defendant posed a risk of flight to be especially unreasonable under the circumstances as defendant was, to the best of the detectives’ knowledge, without the use of a car. We note that defendant had previously offered to take the bus to the Pawtucket police station.', '- 10 -', 'B', 'The Appropriate Remedy for Defendant’s Unauthorized Arrest', 'Our analysis, however, must continue on to determine whether the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution mandates the exclusion of evidence obtained from defendant’s extra-jurisdictional arrest. The state argues that application of “the exclusionary rule is too harsh a remedy for any violation of a state jurisdictional statute” where, as here, the police officers “act[ed] in good-faith furtherance of their duty to protect the public[.]”', 'It is axiomatic that “[t]he exclusionary rule bars from introduction at trial evidence obtained either during or as a direct result of searches and seizures in violation of an individual’s Fourth Amendment rights.” State v. Jennings, 461 A.2d 361, 368 (R.I. 1983). This prohibition against the use of evidence obtained after an illegal search applies with equal force against the use of evidence obtained from an unlawful arrest. See Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 485 (1963).', 'The exclusionary rule operates as “a judicially created remedy designed to safeguard Fourth Amendment rights generally through its deterrent effect, rather than a personal constitutional right of the party aggrieved.” United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 348 (1974). “[W]hether the exclusionary rule’s remedy is appropriate in a particular context * * * [is] an issue separate from the question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct.” Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 223 (1983). The United States Supreme Court has warned that “unbending application of the exclusionary sanction to enforce ideals of governmental rectitude would impede unacceptably the truth- finding functions of judge and jury.” United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 734 (1980). It is with these general principles in mind that we will consider whether the evidence obtained as a result of defendant’s unauthorized arrest must be suppressed.', '- 11 -', 'The United States Supreme Court has recently addressed the question of whether the Fourth Amendment requires that evidence obtained from a search made incident to an arrest that was unlawful under state law be excluded. See Moore, 553 U.S. at 177-78. Moore involved an arrest for the misdemeanor of driving on a suspended license, which under Virginia law was not an arrestable offense. Id. at 167. The Supreme Court concluded that “the arrest rules that the officers violated were those of state law alone” and “it is not the province of the Fourth Amendment to enforce state law.” 14 Id. at 178. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment did not require the exclusion of the evidence because of a violation of a state law where the arrest was otherwise “constitutionally permissible” under the federal constitution. Id.', 'More recently, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has addressed the issue of whether evidence obtained after an arrest made outside of a federal law enforcement officer’s jurisdiction is inadmissible for that reason. See United States v. Ryan, 731 F.3d 66, 67 (1st Cir. 2013). In Ryan, a United States Park Ranger saw the defendant driving over the center line of the road and after following the defendant, pulled him over for the traffic violation, at which time the Ranger determined that the defendant was intoxicated. 15 Id. The traffic stop and the defendant’s subsequent arrest occurred outside of the National Park System and, therefore, outside of the federal statutory jurisdiction of the Ranger. Id. at 67-68. The First Circuit cited Moore in noting that, generally, federal constitutional claims have not been based on violations 14', 'The United States Supreme Court specifically noted that “Virginia law does not, as a general matter, require suppression of evidence obtained in violation of state law.” Virginia v. Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 167 (2008). The Supreme Court’s analysis, therefore, was limited to the question of whether suppression was required under the federal constitution. Id. at 168. 15', 'The federal statute limiting the jurisdiction of the Ranger included an exception for when a person flees to avoid arrest. See United States v. Ryan, 731 F.3d 66, 68 n.2 (1st Cir. 2013). In Ryan, however, there was no claim that the defendant was fleeing and so this exception was deemed to be inapplicable. Id.', '- 12 - of state or federal statutes concerning arrest. See id. at 69. The court concluded that “an officer * * * arrest[ing] an obviously intoxicated driver just outside that officer’s territorial jurisdiction, after a lawful traffic stop, is ‘not remotely’ akin to the invasions of privacy that might call for the exclusion of evidence [under the Fourth Amendment].” Id. at 70.', 'Here, there is no question that defendant’s arrest, although extra-jurisdictional, involves only a violation of state law and not of defendant’s constitutional rights. As a general matter, “the lawfulness of a state arrest by state police is governed by state law so long as that law is not inconsistent with federal constitutional standards.” State v. Berker, 120 R.I. 849, 855, 391 A.2d 107, 111 (1978). This Court has further concluded that a warrantless arrest made under our state statutes is “constitutionally sound * * * to the extent that it meets the requirement of probable cause[.]” Id. at 856, 391 A.2d at 111; cf. Ryan, 731 F.3d at 70 (noting that Moore “implies that an extraterritorial arrest is not a per se violation of the Fourth Amendment”). Our primary concern here is, therefore, with the requirements of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule for an arrest, based on probable cause, that was made outside the territorial jurisdiction of the arresting officer. We hold, in conjunction with the United States Supreme Court and the First Circuit, that the Fourth Amendment does not mandate exclusion of evidence obtained after defendant’s arrest outside of the Pawtucket detectives’ jurisdiction.', 'Although the arrest here was in excess of the officers’ jurisdiction, the Fourth Amendment does not impose some hypothetical ideal of a law enforcement officer’s conduct, but rather is concerned with whether the officer’s conduct was “reasonable” under the circumstances. See State v. Taveras, 39 A.3d 638, 648 (R.I. 2012) (“The lynchpin of any Fourth Amendment analysis is reasonableness.”); see also State v. Johnson, 102 R.I. 344, 351, 352, 353, 230 A.2d 831, 835, 836 (1967) (stating that “standards of reasonableness under the Fourth', '- 13 - Amendment are not susceptible of Procrustean application” and that a court “should measure the totality of circumstances against the constitutional standard of reasonableness” and be mindful of the fact that “a law enforcement officer * * * must act on a quick appraisal of the facts before him without the benefit of the hindsight which is usually possessed by those reviewing his actions”). This Court has stated that the exercise of our supervisory power to interpret and apply the exclusionary rule “should be exercised with great restraint after balancing carefully the societal interests involved.” State v. Jackson, 570 A.2d 1115, 1117 (R.I. 1990). We are of the opinion that the detectives’ actions in the case at bar do not constitute egregious conduct in excess of their jurisdiction. Accordingly, we conclude that the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment does not apply here to suppress the evidence gathered as a result of defendant’s unauthorized arrest. 16', 'The defendant urges us to adopt the reasoning of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Commonwealth v. Hernandez, 924 N.E.2d 709 (Mass. 2010). In Hernandez, the Supreme Judicial Court upheld the suppression of evidence obtained after Boston University campus police had arrested the defendant without the statutory authority to do so. See id. at 710- 11. The Supreme Judicial Court addressed the holding in Moore, but concluded that past precedents of that court had established that suppression was appropriate because “exclusion is a deterrent to the abuse of official power based on the application of State legal principles.” Id. at 16', 'The defendant asserts that this Court has previously applied the exclusionary rule as a remedy for the violation of state law, citing, in particular, State v. Robinson, 658 A.2d 518 (R.I. 1995) as a case where this Court used the exclusionary rule to suppress a confession obtained after a violation of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. We are convinced, however, that this case is not applicable to the case at bar. Robinson involved an arrest and detention made without probable cause, where the actions of the police were egregious. Robinson, 658 A.2d at 520-21. Indeed, this Court explicitly noted that what was at issue in Robinson was “[t]he violation of * * * constitutional protections,” not only a violation of a state procedural rule. Id. at 522.', '- 14 - 712. We deem Hernandez to be inapposite to the instant case. To begin with, the Supreme Judicial Court based its conclusion on its own past precedents and Massachusetts statutory law, which differ both from the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court and from our own jurisprudence. See id. at 712-13; cf. State v. Barros, 24 A.3d 1158, 1167 (R.I. 2011) (declining to follow the reasoning of the Supreme Judicial Court with regard to jury instructions about custodial interrogations). In addition, we note that the conduct of the campus police in Hernandez was significantly more egregious than the conduct of the Pawtucket detectives here. In Hernandez, the campus police apparently decided to run a check of the defendant’s automobile when the defendant was engaged in nothing more suspicious than pumping gasoline and then proceeded to arrest the defendant for an outstanding warrant for an offense that had no connection to the university. See Hernandez, 924 N.E.2d at 711. The campus police behavior in Hernandez is not analogous to the conduct of the Pawtucket detectives here. Accordingly, we decline to adopt the reasoning of Hernandez to order the suppression of the evidence the Pawtucket detectives obtained in the instant case.', 'We recognize that Rhode Island also has a statutory exclusionary rule embodied in G.L. 1956 § 9-19-25. 17', 'This Court has, however, concluded that § 9-19-25 largely tracks the exclusionary rule of the Fourth Amendment. See State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1113 (R.I. 1992) (“[T]his [C]ourt has, with very few exceptions, followed the opinions of the United States Supreme Court whether premised on the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or on our own statutory exclusionary rule. The Rhode Island exclusionary rule is a statute that has 17', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-19-25 states:', '“In the trial of any action in any court of this state, no', 'evidence shall be admissible where the evidence shall have been', 'procured by, through, or in consequence of any illegal search and', 'seizure as prohibited in § 6 of article 1 of the constitution of the', 'state of Rhode Island.”', '- 15 - never acquired or developed an independent body of jurisprudence.”). Moreover, because we are satisfied that, under Moore, 553 U.S. at 169, and Ryan, 731 F.3d at 69-70, defendant’s arrest did not violate the Fourth Amendment, we conclude that it similarly did not violate defendant’s rights under article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution. See State v. Foster, 842 A.2d 1047, 1050 n.3 (R.I. 2004) (noting that the Fourth Amendment “is substantively the same as article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution”); see also Brousseau v. Town of Westerly, 11 F.Supp. 2d 177, 183 (D. R.I. 1998) (recognizing that article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island constitution is generally co-extensive with the federal Fourth Amendment). Accordingly, we are of the opinion that our statutory exclusionary rule also does not mandate the suppression of the evidence obtained in this case.', 'In so doing, we emphasize that our holding is limited to the specific facts of the case at bar. We reserve for another day a decision as to whether more egregious violations of state law would trigger application of our statutory exclusionary rule. Cf. Mattatall, 603 A.2d at 1112-13 (declining to expand our statutory exclusionary rule in that case beyond what was required under the Fourth Amendment).', 'As this Court has stated before, “[w]e believe that an exclusionary rule is strong medicine indeed since it deprives the trier of fact in many instances of highly relevant and reliable evidence.” Jackson, 570 A.2d at 1117. We are of the opinion that the detectives’ conduct here was not egregious enough to justify exclusion of probative evidence, and we decline to expand our exclusionary rule jurisprudence to require the suppression of evidence in the circumstances of the case at bar. Accordingly, we hold that the hearing justice erred in granting the defendant’s motions to suppress the U-Haul receipt, his statement to the Pawtucket police, the testimony of the defendant’s sister, and the U-Haul surveillance video photographs.', '- 16 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the order of the Superior Court granting the defendant’s motions to suppress the evidence obtained as a result of his arrest.

44,State : v. : Pedro Marte.,reversal,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Pedro Marte, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction for possession with intent to deliver cocaine. After a jury trial, the defendant was sentenced to a term of ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with two years to serve, and eight years suspended. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred: (1) by not excluding evidence that the defendant was carrying cash at the time of his arrest; and (2) in denying the defendant any remedy for the state’s late disclosure of that evidence. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On September 13, 2010, at approximately 8 p.m., two Providence police detectives observed a vehicle idling in the parking lot of a Wendy’s restaurant at the corner of Public and', '-1- Eddy Streets in the City of Providence. Detective Kristopher Poplaski and his partner, Det. Patrick Potter, testified that there were two occupants in the vehicle, one of whom—passenger Seth McGough—was using a cell phone. Detective Poplaski testified that he observed a Nissan drive into the lot a short time later. The driver, whom Det. Poplaski identified as defendant, was also talking on a cell phone. According to Det. Poplaski, defendant pulled into the parking space next to McGough and then pulled back out of the space and drove out of the parking lot, towards Public Street. Detective Poplaski testified that McGough’s vehicle followed defendant’s out of the lot and down Public Street. Detectives Poplaski and Potter followed the two vehicles as they turned onto Temple Street. Detective Poplaski testified that defendant’s vehicle pulled over and parked on the side of the road, and McGough’s vehicle pulled up and parked immediately behind it.', 'According to Det. Poplaski, McGough exited his car and entered the front passenger side of defendant’s vehicle. At that point, Det. Poplaski recounted, Det. Potter drove by defendant’s vehicle “very slowly.” As their car drew alongside defendant’s vehicle, Det. Poplaski observed McGough hand something to defendant and defendant hand something to McGough in what he characterized as “a transaction that occurred very quickly.” The detectives exited their vehicle; and although Det. Potter arrested defendant immediately, McGough fled on foot. Detective Poplaski pursued McGough and witnessed as he placed something in his mouth.', 'As he approached McGough, Det. Poplaski recalled that he directed McGough to “spit it out.” According to Det. Poplaski, McGough spit two clear plastic bags of suspected cocaine onto the', '-2- ground. The substance in the bags was weighed and tested and determined to be 3.1 grams of cocaine. 1', 'Mr. McGough testified that, on the night of September 13, he was “[l]ooking to purchase drugs.” He recalled that, as he sat in the Wendy’s parking lot, he made the call to arrange to meet someone there to buy $100 worth of cocaine. Mr. McGough testified that, after getting into defendant’s vehicle, he purchased an “eight ball of cocaine” from defendant for approximately $100. 2', 'The defendant was charged with unlawful delivery of a controlled substance (cocaine) in violation of G.L. 1956 § 21-28-4.01(a)(4)(i). On the morning that his trial was to begin, the state notified defendant that it intended to question one of the detectives about the contents of defendant’s wallet at the time of arrest.', 'The state averred that it had only received the information “[fifteen] minutes ago,” and that it consisted of the inventory of items in defendant’s possession upon arrest—a wallet and $185 cash.', 'The money was neither seized nor photographed, because department policy was to not seize any amount below $300.', 'The defendant made a motion in limine to exclude this evidence, arguing that it was a violation of Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and that it constituted an unfair surprise. 3 The trial justice ruled that the state’s late disclosure was not a violation of Rule 16. 1', 'Mr. McGough later pled nolo contendere to one count of possession of cocaine and two counts of simple assault, for which he received eighteen months of probation and 100 hours of community service. One count of resisting arrest was dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 2', 'According to Det. Poplaski, an eight ball of cocaine is 3.5 grams and can be worth anywhere between $100 and $150. 3', 'This Court has stated that Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the state to turn over “prior recorded statements, a summary of their expected trial testimony, and any records of the[] prior convictions” of any witnesses the state intends to call at trial.

There was testimony that defendant had cash on him at the time of the arrest and that it was not seized because it was less than $300, but no amount was named.

Grant, 946 A.2d 818, 828 (R.I. 2008). The trial justice accepted the state’s representation that the late disclosure was not intentional, and he next considered whether defendant was prejudiced by the information. In response to the trial justice’s questioning, defense counsel stated that “possibly it would have changed the structure of the entire case, whether or not it would have gone to trial * * * .” The defendant’s counsel asserted that it was her understanding that there “was no money here” because it was not included in the seizure 4', 'During his testimony, Det. Potter offered this explanation of a “traps bag”: “It’s property -- when you’re arrested, any property that you have on you can’t go into the cell with you, so it’s placed in a bag, sealed and labeled * * * just to identify what you have * * *.”', '-5- report. Counsel conceded that she was aware of McGough’s statement that he had paid money to defendant.', 'The trial justice found that there was no violation, stating:', '“From a legal point of view, I don’t believe there’s a legal', 'basis upon which I am required to suppress the evidence. Since', 'there was no specific indication that there was no money found,', 'and the defendant, through counsel, had notice of what the', 'codefendant alleged that he, in fact, paid money, I can’t find as a', 'matter of law it’s a Rule 16 violation.” Despite finding no violation, the trial justice then allowed a short recess, during which the parties spoke and came to an agreement that the state would not ask how much money was in defendant’s possession and that testimony regarding the cash would be limited to the fact that there was money and it was less than $300.', 'We have stated that “the trial justice is in the best position to evaluate whether any prejudice has resulted from noncompliance with discovery motions.” Grant, 946 A.2d at 828 (quoting State v. Evans, 668 A.2d 1256, 1259 (R.I. 1996)). Here, after the trial justice granted a brief recess, the parties reached an agreement. Detective Potter then testified that defendant had cash, but that it was not seized, and that it was less than $300. Further, Det. Potter testified that “we never seize less than $300.” The jury, therefore, could not know whether defendant’s wallet contained one dollar or some other amount up to $299.', 'Given our deferential standard of review, we find no clear error on the part of the trial justice. The fact that the defendant had some amount of cash on his person at the time of arrest is not unfairly prejudicial; and, indeed, jurors may likely suppose that most people have some amount of cash in their wallets at any given time.

After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 24, 1994, defendant was charged by criminal information (P2/94-3350A) with felony assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (Count One) and 1', 'The motion at issue in this case was actually entitled “Motion to Expunge/Seal Record.” For the sake of brevity, we shall hereinafter refer to it simply as a “motion to seal.”', '-1- willful or malicious injury to property in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-44-1 (Count Two).

The defendant confines herself on appeal to the hearing justice’s denial, in reliance upon G.L. 1956 § 12-1-12.1(a), of her motion with respect to Count One; she does not appeal the denial of her motion as it related to Count Two.', 'When explaining her rationale for denying defendant’s motion to seal as it related to Count One, the hearing justice stated:', '“The defendant * * * was seeking * * * to have the charges', 'that were dismissed in * * * 1995 sealed, because they were', 'dismissed pursuant to [Rule] 48(a) or [Rule] 48(b) by the Court.', '* * * The State objected to that, indicating under the statute, Rhode', 'Island General Laws 12-1-3.1,[4] the defendant is not entitled to 2', 'Count One was dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 3', 'In 1992, defendant was charged with reckless driving and obstructing a police officer in P3/92-3798A.

The defendant does not appeal that denial. Consequently, this Court will focus only on the 1994 charges. 4', 'As is reflected in the block quote in the text, supra, the transcript contains a reference to “Rhode Island General Laws 12-1-3.1.” That reference is inaccurate since there is no § 12-1-3.1 in the General Laws.

Specifically, defendant argues that § 12-1-12(a) and § 12-1-12.1(a) are in conflict because, in her view, § 12-1-12(a) mandates the sealing of all court records relating to a charge on which an individual has been exonerated, whereas § 12-1-12.1(a) allows for a motion to seal court records only when an individual has been “acquitted or otherwise exonerated of all counts in a criminal case.” (Emphasis added.)', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews questions of statutory construction in a de novo manner.

The defendant posits that the conflict exists because § 12-1-12(a) provides for the sealing of all court records by the clerk of the court within sixty days after exoneration, provided the person has not previously been convicted of a felony and, therefore, the sealing of her court record pertaining to Count One, 6', 'Sections 12-1-12(a) and 12-1-12.1(a) were amended by the General Assembly effective July 15, 2013 by P.L. 2013, ch. 301, § 1.

However, § 12-1-12.1(a) provides for the sealing of all court records only when a person is exonerated of “all counts in a criminal case.” According to defendant’s reading of the statutes, § 12-1-12(a) requires the sealing of court records that § 12-1-12.1(a) does not allow to be sealed. The defendant avers that, because of the alleged conflict, this Court should not rely merely on the plain language of the statute.', 'The state counters, contending that the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) clearly requires exoneration of all counts in a criminal case in order for the individual to be eligible to have his or her record sealed. Moreover, the state argues, § 12-1-12(a) deals with the destruction of physical identification records whereas § 12-1-12.1(a) deals with court records. The state also points out that the only time that court records are mentioned in § 12-1-12(a), a specific reference to the sealing requirements of § 12-1-12.1(a) is made. Consequently, the state contends: (1) that there is no conflict between the two statutory provisions; and (2) that this Court should affirm the trial justice’s decision because it is based on the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a).', 'Pursuant to our canons of statutory construction, we first address whether or not the statute in question has a plain meaning and is, as such, unambiguous. See DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 617; State v. DiCicco, 707 A.2d 251, 253 (R.I. 1998). If we find the statute to be unambiguous, we simply apply the plain meaning and our interpretive task is done. See, e.g., State v. Graff, 17 A.3d 1005, 1010 (R.I. 2011) (“[W]e have indicated that a clear and unambiguous statute will be literally construed.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); State v.

We end the process of statutory construction upon concluding that a statute has a plain meaning because “our ultimate goal is to give effect to the General Assembly’s intent,” and we have', '-6- repeatedly observed that the plain language of a statute is the “best indicator of [legislative] intent.” Olamuyiwa v. Zebra Atlantek, Inc., 45 A.3d 527, 534 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Martone v. Johnston School Committee, 824 A.2d 426, 431 (R.I. 2003) (“[O]ur ultimate goal is to give effect to the General Assembly’s intent * * * [and] [t]he best evidence of such intent can be found in the plain language used in the statute.”); Fleet National Bank v. Clark, 714 A.2d 1172, 1177 (R.I. 1998) (“If the language is clear on its face, then the plain meaning of the statute must be given effect and the Court should not look elsewhere to discern the legislative intent.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Little v. Conflict of Interest Commission, 121 R.I. 232, 237, 397 A.2d 884, 887 (1979) (“It is a primary canon of statutory construction that statutory intent is to be found in the words of a statute, if they are free from ambiguity and express a reasonable meaning.”).', 'We begin by scrutinizing § 12-1-12.1(a), an enactment that relates to judicial records. That statute expressly requires a dismissal of all counts in a criminal case for an individual to be eligible to have his or her record of a dismissed charge sealed: “Any person who is acquitted or otherwise exonerated of all counts in a criminal case * * * may file a motion for the sealing of his or her court records in the case * * * .” (Emphasis added.) We detect no ambiguity in the General Assembly’s use of the words “all counts.” The General Assembly certainly “has not sounded an uncertain trumpet” since the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) clearly requires that an individual be exonerated of all counts in a criminal case in order to have the record in that case sealed. State v. Calise, 478 A.2d 198, 201 (R.I. 1984) (“In the case at bar the Legislature has not sounded an uncertain trumpet.”). Any other interpretation would require this Court to ignore the statute’s pellucid “all counts” language and, in essence, rewrite the statute—thereby flying in the face of the fundamental principle that a court should not rewrite a statute enacted by the General', '-7- Assembly. See Calise, 478 A.2d at 201 (stating that the Court has “neither the authority nor the competence to rewrite” a statutory definition); see also Dodd v. United States, 545 U.S. 353, 359 (2005) (stating that a court is simply “not free to rewrite [a] statute that Congress has enacted”). Moreover, we have repeatedly held that a Court may not “broaden statutory provisions by judicial interpretation unless such interpretation is necessary and appropriate in carrying out the clear intent or defining the terms of the statute.” State v. Santos, 870 A.2d 1029, 1032 (R.I. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Rivera v. Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 70 A.3d 905, 910 (R.I. 2013) (“[W]e have noted that [w]here there is no ambiguity, we are not privileged to legislate, by inclusion, words which are not found in the statute.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Iselin v. Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 943 A.2d 1045, 1049 (R.I. 2008) (“[O]ur assigned task is simply to interpret the act, not to redraft it * * * .”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that the hearing justice appropriately applied the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) in denying defendant’s motion to seal, as she was required to do. See State v. Manocchio, 743 A.2d 555, 558 (R.I. 2000) (stating that the Superior Court does not possess an “inherent power to disregard the specific criteria and limitations on the expungement and sealing of * * * records that are set forth in the statute”); see generally Green v. Biddle, 21 U.S. (8 Wheat.) 1, 89-90 (1823) (“[W]here the words of a law * * * have a plain and obvious meaning, all construction, in hostility with such meaning, is excluded.”); see also Graff, 17 A.3d at 1010- 12 (finding error in a trial justice’s overly expansive interpretation of a statute). When we apply the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a), we reach precisely the same conclusion as did the hearing justice: pursuant to that statute, defendant was not entitled to have her record pertaining to Count', '-8- One sealed because she opted to plead nolo contendere to Count Two, and, consequently, she was not exonerated of “all counts[.]”', 'The defendant contends that, in spite of the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a), we must go beyond the plain meaning in our analysis because the just cited statute, in defendant’s view, is in conflict with § 12-1-12(a). Upon review of both statutes, however, we are unable to perceive the presence of any conflict. The pertinent language of § 12-1-12(a), which defendant submits is in conflict with § 12-1-12.1(a), reads as follows: “[W]ithin sixty (60) days after there has been an acquittal, dismissal, no true bill, no information, or the person has been otherwise exonerated from the offense with which he or she is charged, the clerk of court where the exoneration has taken place shall, consistent with § 12-1-12.1, place under seal all records of the person in the case including all records of the division of criminal identification established by § 12-1-4 * * * .” (Emphasis added.) Even if we assume arguendo that defendant’s contention is correct and that § 12-1-12(a) is mandatory, there is no conflict created in view of the clear reference in § 12-1-12(a) to § 12-1-12.1. It is a basic canon of statutory construction that “the Legislature is presumed to have intended each word or provision of a statute to express a significant meaning, and the court will give effect to every word, clause, or sentence, whenever possible.” State v. Bryant, 670 A.2d 777, 779 (R.I. 1996); see also State v. Reis, 430 A.2d 749, 752 (R.I. 1981). The General Assembly specifically and unambiguously required that the sealing of records under § 12-1-12(a) be consistent with § 12-1-12.1. Accordingly, we conclude that there is no conflict between § 12-1-12(a) and § 12-1-12.1(a) because § 12-1-12(a) requires the sealing of court records only when doing so would be permissible under § 12-1-12.1(a). As a result, we hold that the hearing justice did not err by hewing to the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) when passing upon defendant’s motion to seal.', '-9-', 'B', 'The Defendant’s Further Arguments', 'The defendant has set forth some further arguments to support her contention that the hearing justice’s order was in error.', 'We address these arguments briefly.', 'The defendant contends that § 12-1-7 is also in conflict with § 12-1-12.1(a) because § 12-1-7 requires that the Attorney General maintain only a record of information of “all persons who shall be or shall have been convicted of [a] felony, or imprisoned for violating any of the military, naval, or criminal laws of the United States or of any state, and of all well-known and habitual criminals from wherever procurable.” According to defendant, the duty of the Attorney General pursuant to § 12-1-7 does not include the maintenance of records of those individuals who have been convicted of a misdemeanor or had charges against them dismissed. The defendant posits that § 12-1-7 is in conflict with § 12-1-12.1(a) because § 12-1-12.1(a) prohibits the sealing of records that § 12-1-7 does not require the Attorney General to maintain. However, we perceive no conflict between the fact that the Attorney General is required by statute to maintain only records of felony convictions and the fact that the courts are prohibited from sealing a dismissed felony charge when there was a plea of nolo contendere to an accompanying misdemeanor charge, as occurred in the instant case. Each of the two statutory provisions clearly applies to an entirely different governmental body, and consequently the statutes are not even arguably in conflict. See Olamuyiwa, 45 A.3d at 534 (stating that, when a statute is clear and unambiguous the Court gives the words in the statute their plain and ordinary meaning).', 'Moreover, defendant’s contention that these two statutes are in conflict, even if it were meritorious, does not change the conclusion that this Court has made—viz., that the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) requires', '- 10 - exoneration on all counts in a criminal case before an individual is eligible to have his or her record sealed.', 'Finally, defendant further argues that the General Assembly “did not intend for those individuals with a companion misdemeanor charge to be prohibited from destruction of all other ‘felony’ charges that they were exonerated of * * * .” The defendant, citing the difficulties that an individual encounters when there is a record of his or her arrest, contends that there is no legitimate law enforcement purpose in maintaining the record of charges on which she has been exonerated. Once again, while we do not minimize the challenges that a record of arrest can pose, defendant’s contentions are unavailing due to the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a)—and a statute’s plain language is “the best indicator of legislative intent.” Graff, 17 A.3d at 1010; see also Santos, 870 A.2d at 1032. We are not the branch of Rhode Island government responsible for policy-making; accordingly, any remedy to such hardship as may result from the application of the plain language of § 12-1-12.1(a) would fall within the competence of the General Assembly.

She stated that she was sleeping in her bed, lying on her stomach, and awoke to the touch of defendant’s “rough” hands on her breast and vagina “over and under [her] pajamas.” She further stated that, when she opened her eyes, defendant was “on top of [her] with his hands underneath [her] from behind.” Then, Jessica stated, defendant penetrated her anally.', 'During the fifth incident (Counts Twelve, Thirteen & Fourteen) concerning which Jessica testified, she was sleeping in her bed, on her back, and awoke to the touch of defendant’s hands on her breast and vagina “over and under [her] pajamas.” Then, she stated, defendant “insert[ed] his penis inside my vagina.”', 'Jessica testified that she did not tell anyone about the incidents when they occurred because “[defendant] was still in the house” and “[she] didn’t feel safe.” On cross-examination, Jessica testified that defendant did not threaten her and never said anything to her during the incidents that she had described. She had testified on direct examination, however, that “[w]hen [she] would see [defendant] around the house,” “[h]e would give like little side smiles here and there.”', 'In her testimony, Jessica estimated that each incident lasted “[a]bout 20 to 30 minutes.” She stated that each of the incidents occurred while her sisters, Adriana and Daria, were sleeping in the same room. She further stated that she did not “call[] out” to Adriana or to her mother and never told defendant to “stop” or “get away.” When Jessica was asked by defense counsel whether she had any type of discharge or blood after the second or third incident, she replied “[n]ot that I know of.”', '-4-', 'Jessica acknowledged in her testimony that six to seven years had passed between defendant’s assaults and her reporting about them. During this time, she stated, her mother and defendant “had an okay relationship” but “[t]hey had their ups and downs.” She further stated that, although her mother and defendant “broke up and [defendant] left the house for good” in 2007, her mother and defendant continued to see each other. Jessica testified that only when she knew defendant “was gone for good,” after her mother filed for divorce, did she feel “safe enough to talk about it.”', 'Jessica testified that, after she revealed to her mother (at the office of the principal of her school) that defendant had “raped” her, she refused to describe the assaults in any detail to her. Jessica stated that she did not want to tell her mother about the details because she “was scared and because [her mother] has kids with [defendant]” and “[b]ecause [she] knew it would hurt her [mother] more.”', '2.', 'The Testimony of the Mother of the Complaining Witness', 'Jessica’s mother, Yvonne, testified that she had known defendant since 1994, when she was twenty-four years old; she added that she married him in 1999. Yvonne further testified that, at the time of the assaults, she lived with defendant in an apartment on Charles Street in Providence along with her daughters—Adriana, Jessica, and Daria. Yvonne stated that, since Daria was one month old, she “would * * * spend the night in [Adriana]’s bed a lot of the time.”', 'Yvonne testified that her daughter Adriana told her one morning that “she awoke in the middle of the night and saw [defendant] * * * in their bedroom * * * looking out the window.” Yvonne further testified that, when she asked defendant to explain what he had done in the girls’ room, “[h]e said he had heard something [and he] wanted to make sure the windows were locked.” Yvonne stated that she found defendant’s behavior “odd” and that it “kind of upset', '-5- [her] a little.” It was Yvonne’s testimony that, after that incident, she installed a lock on Adriana and Jessica’s door; she described the lock as being “one of those that you buy at any hardware store and screw it into the wall.” She stated that she wanted to put a lock on their door so that “they can lock their door and feel safe at night.” Yvonne further stated that she asked her daughters to lock their bedroom door at night.', 'It was Yvonne’s testimony that defendant “didn’t understand why there was a lock on the door” and “would say things like what if there was a fire, or what if something happens, how are we going to get to them.” Yvonne testified that, a week or two after she installed the lock, defendant “pushed the door in and broke the lock.” She summarized as follows defendant’s explanation as to why he broke the lock:', '“[He] stated that he heard some noise in their room. He thought', 'somebody was in their bedroom, and I had my ear to the door. I', 'didn’t hear anything. He kept insisting somebody was there. He', 'got mad and pushed the door, forced the door open, kind of broke', 'the piece of the wood so we couldn’t put the lock back on.” Yvonne stated that, when defendant came through the door, no one other than Adriana and Jessica was in the room; she added that they were in bed and that they “jumped up, scared.” It was further her testimony that there was never another adult male in the house overnight and that, during the time period in which the assaults occurred, Jessica “seemed nervous all the time.”', 'On cross-examination, Yvonne testified that the first time she heard that defendant was assaulting Jessica was in 2009, when Jessica told her at her school that defendant had “raped [her].” Yvonne added that Jessica never disclosed any further details of what happened to her and that, even at the time of trial, she still had “no idea of what actually happened other than that [Jessica] told [her] that she was raped by [defendant].” It was her testimony that she “explained', '-6- to [Jessica] what rape was” and Jessica confirmed that she had been raped, stating, “‘Yes, he raped me.’” Yvonne reiterated that her daughter had never spoken to her about any details.', 'On redirect examination, the prosecutor and Yvonne engaged in the following exchange:', '“[Prosecutor]: You have been asked a number of different', 'questions a number of different ways about the fact that your', 'daughter has not explained to you what she meant by rape; is that', 'right?', '“[Yvonne]: Yes.', '“[Prosecutor]: She has never told her mother that someone put his', 'penis in her anus; is that right?', '“[Yvonne]: No.', '“[Prosecutor]: She has never told you that someone put his penis', 'in her vagina; is that right?” At that point, defense counsel objected, but Yvonne proceeded to answer in the negative. A sidebar conference, out of the hearing of the jury, then took place; defense counsel addressed the trial justice as follows: “[T]he witness is totally broken down on the stand. She is crying uncontrollably. It’s through no question that I asked her. It’s through the prosecutor’s redirect.” Defense counsel asked the trial justice to pass the case (i.e., declare a mistrial), arguing that the prosecutor “went after” Yvonne “as a total adverse witness against the rules of redirect;” he added that “[t]o have her breakdown [sic] to the point where the jury can feel nothing but sympathy, I think it’s prejudicial to my client.” The trial justice characterized the prosecutor’s questioning as a “very grave error,” “totally inappropriate,” and “totally improper.” He further chastised the prosecutor at sidebar as follows:', '“Why in the world did you take it upon yourself to tell her', 'what her own daughter has never told her after all of these years', 'when the witness’s answers have been consistent on both direct', 'and cross examination that the daughter never told her?', '-7-', '“***', '“This case rises and falls on the witness’s statement,', '[Jessica’s] statement, not what her mother didn’t know that, you,', 'with great vehemen[ce] told her that she didn’t know, and I think it', 'was very inappropriate that you took it upon yourself to tell her', 'what she didn’t know when it wasn’t necessary. It wasn’t', 'necessary to prove your case and put this woman through the', 'distress that she is now going through.” Despite his criticism at sidebar of the challenged questions by the prosecutor, the trial justice nonetheless decided not to pass the case; and he denied defense counsel’s motion to that effect. Instead, the trial justice provided a curative instruction to the jury as follows:', '“Ladies and gentlemen, that line of questioning engaged in', 'by the prosecutor I consider to be inappropriate to this witness.', 'First of all, the witness answered consistently in both direct, cross', 'and redirect that she was never told by her daughter what the actual', 'alleged acts of misconduct were.', '“I think it’s unfortunate that the prosecution chose to reveal', 'these facts to this woman at this time. It really doesn’t add', 'anything to this case other than to the discomfort of this woman.', '“Now, one of the dangers of her reaction to this is the', 'aspect of sympathy which may be visited upon you by her sudden', 'surprise and reaction to this news. It has nothing to do with the', 'quantum of proof. The case rises or falls so far as I can see in this', 'case at this point on the testimony of the young complaining', 'witness, not on this mother or her reaction to the news of the', 'details allegedly experienced by her minor daughter. So I’m going', 'to instruct you not to have any sympathy for this woman because', 'of this revelation by the prosecution which apparently she has', 'never heard before.” The following exchange between the trial justice and Yvonne then took place:', '“[Trial Justice]: Is that correct, Miss, you had no idea the nature', 'of these acts?', '“[Yvonne]: No.', '“[Trial Justice]: Despite your repeated questions of her over time?', '“[Yvonne]: Yes.', '-8-', '“[Trial Justice]: You never heard [sic] a police report?', '“[Yvonne]: No.” The trial justice then further addressed the jury in the following words:', '“Okay. So her reaction has got nothing to do with this other', 'than her own unfortunate discovery of the nature of these', 'allegations. It doesn’t prove the allegations. Understand what I’m', 'saying? And I think that line of questioning was inappropriate. I’m', 'not going to do anything other than caution you not to allow this to', 'enter into your deliberations with regard to overt sympathy. You', 'may take this witness’s testimony and weigh it and sift as you', 'would anyone else, but you would give no great weight or allow', 'your deliberations to be swayed by the emotion that she has shown', 'by this apparent and recent discovery.”', 'At that point the questioning of Yvonne ceased, and Jessica’s sister Adriana was called to the stand.', '3.', 'The Testimony of the Complaining Witness’s Sister', 'Adriana, Jessica’s older sister, was next called by the prosecution; she stated that she remembered defendant being in the bedroom which she shared with Jessica at the apartment on Charles Street during the night on two occasions. It was her testimony that, on one of those occasions (which she stated that she told her mother about), defendant was “looking out the window, the bedroom window.” It was further her testimony that, on the other occasion, she “woke up” and saw defendant “getting out up from [Jessica’s] bed;” she added that she pretended to be asleep and that defendant walked over, “sat on the end of [her] bed and then he left the room.” Adriana testified that she did not tell her mother about the second incident.', '-9-', 'B', 'The Jury Instructions, the Deliberations and the Verdict', 'After Adriana’s testimony, the prosecution rested, and defendant (after unsuccessfully moving for a judgment of acquittal) likewise rested without calling any witnesses. In the course of giving his final instructions to the jury, the trial justice stated:', '“With regard to the sympathy factor, let me reiterate my', 'comments about any undue sympathy which may have been', 'invoked in you by the emotional response of [Yvonne] on the stand', 'the other day. Sympathy, compassion, hatred, bias, any of the', 'human emotions that we all have and that we all experience have', 'no place in your deliberations.” After a day of deliberating the jury sent a note to the trial justice stating that it had reached a consensus on “12 of the 14 counts but [was] struggling to come up to a consensus on the other two.”', 'After receiving that note from the jury, the trial justice repeated his instructions concerning the issues to which the jury had pointed. That same day, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on two counts of second-degree sexual assault, both of which arose from the first incident about which Jessica testified. Specifically, defendant was found guilty on Count One and Count Two which alleged “Hand to Vagina” and “Hand to Breast” respectively. The jury returned a not guilty verdict on the remaining twelve counts. In due course, the trial justice sentenced defendant on each of the two counts to twenty-five years imprisonment, with eight years to serve and seventeen years suspended, with probation.', 'C', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant moved for a new trial, which motion was heard on December 2, 2011. The defendant argued that the jury’s verdict was “inconsistent” with the evidence presented at trial. It was his contention that there was “really * * * nothing different between” Jessica’s', '- 10 - testimony about the first incident of alleged sexual molestation and her testimony about the other incidents. Accordingly, defendant argued that, if the jury found Jessica to be a credible witness, it should have found him guilty on “all counts” and if it did not find her to be a credible witness it should have “acquitted him” on all counts. The defendant also pointed out that the first incident had the least evidentiary support since Jessica testified that she had “her eyes closed” and knew defendant only by his “rough hands.” The defendant characterized Jessica’s testimony as “robotic;” he added that her description of what had occurred was “done basically without any type of emotion[,] * * * almost in a script * * * .”', 'The trial justice denied defendant’s motion.', 'He found Jessica’s testimony to be “unemotional” but nevertheless “credible.” With respect to Yvonne, the trial justice stated that he found her to be “extremely credible particularly after she was made aware” of the specific allegations against defendant. The trial justice expressed his “surprise” that the jury convicted on only two of fourteen counts, and he found the verdict to be inconsistent. However, he declined to “disturb the finding of guilty on the first two counts.” The trial justice stated that the jury “understood the charge, and took their time.” He further stated that there could have been “some compromise” among the jurors or that the jury may not have believed that a “child of tender years” could have experienced the type of penetration Jessica described without “cry[ing] out.” The trial justice stated that a “reasonable inference[]” could be drawn from Jessica’s testimony that the perpetrator of the first incident of sexual assault (Counts One & Two) was defendant because he was the only adult male in the household.', '- 11 -', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, defendant contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in failing to grant his motion to pass the case subsequent to the prosecutor’s questioning on redirect examination of Yvonne with respect to the details of the assaults that defendant allegedly committed against Jessica (which questioning the trial justice characterized as “totally improper”); and (2) that, in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence and inappropriately relied on Yvonne’s emotional response to the prosecutor’s questioning on redirect examination, which he had instructed the jury not to consider.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The Motion to Pass the Case', '1. Standard of Review', 'It has been our consistent practice to review the decision of a trial justice on a motion to pass2 a case for abuse of discretion. State v.

Hernandez, 641 A.2d 62, 69 (R.I. 1994) (“The decision to declare a mistrial is within the sound discretion of a trial justice.”); see also State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 234 (R.I. 2008); State v. Figueroa, 673 A.2d 1084, 1091 (R.I. 1996).

For that reason, the decision of a trial justice to deny a party’s motion to pass the case “will be given great weight, and we will not disturb that determination unless it is clearly wrong.” Figueroa, 673 A.2d at 1091; see also Clements, 83 A.3d at 565. When a cautionary instruction has been given, “[a] mistrial will be ordered at the appellate level only if we are convinced that the cautionary instructions were untimely or ineffective, or if the improper material had been so indelibly etched in the jurors’ minds that, despite [the trial justice’s] timely action, the trial justice did not disabuse the jurors’ minds of the prejudicial effect.” State v.

Discussion', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in not passing the case after the prosecutor’s improper questioning which led to Yvonne’s “[e]motional [b]reakdown.”4 The defendant argues that both Jessica and her mother were “explicit” about Jessica’s never having told her mother any details of the sexual assaults and yet, despite that state of the record, the prosecutor “ambushed [Yvonne] with the presentation of explicit details about [Jessica’s] claims.” The defendant posits that “the state’s callous questions were designed for theatrical effect and to cause the predictable and public emotional breakdown of [Yvonne];” defendant 3', 'We note that, in our decision in State v. Hoyle, 122 R.I. 45, 48, 404 A.2d 69, 71 (1979), we remarked that the same “principles control,” regardless of whether or not “the conduct complained of is a display of emotion or other objectionable conduct rather than an improper remark.” 4', 'Many of the filings referenced in this Court’s discussion have headings which employ bold-face type. We have conformed those headings to our usual style throughout this opinion.', '- 13 - adds that those questions “served no legitimate testimonial purpose.” The defendant avers that “the prejudice inuring from the prosecutor’s improper questioning was demonstrably incurable.” Moreover, according to defendant, the “most telling evidence” of the “prejudicial effect” of the prosecutor’s questioning “and of the ineffectiveness of the trial justice’s cautionary instruction” was that the trial justice himself referenced Yvonne’s breakdown as evidence of her credibility when ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial. Accordingly, it is defendant’s contention that the trial justice recognized that the questioning was improper and prejudicial and therefore, that, he abused his discretion in not granting defendant’s motion to pass the case.', 'In response, the state, “for its part, stands by the argument that the defendant opened the door to the prosecutor’s line of inquiry when, on cross-examination, counsel pressed [Yvonne] about her daughter’s failure to inform her mother of [defendant’s] conduct in explicit sordid detail * * * .” The state adds that it “respectfully disagrees with the trial justice’s determination that this line of questioning by the prosecutor was improper.” According to the state, the defendant cannot “justifiably complain that the prosecutor questioned [Yvonne] on re-direct examination concerning the very same information his counsel pressed that witness about on cross-examination.” (Emphasis in original.) The state avers that defendant “made an issue out of [Jessica’s] reluctance to disclose to [Yvonne] the specific details of [defendant’s] conduct” and, consequently, “when [defendant] claimed that [Jessica’s] silence on the matter of the sexual abuse was evidence of fabrication, it became the State’s job to provide the jury with an explanation for her hesitancy to confide such sordid information to her mother.” The state further contends that any prejudice which may have resulted from the questioning at issue was cured by the trial justice’s curative instruction to the jury.', '- 14 -', 'A trial justice, in considering a motion to pass a case, “must determine whether the evidence would cause the jurors to be so inflamed as to make them unable to decide the case on the basis of the evidence presented.” State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1127 (R.I. 2005). “If the prejudice is inexpiable, the motion to pass should be granted. If the prejudice can be cured, the instructions which follow must be timely and effective.” Hoyle, 122 R.I. at 48, 404 A.2d at 70; see also Disla, 874 A.2d at 198. However, there is no “precise formula” to determine whether any prejudicial taint may have been cured by a cautionary instruction. Oliveira, 882 A.2d at 1127; see also Hoyle, 122 R.I. at 48, 404 A.2d at 70. Therefore, “[e]ach case must be decided on an ad hoc basis and each challenged remark must be viewed in the context in which it appeared and in light of the attendant circumstances.” Hoyle, 122 R.I. at 48, 404 A.2d at 70-71. Since the trial justice decided to “utilize a cautionary instruction” in the instant case, “the question before us is whether [the trial justice’s] instruction can be fairly said to have removed from [the jurors’ minds], when weighing the evidence properly before them, the taint represented” by Yvonne’s emotional response to the prosecutor’s questions on redirect examination, which questions provided her, for the first time, with the specific details of the assaults to which her daughter was subjected. State v. Brown, 528 A.2d 1098, 1103 (R.I. 1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'We need not, and consequently we do not, make any judgment on the propriety of the prosecutor’s questions to Yvonne; if we assume arguendo that those comments were inappropriate, it is nonetheless our conclusion that any prejudice which may have resulted was effectively and efficiently cured by the trial justice’s instruction to the jury.', 'Without any evidence “that the jury was not capable of complying with the trial justice[’s] cautionary instruction, this [C]ourt must assume that the jury did disregard the witness [reaction] as it was instructed to do.” Disla, 874 A.2d at 198 (internal quotation marks omitted);', '- 15 - see also Mendoza, 889 A.2d at 159.', 'Unquestionably, “the entire rationale underlying the structure of jury trials and the lyrical deference that is paid to jury findings rests upon the proposition that jurors will obey the admonitions of the trial justice and will apply the law as given to them by the justice presiding.” Disla, 874 A.2d at 198 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Mendoza, 889 A.2d at 159. In spite of defendant’s contention that any prejudice in the instant case was “demonstrably uncurable,” we can perceive nothing in the record that indicates that any taint which might have existed was not cured by the trial justice’s curative instruction; we likewise can perceive nothing in the record that indicates that the jury chose to disregard the trial justice’s curative instruction. See McManus, 941 A.2d at 234 (“[W]e cannot conclude that the jury would be so affected by the question that they would not be able to decide the case based on a dispassionate evaluation of the evidence.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'It is worth noting that the curative instruction given by the trial justice clearly and thoroughly explained to the jury that it was not to allow any sympathy which it might have for Yvonne to affect its determination as to her credibility or the credibility of the other witnesses. (We also note approvingly that the trial justice included a substantially similar instruction in his final charge to the jury.) He even reminded the jury that the case rose and fell “on the testimony of the young complaining witness.” The trial justice also gave the instruction in a timely manner, immediately after the questioning at issue. See Hoyle, 122 R.I. at 48, 404 A.2d at 71. Moreover, we note that, despite Yvonne’s emotional response to the questioning on redirect examination, the jury nonetheless found defendant not guilty on twelve out of the fourteen counts against him. Lastly, it is worth remarking that the information which formed the basis of', '- 16 - the prosecutor’s questions was simply cumulative to other testimony at trial, and thus it was not a situation where the jury was exposed to additional, prejudicial information.', 'In our judgment, after reviewing the record, considering the context in which Yvonne’s emotional response was elicited, and the trial justice’s curative instruction, there is no reason to believe that the jury in the instant case was not able to make an objective evaluation of the evidence against Mr. Hie. See Oliveira, 882 A.2d at 1127; Hoyle, 122 R.I. at 48, 404 A.2d at 70- 71.

In fulfilling his or her role as the thirteenth juror and passing on a motion for a new trial, “the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v.

First, he considered the evidence in light of the jury charge; the trial justice addressed with specificity the multiple incidents of sexual assault alleged by Jessica, and he noted that Adriana’s testimony “corroborated” Jessica’s testimony. He further considered Yvonne’s testimony with respect to the fact that she installed a lock on Jessica and Adriana’s bedroom, and he stated that “the inference was she was somewhat suspicious of defendant as the girls got older * * * .” In ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice considered the testimony of every witness who testified at trial. He also commented on the evidence in light of the jury charge on sexual assault. See Silva, 84 A.3d at 416.', 'Next, the trial justice properly weighed the evidence and addressed the credibility of the witnesses. See id. After explicitly recognizing that he had to conduct his own independent review of the evidence, the trial justice discussed Jessica’s testimony. He began by noting that she was “very unemotional” and “fairly monotone;” but he added that he did not find that', '- 20 - “totally unusual in cases like [the one before him].” He noted that, when Jessica testified regarding the assault for which defendant was convicted, she stated that she had her eyes closed but that she had felt “rough hands;” the trial justice added that a “reasonable inference” could be drawn from that testimony that defendant “perpetrated these crimes against her,” because “[h]e was the only adult in the building, living there” and Jessica “knew he was living there” and “had rough hands.” The trial justice concluded that Jessica was a “credible witness” and stated:', '“I thought that her testimony, while delivered in a monotone, flat', 'manner, was as a result of her embarrassment of having to live', 'through the motion, [sic] live through the emotion of telling the', 'story again that had happened so long ago, that she could look at it', 'perhaps from a distance now as a young woman and just relate', 'what she remembered from the facts.” The trial justice proceeded to find Adriana to be “credible” and Yvonne to be “extremely credible.” We note that the mere fact that defendant might disagree with the trial justice’s determination that each of the witnesses at trial was credible does not require the trial justice to grant defendant’s motion for a new trial. See id. at 418 (“This Court has repeatedly stated that [t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Gonzalez, 56 A.3d at 103.', 'With relation to the third step in his analysis, the trial justice remarked that he was “surprised” by the verdict. However, he stated that there potentially might have been “some compromise” among the jurors. The trial justice concluded as follows:', '“[T]he Court believes that based on the evidence, based on the', 'credibility of the witnesses here, and based on particularly the fact', 'that there were five discreet [sic] instances complained of that the', 'Court cannot, I don’t disagree with the verdict because I thought', 'the witnesses were credible as to all counts * * * .”', '- 21 - Thus, it is clear that, after properly assessing the evidence and weighing the credibility of the witnesses, the trial justice concluded that he could not “disagree with the [jury’s] verdict.” As such, his “analysis [was] complete,” and he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. Harrison, 66 A.3d at 445. We perceive no error in the trial justice’s progression through the three required steps or in his conclusion that he could not “disagree with the verdict.”', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice did not properly take into account the fact that, as defendant states, the verdicts were “inconsistent.” However, the trial justice clearly addressed defendant’s argument that the verdicts were inconsistent; he stated that they were in fact “inconsistent.” See State v. Staffier, 21 A.3d 287, 291 (R.I. 2011). But he went on to state that Jessica was a credible witness and that it is possible that the jury compromised in finding defendant guilty on two of the fourteen counts. See id. at 292 (“We also recognize that in cases in which juries reach inconsistent verdicts on different counts of the same information, the jury may reach compromises through a variety of motivations, including leniency.”). Consequently, we are satisfied that the trial justice properly took into account the fact that the verdicts in this case could be characterized as inconsistent.', 'Finally, defendant takes issue with the trial justice’s reference to Yvonne’s emotional response to the questions regarding the specifics of Jessica’s sexual assault.', 'In denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice stated: “I thought the mother was extremely credible particularly after she was made aware of what the nature of the allegations was which apparently heretofore [she] had not been aware of.”', 'While it is true that the trial justice instructed the jury not to let sympathy affect their assessment of Yvonne’s testimony, he did not instruct the jury to utterly disregard her reaction. He expressly stated:', '“I’m not going to do anything other than caution you not to allow', '[the line of questioning on redirect examination] to enter into your', '- 22 -', 'deliberations with regard to overt sympathy. You may take this', 'witness’s testimony and weigh it and sift as you would anyone', 'else * * * .” In our view, in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, it would have been preferable for the trial justice to pass over in silence Yvonne’s emotional breakdown on the witness stand; but there is nothing in the trial justice’s comments that would suggest that he was doing what he instructed the jury not to do—namely, letting sympathy affect his determination of Yvonne’s credibility. Therefore, we consider defendant’s contention that it was error for the trial justice to mention Yvonne’s emotional response in denying his motion for a new trial to be unavailing.', 'Accordingly, in our judgment, the trial justice did not misconceive or overlook material testimony and did not otherwise commit clear error in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.5 5', 'The defendant also raises a challenge to the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal, which he made at the close of the prosecution’s case and at the close of all the evidence. It should be recalled that we have stated as follows:', '“When faced with a defendant’s challenge to the rulings on both [a', 'motion for a judgment of acquittal and a motion for a new trial],', 'this Court first conducts a review of the new-trial', 'motion. * * * The motion for a new trial requires a more exacting', 'analysis, * * * therefore unless a defendant can show that the', 'presented evidence failed to support his or her conviction upon the', 'motion-for-a-new-trial standard, a defendant necessarily will be', 'unable to establish he or she was entitled to a judgment of', 'acquittal.” State v.

47,State : v. : Markus Matthews. :,reversal,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. On the night of May 6, 2009, three men savagely attacked and robbed Cesar Lopez (Lopez or complainant), who had unwittingly arrived at an abandoned house to deliver pizza. The attackers made off with about $20. Several days later, a chance encounter with one of the robbers led to his arrest, and that perpetrator implicated the defendant, Markus Matthews (defendant), in this brutal crime. The defendant was tried and convicted by a jury of a single count of first-degree robbery. He now appeals that conviction, assigning an array of errors to the trial court. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Cesar Lopez was employed by Domino’s Pizza (Domino’s) as a pizza delivery-person. On May 6, 2009, he drove to 54 Lynch Street in Providence to make a delivery. Upon arriving at that address, Lopez called the phone number associated with the order, and the voice on the other end told him to “go through the back door.” Although something about the situation appeared amiss, particularly because the house was dark, Lopez attempted to fulfill the delivery.', '-1-', 'As Lopez exited his vehicle, he was struck from behind with “a piece of tubing.”1 As a second attacker grabbed him, he heard someone say “bring him into the house.” While Lopez was being moved toward the house, there was one man in front, wearing a blue and white bandana over his nose, and another assailant behind him, with his arm around Lopez’s neck. When Lopez tried to turn around, the choke-hold tightened, almost to the point of strangulation. Lopez briefly was able to free himself, but was then struck on the leg with the pipe and dragged up the driveway toward the house.', 'As the attackers moved Lopez toward the house, the beating continued. According to Lopez, there were three assailants: one with the pipe and two men pummeling with their fists. Lopez testified that he was struck with the pipe on the head and left eye. Approximately $20 was taken from his pocket. As the attackers wrestled him toward the back door of the house, he was able to grab onto the handrail; the attackers repeatedly hit him in an effort to make him let go of the railing. At that point, Lopez fought back. The assailants grabbed his uniform shirt; he slipped out of it and escaped to his car. The assailants were left holding the shirt. After Lopez reached the street, the attackers retreated and, despite his injuries—one eye was completely closed—he was able to drive back to Domino’s. When he arrived, he sounded the horn, exited the car, and collapsed. Lopez’s co-workers helped him up and called 911. Lopez continues to have problems with his eyesight and suffers from headaches.', 'On May 10, 2009, Lopez visited Domino’s in order to return some items belonging to the store, including his uniform and pizza bag. While driving there with his wife, Lopez saw one of his attackers who was loitering on the street. According to Lopez, when the attacker saw him, he “started doing some suspicious things,” such as backing up so that Lopez could not see him. 1', 'It appears from the testimony that the “tubing” was a metal pipe.', '-2- After his wife called the police, they decided to circle the block; when the alleged attacker saw the car again, he went into a driveway and came out onto another street. Lopez directed his wife to drive to another street, where he expected the attacker to appear. Upon seeing Lopez again, the assailant started running with Lopez in pursuit.', 'After a foot chase, Lopez caught the attacker—Michael Long—and held him until the police arrived.', 'The police arrested Long for the May 6, 2009 robbery and proceeded to interview him. Long initially denied any involvement in the crime, but eventually confessed, and in so doing, he implicated defendant.2 Based on statements made by Long, defendant was apprehended. Long later pled nolo contendere to charges of robbery and conspiracy to rob.', 'At trial in this case, the complainant testified about the attack, noting that he could not recall the exact time that he left to deliver the pizza, but that it was after 10 p.m.3 He also testified about the circumstances that led to Long’s arrest. The state also called Long to testify; however, he professed to have no memory of the events, notwithstanding his confession and subsequent plea. Jeannine Labossiere, Michael Long’s former fiancée and the mother of his child, also testified at trial, and her memory was intact. She testified that, at about 10:30 p.m. on May 6, 2009, Long borrowed her cell phone and left her apartment. Labossiere testified that he was gone until about 1 a.m. when he returned to her house, accompanied by defendant. She testified that after some prodding, Long disclosed the beating and robbery of a Domino’s delivery-person, as defendant stood silent. The defendant neither contested nor denied Long’s recital of the events of the evening. Labossiere also testified that her cell phone number matched 2', 'Long implicated defendant in both versions that he gave to police, including when he denied his own involvement. Long also implicated a third man referred to as “Knowledge” in his recorded statement. 3', 'The owner of the Domino’s Pizza testified that his establishment’s tracking system indicated that the call came in at 11:17 p.m.', '-3- the one used to call Domino’s on May 6, 2009. Because the testimony of both Long and Labossiere are central to the issues in this case, we elaborate upon their testimony in the discussion below.', 'The defendant testified in his own defense and denied any involvement in this crime. He claimed that he was not at 54 Lynch Street on the night of May 6, 2009, having left Labossiere’s house at about 9:30 p.m., arriving home a little after 10 p.m. The defendant’s mother also testified, corroborating her son’s alibi. The jury was unconvinced.', 'The trial justice instructed the jury that they were to consider three charges against defendant. The trial justice told the jury that defendant was charged with first-degree robbery, but that it was alleged to have been committed under two different theories: “The first theory is that [defendant did] rob Cesar Lopez by use of a dangerous weapon. The second, or alternative, theory is he did rob Cesar Lopez and Cesar Lopez was, in fact, injured.” Later, the trial justice told the jury,', '“There’s only one robbery being charged but two factual elements', 'that are different from each count. One is the dangerous weapon;', 'one is the injury. You make separate decisions for each one. But', 'they clearly are one count, one charge of the robbery. He’s not', 'being charged with two separate counts of robbery.” Additionally, defendant was charged with conspiracy to rob.', 'The jury returned verdicts of not guilty on first-degree robbery by means of a dangerous weapon and the conspiracy count. The defendant, however, was found guilty of first-degree robbery resulting in injury. The defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied by the trial justice, who subsequently sentenced defendant to twenty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with nine years to serve and the remaining eleven years suspended with probation.', '-4-', 'Analysis', 'I', 'Double Jeopardy', 'Count 1 of the indictment charged that defendant “on or about 6th day of May, 2009, in the City of Providence, in the County of Providence, did rob Ceasar Lopez by use of a dangerous weapon * * * .” Similarly, count 2 of the indictment charged that defendant “on or about 6th day of May, 2009, in the City of Providence, in the County of Providence, did rob Ceasar Lopez causing him to be injured * * * .” The defendant argues that his conviction for first-degree robbery must be vacated because “[c]harging one robbery as two crimes and permitting the jury to deliberate twice on one robbery violated double jeopardy principles.”', 'Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[t]he defense of double jeopardy * * * may be raised only by motion before trial.” (Emphasis added.) “[A] defendant’s failure to raise such a motion before trial precludes that defendant from thereafter raising a double jeopardy challenge.” State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007) (citing State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 647 (R.I. 2006)). In this case, defendant did not comply with the provisions of Rule 12(b)(2) and, therefore, has waived this argument.', 'Nonetheless, we deem it appropriate to address two important issues. First, were this issue properly before the Court, we would affirm defendant’s conviction because we are satisfied that defendant’s double jeopardy contentions are without merit. The principal evil against which the Double Jeopardy Clause protects—multiple criminal punishments for the same offense—is not implicated in this case because defendant stands convicted of (and punished for) a single offense. See Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 99 (1997) (“The [Double Jeopardy] Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense', '-5- * * * .”) (emphasis omitted); see also 1A Charles Alan Wright & Andrew D. Leipold, Federal Practice and Procedure: Criminal § 142 at 11-12 (4th ed. 2008) (“It remains permissible to charge a single offense in several counts (although not to convict and punish on more than one for a single crime) * * *.”). Additionally, this Court has noted that “it would be impermissible to charge a defendant with murder in the second degree and, subsequent to disposition of the charge, then charge him or her with first-degree murder,” but that “[t]rial of lesser-included offenses contemporaneously with the trial for the greater offense does not violate principles of double jeopardy.” State v. Grabowski, 644 A.2d 1282, 1286 (R.I. 1994). Although the two separate factual predicates for first-degree robbery here do not constitute a primary and a lesser- included offense, the same principle nonetheless applies because they are alternative theories of guilt. Furthermore, the trial justice’s instruction to the jury mollified the risk that the indictment would result in unconstitutional multiple punishment. The trial justice instructed the jury that the indictment alleged two different theories of robbery, and, later in the instruction, she stated that the two robbery charges “clearly are one count, one charge of robbery. He’s not being charged with two separate counts of robbery.”', 'The defendant argues that in accordance with our decision in State v. Bolarinho, 850 A.2d 907 (R.I. 2004), this Court must vacate defendant’s conviction. We agree that the issues presented in Bolarinho are similar, but we disagree that our holding compels the remedy sought by defendant. In Bolarinho, 850 A.2d at 908-09, the defendant was convicted of two offenses— felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury and felony assault by means of a dangerous weapon, a shod foot. It was clear, however, that both crimes arose from the same assault. Id. at 911. This error was remedied by our decision that vacated the conviction on count 1—assault resulting in serious bodily injury. Id. We did not vacate both convictions and order a new trial.', '-6- See id. Here, defendant contends that the Bolarinho remedy cannot be invoked because the jury found him not guilty on count 1; and that, therefore, the Court must vacate the conviction and order a new trial because defendant “cannot be both innocent and guilty of the same crime.” We reject this argument. In this case, defendant was found guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt, of the offense of first-degree robbery that resulted in injury. The jury was not satisfied that the state had proven robbery by means of a dangerous weapon. Simply because the jury rejected this theory of robbery, that fact does not impact the Double Jeopardy Clause. Because there was a single conviction in this case, there is no double jeopardy violation for us to remedy. See id. Additionally, we are not confronted with inconsistent verdicts. Because the prosecution had two theories of robbery, the jury could have concluded that both theories were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, or that defendant robbed Lopez causing bodily injury, but the state did not prove that defendant used a dangerous weapon in the process. Nevertheless, a conviction of a single count of first-degree robbery would result.', 'Second, we provide guidance to the trial court and its practitioners in order to avoid confusion when a single offense is charged under multiple theories. Initially, we note that a bill of particulars is designed to cure any potential problems with the indictment in the early stage of a prosecution; however, defendant did not file for a bill of particulars in this case. Contrast Pierce v. Wall, 941 A.2d 189, 194 (R.I. 2008) (“The record discloses that a bill of particulars was filed in this case that made clear that a single act was charged in each of the seven counts.”). Furthermore, although a permissible practice, charging defendant with two separate counts of first-degree robbery is not the ideal manner in which to draft an indictment. The preferable manner is to charge a single offense as one count, setting forth multiple theories that may be alleged. See Sanabria v. United States, 437 U.S. 54, 66 n.20 (1978) (“A single offense should', '-7- normally be charged in one count rather than several, even if different means of committing the offense are alleged.”).', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-12-1.4 provides in pertinent part, “An indictment, information, or complaint shall be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the offense charged.” Nothing in this section precludes the assertion of multiple theories in a single count. Additionally, Rule 7(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure permits such a procedure: “It may be alleged in a single count that the means by which the defendant committed the offense are unknown or that he [or she] committed it by one or more specified means.” (Emphasis added.) Although it may be constitutionally permissible to charge a single offense in several counts, we reiterate that “the rules are intended to discourage that practice.” Wright and Leipold, § 142 at 12 (discussing identical federal rule). As the Eighth Circuit recently stated:', '“[W]here a ‘statute specifies two or more ways in which one', 'offense may be committed, all may be alleged in the conjunctive in', 'one count of the indictment, and proof of any one of the methods', 'will sustain a conviction.’ * * * This method of procedure would', 'adequately inform the defendant of each allegation that he must', 'defend against while solving any potential multiplicity problems.”', 'United States v. Roy, 408 F.3d 484, 492 n.4 (8th Cir. 2005)', '(quoting Gerberding v. United States, 471 F.2d 55, 59 (8th Cir.', '1973) (emphasis added)). Ultimately, when confronted with a single offense in an indictment from which a jury could conclude that the offense was committed under one or more theories, it is the trial justice’s responsibility—through instructions to the jury and a carefully drafted verdict form—to ensure that a defendant stands convicted, if at all, of a single offense.', 'An indictment or criminal information that charges one offense having been committed by multiple means is a fair solution for both the state and the defendant. It lessens, or eliminates, any potential double jeopardy concerns, because it ensures that the accused is charged with a single offense, and thus, can only be convicted and sentenced on a single count. It also addresses', '-8- duplicity issues because the jury would have to state which theory or theories were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.4 Requiring a jury to deliberate on each factual predicate alleged in the charging document is also fair to the state because it permits the jury to find that the state proved multiple theories, but only one offense—a practice that permits a complete examination of the sufficiency of the evidence in the event that there is a motion for a new trial.', 'II', 'Admission of Michael Long’s Recorded Statement', 'The defendant wages a multi-pronged attack against the use at trial of Michael Long’s statement to police following his arrest. As noted, when he testified during the state’s case-in- chief, Long suffered from the ubiquitous failure of memory of a confessing codefendant. Long admitted that he participated in the robbery of a pizza delivery-person on May 6, 2009, and that he was serving a sentence at the Adult Correctional Institutions for that crime. However, he claimed to remember almost nothing else about that night or his arrest on May 10, 2009. The prosecutor attempted to refresh Long’s recollection by showing him the statement that he gave to police after he was arrested; this proved futile because Long repeatedly denied that his recollection was refreshed. Long not only professed a failure of memory about the statement, he refused to acknowledge his own voice on the tape recording. When confronted with defendant’s photograph—the one he identified when he was arrested—Long recognized defendant as the person in the photograph; however, he denied that it was his signature below the picture, despite acknowledging that the name looked like “Michael Long” and the date was “5/10/09.” When the 4', '“The term ‘duplicity’ refers to the joining of two or more offenses, however numerous, in a single count of an indictment.” State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1253 (R.I. 1998). The problem with duplicity is that “a guilty verdict on a duplicitous indictment does not indicate whether the jury found defendant guilty without having reached [a] unanimous verdict on the commission of a particular offense.” Id. (quoting United States v. Murray, 618 F.2d 892, 896 (2d Cir. 1980)).', '-9- prosecutor asked Long whether he remembered the interrogation at the Providence police station, Long responded, “I don’t know what happened five minutes ago.”', 'In the face of Long’s recalcitrance and refusal to acknowledge that his recollection was refreshed in any way, the prosecutor began asking specific leading questions about Long’s statement to police. At this point, defense counsel raised an objection to “the further continuance of [the prosecutor’s] line of questioning” and argued at sidebar that Long’s statements did not qualify as prior inconsistent statements. The trial justice, however, analogized this case to two prior opinions of this Court5 and stated, “I think that I am going to make a finding that at the appropriate time it’s a prior inconsistent statement.”6 The prosecutor continued asking specific leading questions after Long continued to claim that his recollection had not been refreshed. These questions included statements by Long that he punched the complainant and that defendant hit him with a lead pipe. Later, during the testimony of a Providence police detective, the recording of the interview was admitted as a full exhibit and played for the jury.7', 'The defendant raises issues under the Rules of Evidence, the Confrontation Clause, and the Due Process Clause. His primary argument is that Long’s statements were inadmissible hearsay and violative of the Confrontation Clause. Although defendant contends that “[t]he arguments against admissibility are the same under [Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence] and the Confrontation Clause,” such is not the case. See Crawford v. 5', 'We discuss these cases below; they are State v. McManus, 990 A.2d 1229 (R.I. 2010) and State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984 (R.I. 2004). 6', 'Although the trial justice stated this in the future tense, it appears that counsel took this as the trial justice’s definitive ruling. 7', 'When the state moved for admission, defense counsel objected and noted the previous sidebars. The court asked whether defense counsel wanted further argument, but defense counsel declined. The trial justice then stated, “Same ruling. May be marked.” Transcripts of the recording were provided as aids for the jury, but the transcripts were not admitted as full exhibits.', '- 10 - Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 61 (2004) (“Where testimonial statements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment’s protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much less to amorphous notions of ‘reliability.’”). Therefore, we will consider these arguments separately.', 'A', 'Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(A)', '“The applicable standard of review of a trial justice’s admission of evidence is a clear abuse of discretion.” State v. McManus, 990 A.2d 1229, 1234 (R.I. 2010). Rule 801(d)(1)(A) provides: “A statement is not hearsay if * * * [t]he declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement, and the statement is * * * inconsistent with the declarant’s testimony * * *.” The trial justice allowed examination based on Long’s prior statements and admitted the recording of his statement under this rule. We conclude that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in doing so.', 'We have addressed nearly identical situations in two previous opinions. In State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984, 986 (R.I. 2004), a key witness “suffered a convenient failure of memory, declaring over and over again, especially at critical points about details of [a] drive-by shooting, that he had difficulty remembering the events of [the evening of the shooting].” At trial, the state introduced portions of the witness’s police statement, and, on appeal, the defendant argued that the statement should not have been admitted under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 986, 987. This Court concluded that “the provisions of Rule 801(d)(1)(A) have been satisfied and that [the witness] was subject to cross-examination within the meaning of the rule.” Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 990. In McManus, 990 A.2d at 1232, a witness who had been approached by the defendant to engage in a murder for hire scheme “professed a total failure of memory about', '- 11 - everything concerning the incident, including his discussions with the state police.”', 'The prosecutor questioned the witness as an adverse witness and used leading questions over defense counsel’s continuing objection.', 'Id.', 'We held that the introduction of the witness’s police statement was proper under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). McManus, 990 A.2d at 1236. Permitting this kind of examination in the face of a witness’s convenient failure of memory is consistent with a prominent treatise on the law of evidence:', '“Where a witness no longer remembers an event, a prior statement', 'describing that event should not be considered inconsistent. Yet', 'the tendency of unwilling or untruthful witnesses to seek refuge in', 'a claim of forgetfulness is well recognized.

Here, Long similarly professed a lack of memory regarding almost all of the facts salient to the robbery and his subsequent arrest, including his own signature and the sound of his voice. Thus, it was permissible for the prosecutor to question him about the details of his statement to police in an attempt to refresh his recollection and for the trial justice to admit the recording. It was for the jury to determine whether Long’s refusal to admit his recollection was refreshed was in fact a denial of the prior statement and therefore, a prior inconsistent statement of a testifying witness. Accordingly, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion by admitting the statements under Rule 801(d)(1)(A).', 'B', 'Confrontation Clause', 'This Court reviews issues of constitutional dimension on a de novo basis.

Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299, 308 (R.I. 2008) (“This Court undertakes a de novo review of questions', '- 12 - of law, as well as mixed questions of law and fact, that involve issues of constitutional dimension.”). The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides: “In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him * * *.” Although not articulated with perfect clarity, defendant’s Confrontation Clause argument seems to suggest that, despite his physical presence on the witness stand, Long was unavailable for cross-examination because of his professed lack of memory.', 'The seminal case in modern Confrontation Clause jurisprudence is Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).', 'In Crawford, the Supreme Court recognized that the Confrontation Clause provides a procedural, rather than substantive, guarantee that evidence be tested by cross-examination:', '“[T]he [Confrontation] Clause’s ultimate goal is to ensure', 'reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a', 'substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable,', 'but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in', 'the crucible of cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a', 'judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a', 'point on which there could be little dissent), but about how', 'reliability can best be determined.” Id. at 61. Nevertheless, Crawford also declared, “[W]hen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements.” Crawford, 541 U.S. at 60 n.9. In this case, the declarant—Long—appeared at trial and was subject to cross-examination, including cross-examination with the contents of his prior statement. Additionally, defense counsel questioned Long about his plea deal, his arrest, and a possible love affair between defendant and Labossiere.', 'The defendant relies upon two United States Supreme Court cases for his Confrontation Clause argument. In Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 416 (1965), the witness called to testify was a previously convicted codefendant who invoked his privilege against self-incrimination', '- 13 - when he took the stand. After the judge ordered the witness to answer and he again refused, the prosecutor read from a document purporting to be a signed confession by the witness and, every few sentences, asked the witness whether he made the statement. Id. The witness continued to assert the privilege and to refuse to answer. Id. at 416-17. The Supreme Court held that the defendant’s inability to cross-examine the witness regarding the confession denied the defendant his right of cross-examination under the Confrontation Clause. Id. at 419. Here, Long did not refuse to testify based on any Fifth Amendment privilege; rather, he testified that he had no memory about the statement but was, in fact, available for cross-examination. Although his responses were not particularly helpful, they were substantive in that he stated that he did not remember making the statement and did not recognize the sound of his own voice or his signature; Long did not deny making the statement to police. Further, on cross-examination, defense counsel asked a number of questions about the circumstances surrounding Long’s statement, and Long answered those questions.8', 'Thus, we cannot say that Long was not available for cross-examination as is a witness who claims a privilege against self-incrimination and refuses to answer any questions at all.', 'The defendant also cites Lee v. Illinois, 476 U.S. 530 (1986), to support his Confrontation Clause argument. Because the reasoning of Lee is fundamentally at odds with the reasoning of Crawford, its continued viability is dubious. Compare Crawford, 541 U.S. at 63 (rejecting an “indicia of reliability” framework as “so unpredictable that it fails to provide meaningful protection from even core confrontation violations”) with Lee, 476 U.S. at 539 8', 'For example, when shown the rights form that he signed, Long acknowledged that he signed the form at 6:12 p.m.; when shown the transcript of the recorded statement, Long acknowledged that it did not start until 6:52 p.m. Defense counsel then asked a number of questions about what happened in the time between the signing of the rights form and the start of the recording. Long responded that he did not remember having a conversation with the police officers before they turned the recorder on, but that they “said something about the robbery.”', '- 14 - (holding that the witness’s statement was “presumptively unreliable and that it did not bear sufficient independent ‘indicia of reliability’ to overcome that presumption”); see also State v. Moten, 64 A.3d 1232, 1240 (R.I. 2013) (noting that Crawford definitively abrogated the “indicia of reliability” framework as announced in Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980)). Regardless of the legal reasoning, the facts of Lee are inapplicable here because the confessing codefendant witness in Lee never took the stand. See Lee, 476 U.S. at 536.', 'Accordingly, we are satisfied that the use of Long’s prior police statements as prior inconsistent statements did not violate the Confrontation Clause. See Crawford, 541 U.S. at 60 n.9; see also Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 989 (“[T]he Confrontation Clause ‘guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.’”).', 'C', 'Remaining Arguments', 'The defendant also contends that the leading questions that the prosecutor was permitted to ask Long were prejudicial. When reviewing leading questions posed to another witness suffering from jailhouse amnesia, this Court declared,', '“Although leading questions generally are prohibited on direct', 'examination, they may be allowed for a limited purpose such as to', 'guide the testimony of a hostile or a purportedly forgetful witness.', '“Here, it is clear that [the witness’s] appearance at trial was', 'anything but cooperative; he experienced a failure of memory that', 'could be characterized as hostile and lacking in credibility. A', 'party is entitled to treat a forgetful witness as adverse; and, in an', 'effort to elicit truthful testimony from the witness, the examiner', 'may resort to leading questions. It is within the discretion of the', 'trial justice to decide whether to allow the examiner to lead; that', 'discretion, however, is not without limit.” McManus, 990 A.2d at', '1236.', '- 15 - Although in McManus, the trial justice came “dangerously close to a prejudicial abuse of discretion,” we deemed any error to have been harmless “in light of our decision upholding the introduction of [the witness’s] statement to the police.” Id. In this case, we are of the opinion that error, if any, arising from the use of leading questions by the state was harmless based on our conclusion that Long’s police statement was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement. This holding simply recognizes the difficulty inherent in attempting to refresh the recollection of an unwilling witness without resort to leading questions. This is a decision left to the discretion of the trial justice.', 'The defendant also argued that his due process rights were violated because Long’s statement was obtained without counsel and was the product of coercion.', 'This argument, however, was not raised to the trial justice below. Therefore, it was waived. See State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828-29 (R.I. 2008) (“It is well settled that a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.”).', 'III', 'Admission of Jeannine Labossiere’s Testimony as an Adoptive Admission', 'The defendant argues that Long’s statements to Labossiere should not have been admitted as adoptive admissions by defendant. At trial, Labossiere testified that Long and defendant came to her house at 1 a.m. on May 7, 2009. She noticed that defendant was limping and that Long had a bandana wrapped around his hand; thus, she sensed that something was amiss. After she repeatedly asked them what happened, Long admitted that “they robbed a Domino delivery guy.” According to Labossiere, defendant “looked a little mad that Long said something” to her, but he remained silent. Long then provided additional details about the crime, including that he gave Labossiere’s cell phone to defendant so that defendant could call Domino’s and place an order', '- 16 - for delivery to an abandoned house. Long disclosed that, when Lopez approached the house, defendant grabbed him and put him in a choke-hold. At that point, it was defendant who demonstrated the choke-hold to Labossiere. She also testified that Long described Lopez as badly beaten and that he got away a couple of times such that defendant had to put him back in the choke-hold. Shocked at these revelations, Labossiere said to them, “What the hell did you guys do?” She testified that defendant responded, “We just told you what we did.” (Emphasis added.) When she inquired about the fruits of the robbery, defendant told Labossiere that he bought her a pack of cigarettes and produced about $15 in cash.', 'A trial justice’s evidentiary rulings are reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. McManus, 990 A.2d at 1234. Rule 801(d)(2)(B) provides that “[a] statement is not hearsay if * * *[t]he statement is offered against a party and is * * * a statement of which the party has manifested his or her adoption or belief in its truth[.]”', 'It is well settled that “silence is sometimes sufficient to signify adoption.”', 'Day, 925 A.2d at 983.', 'Where an accusatory statement was made within hearing distance of an accused and the accused did not respond to the accusation, this Court has pointed to five factors to consider in deciding whether a purported adoptive admission results:', '“(1) whether the statement was incriminating or accusatory; (2)', 'whether it was one to which an innocent person in the defendant’s', 'situation would respond; (3) whether the statement was made', 'within the presence and hearing range of the defendant; (4)', 'whether it was understood by the defendant; and (5) whether the', 'statement was one to which the defendant had an opportunity to', 'respond.” Id.', 'We are satisfied that this case represents a use of classic adoptive admissions. Long implicated defendant in a robbery; thus, the statement was clearly incriminating. Furthermore, an innocent person would certainly respond to such a direct suggestion of robbery. Labossiere also testified that Long and defendant were standing side-by-side—clearly within hearing range.', '- 17 - The fact that defendant looked annoyed by Long’s initial disclosure of the robbery and later demonstrated the choke-hold he applied to subdue Lopez establish that he not only understood the statements, but that he also had an opportunity to respond; additionally, evidence that defendant demonstrated the choke-hold is an admission by conduct. If defendant’s silence during Long’s initial disclosure was not enough to establish an adoptive admission, defendant later affirmed his participation in the robbery by telling Labossiere, “[w]e just told you what we did.” Accordingly, the trial justice did not err by admitting Long’s statements to Labossiere in the presence of defendant as adoptive admissions.', 'IV', 'Denial of Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for a new trial. “When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007)). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 140 (R.I. 2008)). “If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” Id. Only when the trial justice does not agree with the jury’s verdict must he or she consider whether reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome. State v. LaPierre, 57 A.3d 305, 310 (R.I. 2012). “[W]hen ‘the trial justice has articulated a sufficient rationale for denying a motion for a new trial, the decision will be given great weight’', '- 18 - and we will disturb it only if the trial justice ‘has overlooked or misconceived material evidence relating to a critical issue or if the justice was otherwise clearly wrong.’” State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 365 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1367 (R.I. 1994)).', 'In this case, the trial justice thoroughly recounted the evidence witness-by-witness. She made credibility determinations as to the key witnesses; specifically, she found that Lopez and Labossiere were credible and that the defendant, his mother, and Long were not credible witnesses. Ultimately, the trial justice agreed with the jury’s verdict and denied the motion for a new trial. Primarily, the defendant seizes upon the trial justice’s apparent misstatement that it was the defendant who told Labossiere that he and Long had robbed a Domino’s delivery- person. While the defendant is correct—the record discloses that it was Long who made the disclosure—this error is immaterial to the decision denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial. Although the defendant did not directly declare, “we robbed a Domino’s delivery guy,” his silence and demonstrative conduct permit the factfinder to draw an inference that the defendant adopted that statement. Furthermore, as noted by the trial justice, the defendant demonstrated his choke-hold for Labossiere and also responded to her question by saying, “We just told you what we did.” Therefore, the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence relating to a critical issue in this case. Accordingly, she did not err by denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we affirm the conviction.

48,State : v. : Jody Johnson. :,reversal,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Jody Johnson, was found guilty by a jury of first-degree robbery, conspiracy to commit first-degree robbery, and assault with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling house with intent to commit robbery. We granted his petition for writ of certiorari requesting direct review of his convictions.1 He argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for new trial because, according to the defendant, the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On April 10, 2015, defendant was charged by indictment with one count of conspiracy to commit first-degree robbery, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6; one count of first-degree 1', 'The defendant did not file a timely notice of appeal.', '-1- robbery, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a); and one count of assault with a firearm in a dwelling house with intent to commit robbery, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-4.2', 'The defendant was tried before a jury over four consecutive days in January 2017 in the Providence County Superior Court. The state presented testimony from two individuals: the complaining witness, Mary Celletti, and a Providence police detective, Matthew Cute, who responded to Celletti’s home and was subsequently involved in the investigation.', 'Mary Celletti testified that, on the evening of January 28, 2014, she was home alone and getting ready to watch “the presidential address” when she realized, either through a knock at the door or a ring of the doorbell, that someone was outside and wanted to come in. Before opening the door, Celletti asked who was outside and heard “I’m locked out of the house” from an unfamiliar voice who also told her his mother was not at home. Celletti “opened the door a crack” and saw a boy around the age of ten or eleven standing there. She asked him if he wanted to use her phone and opened the door to allow him to enter. After he walked into her house, she tried to close the door but the door pushed back open and a “tall, muscular man” with black skin, a dark blue jacket, a hood, a scarf, and glasses appeared in the doorway and asked her what she was doing with his son. As she answered that she thought the boy was locked out of his house and she was allowing him to use her phone, the man pulled out a gun with a “dirty silver barrel” and brown handle and pointed it at her face. Celletti observed that the man’s glasses were dark gray with Scotch tape on one side holding the arm to the front frame of the lenses. The man 2', 'The defendant was also charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-9-4, but the state dismissed this charge pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure after trial when it realized—during the sentencing phase of the case—that, pursuant to § 11-9-9, the Family Court has exclusive jurisdiction over charges brought under § 11-9-4.', '-2- instructed Celletti to go sit down, and she sat down on her bed, located in an open alcove adjacent to the kitchen.', 'Celletti testified that the man asked her who else lived in her home; when she replied that her son lived there but was at his girlfriend’s house that evening, the man asked where the son’s bedroom was located and said that he was there to collect money the son owed him. The man then took off his scarf and his jacket, hung the jacket on the back of a kitchen chair, and pulled down the hood of his sweatshirt, uncovering his head. He made a phone call and Celletti heard a third person enter her house from the same door through which the boy and the man had come. The man handed the gun to the boy and instructed him to sit in a chair across from Celletti. The boy held the gun on her while the man disappeared from view and spoke with the third person who had entered her home. Celletti testified that she never saw the third person’s face, but that she concluded this person was female from the timbre of the voice. Celletti described the third person as tall and thin, wearing a red hoodie, with the hood up for the entire duration of the incident.', 'Celletti testified that she engaged the boy in conversation and told him about herself “to humanize [her]self with [him]” and to try to find out who he was. She learned his name and the name of his school. When the boy wanted a drink, Celletti gave him a can of Diet Coke. She asked him if he had ever held a gun before and if he thought they were going to kill her.', 'Celletti testified that she saw her son’s mattress and boxspring being lifted up as well as things in her bedroom torn up; she also heard her computer being moved, her pocketbook being dumped out, her television being turned off, unplugged, and carried out, as well as the movement of other televisions in her home. Celletti also stated that the people who entered her home left with bags from her basement, her cell phone, her home phone, bottles of red wine, coin', '-3- collections, CDs and DVDs, her son’s wedding band, and cash, among other things. Before the group of intruders left, the man took the gun from the boy, used a bra from Celletti’s dirty clothes hamper to wipe the gun off, and, on his way out the door, said: “If you call the cops, I’m coming back.”', 'A few moments later, Celletti saw the man’s jacket on the back of her kitchen chair, called out to him, and gave the jacket to him. After realizing that both her cell phone and her home phone had been taken, she found an old cell phone with just enough battery charge to make a call to her daughter and screamed that she had just been “robbed at gunpoint.” Her daughter soon arrived at the house, which shortly thereafter was “swamped with police from Johnston and Providence.”', 'Both Celletti and Det. Cute testified that, a few days after the incident, the detective brought a yearbook from the boy’s school over to Celletti’s house and Celletti was able to identify the boy who had been in her house the night of the incident. Both witnesses also testified that, two weeks after the incident, Det. Cute brought over a photo array which included defendant’s photo, but Celletti was unable to identify any of the men in the photographs as the man who had entered her home on January 28.', 'Some months after being shown the photo array, Celletti called the Attorney General’s office to inquire about the legal proceedings involving the boy. After a brief conversation—the substance of which is not on the record—she used her daughter’s laptop computer to search Facebook for the name “Jodi Johnson.” Celletti thought this might have been the name of the third person in her house on January 28 whom she had not seen but had assumed was a woman based on the voice. After scrolling through the various Jodi Johnsons who came up in the Facebook search results, she looked at photos for different spellings of “Jodi.” She testified that,', '-4- “all of a sudden [she] saw a picture that was very familiar to [her], but it wasn’t a female, it was a male.” Celletti testified that, based on the eyes and the large head, “he looked like the man who came into [her] house with a gun.” Celletti clicked on the photo, which brought her to that man’s Facebook profile page. Celletti scrolled through several photos of this “Jody Johnson,” including one in which he was wearing glasses with tape on the corner. When Celletti saw that picture, she was “a hundred percent” certain this photo was of the man who had entered her house on January 28. Celletti called Det. Cute, who testified that he went to her house, watched her repeat the search sequence she had performed on Facebook, and, using his own cell phone camera, took photos of the images on her computer screen. Celletti identified defendant as the man who entered her home and pointed a gun at her face.', 'At the close of the state’s evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the assault charge, arguing that insufficient evidence had been produced that a firearm was used during the incident. The trial justice denied the motion. The defendant renewed his motion prior to the delivery of the jury instructions and closing arguments; the trial justice reserved his decision. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts. In March 2017, the trial justice denied defendant’s renewed motion for judgment of acquittal and motion for new trial, in which defendant argued that the jury’s verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence and Celletti’s testimony.', 'The trial justice imposed a sentence of twenty-five years’ imprisonment with twelve years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation, on defendant’s first-degree robbery conviction and on defendant’s assault-with-a-firearm conviction.', 'With respect to defendant’s conspiracy conviction, the trial justice initially sentenced him to twenty years’ imprisonment with ten years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation, but corrected the sentence sua', '-5- sponte a month later because this sentence exceeded the statutory maximum. Accordingly, he modified the sentence to ten years’ imprisonment with ten years to serve. Each sentence runs concurrently with the sentences for the other convictions. Final judgment entered on May 30, 2017. The defendant filed a notice of appeal before the trial justice entered a final judgment of conviction, but did not file another notice of appeal after the trial justice corrected the sentence imposed for the conspiracy conviction. We granted defendant’s petition for writ of certiorari asking this Court for direct review of his convictions.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'The defendant appeals only from the trial justice’s denial of his motion for new trial. As we have oft repeated, “[w]hen a trial justice is presented with a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, he or she acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Gomez, 116 A.3d 216, 223 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Storey, 102 A.3d 641, 646 (R.I. 2014)). “[T]he trial justice must consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, then independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and also ultimately determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. (quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 646). “If, after conducting this independent review, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Id. (quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 646). “Only when the trial justice does not agree with the jury’s verdict, [must he or she] embark on a fourth analytical step.” Id. (quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 646).', '-6-', '“This Court’s review of a denial of a motion for a new trial is deferential because the trial justice is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses * * *.” Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223 (quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 647). “If the trial justice has articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion, his or her decision is entitled to great weight and will not be overturned by this Court unless he or she has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 647).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice was clearly wrong when he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial because, according to defendant, the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Specifically, he asserts that Celletti’s testimony identifying him as the perpetrator should have been given little weight and that the weight of the evidence does not indicate that an operable firearm was used during the incident. We begin our discussion by acknowledging that the trial justice applied the correct standard for assessing the motion for new trial and articulated sufficient grounds for denying the motion; his decision is therefore entitled to great weight and deference pursuant to our well established standard of review. See Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223.', 'With respect to Celletti’s in-court identification of defendant as the perpetrator, defendant argues that little weight should have been given to this testimony because she had not been able to identify him from a photo array a couple of weeks after the incident despite her testimony that she had spent several minutes looking at his face while he was in her house. The defendant also argues that none of the Facebook photos of him wearing glasses shows tape at the corner, which directly contradicts the emphasis he claims Celletti placed on her ability to identify him on', '-7- Facebook as the perpetrator based on the Scotch tape at the corner of his glasses. In addition, defendant argues that Celletti more likely identified defendant as the perpetrator because a representative from the Attorney General’s office told her the name of a suspect, she went looking for a photo of the person with that name, and then adjusted her recollection of his physical description once she found the photos.', 'In the trial justice’s decision denying defendant’s motion for new trial, he concluded that Celletti’s testimony was consistent and that the few discrepancies—drawn out during cross- examination—between her initial statements to the police, her grand jury testimony, and her trial testimony “did not diminish the weight or significance of [her] testimony.” Our review of the testimony reveals that, as Celletti scrolled through the Facebook profiles listed from her search for “Jodi Johnson,” she came across a photo of a face that was “very familiar” to her “[b]ecause he looked like the man who came into [her] house with a gun.” She opened his profile and looked through other photos; when she saw the photo of him wearing glasses with “the shadow of the tape on the side of the glasses,” she “knew a hundred percent that was him.” While it had apparently been suggested to Celletti that an individual by the name of “Jodi Johnson” was thought to be involved in the incident, the name merely provided a starting point for Celletti’s Facebook search. Indeed, she testified that, when she started her search, she was looking for a female.', 'As the state points out, the Facebook search for “Jodi Johnson” yielded many profiles and photos that Celletti scrolled through before seeing one with a familiar face; the search did not result in a single photo that Celletti concluded was a photo of her perpetrator. Moreover, at trial, Celletti emphasized that her in-court identification of defendant was based on “his height, how big he is, his eyes.” Deferring to the trial justice’s front-and-center position to evaluate the facts', '-8- and to judge credibility, considering his clear articulation of his conclusion that Celletti’s testimony was consistent and credible, and absent any indication that he overlooked or misconceived the evidence, we agree with the trial justice’s assessment of the weight to which Celletti’s testimony was entitled and perceive no error on his part. See Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223.', 'The defendant also specifically challenges his convictions for first-degree robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling house with intent to rob on the basis that the guilty verdicts for these counts are against the weight of the evidence that the gun wielded during the incident was operable. He argues that Celletti’s only testimony about the gun was to describe its color and to state that it was pointed at her, and he further argues there was no testimony that she knew the gun was operable or that the intruders indicated the gun was operable. The defendant contends that Celletti’s testimony about her fear at the sight of the gun does not show its operability.', 'The indictment in this case identified the dangerous weapon as a firearm. To prove assault with a dangerous weapon when the dangerous weapon in play is a firearm, it is well settled that the state must prove the defendant possessed an operable gun. State v. Tillery, 922 A.2d 102, 107 (R.I. 2007). The state need not either produce the gun at trial or prove that the gun was loaded during the commission of the crime; the operability of the gun “may be inferred from the actions and statements of the defendant.” Id. at 108. We have had prior opportunities to consider whether the circumstances presented in a variety of cases could lead to a reasonable inference that an operable firearm was used in the commission of an assault. We have held that there was sufficient evidence that an operable gun was used when witnesses consistently described the gun they saw the defendant carrying and testified that the defendant had made a threat to shoot and that they had heard the gun click. Id. We have also held that the jury could', '-9- properly infer a firearm was used when the witnesses testified that they were afraid, when the defendant pointed a gun at—and within inches of—one witness’s chest, and when the defendant threatened to shoot a hole in a nearby mattress. State v. Andrade, 657 A.2d 538, 543 (R.I. 1995) abrogated on other grounds by State v. Jackson, 752 A.2d 5, 9-10 (R.I. 2000). On the other hand, we have also vacated a conviction after holding that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the defendant possessed an operable weapon when the complaining witness was equivocal about whether the defendant had possessed a gun at all during the incident in question. State v. Caba, 887 A.2d 370, 376-77 (R.I. 2005).', 'The case at bar presents testimony that is more akin to the circumstances in Tillery and Andrade than those in Caba. In her testimony at trial, Celletti described the gun as having a dirty silver barrel and brown handle and stated that defendant had pointed the gun at her face when he entered her home. She was clearly afraid the gun would be used to kill her because she asked the boy—who held the gun on her while the others searched her house—whether he thought the others were going to kill her. She also testified that the gun was pointed at her face by the young boy while defendant and the third person removed a variety of electronics and personal items from her home. As the intruders were leaving, Celletti testified that defendant issued a threat: “If you call the cops, I’m coming back.”', 'In his decision denying defendant’s motion for new trial, the trial justice specifically concluded that a gun was used during the incident. He considered the caselaw discussed supra and gave great weight to Celletti’s testimony that she was in fear, as demonstrated by her question to the young boy about whether he thought the others were going to kill her, defendant’s threat to return if she called the police, and the gun pointed at her for the duration of the incident. Unlike the defendant in Caba, Celletti was unequivocal about the presence of the', '- 10 - gun. The unrebutted testimony as to the actions and statements of defendant and his accomplices lead to a reasonable inference that the gun was operable, and defendant has not shown that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived any evidence by so concluding.', 'Overall, the trial justice concluded that Celletti was a credible witness, and he specifically stated that he agreed with the jury’s guilty verdicts on all three counts.', 'After thoroughly reviewing the record, it is apparent that the trial justice explained and supported his reasons for denying the defendant’s motion for new trial. It is our opinion that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive any material evidence and did not err by denying the defendant’s motion.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.

49,v. : Brandon Alves. :,reversal,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court.', 'The defendant, Brandon Alves (Alves or defendant), appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction on count 1, robbery in the first degree, and count 2, conspiracy. Alves was found guilty of both counts by a jury, and the trial justice sentenced him to the Adult Correctional Institutions for fifteen years, with six years to serve and nine years suspended with probation as to count 1, and ten years suspended as to count 2. Alves seeks to have his conviction and sentence vacated, and asks this Court to grant him a new trial on the grounds that the trial justice erred in admitting into evidence identification testimony and a photograph identification. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On February 7, 2014, Farhan Mustafa was closing his cell-phone-repair shop for the evening when two men entered from the back door and held “guns right in [his] face” and robbed him. Mustafa recognized one of the assailants as “Big D.” Although he did not know the second assailant, Mustafa testified that the man was “very familiar,” and that he had observed him for ten to fifteen seconds from less than two feet away. Mustafa called the Providence police to report the incident and also called his friend, Ryan Gallant, who, Mustafa testified, knew Big D.', '-1- At the Providence police station, Mustafa met with Detective Ronald Riley and described the assailants. He described the second assailant as between five feet eight inches and five feet ten inches tall, with a medium complexion. Detective Riley then showed Mustafa a series of ten to fifteen photographs, from which Mustafa identified the first assailant, Big D. The following day, Det. Riley presented Mustafa with another photo array to identify the second assailant, but Mustafa did not find the second assailant among the photographs presented.', 'Later that day, in a further attempt to identify the second assailant, Mustafa and Gallant visited a website that featured pictures of patrons at various Rhode Island nightclubs. After looking at between twenty and twenty-five photographs, Mustafa identified a photograph depicting the second assailant. Mustafa recognized the assailant “right away.” Gallant informed Mustafa of the name of the man Mustafa had identified in the photograph. Mustafa printed the website photograph and brought it to Det. Riley. Detective Riley asked Mustafa to draw a circle around the individual he identified. Mustafa then wrote “Brandon New Bedford” in the upper left corner of the image, and signed and dated the photograph.', 'On April 16, 2014, Mustafa received a text message from Gallant reporting the then- current location of the second assailant. Mustafa informed the police, who responded and arrested Alves. Two days later, Det. Riley showed Mustafa a single photograph of Alves from a shared-law-enforcement database. Detective Riley testified that he showed Mustafa a single photograph because “[Mustafa] [had] already identified the suspect in the previous photo he gave” to Det. Riley, and that this single photograph was meant to confirm “the name and date of birth” of the suspect. According to Det. Riley, “As soon as [he] put the * * * photo [of Alves] down in front of [Mustafa],” Mustafa “immediately identified” the individual depicted as the second assailant, with one hundred percent confidence.', '-2-', 'Alves was charged with first-degree robbery and conspiracy. He filed a motion to suppress the single photograph shown to Mustafa by Det. Riley. At a hearing on the motion, Alves argued that the identification procedure was “unnecessarily suggestive,” and that there was a “substantial likelihood of misidentification” such that he was denied due process of law. The trial justice denied Alves’s motion and determined that the photographic depiction was not “an unnecessarily suggestive procedure.” A jury trial commenced shortly thereafter, which resulted in Alves’s conviction for first-degree robbery and conspiracy. He timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v. Adams, 161 A.3d 1182, 1194 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 805 (R.I. 2005)). “The trial justice will not have abused his or her discretion as long as some grounds supporting his or her decision appear in the record.” Id. (quoting State v. Evans, 742 A.2d 715, 719 (R.I. 1999)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'The defendant’s first assertion of error is that the trial justice abused his discretion in admitting Mustafa’s testimony concerning his handwritten notation on the photograph Mustafa', '-3- had procured from the internet. The defendant argues that this testimony was impermissible hearsay.1', '“Hearsay is defined in Rule 801(c) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence as ‘a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.’” State v. Gomez, 116 A.3d 216, 226 (R.I. 2015) (quoting R.I. R. Evid. 801(c)). “Rule 802 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence sets forth the general prohibition against the admissibility of hearsay statements other than those well- recognized exceptions carved out by law.” Id. “[A] determination of whether an out-of-court statement meets an exception to the hearsay rule is within the trial justice’s discretion.” Id. (quoting State v. Watkins, 92 A.3d 172, 187 (R.I. 2014)). “Under this standard, this Court will uphold the trial justice’s ruling unless a clear ‘abuse of discretion that prejudices the complaining party is shown.’” Id. (quoting Watkins, 92 A.3d at 187).', 'At trial, the state questioned Mustafa, “[D]id you write anything on the photo when you saw Detective Riley?” and Mustafa began to answer, “[Gallant told] me that is his name so I wr[o]te it[,]” at which point defense counsel objected. The trial justice overruled the objection and stated, “I will permit the answer to stand to explain why he wrote on the photograph. It is not for the truth of the matter asserted, only to explain why he would make a marking on that photograph and no other reason.”', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice should have stricken Mustafa’s answer, which explained that Gallant informed him of the name of the individual depicted in the photograph they found online, as impermissible hearsay. We are of the opinion, however, as was 1', 'The defendant also argues that his “name could have been obscured or redacted” from the photograph exhibit; but defendant neither objected to the written caption nor requested a redaction before the trial justice. Therefore, this issue is waived. See State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 646 (R.I. 2006).', '-4- the trial justice, that the testimony at issue was not offered “for the truth of the matter asserted”—i.e., that a man named Brandon was the individual in the photograph—but was offered, instead, to explain why Mustafa wrote on the photograph. Mustafa had already, on his own, identified the individual depicted in the photograph as the second assailant. As noted by the trial justice in his oral ruling on defendant’s motion to suppress the identification, Mustafa “immediately without any difficulty, without any hesitation when he saw Mr. Alves’ face in that group photograph he said that is the second guy who robbed him.”', 'Moreover, the jurors had access to the photographic evidence and could determine for themselves whether defendant was the individual depicted in the photograph. Finally, we note that Gallant testified at trial and was thereby subject to cross-examination regarding his statement to Mustafa about the name of the individual in the photograph. See State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984, 990 (R.I. 2004) (“Even evidence that traditionally would be categorized as hearsay * * * d[oes] not alter the fact that the Confrontation Clause’s requirements are satisfied when a hearsay declarant is present at trial, is placed under oath and is subject to unrestricted cross-examination, thus affording the jury an opportunity to observe the witness’s demeanor.”). Therefore, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion, and the statement at issue was not hearsay.', 'B', 'The defendant’s second assignment of error is that the trial justice abused his discretion by failing to suppress the single photograph of defendant shown to Mustafa by Det. Riley. The defendant argues that the display of the single photograph by Det. Riley violated his right to due process and was “unnecessarily suggestive and misleading.”', '-5-', '“In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress an identification that was allegedly tainted by an unduly suggestive procedure, we carry out a two-step analysis.” State v. Franco, 750 A.2d 415, 420 (R.I. 2000). “First, we must determine whether ‘the totality of circumstances discloses procedures that were so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification that it constituted a denial of due process of law.’” Id. (quoting State v. Andrade, 657 A.2d 538, 541 (R.I. 1995)). “Only if we determine that the procedures were unduly suggestive do we proceed to the second step of our analysis and assess the reliability of the identification.” Id. Absent “a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification[,]” the out-of-court identification should be admitted. Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968).', 'In the case under review, we need go no further than the first prong of the analysis, indeed if we need go that far. The presentation to Mustafa of the single photograph of defendant was not so much an identification procedure as it was a confirmation of the identification that Mustafa had already made. The evidence revealed that Mustafa was accosted by two individuals brandishing guns as he was closing his cell-phone-repair shop. He had a clear view of their faces for ten to fifteen seconds, from two feet away. Mustafa immediately recognized one of the assailants and said that the other had a very familiar face.', 'With the help of Gallant, but without any police assistance, Mustafa was soon able to positively identify defendant as the second assailant. Approximately two months later, after defendant was arrested, Mustafa instantly identified the second suspect from the individual photograph depicting defendant. Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that the use of a single photograph was neither unnecessarily suggestive, nor did it implicate defendant’s right to due process. See Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 238-39 (2012) (“[D]ue process', '-6- concerns arise only when law enforcement officers use an identification procedure that is both suggestive and unnecessary.”).', 'The facts here are analogous to those in State v. Luciano, 739 A.2d 222 (R.I. 1999), in which this Court ruled that “use of an individual picture of [a] defendant was not unnecessarily suggestive” where witnesses had identified the defendant as the shooter before they were shown the individual photograph of the defendant, because the police had not suggested that the man in the photograph was the shooter, but “simply showed the picture to confirm [the witnesses’ previous] identification.” Luciano, 739 A.2d at 226. Here, Mustafa identified defendant through his own research, without the help of the police. Detective Riley’s display of the individual photograph to Mustafa was strictly a means to confirm the identification Mustafa had already made and relayed to police. Consequently, the photograph display was not unduly suggestive, and the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the photograph into evidence.', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred in admitting the photograph because he did not consider whether Mustafa’s identification was reliable. Again, this Court has made clear that “[o]nly if we determine that the procedures were unduly suggestive do we proceed to the second step of our analysis and assess the reliability of the identification.” Franco, 750 A.2d at 420.', 'Because this Court has determined that the photograph display was not unduly suggestive, we need not proceed to any further analysis regarding reliability.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

50,State : v. : Thomas Mercurio. :,non-reversal,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court.', 'The defendant Thomas Mercurio (Mercurio or defendant) appeals from his conviction on one count of resisting arrest. The defendant contends that the trial justice abused his discretion by permitting the prosecutor to inquire about three prior convictions for assault and, during cross-examination, erred in permitting the prosecutor to reveal that two of the defendant’s prior assault convictions in question were upon police officers. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 4, 2014. After carefully considering the written and oral submissions of the parties, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant was charged by information on January 11, 2011 with making threats to a public official (count 1), simple assault and battery (count 2), resisting arrest (count 3), and disorderly conduct (count 4).', '-1-', 'The incident triggering the charges occurred on the evening of October 26, 2010 in Cranston, Rhode Island. It began with a dispute between defendant and his neighbor, Ms. Irene Ferreira. According to defendant, he and his neighbor had been “feuding” for over a decade. Each had called the police on the other party in the past. On the evening in question, defendant testified that the dispute was nothing more than an exchange of childish words and that he was not angry. Ferreira, however, asserted that defendant was yelling in an outrageous tone that left her fearful for her life, prompting her to call 911 at around 6 p.m., requesting that a police officer be sent to her home.', 'The interactions between the police officer who responded to Ferreira’s 911 call and defendant resulted in defendant being charged with the aforementioned criminal charges. A jury trial was conducted in the Providence County Superior Court over the course of four days between March 14, 2012 and March 20, 2012.', 'A', 'The Trial', '1', 'Officer Salvatore’s Testimony', 'At trial, Officer Donald K. Salvatore, Jr. testified that, just before 6 p.m., he was dispatched to the home of defendant because “there was a Tom Mercurio at that residence [who was] out of control.” Officer Salvatore, in uniform, arrived at defendant’s house in a marked police car. The testimony of defendant and that of Officer Salvatore diverge from the time of their initial encounter. Officer Salvatore stated that, as the front door of defendant’s residence was open and the storm door was shut, and seeing a male and a female in the kitchen area, he knocked on the storm door. When they did not acknowledge him, he opened the storm door,', '-2- stepped on the threshold, and yelled, “Hello.”', 'The man asked who the officer was; after identifying himself as a Cranston police officer, Officer Salvatore asked the man if he was Tom. At this time, another man later identified as Thomas Mercurio “came running from the right side of the home” and began yelling, asking the officer if he had a warrant. Officer Salvatore described Mercurio as “irate” or “pretty upset.”', 'The officer testified that, at that time, he was standing on the threshold and had one foot inside of the home. Officer Salvatore explained that he asked defendant to come outside to talk, and they both stepped outside to the front stairway, with the officer standing approximately two feet away from defendant. After stepping outside, defendant said, “That f---ing neighbor.” When he then asked defendant if he had any guns or knives on him, defendant angrily said, “F--- this,” pushed him in the chest, and retreated back into the home.', 'Officer Salvatore testified that he then pursued defendant into the house, entering the landing between the first and second floors. He tried to grab defendant and repeatedly told defendant that he was under arrest. He testified that, because defendant was “flailing his arms” and “trying to kick,” defendant’s momentum caused him to trip down the stairs and fall sideways to the lower level. He then ran down the stairs and grabbed defendant, who was still kicking and punching in an apparent attempt to get away. According to Officer Salvatore, defendant was still swinging and kicking towards him before Officer Salvatore had his whole body on top of the face-down defendant, continually telling defendant that he was under arrest. He testified that defendant put his hands underneath his body after defendant was on his stomach and Officer Salvatore was on top of him. At this time, while trying to grab defendant’s left arm, Officer Salvatore first became aware that two other Cranston patrolmen, Officers Aldrich and Escobar, had arrived. Officers Salvatore and Aldrich grabbed defendant’s arms and handcuffed him.', '-3-', 'Officer Salvatore testified that, as he escorted defendant to the police car, defendant was “yelling the whole time[,]” as were members of his family. He stated that defendant was “very tense when [Officer Salvatore] was getting him into the car, [and defendant] continued to call me a yellow bastard.” According to him, defendant screamed and threatened to kill him while he walked defendant to the police car.', '2', 'Officer Aldrich’s Testimony', 'Officer Seth Aldrich testified that he also received the dispatch shortly before 6 p.m. and arrived at defendant’s residence soon after Officer Salvatore. He testified that he was in the street, about twenty-five to thirty feet away, when he observed Officer Salvatore speaking with Mercurio. He did not hear much of what was said but did hear Officer Salvatore state that he would rather speak with Mercurio outside. He stated that Officer Salvatore was standing on the outside front steps of the house while Mercurio was standing in the open doorway. Officer Aldrich did not see defendant strike Officer Salvatore; he did see defendant quickly turn towards Officer Salvatore and re-enter the house and Officer Salvatore run into the house after him. Officer Aldrich then ran into the house, and “observed Officer Salvatore and * * * defendant wrestling on the [lower-level] floor.” He stated that defendant was “lying on his stomach with his hands underneath his chest [and that he] attempted to get [defendant’s] right arm from underneath him [as] Officer Salvatore was on [defendant’s] left side.” Officer Aldrich stated that he handcuffed defendant after a “brief struggle.” During this time, defendant yelled toward his family members to get the video camera while saying that the officers should not have been in his home. Officer Aldrich followed behind Officer Salvatore and observed him secure defendant in the police cruiser. Officer Aldrich did not observe defendant kick, scream vulgarities, threaten', '-4- to kill Officer Salvatore, or otherwise cause problems either in the house or as he was being secured in the cruiser. Notably, Officer Aldrich was not questioned as to whether he heard Officer Salvatore inform defendant that defendant was under arrest.', '3', 'The Defendant’s Testimony', 'The defendant gave a different version of the events. He stated that, at the time Officer Salvatore arrived, he was eating dinner at the kitchen table with his mother, brother, and sister. According to defendant, his family’s dinner was interrupted when they heard someone open the door and ask for “Todd.” He became upset on seeing a police officer completely inside the house, with his foot on a stair and hand on the railing. He testified that he first asked Officer Salvatore “what he was doing in our home[,]” to which Officer Salvatore did not respond. When defendant next asked if the officer had a warrant, Officer Salvatore only responded by saying, “Just come down, I want to talk to you.” The defendant then came down the stairway while pointing his finger at Officer Salvatore and telling him to leave. He stated that he was angry, but did not yell. The defendant then testified that he stopped on one of the first three steps when the officer, standing inside of the home approximately two feet away, grabbed defendant’s right arm and collar, pulling him down the stairs and into the railing. The railing gave way and he fell to the bottom floor on his hands and knees. The defendant then testified that he received a blow to the left side of his rib and that the pain of the blow caused him to lie down flat on the ground. He stated that he received a blow on the left side of his head, and Officer Salvatore then put his knee in defendant’s back. According to defendant, he had both arms under his stomach as a result of the blow but allowed the officer to handcuff him when the officer grabbed his arm. He stated that he and Officer Salvatore did not speak to each other at this point, and that he was not', '-5- told that he was under arrest. He first observed two more police officers after he was handcuffed and brought to his feet. The defendant testified that he went willingly to the officer’s car and did not try to hit, yell at, threaten, or escape from Officer Salvatore.', 'After hearing all the testimony, the jury found defendant guilty of the charge of resisting arrest but not guilty of the charges of making threats to a public official, simple assault, and disorderly conduct. On April 4, 2012, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial and sentenced him to one year of imprisonment at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with thirty days to serve and eleven months suspended with probation. 1 Thereafter, defendant filed a notice of appeal to this Court on April 13, 2012. A final judgment of conviction and commitment entered on May 4, 2012. 2', 'On appeal, defendant challenges the trial justice’s pretrial ruling on his motion in limine permitting admission into evidence of his prior convictions. The defendant also challenges the trial justice’s decision during trial that defendant had “opened the door” so as to allow the state to impeach his credibility on cross-examination by bringing in the fact that his prior convictions involved assaults against police officers.', 'Additional facts will be added as necessary to resolve the issues on appeal. 1', 'The execution of defendant’s sentence was stayed pending this appeal. 2', 'This Court considers a premature notice of appeal timely so long as a final judgment is entered thereafter.

This Court has outlined factors that the trial justice must balance when deciding whether to permit the state to impeach a defendant with his or her prior convictions. See State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1117 (R.I. 1992). “The trial justice must balance the remoteness of the conviction, the nature of the crime, and the defendant’s disdain for the law as represented by the extent of his prior criminal record, to determine whether the relevance with respect to credibility outweighs the prejudicial effect to the defendant.” Id.

During the cross-examination of defendant, the state first broached the topic of defendant’s like or dislike of the police by inquiring why defendant asked Officer Salvatore “Do you have a warrant?” and why he was “angry” that Officer Salvatore was in his home. The defendant explained that “it’s [his] personal understanding and knowledge that the police require a warrant or some type of consent upon entering a dwelling place.” The following exchange then ensued:', '“[The State]: You don’t like the police, do you?', '“[Defendant]: That’s not true. I have many friends that are in the', 'police department.

This Court has since applied this rule concerning the prosecution manufacturing an issue during cross-examination in the context of Rule 404(b) in State v. McDowell, 620 A.2d 94, 95-96 (R.I. 1993).', '- 11 - The trial justice overruled an objection made by defense counsel. The defendant was thus permitted to answer.', '“[Defendant]: I respect law and order, yes, I do.', '“[The State]: You respect law and order?', '“[Defendant]: Yes, I do.” The cross-examination of defendant then continued, before the following colloquy took place, again regarding defendant’s sentiments about the police:', '“[The State]: You never got angry with the officer * * * and', 'pushed him?', '“[Defendant]: I never said that.', '“[The State]: Because you respect police; right?', '“[Defendant]: I respect law and order, yes, I do.', '“[The State]:', 'And you wouldn’t put your hands on a police', 'officer.', '“[Defendant]: No, I would not.”', 'At a sidebar immediately following this exchange, the state argued that defendant had “opened the door” to the fact that two of his prior convictions for assault involved police officers. The trial justice determined that defendant had “opened the door” to the nature and circumstances surrounding the prior convictions. Therefore, he permitted the state to confront defendant with specific evidence of the prior convictions.', 'This Court has recently been faced with a similar situation involving a prosecutor’s alleged manufacturing of an issue in order to impeach a witness’s testimony in Rosario. In Rosario, 14 A.3d at 207-08, the defendant was charged with assault with a dangerous weapon on a police officer. In ruling upon two motions in limine, the trial justice in Rosario held inter alia', '- 12 - that evidence of one particular previous interaction between the defendant and the police officer who had been the victim of the alleged assault as well as of specific comments that the defendant had made with regard to the police officer would be admissible. Id. at 208-09. The trial justice further held that evidence of “generalized references to threats of assault on police officers in general” would be precluded but noted that her decision on the motions in limine might be changed depending on what the defendant testified to during trial. Id. at 209.', 'At trial, during cross-examination of the defendant, Rosario was asked specifically if he liked the victim-police officer. Rosario, 14 A.3d at 212. The defendant responded, “Yes, I like him. He is an officer. I respect authority.” Id. The prosecutor then asked the defendant for confirmation: “Sir, you testified to this jury under oath that you respect all authority and you respect all Providence police officers; didn’t you say that?” Id. The defendant answered in the affirmative. Id. At this point, the prosecutor questioned the defendant regarding a previous generalized negative statement defendant had made about “all Providence police officers[.]” Id. The trial justice permitted the cross-examination of the defendant to proceed with that line of questioning, finding that the defendant had “opened the door” with his answer that he respected authority. Id. at 212. This Court affirmed the trial justice’s ruling, noting that “[the] defendant chose to answer a question about his attitude towards one person * * * with an extremely broad and unqualified declaration about his respect for authority in general[,]” in holding that defendant had “opened the door” to the rebuttal testimony which followed. Id. at 218.', 'The state relies on Rosario to support its contention that the trial justice did not err in determining that defendant had “opened the door” to being impeached based on his prior convictions for assault on police officers. We are of the opinion, however, that the facts of Rosario are different from the facts here. We emphasize, in particular, that in Rosario it was the', '- 13 - defendant who answered a specific question about one police officer with a broad, generalized statement about his respect for authority. See Rosario, 14 A.3d at 218. In contrast, here, the prosecutor was the first one to ask a broad leading question about defendant’s sentiments towards the police by asking, “You don’t like the police, do you?” 6 Prior to the prosecutor’s asking this question, the defendant had not “opened the door” through any general declarations about his respect for authority. Indeed, we note that in both this first exchange and in the one which followed, it was the prosecutor who persisted in questioning defendant in such broad terms. 7 We conclude that defendant had not “opened the door” to these questions. We find no support in the record for the proposition that defendant had previously volunteered any broad declarations of his respect for either the police or law and order generally so as to “open the door” to the prosecutor’s questions.', 'Our careful review of the record compels us to the conclusion that the repeated broad questions about defendant’s sentiments towards police officers in general elicited a response from defendant which then enabled the state to bring in defendant’s prior convictions of assault against police officers. We are persuaded that these repeated questions constituted improper “manufacturing” of an issue to bring in evidence which the trial justice had previously ruled inadmissible.', 'Our conclusion is further buttressed by the fact that, during the pretrial motion in limine hearing, the prosecutor stated that he would use defendant’s prior convictions only “if the defendant testifies and he gets up there and starts saying he’s a peaceful guy, that he respects police, or something along those lines.” (Emphasis added.) We are struck by the prosecutor’s use of this very phrase in several different permutations during the course of defendant’s cross- 6', 'In phrasing the question thusly, we note that the prosecutor had essentially “painted defendant into a corner” where the only possible response was a broad statement of liking the police. 7', 'As noted above, the prosecutor asked defendant “Because you respect police; right?” and then “And you wouldn’t put your hands on a police officer.”', '- 14 - examination. It was only after broadly leading questions along these lines that the prosecutor directly asked, “And you wouldn’t put your hands on a police officer,” thereby referring obliquely to defendant’s prior convictions in such a way as to lead inevitably to further questions regarding the exact nature of those convictions. We conclude that these questions on cross- examination were improper. 8 Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice erred in permitting the state to impeach defendant’s testimony using his prior convictions of assault against police officers.', 'Finally, this Court will address whether the trial justice’s error was harmless. “In order to meet the harmless-error test, there must be proof ‘beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.’” State v. Smith, 446 A.2d 1035, 1036 (R.I. 1982) (quoting Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967)). This Court has listed various factors to be considered in determining whether an error was harmless,', '“including the relative degree of importance of the witness', 'testimony to the prosecution’s case, ‘* * * the presence or absence', 'of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the', 'witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination', 'otherwise permitted, and * * * the overall strength of the', 'prosecution’s case.’” State v. Bustamante, 756 A.2d 758, 766 (R.I.', '2000) (quoting State v. Texter, 594 A.2d 376, 378 (R.I. 1991)). We are of the opinion that the trial justice’s error in permitting the state to cross-examine the defendant concerning the exact nature of his prior convictions was not harmless. As previously noted, this case was largely devoid of physical evidence, rendering the credibility of each of the witnesses central to the case.', 'We cannot be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the 8', 'We note that we do not believe the prosecutor acted deliberately in improperly cross-examining defendant. Indeed, we are satisfied that the prosecutor was fulfilling his duty as a zealous advocate for the state. We reiterate, however, our admonition in a recent case: “[w]hen a defendant is testifying at his trial, prosecutors and trial justices must be scrupulous to ensure that impeachment of defendant by reference to prior convictions or past criminal conduct is effected in a proper manner * * *.” State v. Price, 68 A.3d 440, 448 (R.I. 2013).', '- 15 - improper admission into evidence of the defendant’s prior convictions was not overly prejudicial. We are, moreover, especially reluctant to find the improper use of prior convictions to be harmless in the case at bar, when the improper cross-examination occurred to impeach the credibility of the defendant, whose liberty was directly at stake. Because we cannot conclude that the use of the defendant’s prior convictions was harmless, we are perforce required to hold that their admission into evidence was a reversible error. Consequently, we conclude that the defendant is entitled to a new trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s judgment of conviction is vacated.

State of Rhode Island : (PM 14-4730),reversal,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court.', 'The petitioner/defendant, Frederick Gibson, was convicted of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, and, as a sex offender, he became obligated to register with and notify local authorities when he changed his residence from town to town in the state of Rhode Island. But one thorny issue to be determined in these consolidated cases is the duration of that obligation. Is he required to register for life, as the state argues, or for a period of ten years, as he maintains? An equally vexing question that must be addressed by this Court in this case of first impression is whether changes to the law requiring Gibson to register—namely, two amendments to G.L. 1956 § 11-37.1-4(a), which governs the duration and frequency of registration, and an increase in the punishment for the failure to comply with the', '-1- sex-offender registration laws—violate the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions.', 'Gibson seeks review on certiorari of a decision of a magistrate of the Superior Court denying his motion to dismiss a 2012 charge for failing to notify law enforcement of a change in residence, in violation of §§ 11-37.1-9 and 11-37.1-10. In denying Gibson’s motion to dismiss, the magistrate determined that Gibson had a lifetime duty to register; therefore, his duty to register had not expired, and the 2012 charge would not be dismissed. Also, Gibson appeals from a judgment embodying a decision of a justice of the Superior Court denying his application for postconviction relief from three failure-to-notify convictions in 2007, 2009, and 2010, in violation of § 11-37.1-9. 1 The hearing justice in the postconviction relief matter also found that Gibson was burdened by a lifetime duty to register. In addition, she ruled that Gibson’s three failure-to-notify convictions did not violate the ex post facto clause.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm both the magistrate’s denial of Gibson’s motion to dismiss and the judgment of the Superior Court denying Gibson’s application for postconviction relief. However, in so doing, we deviate slightly from the reasoning on which the decision and judgment were based. We depart from the conclusions of the magistrate and the hearing justice that Gibson has a lifetime duty to register. Rather, we hold that, in accordance with the language of §§ 11-37.1-18 and 11-37.1-4(a), Gibson’s duty to register expires “ten (10) 1', 'Because of the considerable overlap of the issues presented in these cases, we consolidated Gibson’s petition for a writ of certiorari and his appeal from the denial of his application for postconviction relief. Gibson’s challenge to the denial of postconviction relief comes to us on appeal, not certiorari, because he filed his notice of appeal prior to the 2015 amendment to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-9 requiring an applicant seeking review of a final judgment regarding postconviction relief to do so “by filing a petition for writ of certiorari * * *.” See P.L. 2015, ch. 91, § 1; P.L. 2015, ch. 92, § 1. Still, final judgment in the Superior Court did not enter until July 7, 2015, shortly after that amendment’s date of enactment. In what appears to be an attempt to ensure that the appeal of his application for postconviction relief was procedurally proper, Gibson filed a petition for a writ of certiorari and a motion to consolidate, which we granted.', '-2- years from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *.” Section 11-37.1-4(a). We also hold that Gibson’s prior failure-to-notify convictions in 2007, 2009, and 2010 do not run afoul of the ex post facto clause.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On November 18, 1994, Gibson entered an Alford plea 2 to a charge of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-8.3. 3 As a consequence of his plea, he received a fifteen-year sentence, with four and a half years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation. Under the provisions of § 11-37-16, a statute that the General Assembly had enacted in 1992, Gibson was required to register as a sex offender. 4 In 1996, the General Assembly repealed § 11-37-16 and enacted a more comprehensive registration regime entitled the “Sexual Offender Registration and Community Notification Act,” chapter 37.1 of title 11 (the “Registration Act”).

Although this was Gibson’s first conviction for failing to notify in accordance with the Registration Act, it would not be his last. In both 2009 and 2010, Gibson—for a second and third time, respectively—pleaded nolo contendere to failing to notify in violation of § 11-37.1-9. For his 2009 failure-to-notify conviction, Gibson received a three-year sentence, with ninety 5', 'The pertinent subsection, § 11-37.1-9(d), which governs the duty of sex offenders who change their residence within the state of Rhode Island, provides that:', '“A person who has been convicted of an offense which requires', 'registration under this chapter and who changes his or her', 'residence address to another city or town in Rhode Island, shall', 'notify the local law enforcement agency in the city or town from', 'which the person is moving before the person establishes residence', 'in the new location, and shall register with the local law', 'enforcement agency in the city or town in which the person is', 'moving not later than twenty-four (24) hours after the person', 'establishes residence in the new city or town.

For his 2010 transgression, he received a ten-year sentence, with six months to serve and the balance suspended with probation. Thus, by the close of 2010, Gibson had been convicted on three separate occasions of failing to notify in accordance with the Registration Act.', 'Finally, in July 2012, Gibson was charged for a fourth time with failing to notify in violation of §§ 11-37.1-9 and 11-37.1-10. To this charge, though, Gibson did not plead nolo contendere. Rather, he moved to dismiss the criminal information, arguing that his duty to register as a sex offender had expired in 2004—ten years from the date of his conviction in 1994 and well before the 2012 charge.', 'However, a magistrate of the Superior Court decided otherwise. In a written decision, the magistrate denied Gibson’s motion to dismiss, concluding that Gibson was saddled with a lifetime duty to register. Gibson then filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with this Court, seeking review of the magistrate’s decision. We granted his petition.', 'Several months after the magistrate denied his motion to dismiss, Gibson filed an application for postconviction relief from his three prior failure-to-notify convictions that had occurred in 2007, 2009, and 2010. Before a justice of the Superior Court, Gibson made the same argument that he had raised in his motion to dismiss: the duration of his duty to register was limited to ten years, not for the remainder of his life. He further argued that his prior failure-to- notify convictions violated the ex post facto clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions because (a) amendments to the Registration Act impermissibly extended the duration of his duty to register, and (b) the Registration Act increased the punishment for failing to comply with the sex-offender registration laws from a misdemeanor to a felony. After two hearings on the matter, the hearing justice denied Gibson’s application for postconviction relief,', '-5- determining first that Gibson had a lifetime duty to register, and second that there was no violation of the ex post facto clause. Gibson appealed that ruling to this Court. 6', 'The issues before this Court are twofold: whether the duration of Gibson’s duty to register lasts ten years or for the rest of his life, and whether Gibson’s 2007, 2009, and 2010 failure-to-notify convictions violate the ex post facto clause.', 'II', 'Motion to Dismiss: The Duration of Gibson’s Duty to Register', 'The first issue Gibson presents to this Court is whether the duration of his duty to register as a sex offender is for a lifetime or is limited to ten years. Significantly, he does not dispute his duty to register. The question for this Court is whether the duration of Gibson’s duty to register is governed by either the repealed § 11-37-16—the registration statute in effect in 1993, the year of the underlying sex offense—or chapter 37.1 of title 11—the registration statute he has been convicted of violating on three separate and subsequent occasions.', 'As noted above, in 2012, Gibson was charged by criminal information with, for the fourth time, failing to notify in violation of §§ 11-37.1-9 and 11-37.1-10. 7 He moved to dismiss the criminal information, 8 arguing to the magistrate that his duty to register expired in 2004, ten years from the date of his conviction for second-degree child molestation sexual assault. The state, on the other hand, argued that Gibson’s duty to register was without expiration. According to the state, that was so because the statute in effect at the time of his conviction in 1994, the 6', 'Although Gibson’s appeal of the hearing justice’s decision was premature, because a final judgment was entered several months thereafter, his appeal is considered timely.

Neither Gibson nor the state has taken issue with the magistrate’s sua sponte conversion of the motion to dismiss.', '-6- former § 11-37-16, mandated a lifetime duty to register. In the alternative, the state also argued that Gibson’s duty to register, as a consequence of the child molestation conviction, even if not for life, would not expire until at least November 2019, ten years after the expiration of his sentence for second-degree child molestation sexual assault, in accordance with § 11-37.1-4(a).', 'In a written decision, the magistrate denied Gibson’s motion to dismiss, holding that the statute in effect at the time of his plea, § 11-37-16, burdened him with lifetime registration. Relying on an opinion from the United States District Court for the District of Maine that interpreted the repealed Rhode Island statute, the magistrate held that the clear and unambiguous language of § 11-37-16 imposed a lifetime duty to register, because it lacked a durational requirement. 9 Then, quoting from this Court’s opinion in State v. Flores, 714 A.2d 581 (R.I. 1998), the magistrate reasoned that Gibson, who was charged with a crime prior to the enactment of the Registration Act in 1996, “must register as a sex offender pursuant to the registration requirements in effect at the time he was charged, that is, pursuant to § 11-37-16.” Flores, 714 A.2d at 583.

Gibson, who does not dispute that he was under a duty to register, argues that the ten-year duration contained in § 11-37.1-4(a) controls. However, he further argues that the duration of his duty to register was set as of 1996, when the version of the Registration Act in effect at that time stated that the duty to register for offenders such as him ran “for a period of ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction * * *.” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1. According to Gibson, because his conviction for second-degree child molestation sexual assault was in 1994, his duty to register concluded ten years later, in 2004.', 'The state does not agree. It first posits that the duration of Gibson’s duty to register is governed by § 11-37-16, the statute in effect at the time of the sex offense. Under the state’s interpretation of that statute, Gibson has a lifetime duty to register because he was convicted in', '-8- 1994, and because the statute was silent on the issue of how long an offender must register. Indeed, the state maintains that § 11-37.1-4 applies by its specific and unambiguous terms only to offenses occurring after its enactment in 1996.', 'In the alternative, the state contends that the duration of Gibson’s duty to register, if governed by chapter 37.1 of title 11, ends in 2019, ten years from the expiration of his fifteen- year sentence, pursuant to the terms of the current version of § 11-37.1-4, and not, as Gibson maintains, ten years from the date of his 1994 conviction, under the terms of the since-amended 1996 version of that section.', 'According to Gibson, his duty to register expired in 2004. But, to accept that argument would require us to ignore changes to § 11-37.1-4(a) that extended the duration of the duty to register for those subject to its terms from “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction” to “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of release from confinement or placement on parole, supervised release or probation” to the current requirement of “ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *.” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1; P.L. 1997, ch. 156, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1.', 'With respect to the state’s argument that there is a lifetime obligation, it does not escape us that we cannot overlook the specific language of § 11-37.1-18, which provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“Any person who pursuant to the provisions of former § 11-37-16', 'had a duty to register under that section after having been', 'convicted of any violation of the provisions of chapter 37 of this', 'title * * * shall have the duty to register in accordance with the', 'provisions of this chapter.” (Emphasis added.)

To complicate matters further, the 1996 Registration Act included a general provision that it “shall', '-9- apply to those persons who are convicted of an offense requiring registration * * * which was committed after the effective date of [the Registration Act].” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 4 (emphasis added). Of course, the sex offense to which Gibson later pled was in 1993, three years prior to the effective date of the Registration Act. See Flores, 714 A.2d at 583.', 'After considering the thoughtful arguments of counsel, we are persuaded that a slightly different rationale resolves the question of the duration of Gibson’s duty to register. Starting with § 11-37.1-18, it is clear to us that, in enacting the Registration Act, the Legislature preserved Gibson’s duty to register because he had an obligation to do so under the former § 11- 37-16. Therefore, in our opinion the passage of the Registration Act did not free Gibson from the responsibility to register. However, the General Assembly’s mandate that offenders “shall have the duty to register in accordance with the provisions of [chapter 37.1 of title 11]” included the ten-year duration period set forth in § 11-37.1-4(a). Section 11-37.1-18 (emphasis added). It is important to note that the savings clause in § 11-37.1-18 says nothing about the duration of the duty to register. Id. (“Nothing in this section shall be construed to abrogate any duty to register which exists or existed under the provisions of former § 11-37-16.” (Emphasis added.)). This clear and unambiguous language constrains us to conclude that, in accordance with chapter 37.1, the duration of Gibson’s duty to register is governed by § 11-37.1-4(a). 10 In other words, when it repealed and replaced § 11-37-16, the General Assembly not only preserved the duty to register 10', 'Looking at the Registration Act as a whole, we also note that the crime for which Gibson was convicted—second-degree child molestation sexual assault in violation of § 11-37-8.3—is defined in § 11-37.1-3(a)(1) as “a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor[,]” bringing Gibson within the universe of persons whose annual duty to register is governed by § 11-37.1- 4(a). See § 11-37.1-4(a) (stating that “[a]ny person required to register under § 11-37.1-3(a)(1) * * * shall annually register * * * for a period of ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *”); § 11-37.1-3(a)(1) (requiring “[a]ny person who, in this or any other jurisdiction * * * has been convicted of a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor” to register as a sex offender “for the time period specified in § 11-37.1-4”); § 11-37.1-2(e)(3) (defining a “[c]riminal offense against a victim who is a minor” to include “[a]ny violation of * * * [§] 11-37-8.3”).', '- 10 - from that statute, but it also imposed the provisions of the new enactment, including the duration of registration. 11 Therefore, it is our opinion that Gibson’s duty to register is for a period of ten years, not a lifetime.', 'The next question we must address is, ten years from when? We do not agree with Gibson that the duration of his duty to register was fixed as of the enactment of the Registration Act in 1996. As we explained above, in 1997 and again in 2003, the General Assembly amended the durational period contained in § 11-37.1-4(a), extending it from, in 1996, “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction” to, in 1997, “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of release from confinement or placement on parole, supervised release or probation” and, as of 2003, “ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *.” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1; P.L. 1997, ch. 156, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1; see also § 11- 37.1-4(a).', 'Those amendments extended Gibson’s duty to register beyond 2004, and, in accordance with the provisions of the present version of the Registration Act, see § 11-37.1-18, Gibson’s duty to register is “ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense * * *.” Section 11-37.1-4(a).', 'Accordingly, it is our opinion that the magistrate was correct in denying Gibson’s motion to dismiss the 2012 charge for failing to notify in violation of §§ 11-37.1-9 and 11-37.1-10.

Thus, in accordance 11', 'We offer no opinion as to whether the duration of the duty to register under the former § 11- 37-16 was a lifetime.

As the magistrate noted, in Flores, “this Court conclude[d] that petitioner must register as a sex offender pursuant to the registration requirements in effect at the time he was charged, that is, pursuant to § 11-37-16.” Flores, 714 A.2d at 583. Moreover, it is true that this Court “reach[ed] [that] conclusion by noting that the registration requirements of chapter 37.1 of title 11 [did] not apply to petitioner by the clear and express language of the public law that enacted that statute.”', 'Id.', 'However, Flores is distinguishable from this case. The petitioner in Flores argued that, because of the timing of his conviction and the effective date of the Registration Act in 1996, he had no duty to register whatsoever. 13 Id. at 582. Here, however, Gibson contested the duration of his duty to register, not the duty itself. Thus Flores resolved an issue distinct from the issue with which we are confronted here.', 'Despite this Court’s language in Flores regarding the interplay between the effective date of the 1996 Registration Act and that particular petitioner’s duty to register, we are firm in our view that the provisions of the Registration Act control here.

In his application, Gibson challenged his convictions on constitutional grounds. His primary contention was that each of those failure- to-notify convictions violated the ex post facto clause, pointing out two grounds as to why those convictions were constitutionally infirm. First, based on Gibson’s contention that the duration of his duty to register was not for the remainder of his life, but for only ten years, he argued that the General Assembly unconstitutionally extended his duty to register when it amended the Registration Act in 1997 and 2003. According to Gibson, the duration of his duty to register was set under the 1996 version of § 11-37.1-4, which required him to register “for a period of ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction * * *.” See P.L. 1996 ch. 104, § 1.

However, the hearing justice dispatched Gibson’s argument by holding that he had a lifetime duty to register under the since-repealed § 11-37-16, the registration statute in existence at the time of the second-degree child molestation sexual assault in 1993.', 'Second, Gibson argued that the 1996 Registration Act unconstitutionally increased the punishment for the crime of failure to register or notify from a misdemeanor to a felony. As Gibson pointed out, under the 1992 Act, failure to notify was a misdemeanor, but, in 1996, under the Registration Act, it became a felony. See § 11-37-16(g) (1994 Reenactment); P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1. Nevertheless, the hearing justice held that there was no constitutional violation. She reasoned that at the time Gibson committed each criminal offense of failing to notify—in 2007, 2009, and again in 2010—the punishment for the offense was already in place.', 'As she explained, there was no retroactive punishment because the “penalty for failing to [notify] did not change after [Gibson] was charged with the criminal offense of failing to [notify].” The ten- year penalty was added to § 11-37.1-10 in 2003—at least three years prior to Gibson’s first failure-to-notify offense in 2006, an offense for which he was convicted in 2007.', 'However, before turning to the merits of Gibson’s ex post facto arguments, we must briefly summarize the history of the Registration Act.', 'B', 'History of the Registration Act', 'In 1992, the General Assembly enacted § 11-37-16, as enacted by P.L. 1992, ch. 196, § 1, imposing on sex offenders a duty to register.

For that reason, the state argues that Gibson is severely limited in his ability to launch a collateral attack against those convictions in his application for postconviction relief. According to the state, because Gibson entered those pleas, he waived his right to argue that his 2007, 2009, and 2010 convictions are constitutionally defective.

Gibson reasons that, in 1993, when the offense that precipitated his 1994 conviction for second-degree child molestation sexual assault occurred, he had a duty to register in accordance with the since-repealed § 11-37-16. As discussed above, in 1996, however, his duty to register—preserved by the savings clause set forth in § 11-37.1-18—became governed by the Registration Act, chapter 37.1 of title 11. Under the Registration Act, as it was constituted in 1996, the duty to register for an offender like Gibson was limited to “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction * * *.” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1. Gibson argues that the duration of his duty to register became fixed as of that time, meaning that his duty to register expired in 2004, ten years from the date of his conviction. Thus, Gibson reasons that, in 1997, when the General Assembly extended the duty to register to “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of release from confinement or placement on parole, supervised release or probation[,]” and again in 2003 to “ten (10) years, from the expiration of sentence for the offense[,]” it impermissibly increased a punishment—the duty to register— annexed to his original crime of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. According to', '1214-15 (R.I. 1991)); see also Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 390-91', '(1798). Gibson focuses on the third category: he alleges an increase in punishment from the one initially annexed to the sex offense of 1993.', '- 20 - Gibson, because his duty to register should have expired in 2004, his convictions for failing to notify in 2007, 2009, and 2010 are unconstitutional because they violate the ex post facto clause.', 'Under our caselaw, however, Gibson’s argument that the duration of his duty to register amounted to an unconstitutional extension of his punishment does not pass muster. There is a distinction between the imposition of a duty to register as a sex offender, which we have held to be a civil, nonpunitive regulatory measure, and the criminal offense of failing to register or notify. As this Court explained in Germane, “[a]lthough it follows as a consequence of a criminal conviction, sexual offender registration and notification is a civil regulatory process.” Germane, 971 A.2d at 593. In Germane, we held that the retroactive imposition of the duty to register did not implicate “the Rhode Island ex post facto clause because the registration requirement is simply part of a nonpunitive, civil regulatory scheme.” Id. The United States Supreme Court has held likewise with respect to the federal ex post facto clause. See Smith v. Doe I, 538 U.S. 84, 105-06 (holding that Alaska’s sex-offender registration act, modeled after Megan’s Law, was “nonpunitive, and its retroactive application [did] not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause”). Thus, the duty to register and the civil, nonpunitive regulatory conditions attached to that duty did not implicate the ex post facto clause’s prohibition on retroactive penal legislation in Germane.', 'In our opinion, we face precisely the same situation here. Gibson’s core contention is that the combination of changes to the Registration Act transformed his requirement to register from a civil regulation to a criminal punishment. The duration of his duty to register went from (arguably) a lifetime, under the former § 11-37-16, to 2004 (ten years from the date of his conviction) under the 1996 Registration Act, to 2009 (ten years from his release or the beginning of his parole, supervised release or probation) under the 1997 amendment, and to 2019 (ten years', '- 21 - from the expiration of his fifteen-year sentence, imposed in 1994) under the 2003 amendment. However, it is our firm opinion that the ex post facto clause is not implicated here because the duration of his duty to register is merely a condition attached to a civil, nonpunitive regulatory measure. See Germane, 971 A.2d at 593. The extension of his obligation to register from 1996 onward is the product of the General Assembly’s fine-tuning a civil regulatory scheme, not the imposition of retroactive punishment. As the United States Supreme Court has noted, the federal ex post facto clause “does not preclude a State from making reasonable categorical judgments that conviction of specified crimes should entail particular regulatory consequences.” Doe I, 538 U.S. at 103-04. We conclude that the same is true of the Rhode Island ex post facto clause; the extension of the expiration of Gibson’s duty to register from 2004 to 2019 does not transform a civil, nonpunitive regulatory requirement into retroactive penal legislation. See id.; Germane, 971 A.2d at 593.', 'Our opinion on this issue gains support from the “intent-effects” test that the United States Supreme Court has applied in determining whether sex-offender registration and notification requirements implicate the ex post facto clause. Under this test, a court first “must ascertain whether the legislature meant the statute to establish ‘civil’ proceedings.” Doe I, 538 U.S. at 92 (citation omitted). This requires us to discern the intent of the Legislature:', '“If the intention of the legislature was to impose punishment, that', 'ends the inquiry. If, however, the intention was to enact a', 'regulatory scheme that is civil and nonpunitive, we must further', 'examine whether the statutory scheme is ‘so punitive either in', 'purpose or effect as to negate [the State’s] intention to deem it', 'civil.’” Id. (citation omitted). Furthermore, “only the clearest proof will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.” Id. (quoting Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 100 (1997)).', '- 22 -', 'This Court previously has explained that the overall purpose of the Registration Act is civil and nonpunitive:', '“It is evident that the purpose of the Registration Act is not to', 'punish the offending [individual], but rather to protect the safety', 'and general welfare of the public. Supplying the names and', 'addresses of sex offenders to law enforcement agencies enables the', 'agencies to deal more successfully with the serious problem of', 'recidivist sex offenders. * * * [T]he proceeding remains', 'rehabilitative, rather than punitive * * *.” Germane, 971 A.2d at', '593 (quoting In re Richard A., 946 A.2d 204, 213 (R.I. 2008)). In our judgment, with respect to the first prong of the “intent-effects” test, see Doe I, 538 U.S. at 92-93, the intent behind the specific amendments extending Gibson’s duty to register was similarly civil and nonpunitive. See Germane, 971 A.2d at 593. In extending the duration of the duty to register by amendment in 1997 and 2003, the General Assembly intended not to impose punishment, but merely to further the civil, nonpunitive sex-offender registration and notification scheme. As we concluded in Germane, we are of the opinion that this was done in furtherance of “protect[ing] the safety and general welfare of the public[,]” not for the purpose of imposing further punishment on Gibson. Id. (quoting In re Richard A., 946 A.2d at 213).', 'Having concluded that the General Assembly’s intent was nonpunitive, we turn next to the “effects” part of the analysis; that is, “whether the statutory scheme is ‘so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate [the General Assembly’s] intention to deem it civil.’” See Doe I, 538 U.S. at 92. The United States Supreme Court has identified seven factors that serve as “useful guideposts” in analyzing whether the effects of a law are sufficiently punitive to overcome a legislature’s nonpunitive intent. Id. at 97 (quoting Hudson, 522 U.S. at 99). Known as the “Mendoza-Martinez factors,” they are: whether the law (1) “has been regarded in our history and traditions as a punishment”; (2) “imposes an affirmative disability or restraint”; (3) “promotes the traditional aims of punishment”; (4) “has a rational connection to a nonpunitive', '- 23 - purpose”; (5) “is excessive with respect to this purpose”; (6) “comes into play on a finding of scienter”; and (7) “whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime[.]” Id. at 97, 105. Accordingly, our analysis must be whether, after applying those factors, the General Assembly’s extension of Gibson’s duty to register evidences a punitive effect or purpose so onerous as to negate its intent to enact a civil, nonpunitive statutory scheme. See id. at 92, 97.', 'It is our considered opinion that the Mendoza-Martinez factors do not militate in Gibson’s favor. Since we first addressed this issue in 2008, we have considered the registration requirement itself to be nonpunitive. See In re Richard A., 946 A.2d at 213. We are not persuaded that the extension of the duration of Gibson’s registration requirement by amendments to the Registration Act in 1997 and 2003 strays from that historically nonpunitive intent. Furthermore, the duration of the duty to register neither “imposes an affirmative disability or restraint” on Gibson nor does it “promote[] the traditional aims of punishment.” See Doe I, 538 U.S. at 97. In addition, of particular import, extending the duty to register is not so excessive as to stray from the requirement’s purposes, which are to curb recidivism and protect the public. See id.; Germane, 971 A.2d at 593. Finally, the last two factors are of no significance here; there is no issue of scienter, and it is well settled that the registration requirement and the duration attached thereto flow from the commission of a criminal, sexual offense. See Doe I, 538 U.S. at 105. Therefore, there is no punitive effect as applied to Gibson, nor were the amendments in furtherance of a punitive purpose. Gibson’s argument that those amendments violate the ex post facto clause of either the federal or state constitutions must therefore fail.', 'We do pause to note, however, that although Gibson’s constitutional right against the passage of ex post facto laws has not been violated by the amendments that have been enacted to date, this does not foreclose the possibility that there is some threshold that the General', '- 24 - Assembly could someday cross that might lead to a different conclusion. In fact, the New Hampshire Supreme Court recently held that its state’s sex-offender registration act was so punitive in its effects on an offender that it negated the civil, nonpunitive purpose of the legislation. In Doe v. State, 111 A.3d 1077 (N.H. 2015), that court applied the “intent-effects” test to several changes in New Hampshire’s onerous sex-offender registration and notification statute.', 'Doe, 111 A.3d at 1093-1100.', 'While “[n]o one amendment or provision [was] determinative, * * * the aggregate effects of the statute” compelled the court to hold that the statute “ha[d] a punitive effect as applied to the [offender].” Id. at 1100. The court emphasized that two requirements of the statute were particularly punitive: the lifetime registration requirement and the requirement that the offender register in person. Id. at 1094, 1096, 1100.', 'We are satisfied that the extended duration of Gibson’s duty to register pales in comparison with the situation that was held to be constitutionally deficient in Doe. First, in contrast to the history of Gibson’s duty to register, the first iteration of New Hampshire’s registration statute was passed four years after the Doe offender’s probation ended. Doe, 111 A.3d at 1082. Further, Gibson, unlike the offender in Doe, has not been subjected to a cascading effect of onerous registration requirements.', 'For example, it was significant to the New Hampshire Supreme Court that the offender there, unlike Gibson, was required to register in person four times per year, a requirement that he had no opportunity to alleviate under the registration statute. Id. at 1094-95, 1096. Also, contrary to Gibson’s present scenario, the law in New Hampshire imposed on the offender a lifetime duty to register, a duration that the court considered particularly excessive in light of the fact that the offender had not reoffended. See id. at 1100. While Gibson, too, has not reoffended, he does not, in our opinion, have a lifetime duty to register.', 'Moreover, the offender in Doe suffered from a serious permanent disability,', '- 25 - furthering the court’s conclusion that the more onerous changes to the registration statute had constrained his ability to change addresses. Id. at 1082.', 'Those facts, when churned through the “intent-effects” analytical framework, weigh far more heavily in the Doe offender’s favor than they do in Gibson’s. This is especially true because we do not believe that the extension of Gibson’s duty to register is excessive in relation to the nonpunitive purpose underlying the 1997 and 2003 amendments. See Doe, 111 A.3d at 1100 (stating that “[a] number of courts give greatest weight” to the factor that asks whether the law “appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned” (citations omitted)). Gibson is not subject to a lifetime duty to register, nor must he register in person multiple times per year. See id. at 1100. We conclude that the extension of Gibson’s duty to register is an example of the General Assembly’s modification of the civil, nonpunitive regulatory requirements of the Registration Act, and nothing more.', '2', 'The Penalty for Failure to Register or Notify: From a Misdemeanor to a Felony', 'Gibson also argues that the General Assembly’s enhancement of the punishment for failing to notify from a misdemeanor to a felony violates the ex post facto clause. Again, we disagree. It is true that in 1993, when the offense that precipitated his 1994 conviction for second-degree child molestation sexual assault occurred, the failure to register as a sex offender or notify local law enforcement was a misdemeanor, punishable by ninety days in jail and one year probation. See P.L. 1992, ch. 196, § 1. It is also true that, in 1996, the failure to register or notify became a felony, punishable by up to two years in jail and fines of up to $2,000, see P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1, penalties which were increased in 2003 when the sentence for failing to', '- 26 - register or notify became up to ten years in jail and fines of up to $10,000. See § 11-37.1-10(a); P.L. 2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1.', 'However, what Gibson’s argument overlooks is that at the times when he failed to notify in multiple years, leading to his convictions in 2007, 2009, and 2010, the punishment for that crime already was in full force and effect. See §§ 11-37.1-9, 11-37.1-10(a); P.L. 2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1. Furthermore, his failures to notify were offenses separate and apart from the second-degree child molestation sexual assault of 1993, rendering them insufficiently annexed to that crime as to trigger a violation of the ex post facto clause. See State v. Pelz, 765 A.2d 824, 830-31 (R.I. 2001). Therefore, there has been no retroactive punishment and no ex post facto violation. See Pereira, 973 A.2d at 32. Accordingly, as applied to Gibson, the amended statutory framework does not violate the ex post facto clause.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm in part and quash in part the decision of the magistrate on the motion to dismiss. We affirm that part of the decision denying the motion to dismiss, but reverse the magistrate’s ruling that Gibson has a lifetime duty to register as a sex offender. With respect to the application for postconviction relief, we affirm the judgment denying relief, but reverse the hearing justice’s ruling that Gibson’s obligation to register is for the remainder of his life. 18 The papers in this case are remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. 18', 'We note that the hearing justice who denied Gibson’s application for postconviction relief concluded that Gibson’s duty to register, if not a lifetime in length, will expire in November 2030. She reached that conclusion based upon her interpretation of a 2008 amendment to a provision of the definitional section of chapter 37.1 by the General Assembly. See § 11-37.1- 2(e)(8) (defining the term “[c]riminal offense against a victim who is a minor” to include “[a]ny violation of § 11-37.1-10”); P.L. 2008, ch. 155, § 1; P.L. 2008, ch. 202, § 1; see also § 11-37.1-', '- 27 - 10(a) (“Any person who is required to register or verify his or her address or give notice of a change of address or residence who knowingly fails to do so shall be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, be imprisoned not more than ten (10) years, or fined not more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or both.”).

52,: In the Matter of B.H.,reversal,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The respondent, B.H., appeals from adjudications of delinquency entered in the Family Court. The Family Court trial justice found the respondent delinquent on two charges of first-degree child molestation sexual assault (first-degree child molestation) in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.1 and 11-37-8.2. On appeal, the respondent primarily contends that the evidence at the delinquency proceeding was insufficient to establish sexual penetration—an element of both of the charges of first-degree child molestation of which the respondent was adjudged to be delinquent. We agree that the evidence was insufficient on this element, and we remand to the Family Court with directions to enter adjudications of delinquency on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation sexual assault (second-degree child molestation) and for resentencing.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In August 2012, the Cranston Police Department filed delinquency petitions with the Family Court, alleging that, when respondent was thirteen years old, he committed two offenses that, if committed by an adult, would constitute the offense of first-degree child molestation and', '-1- one offense that, if committed by an adult, would constitute the offense of second-degree child molestation. The two complainants, Kevin and Henry, are twin brothers who were eleven years old at the time of the offenses.1 The state alleged that respondent committed first-degree child molestation against Kevin and Henry when he forced the victims to penetrate his anus with their penises and that he committed second-degree child molestation when he touched Kevin’s penis with his hand.2 Because the testimony of the two complainants is central to the primary issue respondent raises on appeal, we recount it in some detail.', 'The conduct giving rise to all three offenses occurred during a sleepover in August 2011. After a day of fishing, Kevin, Henry, and respondent had a sleepover at the home of the twins’ maternal grandparents. During the sleepover, the three boys shared the same room. Kevin testified that, after the three boys had retired to the bedroom that evening, respondent asked Kevin to put Kevin’s penis “in [respondent’s] butt.” Because Kevin trusted respondent, who was his best friend, and because respondent threatened to tell his grandmother “something” if he refused, Kevin complied. When asked whether his penis went “inside of [respondent’s] butt,” Kevin responded in the affirmative. Kevin also testified that respondent expressed a desire to insert respondent’s penis into Kevin’s “butt” but that Kevin refused. On cross-examination, it became apparent that Kevin was unable to recall the specifics of this episode with any great detail, and he repeatedly stated that he did not remember the details. However, Kevin was 1', 'To afford the complainants a measure of privacy, we use fictitious names to identify them. 2', 'The trial justice ultimately concluded that the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent committed second-degree child molestation by touching Kevin’s penis, and this finding is not pertinent to the issues on appeal. Accordingly, we have no need to discuss the evidence relating to this charge.', '-2- emphatic that his penis went “in” and “inside” respondent’s “butt.”3 It is evident from the transcript that it was difficult for Kevin to testify about what transpired during the sleepover. The trial justice later explained in her bench decision that Kevin “was noticeably upset, crying, [and] sometimes almost sobbing” during the course of his testimony.', 'Like Kevin, Henry had difficulty testifying about this episode; he testified that “I don’t like talking about it.” The trial justice later described each twin as “visibly shaken” during his testimony. Henry’s testimony was similar to his brother’s. He testified that respondent proposed that the boys engage in “[a]n experiment to see if we wanted to be gay” and that the experiment was “[t]o stick my penis in his butt.”', 'Henry testified that he placed his penis “inside [respondent’s] butt.”4 Like Kevin, Henry explained that he complied with respondent’s request because respondent threatened to tell his grandmother that they “were trying to do something” if he did not. Henry also testified that respondent placed his penis on Henry’s body and that he, like his brother, refused to allow respondent to insert his penis into Henry’s “butt.” As was true for Kevin’s testimony, cross-examination revealed that Henry could not recall many specifics of the episode. Nevertheless, when defense counsel asked whether Henry put his penis “inside of [respondent],” Henry responded that he did.', 'On redirect examination, Henry was asked, “[W]hen you mean [respondent’s] butt, what is that part of [the] body used for?” Henry did not answer this question.5 3', 'Henry also testified that he observed Kevin “[stick] his penis in [respondent’s] butt.” 4', 'Confirming Henry’s testimony, Kevin testified that he observed his brother “[p]utting his penis in [respondent’s] butt.” 5', 'During closing argument, the state asserted that “[Henry] clarified that [the term] ‘butt’ [meant] the part of the body that one uses to poop.” However, this assertion does not comport with the transcript of the delinquency proceeding. The pertinent passage of the transcript reads as follows:', '-3-', 'The twins’ mother testified that, when she picked up her children the day after the sleepover, a hysterical Kevin told her that “[respondent] wanted them to do it in the bum bum of them, and * * * [respondent] looks like he enjoyed it.” Finally, Det. Sean Maloney of the Cranston Police Department testified that, after he explained the arraignment procedure in Family Court to respondent, respondent stated: “I understand. I did it. I did not force them. It was experimental.”', 'At the close of the state’s case, respondent moved to dismiss the petitions. With respect to the first-degree child molestation charges, defense counsel argued that the twins’ testimony that they placed their penises “in” or “inside” respondent’s “butt” was insufficient to establish sexual penetration—an essential element of the offense.', 'Defense counsel also argued— incorrectly, we conclude—that, if the state had established sexual penetration, the state was required, in the circumstances of this case, to prove that respondent “acted with the intent for sexual arousal or sexual gratification” and that it had not done so.', 'The trial justice denied respondent’s motion, concluding that the testimony of both Kevin and Henry was sufficient to establish sexual penetration. The trial justice explained her rationale as follows:', '“[I]n or inside the butt, as described by each victim, is more than', 'sufficient to satisfy the requirement of the statute for sexual', 'penetration. In or inside the butt is an intrusion, however slight. In', 'or inside the butt is certainly where the anal opening is located.', '“Q.', 'And[,] just to clarify, when you mean [respondent’s] butt, what is that part', 'of [the] body used for?', '“A.', '(NO RESPONSE).” We therefore give no weight to this assertion. Additionally, we note that the state has not repeated this assertion on appeal, and the trial justice made no mention of it in her findings of fact adjudicating respondent delinquent on the two charges of first-degree child molestation.', '-4-', '“This Court does not expect a child, now thirteen years old,', 'to describe a horrific act that occurred two years ago when the', 'child was eleven years old, with such specificity and adult', 'language that it mirrors the language of the statute. Using one’s', 'common sense, the victims each were truthful, credible[,] and', 'consistent in describing the act[,] and[,] when questioned and', 'challenged many times, each testified consistently at different', 'times that their penis[es were] inside [respondent’s] butt. Inside', 'plainly means an intrusion, however slight, in the anal opening.”', 'Although the trial justice also rejected respondent’s argument that the state was required to prove that respondent acted with the intent of sexual arousal or gratification, she nonetheless went on to conclude that the state had in fact proven that respondent’s conduct was intended for sexual arousal or gratification. She explained:', '“[T]he [r]espondent’s specific request of each victim to penetrate', 'his butt with their penis[es], [r]espondent’s description and', 'instruction on how to perform the act which he called an', 'experiment and his willingness to participate and [his] engaging in', 'the act was for the sole and exclusive purpose of sexual', 'gratification or arousal. There was no other reason or purpose for', '[r]espondent to make such a suggestion to two very young[,]', 'inexperienced boys whose innocence and trust in him practically', 'guaranteed compliance.', '“Further, [r]espondent’s later request to penetrate the', 'victims, which request was refused by them, adds another layer to', '[r]espondent’s quest for sexual gratification or arousal.', '“Even though th[e] element [that the accused act with the', 'intent for sexual arousal or gratification] is not essential to [prove]', 'when the act is purposeful penile penetration, that element does', 'exist here.”', 'Concluding that the state had met its burden of proving that respondent committed first- degree child molestation upon Kevin and Henry, the trial justice adjudged respondent delinquent on those charges. The respondent timely appealed.', '-5-', 'Standard of Review', 'On appeal from an adjudication of delinquency, our task “is to review the record to determine ‘whether legally competent evidence exists therein to support the findings made by the Family Court trial justice.’” In re Miguel A., 990 A.2d 1216, 1220 (R.I. 2010) (quoting In re Andrey G., 796 A.2d 452, 456 (R.I. 2002)). In passing on the sufficiency of the evidence, “the relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979); cf. In re Miguel A., 990 A.2d at 1223 (reciting a similar standard for this Court’s review of a motion for a judgment of acquittal).', 'Analysis', 'Sufficiency of Evidence on Sexual Penetration', 'The respondent argues that the evidence in this case, which establishes, at most, that Kevin and Henry each inserted his penis “in” and “inside” respondent’s “butt,” is insufficient to establish sexual penetration—an essential element of the offense of first-degree child molestation. We agree.', 'Section 11-37-8.1 provides that “[a] person is guilty of first[-]degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual penetration with a person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” (Emphasis added.) In turn, § 11-37-1(8) defines the term “[s]exual penetration” as follows:', '“‘Sexual penetration’ means sexual intercourse,', 'cunnilingus, fellatio, and anal intercourse, or any other intrusion,', 'however slight, by any part of a person’s body or by any object', 'into the genital or anal openings of another person’s body, or the', 'victim’s own body upon the accused’s instruction, but emission of', 'semen is not required.”', '-6- This case requires us to decide whether testimony that Kevin’s and Henry’s penises were “inside of [respondent’s] butt” is sufficient to establish “anal intercourse[] or any other intrusion, however slight, by any part of a person’s body or by an object into the * * * anal opening[] of another person’s body * * *.” Id. We unanimously hold that this evidence is not sufficient.', 'Although the focus below and in the briefs on appeal was whether the evidence was sufficient to establish an “intrusion, however slight, * * * into the * * * anal opening[],” § 11-37- 1(8), the state contended at oral argument that what transpired during the sleepover qualifies as “anal intercourse” as that term is used in the statute. We reject this assertion. The terms “sexual intercourse” and “anal intercourse” are not defined in § 11-37-1. Dictionaries typically provide a primary definition of “sexual intercourse” that involves the penetration of the vagina by the penis.6 See, e.g., Mosby’s Medical, Nursing, and Allied Health Dictionary 276, 1075 (3d ed. 1990) (Mosby’s) (defining “sexual intercourse” and “coitus” as “the sexual union of two people of opposite sex in which the penis is introduced into the vagina”); Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary 1074 (10th ed. 1997) (Merriam-Webster’s) (defining “sexual intercourse” as “heterosexual intercourse involving penetration of the vagina by the penis”). Although the parties have not cited, and we have not found, a dictionary definition of the term “anal intercourse,” we are persuaded that that term, like sexual intercourse, involves penetration by the penis. Therefore, the term “anal intercourse” means penetration of the anal opening by a penis. See State v. DeLeonardo, 340 S.E.2d 350, 353 (N.C. 1986) (“Anal intercourse requires penetration of the anal opening of the victim by the penis of the male.”); 70C Am. Jur. 2d 6', 'When confronted with an undefined term contained in G.L. 1956 § 11-37-1(8), we turn to dictionary definitions for that term. See, e.g., In re Ryan B., 739 A.2d 232, 235 n.2 (R.I. 1999) (consulting dictionary definition for term “fellatio”); State v. Beaulieu, 674 A.2d 377, 378 (R.I. 1996) (same for term “cunnilingus”).', '-7- Sodomy § 3 at 644 (2011) (“One act that is almost universally prohibited by sodomy statutes is anal intercourse, which requires the penetration of the anal opening of the victim by the penis of a male.”); cf. State v. Bryant, 670 A.2d 776, 778, 783 (R.I. 1996) (referring to “count 3[, which charged ‘anal intercourse,’] where anal penetration by the penis was charged and found to have occurred”).', 'Thus, if the twins’ testimony established only an intrusion into the area between respondent’s buttocks and not an intrusion into respondent’s anal opening, such an intrusion does not constitute anal intercourse. See State v. Gallagher, 668 A.2d 55, 61 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1995) (“While insertion of the penis between the left and right buttocks may be sufficient to prove sexual contact in that there is a touching of the victim’s intimate part, it is not sufficient to prove anal intercourse.”). The precise issue we must decide, then, is whether the testimony of each twin that his penis went “in” and “inside” respondent’s “butt” is sufficient to qualify as an intrusion into the anal opening.', 'The word “butt” in the context in which it was used by Kevin and Henry is slang for buttocks. See 1 J.E. Lighter, Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang 333 (1994); Richard A. Spears, NTC’s Dictionary of American Slang and Colloquial Expressions 61 (3d ed. 2000); Kenneth G. Wilson, The Columbia Guide to Standard American English 82 (1993); see also Merriam-Webster’s, at 155. The buttocks are defined as “[t]he prominence formed by the gluteal muscles of either side.” Stedman’s Medical Dictionary 283 (28th ed. 2006) (Stedman’s); see also Dorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary 248 (27th ed. 1988) (defining “buttock” as “one of the gluteal prominences; called also clunis or breech and, in the plural, nates”); Mosby’s, at 795 (defining “nates” and “buttocks” as “the large fleshy protuberances at the lower posterior portion of the torso comprising fat and the gluteal', '-8- muscles”). The anus or anal orifice, by contrast, is defined as “[t]he lower opening of the digestive tract. It is associated with the anal sphincter and lies in the cleft between the buttocks, through which fecal matter is extruded.” Stedman’s, at 114. “The words [buttocks and anus] are not synonyms as they describe entirely different parts of the anatomy.” Downey v. State, 726 N.E.2d 794, 797 (Ind. Ct. App. 2000).', 'When enacting the chapter of our general laws relating to sexual assault, the General Assembly drew a distinction between the buttocks and the anus.', 'The term “sexual penetration”—an essential element of first-degree sexual assault, see § 11-37-2, and first-degree child molestation, see § 11-37-8.1—is defined to include intrusions into the “anal opening[].” Section 11-37-1(8). By contrast, the offenses of second-degree sexual assault and second-degree child molestation require “sexual contact.” Section 11-37-4; § 11-37-8.3. Sexual contact is defined as “the intentional touching of the victim’s or accused’s intimate parts, clothed or unclothed, if that intentional touching can be reasonably construed as intended by the accused to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.” Section 11-37-1(7). In turn, the phrase “[i]ntimate parts” is defined as “the genital or anal areas, groin, inner thigh, or buttock of any person or the breast of a female.” Section 11-37-1(3) (emphases added). It is clear from this carefully constructed statutory framework that the General Assembly appreciated the distinction between the buttocks and the anus or anal opening.', 'This Court’s decision in State v. McDonald, 602 A.2d 923 (R.I. 1992), is instructive. In that case, the defendant was charged with first-degree sexual assault arising from digital penetration of the complainant’s vagina. Id. at 924, 925. The complainant testified that the defendant “touched her ‘in the vagina.’” Id. at 924. She also testified that the defendant had “touched her ‘in the breasts.’” Id. at 925. We held that this evidence was insufficient to', '-9- establish sexual penetration. Id. In so holding, we explained that, “in respect to such a serious allegation [as digital vaginal penetration], precise and specific testimony is necessary to support it” and that “[t]o infer penetration from [the complainant’s] testimony would be to draw an inference that could scarcely justify a finding of digital penetration beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id.', 'In this case, the necessary precise and specific testimony was lacking. The twins’ use of the term “butt” rendered their testimony too imprecise and vague on the pertinent question of whether sexual penetration occurred in this case: that is, whether there was an intrusion, however slight, into respondent’s anal opening. In reaching this conclusion, we necessarily reject the trial justice’s reasoning that “[i]n or inside the butt is certainly where the anal opening is located.” This circumstance is beside the point. To sustain a prosecution for first-degree child molestation, the state had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that sexual penetration—an intrusion into an anal opening in the circumstances of this case—occurred. By eliciting only testimony about an intrusion into respondent’s “butt,” the state failed to carry its burden.', 'An intrusion into the space between a person’s buttocks, while perhaps a necessary step on the path to intrusion of the anal opening, is not, in itself, an intrusion into the anal opening. See Downey, 726 N.E.2d at 798 (“Despite their proximity, the buttocks and anus are not the same, and an inference that contact with the buttocks necessarily includes contact with the anus[7] cannot be made beyond a reasonable doubt in this case.”).', 'Although we reaffirm today that “precise and specific testimony is necessary to support” a prosecution for first-degree sexual assault or first-degree child molestation, McDonald, 602 7', 'Unlike Rhode Island’s first-degree child molestation statute, which requires an intrusion, however slight, into the anal opening, the statute in Downey v.

When the prosecutor asked Henry “what * * * part of [the] body” the “butt” was used for, Henry provided no response.

Malouin, 433 A.2d 176, 178 (R.I. 1981) (“[S]econd-degree sexual assault is necessarily a lesser- included offense of first-degree sexual assault.”). The element that differentiates the greater offense from the lesser-included offense is the type of touching that occurs; first-degree child molestation requires sexual penetration, while the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation requires only sexual contact. See § 11-37-8.1; § 11-37-8.3; see also Malouin, 433 A.2d at 178.10', 'This jurisdiction follows the common-law rule that, when the state charges an accused with an offense that has a lesser-included offense, the accused is on notice that “an accusation of the greater crime carries with it the charge that he [or she] has committed all the necessarily 10', 'At oral argument, respondent contended that second-degree child molestation is not a lesser- included offense of first-degree child molestation because the second-degree offense requires proof of an element not required for conviction or adjudication on the first-degree offense: that the “intentional touching can be reasonably construed as intended by the accused to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.” Section 11-37-1(7).

The General Assembly has codified this rule in G.L. 1956 § 12-17-14, which provides that:', '“Whenever any person is tried upon an indictment, information, or', 'complaint and the court or jury, as the case may be, shall not be', 'satisfied that he or she is guilty of the whole offense, but shall be', 'satisfied that he or she is guilty of so much of the offense as shall', 'substantially amount to an offense of a lower nature, or that the', 'defendant did not complete the offense charged, but that he or she', 'was guilty only of an attempt to commit the same offense, the', 'court or jury may find him or her guilty of the lower offense or', 'guilty of an attempt to commit the offense, as the case may be, and', 'the court shall proceed to sentence the person for the offense of', 'which he or she shall be so found guilty, notwithstanding that the', 'court had not otherwise jurisdiction of the offense.” Additionally, as we explained in Silvia, this rule applies to sexual-assault offenses:', '“[W]hen ‘[a]ny person who is indicted for * * * first * * * degree', 'child molestation * * * upon trial the jury [or trial justice] acquits', 'that person of any of the charges of sexual assault and finds him or', 'her guilty of any of the other [lesser-included] offenses [including', 'second[-]degree child molestation], judgment and sentence may be', 'entered against him or her accordingly.’” Silvia, 798 A.2d at 424', '(quoting § 11-37-9).', 'Therefore, in this case, each count of the petition charging respondent with first-degree child molestation necessarily included a charge on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation.11', 'See Walsh, 113 R.I. at 122, 318 A.2d at 466.', 'Similarly, in finding 11', 'For this reason, the dissent’s position that our disposition of this case “is grossly unfair to this respondent” and that “the unsuspecting respondent has been waylaid by the sua sponte decision of this Court” rings hollow. Irrespective of whether the lesser-included offense was addressed by the parties or the trial justice, the above-cited statutes, as a matter of law, placed respondent on notice that he was charged with first-degree child molestation as well as all of that crime’s lesser-included offenses; such is the case in every criminal trial. See State v. Walsh, 113 R.I. 118, 122-23, 318 A.2d 463, 466 (1974) (“[General Laws 1956] § 12-17-14 is but a reaffirmation of the common[-]law rule that where an indictment charges an offense which includes within it another lesser offense, it is sufficient to prove so much of the charge as demonstrates that the accused is guilty of a crime therein contained, although not to the full extent charged against', '- 14 - respondent delinquent on the greater offense, the trial justice necessarily found that all of the elements of the lesser-included offense had been met. In fact, it was respondent who argued that the state was required to prove that he acted with the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification, and the trial justice complied, finding beyond a reasonable doubt that respondent acted with such intent.12 On appeal, respondent argues that there was insufficient evidence to support this finding. We reject this contention.', 'In State v. Erminelli, 991 A.2d 1064 (R.I. 2010), we held that evidence that the defendant “intentionally touched [the complainant’s] naked buttocks with his penis” was sufficient to sustain a conviction for second-degree child molestation because “[s]uch contact ‘can be reasonably construed as intended by [the defendant] to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault.’” Id. at 1070 (quoting § 11-37-1(7)). Similarly, in this case, there is sufficient evidence that the contact between respondent’s “butt” and the twins’ penises can be reasonably construed as intended by respondent to be for the purpose of sexual arousal or gratification. The trial justice found that respondent, by asking the twins to penetrate his “butt” with their penises and by voluntarily engaging in the act of contact between his intimate parts and those of Kevin and Henry, acted “for the sole and exclusive purpose of sexual gratification or arousal.” She further noted that respondent’s expressed desire to switch roles with Kevin and him. * * * Consequently, a defendant is charged with the knowledge that an accusation of the greater crime carries with it the charge that he has committed all the necessarily included lesser offenses that make up the greater crime. He will not be heard to complain that he is not prepared to defend against the lesser offenses or that the statute authorizing the return of a guilty verdict on the lesser offenses deprives him of his constitutional right to a presentment on indictment relative to the ‘infamous crime’ which the jury believes he has committed.”). 12', 'The dissent characterizes the trial justice’s action in this regard as “mention[ing], almost as an aside, that the element of sexual gratification was present.” In our opinion, this is not accurate. In the course of three paragraphs of her bench decision, the trial justice explained that she was “convinced” that respondent acted “for the sole and exclusive purpose of sexual gratification or arousal” and that “[t]here was no other reason or purpose” for respondent’s conduct.', '- 15 - Henry and put his penis on or in their intimate parts was further evidence of his purpose in engaging in this conduct.', 'Moreover, the twins’ mother testified that Kevin told her that respondent “look[ed] like he enjoyed it.” After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the contact between respondent and the twins can be reasonably construed as intended by respondent to be for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or assault. See Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319.', 'Contrary to respondent’s suggestion, the mere fact that he characterized the exchange as an “experiment” does not foreclose this conclusion. Cf. State v. Rossi, 520 A.2d 582, 583, 584 (R.I. 1987) (rejecting sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge in second-degree child molestation case where the defendant argued that the purpose of the contact between his penis and the minor complainant’s vaginal area was to rehearse the minor’s testimony that she was molested by the defendant’s landlord, a story that was concocted by the defendant to combat a rent increase imposed by the landlord; the Court explained that, when “view[ing] the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences therefrom, one can reasonably infer from this record that when [the defendant] was ‘contacting’ the eight-year-old after removing all her clothing, other things were on his mind than attempting to gain revenge on his landlord for increasing the rent”). The evidence was sufficient on this element.', 'When, as in this case, this Court determines on appeal that the evidence adduced at a bench trial was insufficient only on the element that differentiates the greater offense from the lesser-included offense, such that a conviction or adjudication on the greater offense cannot be upheld, we have directed the entry of judgment on the lesser-included offense. See State v. Eiseman, 461 A.2d 369, 383-84 (R.I. 1983), abrogated in part on other grounds by Horton v.', '- 16 - California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990).13', 'Therefore, we remand this matter to Family Court with directions to enter an adjudication of delinquency on the lesser-included offense of second- degree child molestation and for resentencing.', 'Although the dissent suggests that we are “significantly departing from our well-settled law,” our remand in this case follows from a straightforward application of the law of lesser- included offenses. On the way to adjudging the respondent delinquent on the greater offense, the trial justice necessarily adjudged him delinquent on the lesser-included offense. See Douglas v. Jacquez, 626 F.3d 501, 506 (9th Cir. 2010) (“[The defendant] was convicted of the greater offense [of arson of an inhabited structure]. On the way to finding him guilty of arson of an inhabited structure, the [factfinder] had necessarily found adequate proof that [the defendant] committed [the lesser-included offense,] arson of a structure. * * * In this circumstance, the prosecution necessarily already proved the elements of a lesser-included offense.”). Therefore, that the respondent has not conceded culpability and the evidence is not uncontroverted on appeal is entirely beside the point. As a matter of law, the respondent has been adjudged delinquent on the lesser-included offense because the trial justice’s adjudication of delinquency on the greater offense necessarily included an adjudication of delinquency on the lesser-included offense. There is no way to avoid this conclusion. 13', 'The dissent points out that §§ 12-17-14 and 11-37-9 refer only to the trial court’s authority to find a defendant guilty on a lesser-included offense. This is true, because criminal cases arise in the trial court, but it is beside the point in this case. We cite these statutes merely to establish that respondent was, as a matter of law, on notice of the lesser-included offense. Our authority to remand for entry of judgment of conviction or adjudication on a lesser-included offense does not depend on an express grant of such power by the General Assembly. To the contrary, as we explained in State v. Eiseman, 461 A.2d 369 (R.I. 1983), “[s]tate and federal appellate courts have long exercised the power to reverse a conviction while at the same time ordering the entry of judgment on a lesser-included offense.” Id. at 384 (quoting Dickenson v. Israel, 482 F. Supp. 1223, 1225 (E.D. Wis. 1980)).', '- 17 -', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated above, we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the Family Court’s adjudications of delinquency on the two charges of first-degree child molestation.', 'Accordingly, we remand this case to Family Court with directions to enter adjudications of delinquency on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation and for resentencing.', 'Justice Flaherty with whom Justice Robinson joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part. We concur with the majority’s well-reasoned and articulate conclusion that there was insufficient evidence at trial of penetration to sustain a finding of delinquency by reason of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. However, we depart from the majority when it concludes that this case should be remanded to the Family Court for entry of judgment of adjudication of delinquency by reason of second-degree child molestation sexual assault (second-degree child molestation), a lesser-included offense.', 'It is our opinion that this Court’s ruling is grossly unfair to this respondent because, in the Family Court, this case was tried solely as a case of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. There was no argument by either party that the trial justice should make a finding of second- degree child molestation if she found insufficient evidence of first-degree child molestation. Although the trial justice did mention, almost as an aside, that the element of sexual gratification was present, that was neither necessary for her finding of first-degree child molestation nor was it an essential part of her decision. When the case was appealed to this Court, neither party briefed nor argued that the respondent could be adjudicated as delinquent because he committed an act of second-degree child molestation. Indeed, on appeal, the state’s sole argument was that', '- 18 - the evidence was sufficient to prove penile penetration to support an adjudication of delinquency on first-degree child molestation. As a result, the unsuspecting respondent has been waylaid by the sua sponte decision of this Court.', 'We agree with the majority that second-degree child molestation is a lesser-included offense of first-degree child molestation. See State v. Silvia, 798 A.2d 419, 424-25 (R.I. 2002); State v. Malouin, 433 A.2d 176, 178 (R.I. 1981). However, it is our opinion that that does not provide an adequate basis for allowing this respondent to be subjected to further proceedings. In each case decided by this Court involving the interplay between greater and lesser-included offenses, the controversy has been initiated in the trial court, either because a trial justice refused to charge or decide on a lesser-included offense or because, over the defendant’s objection, the trial justice actually did so. See Silvia, 798 A.2d at 424 (citing G.L. 1956 § 11-37-9 on joinder of offenses for the trial court’s authority to enter judgment on lesser-included offenses). We are aware of no case in which this Court, on its own initiative and without argument of the parties or a decision in a trial court, remanded for entry of judgment on a lesser-included offense after vacating a conviction based on insufficient evidence.', 'The majority cites two statutes, G.L. 1956 § 12-17-14 and § 11-37-9, to support its reasoning that respondent was on notice of all lesser-included offenses. Section 12-17-14 says,', '“[w]henever any person is tried upon an indictment, information,', 'or complaint and the court or jury, as the case may be, shall not be', 'satisfied that he or she is guilty of the whole offense, * * * the', 'court or jury may find him or her guilty of the lower offense or', 'guilty of an attempt to commit the offense, as the case may be, and', 'the court shall proceed to sentence the person for the offense', '* * *.” In adopting this language, the General Assembly was clearly referring to the trial court, not this Court. Similarly, § 11-37-9 provides that, “If upon trial the jury shall acquit the person of any of', '- 19 - the charges of sexual assault and shall find him or her guilty of any of the other offenses, judgment and sentence may be entered against him or her accordingly.” The wording of this statute, likewise, can lead to no rational conclusion other than that the General Assembly was referring to the trial court and only the trial court. Although we do not disagree with the majority that respondent was on notice when he went to trial that he could be found delinquent on any lesser-included offense, that fact does nothing to support the majority’s disposition in this matter.', 'Rather, the majority claims to derive authority for directing entry of delinquency on the lesser-included offense from this Court’s decision in State v. Eiseman, 461 A.2d 369, 384 (R.I. 1983), abrogated in part on other grounds by Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990). In Eiseman, the defendant was charged with possession with intent to deliver cocaine. Id. at 372. After a justice of the Superior Court denied his motion in limine to suppress the cocaine, the defendant conceded during a bench trial that the quantity of cocaine found in his possession was wholly consistent with personal use, but argued that it was not sufficient to support a conviction for possession with intent to deliver. Id. Nonetheless, the trial justice found the defendant guilty of the greater offense. Id.', 'On appeal, this Court agreed with the defendant. Eiseman, 461 A.2d at 383. Having arrived at that conclusion, the Court then found itself in a quandary about how to resolve the case. Id. at 383-84. We observed that, “in a jury trial of a charge of possession with intent to deliver, the trial justice would instruct the jury on the elements of the lesser offense,” and that it could find him guilty of that lesser charge. Id. at 384. This Court further noted that “[c]learly, this alternative was available to the trial justice in this case if he had determined, as he should have, that the state had failed to prove intent to deliver * * *.”', 'Id.', 'This Court then acknowledged that “[s]tate and federal appellate courts have long exercised the power to reverse', '- 20 - a conviction while at the same time ordering the entry of judgment on a lesser-included offense.” Id. (quoting Dickenson v. Israel, 482 F.Supp. 1223, 1225 (E.D. Wis. 1980)). But, noting that our Court had “never availed itself of the opportunity to adopt this practice,” it nonetheless determined that it would employ it in Eiseman because the evidence of guilt was overwhelming, because the defendant had conceded at trial and on appeal that the state had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he indeed possessed cocaine, and that, as a result, there would be no prejudice to the defendant if this Court simply ordered the Superior Court to enter judgment on the lesser-included offense. Id. Therefore, the Court concluded “that a reduction of [the] defendant’s conviction to the lesser-included offense * * * would serve the interests of justice and would not prejudice [the] defendant since the sufficiency of evidence on this charge is uncontroverted on appeal.” Id.', 'The rationale employed in Eiseman is singular in our jurisprudential history and it simply is not appropriate for the case before us at present.', 'Here, respondent has not conceded culpability, the evidence is not uncontroverted on appeal, and respondent would be manifestly prejudiced on remand. The majority here is significantly departing from our well-settled law and embracing what it maintains is the rationale of Eiseman in ordering the entry of judgment on a lesser-included offense. It has done this despite the fact that the Eiseman Court specifically explained that the Court had never before adopted such a practice. We have been unable to find any other case in which we employed that approach after doing so in Eiseman. Furthermore, it is significant that, in each of the cases cited in Eiseman as examples of appellate courts exercising the power to modify a judgment, none of those courts wielded that power sua sponte, as the majority does here. See United States v. Swiderski, 548 F.2d 445, 452 (2nd Cir. 1977) (case had been tried twice and government argued that the appellate court should enter judgment on lesser-', '- 21 - included offense); Austin v. United States, 382 F.2d 129, 140, 142-43 (D.C. Cir. 1967) (federal statute conferred power to modify judgments only where no prejudice results to the defendant; court found that the defendant had a full and fair adjudication on all elements of the lesser- included offense and based his defense on insanity, which the jury clearly rejected); State v. Grant, 411 A.2d 917, 920 n.6 (Conn. 1979) (noting that the jury was instructed on both burglary in the first degree and the lesser-included offense of burglary in the third degree); Miller v. State, 426 A.2d 842, 844 (Del. 1981) (the defendant specifically requested instruction on lesser- included offense of second-degree arson and was denied by the trial judge); State v. Smith, 603 P.2d 638, 642 (Kan. Ct. App. 1979) (lesser-included offense of possession is not contested); People v. Monaco, 197 N.E.2d 532, 534 (N.Y. 1964) (the defendant argued on appeal that the most the facts could support was the lesser-included offense of manslaughter in the first degree).', 'Thus, by remanding for entry of judgment, the majority’s decision greatly expands the holding enunciated by this Court in Eiseman. As a result, it is our firm opinion that a remand to the trial court for entry of judgment on second-degree child molestation unfairly prejudices the respondent.', 'For these reasons, we respectfully dissent from the opinion of the majority.

In her statement to the police, Lisa explained that she had “been friends with Devina since the both of [them] attended middle school together.” She further stated that “Devina lives on Anthony St[reet] * * * in a white house.” According to Lisa’s statement, on the evening of the incident, defendant invited her into his home and then attempted to have sex with her.', 'On August 15, 2008, defendant also made a statement to the East Providence police, in which he confirmed that Lisa had visited his home and admitted to touching Lisa on her hip, buttocks, and breasts. The defendant claimed, however, that Lisa came to his house looking for a sexual adventure. He stated that she told him that “she was eighteen years old and that she wanted to have some fun. She told me that she wanted to fool around.” On November 18, 2008, the state filed an information charging defendant with one count of second-degree sexual assault. 4', 'Immediately before the case opened to a jury on the morning of Tuesday, June 7, 2011, defense counsel made two motions concerning a new statement allegedly made by Lisa. Defense counsel explained to the trial justice that, based upon the discovery materials that the state had previously provided, counsel had expected Lisa to testify that she went to defendant’s house on 3', 'To avoid confusion, we refer to Ms. Rolle by her first name. We intend no disrespect. 4', 'Under G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4, a person is guilty of second-degree sexual assault if he or she uses force or coercion to engage in sexual contact with another person.', '-2- August 6, 2008 to visit her friend Devina, who she believed resided with defendant.', 'In anticipation of this testimony, defense counsel had caused Devina to be flown in from her current residence in the state of Georgia to testify at trial that she had not resided in Rhode Island since 2007 and that she and Lisa had never been friends. Defense counsel then learned during a discussion that took place in chambers on the previous morning that Lisa was now expected to testify that she went to defendant’s house on the evening of the incident because she had heard that Devina was visiting from out of town. Defense counsel requested that the new statement be excluded or that the state provide her with additional information about the circumstances surrounding Lisa’s decision to alter her statement. Specifically, counsel asked the prosecutor to disclose when he had learned that Lisa was changing her statement; who was present when the new statement was made; and who and/or what had prompted the change.', 'In response to defense counsel’s motions, the prosecutor informed the trial justice that he and a victims’ services advocate had met with Lisa on Friday, June 3, 2011 at the Attorney General’s offices. The prosecutor explained that he was only recently assigned to the case. After the prosecutor concluded his response, defense counsel requested that the prosecutor also disclose when and from whom Lisa had allegedly heard that Devina was visiting from out of town. The prosecutor did not offer any additional information at that time. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion to exclude the new statement but reserved ruling on the request for supplemental discovery.', 'When the trial commenced, the state presented Lisa as its first witness. During direct examination, the prosecutor questioned Lisa about why she went to defendant’s home on the night of the incident. Lisa explained that she had “heard that Devina was in town so [she] decided to see if [Devina] was there and say hi.” She could not remember who informed her that', '-3- Devina was visiting from out of town but averred that she was aware in 2008 that Devina was living in Georgia.', 'Thereafter, on cross-examination, defense counsel showed Lisa a copy of her statement from August 7, 2008 and pointed out that nowhere in the statement did it indicate that she had heard that Devina was visiting from out of town. Lisa answered, “I told the police that. They probably didn’t write it down[.]”', 'At one point during cross-examination, the court recessed and defense counsel renewed her earlier motion for supplemental discovery. Defense counsel argued that, in order for her to effectively cross-examine Lisa, the state needed to disclose all of the circumstances surrounding Lisa’s new statement, including everyone who was present at the meeting, if there were any notes from the meeting, and if Devina’s testimony was discussed. The trial justice denied the motion, reasoning that the information that the state had provided earlier that morning was sufficient. After the jury returned, cross-examination concluded and the state completed redirect examination of Lisa.', 'When recross-examination began, defense counsel asked Lisa to review a portion of her statement from August 7, 2008. Lisa responded, “Before I read this, we revised this at my attorney’s office. We went over it and we highlighted the parts that weren’t accurate and I put in the rest of the information.” Lisa then revealed that her father had also been present during her meeting with the prosecutor on Friday, June 3. Lisa indicated that her father had made some handwritten additions to her statement. Defense counsel asked Lisa if the prosecutor had spoken with her on Friday about Devina’s expected testimony. Lisa explained that, during the meeting, she had spoken on the telephone with another prosecutor who had previously worked on her case. According to Lisa, the other prosecutor had informed her that Devina would be coming', '-4- from Georgia to Rhode Island to testify. She admitted that the other prosecutor specifically questioned her about why she went to defendant’s house on August 6, 2008 if Devina had already moved to Georgia at that time. Lisa insisted, however, that the Friday meeting was not the first time that she had mentioned hearing that Devina was visiting from out of town. She maintained that she had given this information to the police when she first met with them the day after the incident.', 'The trial justice then allowed the prosecutor to conduct further redirect examination, during which the prosecutor had the following exchange with Lisa:', '“[Prosecutor]: * * * you made—actually, you didn’t make the', 'marks on the statement, right, your father did?', '“[Lisa]: Yes.', '“[Prosecutor]: All right. And I left the room?', '“[Lisa]: Yes.', '“[Prosecutor]: And I said, ‘Read this over, tell me if you got any', 'changes’; right?', '“[Lisa]: Correct.', '“[Defense Counsel]: Objection, Judge, leading.', '“The Court: Sustained.', '“[Prosecutor]: I’m just trying to—okay.', 'If I could have this', 'marked for identification, please.” At that point, the prosecutor produced a highlighted and annotated copy of Lisa’s August 7, 2008 statement, prompting defense counsel to request a sidebar.', 'At the sidebar, defense counsel told the trial justice that she had never seen the document that the prosecutor was attempting to introduce. She emphasized that the information that the prosecutor was now using to lead the witness on re-redirect examination was exactly the kind of', '-5- information she had repeatedly asked him to disclose in her requests for supplemental discovery. In response, the prosecutor asserted that the document was the same statement that Lisa had given to the police on August 7, 2008 but with some inconsequential additions. He explained that he was “concerned about * * * the impression that I am hiding something in front of this jury. Now, what I would like to do is move this statement as a full exhibit because I have * * * absolutely nothing to hide.”', 'The trial justice allowed the document to be marked for identification but refused to allow the document to be admitted as a full exhibit. After the sidebar, the state presented one more witness before resting.', 'When the trial continued the following morning, defendant moved for a mistrial. In ruling on defendant’s motion, the trial justice found that the prosecutor’s failure to turn over the revised statement to defense counsel was a violation of Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice then went on to consider whether the discovery violation required him to grant a mistrial. According to the trial justice, the undisclosed information was central to defendant’s case since its disclosure likely would have prompted defense counsel to adopt a different trial strategy. He emphasized that had the state been more forthcoming when defendant first requested the information, the nondisclosure could have been rectified by granting a continuance. The trial justice ultimately concluded that the only available remedy at that point in the proceedings was to declare a mistrial. Accordingly, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion for a mistrial.', 'The defendant thereafter moved to dismiss the sexual-assault charge on double jeopardy grounds. At a hearing on defendant’s motion on August 5, 2011, defense counsel argued that the prosecutor’s attempt to submit the revised version of Lisa’s statement into evidence was a deliberate effort to goad defendant into moving to pass the case. She emphasized that she had', '-6- repeatedly requested that the prosecutor disclose the circumstances under which Lisa changed her statement at the June 3 meeting. It was only after Lisa had unexpectedly revealed some of those circumstances on recross-examination that the prosecutor produced the revised statement. According to defense counsel, the momentum of the trial had swung in defendant’s favor after recross-examination because the jury had begun to suspect that Lisa had altered her statement after learning of Devina’s expected testimony.', 'Defense counsel suggested that, as an experienced attorney for the state, the prosecutor knew that producing the revised statement could save his unraveling case by prompting defendant to request a mistrial.', 'In response, the prosecutor insisted that he did not turn over the revised statement because he did not believe the statement contained any “significant impeachment evidence.” According to the prosecutor, the granting of the mistrial did not provide him with any tactical advantage since he had successfully completed his case-in-chief.', 'In a bench decision rendered that same day, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion to dismiss. He explained that a mistrial granted at defendant’s behest will only bar a retrial if the prosecutor engaged in extreme misconduct intended to goad defendant into moving to pass the case. The trial justice ultimately concluded that the prosecutor in Rolle’s case did not have the specific intent to provoke Rolle into requesting a mistrial. In reaching this conclusion, the trial justice rejected defense counsel’s suggestion that the prosecutor had attempted to abort an unraveling case. He reasoned that the prosecutor was “more overzealous than Machiavellian,” since the withholding of the revised statement appeared to be no more than a good-faith error in judgment. 5 An order denying defendant’s motion to dismiss entered on June 12, 2012. 5', 'The trial justice ordered the Attorney General’s office to reimburse the Public Defender’s office for the cost of flying Devina Rolle from Georgia to Rhode Island to testify at trial.', '-7-', 'The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal on August 18, 2011. 6 On September 24, 2013, defendant filed a motion to hold this appeal in abeyance because state’s exhibit No. 5 for identification, Lisa’s revised statement, had been irretrievably lost. The defendant argued that, without a copy of the revised statement, retrial would be impossible because he would be unable to adequately cross-examine his accuser. He therefore requested that this Court remand the matter for the limited purpose of allowing him to file another motion to dismiss in Superior Court. In an order entered on November 14, 2013, this Court denied Rolle’s motion.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In instances “where a defendant has moved for a mistrial and asserts on appeal that double jeopardy bars his retrial because of prosecutorial goading, we defer to the trial court’s findings of fact.” State v. O’Connor, 936 A.2d 216, 220 (R.I. 2007). “Whether prosecutorial misconduct was intended to goad the defendant into seeking a mistrial is a question of fact for the trial [justice] to decide.” State v. Hull, 754 A.2d 84, 87 (R.I. 2000). On appeal, we “will not disturb the trial [justice]’s finding on that factual issue if it is supported by competent evidence.” O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 220.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'At the threshold, we address defendant’s suggestion that we need not reach the merits of this appeal. The defendant argues that, even if we conclude that double jeopardy does not preclude retrial, the loss of state’s exhibit No. 5 for identification makes retrial impossible. 6', 'Even though a final order did not enter until nearly ten months after defendant filed his notice of appeal, we consider defendant’s premature notice of appeal timely. See Curtis v. State, 996 A.2d 601, 603 n.3 (R.I. 2010) (“premature notice of appeal [is] timely as long as a final judgment is entered thereafter”).', '-8- According to defendant, his Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine his accuser will be compromised if he must retry the case without a copy of the revised statement. At this time, we are not convinced that retrial is impossible. We hold out hope that the exhibit may yet be located. In the event it is not, the possibility of a retrial in its absence is a question more appropriately answered, in the first instance, by the trial justice. We will therefore go on to address whether double jeopardy prohibits retrying defendant on the sexual-assault charge.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to dismiss the charge on double jeopardy grounds. In particular, he ascribes error to the trial justice’s conclusion that the prosecutor lacked the specific intent to provoke a mistrial.', 'The prohibitions on double jeopardy contained in the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions ordinarily do not prevent the retrial of a criminal defendant when a mistrial has been granted at the defendant’s behest. 7 State v. Casas, 792 A.2d 737, 739 (R.I. 2002). There is an exception, however, for instances where a prosecutor has engaged in extreme misconduct intended to provoke the defendant into moving to pass the case. Id. This exception is a narrow one. See State v. Beltre, 764 A.2d 190, 191 (R.I. 2000) (mem.). We have steadfastly adhered to the rule announced in Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 676 (1982), that a second trial is not forbidden unless the prosecutor’s conduct was specifically intended to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial. Casas, 792 A.2d at 739. “Mere prosecutorial error, therefore, although it may incite a mistrial, will not preclude retrial.” O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 222. In rejecting any attempt to broaden this exception, we have explained that the Kennedy rule strikes “a careful balance between the right of a defendant to obtain a completion of his trial by the first tribunal assembled * * * and the societal interest in apprehending and punishing those who are guilty of 7', 'Article 1, section 7 of the Rhode Island Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibit a defendant from twice being put in jeopardy for the same offense.', '-9- serious crimes.” State v. Diaz, 521 A.2d 129, 133 (R.I. 1987); see Casas, 792 A.2d at 740; State v. McIntyre, 671 A.2d 806, 807 (R.I. 1996).', 'To infer the existence or nonexistence of intentional goading, the trial justice examines the objective facts and circumstances surrounding the prosecutor’s misconduct. O’Connor, 936 A.2d at 223 n.6. Some of those relevant facts and circumstances include the timing of the misconduct, the experience of the prosecutor, and whether there was a legitimate reason for the misconduct. See, e.g., Casas, 792 A.2d at 740; Hull, 754 A.2d at 87; McIntyre, 671 A.2d at 807.', 'According to defendant, the objective facts and circumstances in this case compel the conclusion that the prosecutor’s production of the revised statement was intended to provoke a mistrial. He relies heavily upon the prosecutor’s experience and the timing of the misconduct, arguing that the prosecutor did not reveal the revised statement until after his case had begun to unravel.', 'The defendant is correct that one of the evils that the Kennedy rule seeks to guard against is “an unscrupulous prosecutor, faced with a rapidly derailing trial, conceivably * * * seek[ing] a premature end of the proceedings in hope of returning another day.” Casas, 792 A.2d at 740; see also State v. Perez, 605 A.2d 1305, 1309 (R.I. 1992) (Retrial is prohibited when a prosecutor has engaged in “bad-faith conduct designed to afford the prosecution a more favorable opportunity to convict the defendant.”) (quoting State v. Gordon, 508 A.2d 1339, 1345 (R.I. 1986)). After carefully reviewing the record, however, we agree with the trial justice’s conclusion that no such evil was present in this case.', 'Here, the trial justice specifically took into consideration the prosecutor’s experience and the fact that the prosecutor’s attempt to introduce the revised statement came deep into the state’s case. Notwithstanding these facts, he concluded that “it does not follow that [the prosecutor’s]', '- 10 - misconduct was [the] voluntary derailing of a trial going badly.” In reaching this conclusion, the trial justice acknowledged that “cross-examination * * * might have been considered a setback for the prosecution” but indicated that he “was not convinced that the [s]tate was by any means on the verge of losing this case.”', 'Although defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s finding that the prosecutor’s case was not progressing badly, we conclude that this finding is amply supported by competent evidence of record. In finding that the state was not on the brink of losing the case, the trial justice characterized Lisa as a convincing and consistent witness for the state. Since we are “relegated to reading from a ‘lifeless record,’ [we] justifiably defer to trial justices who experience firsthand the delivery and demeanor of a witness’s testimony.” State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 366 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Guerrero, 996 A.2d 86, 90 (R.I. 2010)). At trial, Lisa repeatedly insisted that when she made her initial statement to the police, she mentioned hearing that Devina was visiting from out of town and speculated that the police officer had accidentally omitted that fact from the typed statement. We cannot fault the trial justice for crediting this testimony.', 'The defendant also quarrels with the trial justice’s conclusion that the prosecutor’s misconduct was the result of a good-faith error in judgment. He asserts that the prosecutor’s repeated failure to disclose the circumstances of the June 3 meeting is highly suggestive of bad faith. Again, our review of the record convinces us that the trial justice appropriately considered this factor and made a well-supported finding.', 'The trial justice admonished the prosecutor for not being more forthcoming about the June 3 meeting and warned that he would not tolerate “trial[] by ambush.” He ultimately found, however, that the prosecutor’s withholding of the revised statement was an error of judgment.', '- 11 - The prosecutor explained that he believed—albeit erroneously—that he was not obligated under Rule 16 to turn over the revised statement to defense counsel because he deemed the changes to the statement to be largely inconsequential. If the prosecutor did not believe that his initial decision to withhold the document was a discovery violation, it is unlikely that he would believe that his later decision to produce the document would be grounds for a mistrial. In fact, the prosecutor offered a legitimate explanation for producing the statement. When he submitted the document into evidence, he explained that he wished to correct any impression the jurors might have that he was concealing the circumstances surrounding Lisa’s changed statement. We are cognizant of the fact that the prosecutor’s own lack of openness created the unfavorable impression that he was attempting to dispel. Nonetheless, it appears that the prosecutor was not seeking a more favorable opportunity to try his case in front of a new jury, but rather was seeking to redeem himself in the eyes of the original jurors. The trial justice correctly concluded that such overzealousness was grounds for a mistrial but would not preclude retrial.', 'After considering all of the defendant’s arguments, we are satisfied that the trial justice performed a balanced and conscientious analysis of the objective facts and circumstances in this case. We conclude that there was sufficient evidence of record to support the trial justice’s finding that those objective facts did not give rise to an inference of intentional goading. Accordingly, we uphold the trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s motion to dismiss the charge.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.

This case came before the Supreme Court on April 3, 2012, on appeal from a Superior Court judgment of conviction after a jury verdict finding the defendant, Kayborn Brown (defendant or Brown), guilty of first-degree robbery. Brown was sentenced to forty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with fifteen years to serve and twenty-five years suspended, with probation. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice (1) erred in denying his motion to suppress the out-of-court identification based on a photographic array he contends was unduly suggestive; and (2) abused his discretion under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence by denying the defendant‟s motion in limine to exclude evidence of a fraudulent charge to the complainant‟s credit card that occurred shortly after the robbery. We affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On the afternoon of June 26, 2008, James Torres (complainant or Torres) was beaten and robbed by two men as he walked home from the Providence campus of Community College of Rhode Island, where Torres was a student and employee. On October 24, 2008, a grand jury', '-1- returned an indictment charging defendant and his brother, Keishon Brown (Keishon), with first- degree robbery in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a).', 'In September and October 2009, defendant and Keishon were tried together before a jury. Before trial, the trial justice entertained two preliminary motions filed by defendant, and it is those rulings that form the basis of defendant‟s appellate arguments.', 'At trial, Torres testified that as he was walking home from campus around 4 p.m. on the afternoon of the robbery, he noticed two men across the street. Torres described the men: “[o]ne was about five ten, he was wearing a black hoodie, had braids [and] dark skin [and the] second one was wearing a yellow shirt, was also dark skinned and was wearing a wave, a nylon cap.” The two men crossed the street and approached Torres—inquiring about the time. Torres testified that in order to answer that question, he took out his cellular phone and the man in the black hoodie demanded that Torres relinquish the phone to him. When Torres refused, the man produced a firearm, held the gun to Torres‟s head, and ordered him to turn over the phone. When Torres—who testified that he was frozen with fear—made no response, the man with the gun bashed him over the head with the weapon, and then both men proceeded to “pummel[]” him. As the onslaught continued, Torres attempted to shield himself from the blows. The assailants forced him to the ground, continuously stomping and kicking him in the head until he was bleeding. When Torres finally was able to break free, he fled the scene. Torres testified that he had his MP3 player and phone in his hand as he ran away, and his backpack was still in place; his wallet, however, was missing from the pocket of his pants.', 'Torres testified that as he ran home, he encountered several youths in his neighborhood who inquired about what had happened. When Torres told them that he had been “mugged” and beaten, the youths responded, “Oh, it must have been Comstock boys” or “C-block.” Torres', '-2- proceeded home, and the police were called. He was taken to the hospital and treated for injuries to his shoulders, arm, and head. From the hospital, Torres contacted his credit card company in order to cancel his card and inquire about whether any charges had been made. Torres was informed that a charge for $102 had been made to T-Mobile—a wireless telephone service provider; Torres reported the charge as fraudulent.1', 'At trial, Torres identified defendant and his brother as the two men who robbed and beat him. The record also disclosed that Torres had made an out-of-court identification of defendant from a photographic array shown to him at the Providence Police Department six days after the robbery. Torres identified defendant as the man with the gun and recalled that he “recognized him instantly” when shown the array.2', 'Providence Police Detective Robert DeCarlo (Det. DeCarlo), who investigated the robbery, testified that he had compiled the photographic array based on Torres‟s description of his attackers as “two dark-skinned males * * *, one wearing a yellow shirt, one wearing a black hoodie.” He further testified that Torres identified defendant‟s picture from the array “[r]ight away, [with] no hesitation.”', 'Ronald Witt (Witt), the keeper of the records for T-Mobile, also testified at trial. Witt stated that a credit card, which evidence revealed was issued to James Torres, was used at 5:12 p.m.—approximately an hour after the robbery—to make a payment of $102.36 to a T-Mobile cellular telephone account in the name of Dechana Vicoria. The T-Mobile records indicated that Dechana Vicoria resided at 100 Daboll Street in Providence—a short distance from the scene of the robbery—and that the account holder had a birthdate of August 6, 1973. 1', 'Torres testified that he did not make any charges to his credit card on the day of the robbery and that he did not have a T-Mobile account. 2', 'Torres also later identified Keishon from another photographic array.', '-3- Evidence introduced at trial showed that defendant‟s mother, Charlotte Brown, had the same address and birthdate as that of the T-Mobile account holder. According to the police database, defendant and his brother also resided at 100 Daboll Street in Providence, which was described as a multiunit tenement dwelling.', 'After the close of evidence, the jury returned a verdict finding defendant guilty but acquitting Keishon.3 The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial justice denied. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'Standard of Review', 'A trial justice‟s decision denying a motion to suppress an identification will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is deemed to be clearly erroneous. State v. Texter, 923 A.2d 568, 573 (R.I. 2007). In determining whether the trial justice‟s decision was clearly erroneous, this Court must “assess the available evidence in the light most favorable to the state.” Id. (citing State v. Luciano, 739 A.2d 222, 226 (R.I. 1999)).', 'Furthermore, it “is well settled that we review a trial justice‟s decision admitting or excluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.” State v.

This Court will not reverse a trial justice‟s ruling admitting evidence over a Rule 403 objection unless it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion. See State v.

The defendant sought to exclude this evidence, contending that the photographic array from which Torres identified defendant was unduly suggestive. Specifically, defendant asserted that of the six photographs in the array, only two depicted “dark-skinned black males” and, consequently, only two of the six pictures matched Torres‟s description of his attackers. The defendant further averred that the improperly suggestive out-of-court identification tainted Torres‟s in-court identification of defendant to the extent that the trial justice also should have suppressed the in-court identification. See State v. Holland, 430 A.2d 1263, 1269 (R.I. 1981) (noting that improper pretrial identification procedures may taint a subsequent in-court identification).', 'When faced with determining whether an identification procedure was improper, a trial justice must perform a two-step analysis. Texter, 923 A.2d at 573-74 (citing Luciano, 739 A.2d at 226; State v. Mastracchio, 612 A.2d 698, 704 (R.I. 1992)). The trial justice first must “consider whether the procedure used in the identification was unnecessarily suggestive.” Id. at 574 (citing Luciano, 739 A.2d at 226; Mastracchio, 612 A.2d at 704). Only if the trial justice answers that first question in the affirmative does he or she proceed to the second step― determining “whether in the totality of the circumstances the identification was nonetheless reliable.” Id. (quoting Luciano, 739 A.2d at 226).', 'Before ruling on defendant‟s motion to suppress the out-of-court identification, the trial justice heard testimony from Det. DeCarlo, who testified that several days after the robbery, Torres gave a statement to the police in which he described his attackers. In that statement, Torres described one perpetrator―defendant―as being around twenty years old, “five foot ten,', '-5- wearing a black hoodie, a dark-skinned male with a thin build;” the second he described as being a “dark-skinned male, around 20 years old, five ten, chunky, wearing a yellow shirt and black pants.” Detective DeCarlo also testified that a police incident report was generated on the day of the robbery and recorded Torres‟s description of the perpetrators as “two black males.”', 'Detective DeCarlo explained that the police compiled the photographic array based on Torres‟s description of the suspects and the fact that the police believed that the suspects were likely from the Comstock or Congress Avenue area of the city, based on the statements made to Torres by the youths he encountered after the robbery. On cross-examination, Det. DeCarlo testified that although the average person may consider only two of the photographs in the array to depict dark-skinned black males, it was his opinion that “there could be three, four, five or six” in the array. Torres also testified at the suppression hearing and stated that he would classify four of the photographs as depicting dark-skinned black males. He also testified that he independently identified defendant from the array, without any suggestion from the police.', 'At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial justice denied the motion to suppress. He recounted the eyewitness identification procedures the police followed when showing the photographic array to Torres, and determined that the identification was conducted in a non- suggestive manner. Additionally, the trial justice underscored the fact that Torres identified defendant “right away,” when shown the photographs. The trial justice noted that the pictures in the array were selected based upon Torres‟s description of the suspects and “seemed to me to be an attempt to try to pick out people who were similar in looks, complexion and facial structure.” Accordingly, the trial justice ruled that the array was not unduly suggestive.', 'We discern no error in the decision of the trial justice. “In determining whether the photographic array poses a substantial risk of misidentification, we must „compare the physical', '-6- characteristics of each individual featured in the display to the general description of the suspect given to the police by the victim.‟” State v. Gatone, 698 A.2d 230, 235 (R.I. 1997) (quoting State v. Barnes, 559 A.2d 136, 140 (R.I. 1989)). We accord great weight to the finding by the trial justice that the pictures in the array featured men who were similar in appearance and consistent with Torres‟s description of his assailants. This Court is not persuaded by defendant‟s argument that the array was unnecessarily suggestive because, defendant contends, only two dark-skinned black males were featured. We note at the outset that the record does not disclose that Torres described the assailants to the police as “dark-skinned black males.”4 Additionally, it is a matter of opinion how many African-American males with dark complexions were depicted in the array; Torres testified that in his opinion, up to four men fit that description, and the trial justice opined that as many as five men in the array could be characterized as dark-skinned black males.', 'Consequently, we affirm the trial justice‟s denial of defendant‟s motion to suppress the out-of-court identification.', 'Accordingly, once a finding is made that the “out-of-court identification is not impermissibly suggestive, then the in-court identification is likewise proper.” Id. at 236 (citing State v. Gardiner, 636 A.2d 710, 716 (R.I. 1994); Mastracchio, 612 A.2d at 706). We are satisfied, therefore, that defendant‟s contention that Torres‟s in-court identification of defendant was improperly tainted is without merit.', 'We now consider the subject of defendant‟s second assertion of error: the trial justice‟s decision to allow into evidence business records showing payment made to a T-Mobile account in the name of Dechana Vicoria and charged to Torres‟s credit card. The defendant argues that 4', 'The record reveals that Torres described his assailants as “black males” in his initial police report and as “dark-skinned” males in a subsequent statement to the police, but never as dark- skinned black males. We are of the opinion that the police cannot be faulted for compiling a photographic array containing a smaller ratio of dark-skinned black males when the complainant did not describe his assailants as such.', '-7- the evidence was irrelevant and highly misleading because the state never established that “Dechana Vicoria” was a fictitious name or that defendant had any connection with the T-Mobile account holder who shared his address, his mother‟s address, and his m other‟s date of birth— similarities that defendant argues could be mere coincidences. Accordingly, defendant avers that the trial justice abused his discretion by denying defendant‟s motion in limine because the evidence was only marginally relevant and highly prejudicial. We disagree.', 'Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence broadly defines relevant evidence as “evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Rule 403 provides for a balancing test by which a trial justice determines whether relevant evidence should nonetheless be excluded. Rule 403 states that relevant evidence “may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” It is a well-settled principle of our law that “the discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be exercised sparingly.” Shelton, 990 A.2d at 202 (quoting State v. Hak, 963 A.2d 921, 928 (R.I. 2009)).', 'Before Witt testified about the T-Mobile business records, the trial justice conducted a voir dire examination and heard argument from counsel regarding defendant‟s motion in limine to exclude the evidence.5 At the conclusion of arguments, the trial justice determined that:', '“the State has presented evidence that would show that these', 'defendants had some linkage with 100 Daboll Street. * * * Now,', 'add to that the fact that the person named on the account happens 5', 'The trial justice had deferred definitively ruling on defendant‟s pretrial motion in limine pending a determination of whether the state would call a representative from T-Mobile to testify and to provide a foundation for the admission of T-Mobile‟s business records.', '-8-', 'to have the same date of birth as the defendants‟ mother, certainly,', 'to me is enough to present a situation where a reasonable inference', 'could be drawn that these defendants were involved somehow in', 'the use of this credit card for the benefit of someone at that', 'address.”', 'We are not persuaded that the trial justice‟s decision to admit this evidence was an abuse of discretion. The fact that Torres‟s credit card was used approximately an hour after he was robbed and beaten by a man he identified as defendant—who lived at the address listed on the T-Mobile account—and the fact that the fraudulent charge benefitted a woman with the same address and date of birth as defendant‟s mother, constitute relevant evidence tending to show that defendant was involved in the robbery.', 'The trial justice astutely observed the multiple connections between defendant and the T-Mobile account holder—which was circumstantial evidence connecting defendant to the crime.', 'However, it was within the purview of the jury to determine what, if any, inferences to draw from the myriad of similarities between the named account holder and the defendant‟s mother.', 'The defendant was free to argue to the jury that the T-Mobile records were not probative evidence against him, and in fact he did so.6 The defendant‟s argument that the state failed to establish a sufficient nexus between the defendant and the fraudulent charge made on Torres‟s credit card is a matter that goes to the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. See Beaton v. Malouin, 845 A.2d 298, 302 (R.I. 2004) (noting that the fact that an opinion is based on a number of assumptions is a factor that goes to the weight of the evidence, and not its 6', 'Counsel for defendant argued in his closing statement that there was no evidence that defendant had taken Torres‟s wallet, and that the wallet simply could have been lost when Torres ran from his assailants.

55,Javier Merida : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,reversal,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. In this appeal, we review the denial of an application for postconviction relief. Javier Merida (Merida or applicant) was convicted of two counts of first-degree child molestation and one count of second-degree child molestation. We affirmed those convictions in his direct appeal. See State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 240 (R.I. 2008). Merida then applied for postconviction relief, arguing that he was deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel. Merida’s application for postconviction relief was denied. The applicant sought review by this Court, and both parties appeared pursuant to an order directing them to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be decided summarily. We are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we affirm the denial of the application for postconviction relief.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This Court thoroughly recounted the facts as borne out by the trial testimony in our consideration of applicant’s direct appeal. See Merida, 960 A.2d at 230-34. Therefore, we only recount facts salient to this appeal and other facts as necessary for context.', '-1-', 'During the May 2006 trial, the complainant, Betsy, 1 testified that Merida—her paternal grandfather—repeatedly molested her when she was between the ages of seven and ten years. Merida, 960 A.2d at 230-31. She testified that the molestations occurred during weekends spent with her paternal grandparents, but when her paternal grandmother was not home. Id. at 231. Specifically, Betsy testified to one instance of breast grabbing, one instance of digital-vaginal penetration, and three instances of vaginal intercourse; however, the testimony of a third instance of vaginal intercourse was unexpected. Id.', 'Merida’s niece by marriage, Lisa, also testified at trial. Merida, 960 A.2d at 233. Lisa testified that, when she was five to ten years old, Merida molested her when she was alone with him. Id. The trial justice permitted this testimony over objection by trial counsel, who argued that the evidence should have been excluded under Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. Merida, 960 A.2d at 232. Although Lisa was the first witness to testify for the state, Merida’s trial counsel did not object to the order in which the state presented the witnesses. Id. at 233.', 'Ultimately, the jury convicted Merida of two counts of first-degree child molestation and one count of second-degree child molestation; Merida was acquitted of a third count of first- degree child molestation. We affirmed his convictions on his direct appeal. Merida, 960 A.2d at 240.

The trial justice found that applicant failed to establish that trial counsel’s performance was deficient, and she therefore denied the application.', 'Standard of Review', '“The statutory remedy of postconviction relief set forth in G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1 is ‘available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant’s constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interest of justice.’” Hall v. State, 60 A.3d 928, 931 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Sosa v. State, 949 A.2d 1014, 1016 (R.I. 2008)). “When passing on an application for postconviction relief, this Court accords great deference to the factual determinations of the Superior Court hearing justice.” Neufville v. State, 13 A.3d 607, 610 (R.I. 2011) (citing Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 313 (R.I. 2009)). Accordingly, this Court “will uphold a postconviction relief decision absent clear error or a determination that the hearing justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence.” Rodrigues, 985 A.2d at 313. However, “[w]hen a postconviction relief decision involves ‘questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights[,]’ we review those issues de novo.” Neufville, 13 A.3d at 610 (quoting Hazard v. State, 968 A.2d 886, 891 (R.I. 2009)). “[F]indings of historical fact, and inferences drawn from those facts, will still be accorded great deference by this Court, even when a de novo standard is applied to the issues 2', 'The application for postconviction relief was heard together with a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence.

State, 935 A.2d 82, 85 (R.I. 2007)).', 'This Court evaluates a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the criteria set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Linde v. State, 78 A.3d 738, 745 (R.I. 2013). “First, the applicant must establish that counsel’s performance was constitutionally deficient; [t]his requires [a] showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed * * * by the Sixth Amendment.” Linde, 78 A.3d at 745 (quoting Bido v. State, 56 A.3d 104, 110-11 (R.I. 2012)). This review is highly deferential, and we afford counsel “a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the permissible range of assistance.” Id. (quoting Bido, 56 A.3d at 111). “Only if it is determined that trial counsel’s performance was constitutionally deficient does the Court proceed to the second prong of the Strickland test, in which the applicant must show that the ‘deficient performance was so prejudicial to the defense and the errors were so serious as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.’” Id. at 745-46 (quoting Guerrero v.

In applicant’s direct appeal, we held that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in admitting Lisa’s testimony. See State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 239 (R.I. 2008). Accordingly, the doctrine of res judicata bars the relitigation of this issue, despite appellate counsel’s attempt to breathe', '-4-', 'The applicant contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to investigate, call witnesses, or properly cross-examine witnesses about the complainant’s motive to lie. This argument focuses on allegations of tension that existed between Betsy’s maternal grandmother, Donna, and the Merida family that arose at the time the complainant was born. According to trial counsel, the defense’s theory at trial was that her grandmother pressured Betsy into making the allegations against Merida. Although trial counsel acknowledged that he was aware of the animosity between the families at the time of Betsy’s birth, he contends that the Merida family never told him “why [Donna] wanted to see Javier Merida prosecuted for child molestation.”', 'The applicant testified at the hearing and averred that he provided trial counsel with the details of an ongoing inter-familial conflict—in particular, issues regarding Betsy’s custody, changing her last name, and changing her health insurance—and that he asked trial counsel to hire an investigator to explore the family dynamics. Trial counsel, however, testified that he did not recall any discussion with the Merida family about changes to Betsy’s custody, last name, or health insurance. The trial justice found trial counsel’s version of the discussions with his client to be “highly credible” and based on both his memory and his detailed notes. Conversely, she found that Merida’s version lacked credibility. Accordingly, the trial justice was satisfied that trial counsel adequately explored any motives Betsy may have had to fabricate her testimony.', 'Before this Court, applicant asserts that trial counsel’s actions were not a “reasonable exercise of strategy.” However, this argument is largely predicated upon Merida’s version of events, which the trial justice found to be not credible. This Court defers to a trial justice’s findings on credibility.', 'See Doctor v. State, 865 A.2d 1064, 1068 n.5 (R.I. 2005) (“[I]n new life into it. See Taylor v. Wall, 821 A.2d 685, 688 (R.I. 2003) (“Res judicata bars the relitigation of any issue that could have been litigated in a prior proceeding, including a direct appeal, that resulted in a final judgment between the same parties, or those in privity with them.”).', '-5- reviewing an application for postconviction relief, we defer to the trial justice’s findings on credibility unless clearly wrong.”). Accepting trial counsel’s version—that he did not know the specifics of the ongoing animosity between the families—we agree with the trial justice that it was reasonable for trial counsel to not pursue it any further. See Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 17 n.11 (R.I. 2012) (“We note that ‘[o]n review of an application for post-conviction relief we are bound by the trial justice’s determination concerning credibility.’”) (quoting State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1273 (R.I. 1980)). An attorney cannot pursue a potential defense if he or she is unaware of the specifics of that defense. Furthermore, the record discloses that trial counsel examined Betsy for any potential influence by Donna, and he argued that issue to the jury. Therefore, trial counsel was not constitutionally deficient with respect to the complainant’s motive to lie.', 'The applicant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to present a medical expert to rebut the testimony of Dr. Christine Barron (Dr. Barron). Doctor Barron examined Betsy after she disclosed Merida’s abuse. Testifying during the state’s case-in-chief, Dr. Barron testified that the results of Betsy’s examination were normal. When asked whether a normal examination may nonetheless be consistent with allegations of vaginal penetration, Dr. Barron stated that “[a] normal examination neither rules out nor confirms the possibility of sexual abuse or prior penetration.”', 'The applicant attempts to assign constitutional deficiency to his trial counsel’s failure to call a medical expert to rebut Dr. Barron’s opinion. However, there was nothing for applicant to rebut. Doctor Barron’s conclusion was equivocal: her testimony did not indicate that Betsy was sexually abused (much less, sexually abused by Merida). Furthermore, trial counsel did engage an expert, Dr. Patricia Crane (Dr. Crane), to review the records of Betsy’s examination.', '-6- Although the record discloses that Dr. Crane requested additional information and trial counsel did not comply with that request, her evaluation of the medical records she did review similarly was equivocal. She stated that (1) “Any expert, defense or prosecution[,] would have to say that there is always the possibility of no physical injuries”; (2) the hymen “may remain with smooth retracted edges after digital penetration”; (3) “No one would be able to say for sure if the notch is related to a past tear in the tissue or if it is a normal variation”; and (4) “With no definitive clinical findings, as in this case, there is no way to say for sure who did what [and] when, unless the child has a sexually transmitted disease.” (Emphases added.) Thus, Dr. Crane’s opinion was consistent with Dr. Barron’s opinion. Because Dr. Barron’s conclusion was equivocal and because the expert advice that trial counsel received did not contradict it, trial counsel’s performance was not constitutionally deficient based on his decision to not present a medical expert to testify.', 'See Linde, 78 A.3d at 745 (noting strong presumption that counsel’s performance was in the permissible range of assistance).', 'Finally, regarding the medical testimony, applicant asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for his failure to request a continuance to review an article referenced by Dr. Barron during her testimony.', 'Trial counsel testified that it would have prolonged Dr. Barron’s testimony and would have had little impact in light of her previously stated medical opinion. The trial justice agreed and found trial counsel’s decision to be a reasonable strategic decision. We are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in concluding that this was a reasonable tactical decision, particularly in light of the fact that Dr. Barron’s testimony on the issue was equivocal.', 'The applicant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he prevented applicant from testifying in his own defense. Merida did not testify at trial, but his version of the events leading to this decision varied greatly from that of counsel. Trial counsel testified that he', '-7- discussed the pros and cons of testifying with his client. In fact, he conducted a mock exercise consisting of both direct and cross-examination with Merida and told him that it went well. However, after the conclusion of the state’s case, trial counsel testified that he recommended Merida not testify because trial counsel thought he had established a reasonable doubt defense, and, if Merida testified, the case would turn into a credibility contest for the jury, and not whether there was reasonable doubt. Trial counsel testified that he thought a great deal about this recommendation and consulted another veteran defense attorney regarding this decision. Trial counsel testified that he did not recall Merida telling him that he wanted to take the stand; he testified that Merida concurred with his recommendation. Merida, on the other hand, testified that trial counsel knew that he wanted to testify, and that Merida left the mock examination session with the impression that he would testify the next day. According to Merida, he was surprised when trial counsel did not call him to testify.', 'The trial justice found trial counsel’s testimony on this issue more credible than applicant’s testimony. Furthermore, the Court found that Merida and trial counsel discussed the issue and that Merida “knowingly and voluntarily accepted [trial counsel’s] recommendation that he not testify.” We defer to the trial justice’s ruling on this point. See Doctor, 865 A.2d at 1067. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice’s finding—that it was a reasonable strategic decision for trial counsel to recommend that Merida not testify—also is supported by the evidence and is not clearly wrong. See id.', 'The applicant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to properly cross-examine Lisa and neglected to object to the state’s order of proof at trial. The indictment against Merida charged him with abusing both Betsy and Lisa; the first trial ended in a mistrial because Lisa did not appear to testify, and the charges against Merida pertaining to', '-8- Lisa’s allegations were dismissed. The applicant contends that trial counsel was deficient by not examining Lisa about her failure to appear at the first trial. Trial counsel, however, testified that he did not do so because it would highlight to the jury that a grand jury had indicted Merida on separate counts concerning Lisa as well as Betsy and that information could result in prejudice to Merida. Regarding his failure to object to the order of witnesses, trial counsel testified that he considered the order of proof to be immaterial because he had solid grounds for effective cross- examination of Lisa. The trial justice found this decision to be a reasonable and strategic one. Clearly, vigorous examination of Lisa, another putative victim, was a risky undertaking, and reference to an additional indictment would have exacerbated the impact of Lisa’s testimony. Because trial counsel believed that he had better cross-examination material against Lisa and that the order in which the evidence was presented was of no moment, his decision not to object to the order of witnesses was a reasonable tactical decision.', 'Finally, the applicant stated in his initial Rule 12A statement that he wished to assert seven additional grounds for postconviction relief on appeal that were raised below and articulated in an exhibit attached to his memorandum. Although these issues were raised in the Superior Court, they were not argued in any detail nor were they addressed by the trial justice. Additionally, the Rule 12A statements themselves contain no argument on these issues. Therefore, these issues are waived.4 Kaveny v.

56,State : v. : Adrian Shepard.,reversal,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Adrian Shepard, by way of a petition for writ of certiorari, seeks review of a Superior Court judgment declaring him to be in violation of the terms of his probation and revoking three years of an eight-year suspended sentence. He also appeals from a Superior Court order denying his motion to correct and reconsider his sentence. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this petition and appeal should not summarily be decided. After reviewing the record and considering the parties’ written and oral submissions, we are satisfied that the issues may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm both the judgment and order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On May 6, 2004, defendant pled nolo contendere to one count of conspiracy to commit a felony, for which he was sentenced to ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), consisting of two years to serve and eight years suspended, with probation (the 2003 case). On', '-1- April 5, 2006, defendant was found to have violated the terms of his probation, resulting in the revocation of ten months of his suspended sentence. 1', 'The defendant’s second sojourn in prison failed to achieve rehabilitation because defendant again was arrested and charged with possession of cocaine with intent to deliver (the 2007 case). He eventually pled nolo contendere to an amended charge of possession of cocaine and was sentenced to eight years at the ACI, with twenty months to serve and seventy-six months suspended, with probation. 2 Upon his release from the ACI, defendant was arrested yet again, this time for an alleged domestic assault upon Deanna Monroe, the mother of his son. 3 As a result of this incident, defendant was presented as a violator of his probation in both the 2003 and 2007 cases.', 'On June 9, 2009, defendant’s violation hearing was held in the Superior Court. The state presented two witnesses: Detective Sarkis Zeitountzian of the Providence Police Department and Ms. Monroe, the complaining witness. Detective Zeitountzian testified that on March 14, 2009, he responded to Women and Infants Hospital to meet with the victim of an alleged sexual assault. At the hospital, he introduced himself to Ms. Monroe, the alleged victim, whom he described as having a “black eye under her left eye,” which was “clearly bruised.” He estimated that this injury was two to three days old.', 'Ms. Monroe testified about two particular incidents involving defendant.', 'The first occurred on March 11, 2009, when defendant arrived at her residence while she was taking a shower. She testified that defendant walked into the bathroom and threatened her, saying, “I’ll 1', 'The remaining eighty-six months of the eight-year sentence remained suspended, with probation. 2', 'As will be discussed in footnote 4, infra, the eight-year sentence exceeded the maximum permissible penalty for a possession conviction. 3', 'A criminal complaint for domestic assault also was filed against defendant in District Court.', '-2- leave you dead in the shower.” Ms. Monroe said she had confronted him earlier in the day about his relationship with her cousin. According to Ms. Monroe, when she got out of the shower defendant asked her “to do a sexual favor for him,” which she refused. They then started “tussling,” which she described as defendant trying to hold her down as she attempted to push him off. She further testified that she “finally just stopped resisting and * * * let him have sex with [her].” Ms. Monroe stated that she suffered a black eye in this scuffle. Ms. Monroe also described a second incident on the following evening at the same residence. She testified that she resisted as defendant tried to touch her “private areas” and have sex with her.', 'Two days later, Ms. Monroe called the police to report these two incidents. She testified that a police officer came to her residence, took pictures of her eye and brought her to the emergency room, where she later met with and gave a statement to Det. Zeitountzian. Ms. Monroe further acknowledged that on March 16, 2009, while in the presence of defendant, she called the police to modify her statement. During that call, she told Sergeant Marandi “that the violence did happen but the sexual assault didn’t happen.” She testified that she made this telephone call and partially recanted her original statement because defendant had told her that he would “kill [her] before he [went] to jail for rape.” Ms. Monroe swore that her testimony at the violation hearing was true and that her recantation was a lie.', 'The defendant presented no witnesses, but introduced into evidence two police reports and a tape recording of a phone conversation between Ms. Monroe and defendant. The hearing justice summarized the contents of the recording as follows:', '“The tape of the conversation between the complaining', 'witness and the defendant shortly after these incidents was played', 'for the [c]ourt, and in that tape, it seems clear that there was', 'reference to the complaining witness saying to the defendant that', 'she wanted to keep the relationship together for the benefit of the', '-3-', 'child and that if she had to, she could testify against him to get him', 'in jail to keep him away from the cousin.”', 'In his closing argument, defendant characterized Ms. Monroe’s testimony as “completely unreliable.” According to defendant, Ms. Monroe falsely accused him of sexually assaulting her because she was angry that he was dating her cousin.', 'The most telling evidence of her mendacity, he suggested, was the tape recording in which she is purported to have said that “if she had to put him in jail to keep him away from ‘that bitch’ then that is ‘what the fuck she was going to do.’”', 'In his bench decision, the hearing justice explained that “cases like this are never clear cut and that’s the reason why the [c]ourt, ultimately, has to make determinations as to credibility.” He acknowledged that Ms. Monroe “had some inconsistencies in her testimony,” but he concluded that he was “confident, after hearing her testify, that the thrust of her testimony [was] accurate.” Ultimately, the hearing justice found that defendant did violate his probation in relation to this incident:', '“So, while there are some inconsistencies in [the', 'complaining witness’s] testimony, the thrust of it is believable and', 'I accept it. And, I think as a result of that, enough has been shown', 'to me that he was assaultive on the night in question, that there was', 'a battery resulting in the injury that was described by the police', 'officer, and because he did not keep the peace and was not of good', 'behavior, I believe the State has proven this to the Court to a', 'reasonable satisfaction and I find that he is in clear violation of the', 'probation that he is on.”', 'Consequently, the hearing justice revoked three years from the remaining eighty-six- month suspended sentence in the 2003 case.

Several months thereafter, defendant filed a motion to correct and reconsider the sentence he received for violating his probation. In this motion, defendant requested that the “drastic remedy of imposing three years to serve in prison” be reconsidered under Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure and that the hearing justice order his release from custody.', 'At the hearing on defendant’s motion, defendant acknowledged that because the hearing justice had not revoked any portion of his suspended sentence in the recently corrected 2007 case, the three-year sentence imposed was not an illegal sentence. 5 He still wished to be heard on his motion to reconsider, however, arguing that the hearing justice should reconsider the three-year prison sentence in light of the dismissal of the underlying domestic assault charge. The hearing justice allowed defendant to proceed on the motion. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing justice noted that a subsequent dismissal of the underlying charges upon which a violation is predicated does not require the violation adjudication to be vacated.

With respect to the second incident, the hearing justice found that Ms. Monroe was in fear of defendant as the result of the “same kind of tussle.” Thus, he opined that the first incident could constitute an assault and battery and the later incident an assault.

The defendant was convicted of possession of a controlled substance; possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime of violence; carrying a firearm without a license; breaking and entering a dwelling without consent; and conspiracy to commit the crime of breaking and entering.

From the second floor Weston asked if she could help; the men responded that they were looking for the “gentleman on the first floor.” Weston informed the strangers that the first-floor tenant—whom she identified at trial as “Troy Grant” or “Troy Tunstall”—was not home. She then overheard the men discuss “jimmying the lock” and watched as they attempted to gain entrance by manipulating the lock of the front door. After this attempt proved unsuccessful, the men walked around to the back and peered into the first-floor apartment windows. The men began talking to each other, and Weston testified that “they mentioned what they were going to do and then proceeded to do that.” Specifically, Weston overheard one of the men say “go pop the front lock” as the other man thereafter pushed open the window to the first-floor apartment; he entered through the window, and Weston called 9-1-1 to report a break-in. The man who entered through the window opened the front door for the other man.

The defendant was acquitted of the remaining charges. Thereafter, defendant moved for a new trial and for a judgment of acquittal as to count 9, breaking and entering, and count 10, conspiracy to commit breaking and entering.

Day, 925 A.2d 962, 975 (R.I. 2007)). The essence of a criminal conspiracy is the agreement to commit an unlawful act. The evidence presented may be solely circumstantial such that it may be “inferentially established by proof of the relations, conduct, circumstances, and actions of the parties.” State v. Disla, 874 A.2d 190, 197 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Lassiter, 836 A.2d at 1104).', 'When passing upon a motion for judgment of acquittal, in accordance with Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, the trial justice is required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, according “full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and draw[ing] therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” State v. Fleck, 81 A.3d 1129, 1133 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Cardin, 987 A.2d 248, 250 (R.I. 2010)).', 'At trial, the state presented Weston, the second-floor neighbor and eyewitness to the crimes, as well as the two police officers who apprehended defendant. After Weston informed the suspects that the first-floor tenant was not at home, she overheard defendant and his counterpart discuss entering the apartment by “jimmying the lock” to the first door and watched as they attempted to manipulate the lock. Weston testified that, when their efforts proved unsuccessful, the men then went around to the back of the house and she overheard one man direct the other to “go pop the lock.” She also watched as they opened a window and one of the men climbed through the window and opened the front door for his counterpart. Additional evidence presented at trial established that the police officers discovered defendant in the first-', '-5- floor apartment hiding in the dark under a table with a firearm in his immediate vicinity. This testimony, when viewed in the light most favorable to the state, is sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant, and his unidentified counterpart, conspired to unlawfully enter the apartment. The state presented a witness who overheard the suspects discuss their plans. We are therefore satisfied that the statements overheard by the second-floor tenant constitute direct evidence of the conspiracy. Nothing more is required.', 'The defendant also attacks the conviction on the ground that the state did not identify defendant’s co-conspirator.', 'However, we have recently held that there can be sufficient evidence to establish a conspiracy conviction despite the fact that the co-conspirators’ identities were unknown. See State v. Tully, 110 A.3d 1181, 1195 (R.I. 2015). Here, the record clearly reflects that defendant entered into an agreement with another person to unlawfully enter the apartment. They collectively agreed to disable the lock to the front door and attempted to do so. They were also observed opening a first-floor window in order to gain entrance. The fact that the co-conspirator was unidentified is of no moment to the sufficiency of the evidence in support of defendant’s conspiracy conviction.', 'The defendant further contends that the evidence to support a conspiracy charge was nothing more than a pyramiding of inferences that was based on speculation and conjecture. In a criminal prosecution, the state may seek to establish guilt “by a process of logical deduction, reasoning from an established circumstantial fact through a series of inferences to the ultimate conclusion of guilt.” State v. Vargas, 21 A.3d 347, 353 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Caruolo, 524 A.2d 575, 581-82 (R.I. 1987)).', 'However, inferences cannot be drawn from another inference that rests upon an ambiguous fact that is capable of supporting other reasonable inferences clearly inconsistent with guilt.

Shipyard Marina, Inc., 102 R.I. 366, 374, 230 A.2d 841, 845 (1967) (“an inference resting on an inference drawn from established facts must be rejected as being without probative force where the facts from which it is drawn are susceptible of another reasonable inference”); In re Derek, 448 A.2d 765, 768 (R.I. 1982) (holding that reasonable inferences cannot be drawn from conjecture or speculative evidence).', 'The defendant argues to this Court that a judgment of acquittal on the crime of conspiracy should have been granted because, he contends, “the state had to prove that [defendant] and another person had entered into an agreement to illegally break and enter the dwelling of another.” In a somewhat unorthodox approach to the crime of conspiracy, defendant posits that the state was required first to prove that the entry was unlawful and second, that the suspects, “knowing it was unlawful, agreed to enter the apartment anyway.” This contention is without merit. The crime of conspiracy consists of an agreement between “two or more persons to commit an unlawful act or perform a lawful act for an unlawful purpose.” Lassiter, 836 A.2d at 1104 (quoting State v. Mastracchio, 612 A.2d 698, 706 (R.I. 1992)). The crime is complete when the agreement is made. Conspiracy does not require an overt act or even an attempt to perform an act in furtherance of the agreement.', 'In the case at bar, abundant and direct evidence was introduced from which a factfinder could find—without drawing any inferences—that these suspects agreed to enter the dwelling. They were overheard discussing how to break in, and an eyewitness saw them enter the apartment through the window. To the extent that defendant challenges whether there was an ambiguous inference that the intruders knew that the entry was unlawful (that is, they entered without consent) this would constitute the only inference, drawn from the eyewitness testimony and “by proof of the relations, conduct, circumstances, and actions of the parties.” Lassiter, 836', '-7- A.2d at 1104 (quoting Mastracchio, 612 A.2d at 706). This inference obviously could be drawn from the direct evidence that defendant was located hiding in a dark kitchen, under the table, with a firearm. The defendant’s suggestion that the finding of guilt in this case was contingent upon a pyramiding of ambiguous inferences is not supported by the record or the law of conspiracy and is incorrect. Because this is not a case of one or more ambiguous inferences, we are satisfied that the trial justice was correct in denying the defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal as to count 10.', 'B', 'Count Nine-Breaking and Entering a Dwelling', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal as to count 9 because the state failed to prove that the defendant did not have consent to be in the apartment. In support of this contention, the defendant argues that there was a material variance between the pleadings and the evidence causing the jury to be misled at trial.

58,"I Facts1 and Travel Detective Brian Macera (Detective Macera) is a ten-year veteran of the Rhode Island State Police (RISP), and is currently assigned to the Computer Crimes Unit (CCU) and the Rhode Island Internet Crimes against Children (ICAC) Task Force. 2 Aff. at 3. Members of the CCU and ICAC Task Force engage in undercover investigation of computer-related crimes to identify criminals trading child pornography on the Internet using peer-to-peer networks. Id. 1 Pursuant to the applicable standard of review, the following facts are garnered from the Affidavit. State v. Byrne, 972 A.2d 633, 638 (R.I. 2009); State v. Verrecchia, 880 A.2d 89, 94 (R.I. 2005). 2 The ICAC Task Force is administered by the RISP and “supports a national network of multi- agency, multi-jurisdictional task forces engaged in investigations, forensic examinations, and prosecutions related to Internet crimes against children and technology-facilitated child sexual exploitation.” Id. Peer-to-peer networks facilitate the sharing of electronic files between participating members over the Internet. Id. To be a participating member, a computer user must install a file-sharing software and “sharing folder” in which files can be stored and shared with other participating members of the peer-to-peer network. Id. Members of the peer-to-peer network can search the network and download any shared file in that network. Id. at 3-4. Each file in the peer-to-peer network is attached to the Internet Protocol (IP) address3 of the computer that is sharing the file. Id. at 2. Further, each file in the peer-to-peer network is identifiable by a “hash” value, which is an “alpha-numeric string . . . that is calculated by applying a mathematical algorithm to the electronic data that is contained in the electronic file.” Id. Therefore, if an electronic file has identical content to another file, their hash values will also be identical. As a result, hash values are “commonly referred to as electronic fingerprints.” Id. Any changes to the content of an electronic file, no matter how slight, will change the file’s hash value. Id. Law enforcement, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), and the ICAC Task Force have identified certain hash values as confirmed child pornography. Id. In June 2015, Detective Macera was contacted by Detective Lieutenant Stephen Riccitelli—a detective in the North Smithfield Police Department and member of the ICAC Task Force—who informed him that the ICAC Task Force computer system had downloaded a file suspected to be child pornography from IP address 100.10.41.6.4 Id. at 5. Detective Macera 3 An IP address is a “unique routing number associated with a computer connected to the Internet which functions in the routing of data between source and destination. IP addresses are assigned to Internet service providers . . . who, in turn, assign them to customers for Internet access.” Id. 4 At the evidentiary hearing, Detective Macera explained that the ICAC Task Force subscribes a system of computers to common peer-to-peer file sharing programs. These computers are programed to continuously look for child pornography files on the peer-to-peer network, and will download files from another participating member’s computer when such files contain certain hash values or descriptions that match child pornography. When an ICAC Task Force computer downloads a child pornography file from another computer, a member of the ICAC Task Force is 2 viewed the downloaded file and confirmed that it contained child pornography as defined in § 11-9-1.3 of Rhode Island’s General Laws. Id. Detective Macera described the file as follows: “File Name: Jamtien.mpeg Date/Time: June 15, 2015 at 11:42 PM (UTC) HASH Value: 2aad88e182cc9c66ccd7ba15aa186ecfac39f370 Description: This video file depicts a prepubescent female on the beach removing her bathing suit exposing her genitals.” Id. Detective Macera conducted a search of the American Registry of Internet Numbers (ARIN) and determined that IP address 100.10.41.6 was owned by Verizon Internet Services, 2701 South Johnson Street, San Angelo, Texas 76904 (Verizon). Id. Verizon was served with a subpoena, which directed it to provide to RISP the name, address, and telephone number of the subscriber of IP address 100.10.41.6. Id. Verizon identified the subscriber of the IP address 100.10.41.6 as Heather Reisner (Heather) of 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island. Id. Detective Macera searched law enforcement databases and confirmed that Heather resided at 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island 02893. Id. Although Heather’s driver’s license indicated that her address was 8 ½ Lachance Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island, she indicated in a previous communication with the West Warwick Police Department that her residence was 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island. Id. at 5-6. Detective Macera also confirmed with the United States Postal Service that Heather was receiving mail at 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island. Id. at 6. On several occasions in July 2015, Detective Macera set up surveillance at 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island and observed a female exiting the residence. Id. Detective Macera recognized the female exiting the house as Heather from her driver’s license photograph. Id. notified and the download is documented in a log file along with the IP address from which the child pornography file was downloaded. 3 On July 29, 2015, Detective Macera used the above information to apply for a search warrant (the Search Warrant) of 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island and requested that a member of the RISP CCU conduct an on- and off-site forensic review of seized evidence related to the possession and transfer of child pornography. On the same day, the Search Warrant was approved. Subsequently, on August 3, 2015, RISP executed the Search Warrant, seizing Defendant’s computer—a Mac Pro desktop (serial number WCAU40341527) (Defendant’s Computer). A police forensic examination of Defendant’s Computer revealed seven videos of child pornography. Based on this evidence, the RISP obtained an arrest warrant for Defendant, and Defendant was subsequently arrested. On December 24, 2015, the State filed a criminal information, charging Defendant with possession of child pornography, in violation of § 11-9-1.3(b)(2); and delivery or transfer of child pornography, in violation of § 11-9-1.3(b)(1). II Standard of Review “The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution, prohibits the issuance of a search warrant absent a showing of probable cause.” Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 94. “The United States Supreme Court has indicated that the existence of probable cause should be determined pursuant to a flexible ‘totality-of-the- circumstances analysis.’” Id. (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39 (1983)). The Supreme Court of the United States explained: “The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the ‘veracity’ and ‘basis of knowledge’ of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. And the duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a ‘substantial basis for . . . 4 conclud[ing]’ that probable cause existed.” Gates, 462 U.S. at 238-39. “In other words, the approach to the probable cause question should be pragmatic and flexible.” Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 94 (citing State v. Spaziano, 685 A.2d 1068, 1069 (R.I. 1996); State v. Correia, 707 A.2d 1245, 1249 (R.I. 1998); State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 959 (R.I. 1995)). Therefore, “[t]he magistrate is permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the affidavit presented to him or her.” Id. (citing State v. Pratt, 641 A.2d 732, 736 (R.I. 1994)). “Because there is ‘a strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant,’ affidavits are to be interpreted in a realistic fashion that is consistent with common sense, and not subject to rigorous and hypertechnical scrutiny.” Byrne, 972 A.2d at 638 (quoting Gates, 462 U.S. at 235-39); see also United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 109 (1965) (“[W]hen a magistrate has found probable cause, the courts should not invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense, manner.”). In fact, “[i]t is incumbent upon the trial justice and the reviewing court to accord great deference to the issuing magistrate’s probable-cause determination, so long as there is a showing of ‘a substantial basis from which to discern probable cause.’”5 Id. (citing State v. Correia, 707 A.2d 1245, 1249 (R.I. 1998)). “[I]n close cases, the validity of the warrant should be upheld.” Id. at 642. “‘Probable cause exists when the affidavit demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood that an offense has been or is being committed.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Santana, 342 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 2003)). 5 Our Supreme Court has held that “a deferential standard of review should be applied when reviewing a magistrate’s decision to issue a warrant because ‘[t]he Fourth Amendment demonstrates a strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant . . . and the police are more likely to use the warrant process if the scrutiny applied to a magistrate’s probable-cause determination to issue a warrant is less than that for warrantless searches.’” Id. (internal citations omitted). 5 III Analysis Defendant argues that evidence seized as a result of the Search Warrant should be suppressed because (1) Detective Macera’s description of the video was insufficient; (2) the video was not child pornography as defined by § 11-9-1.3(c)(1)(ii); and (3) the issuing magistrate did not view the video to determine if it was, by law, child pornography. The State maintains that the Search Warrant was supported by probable cause because (1) the Affidavit established a fair probability that the evidence of crime would be located at 15 Harding Street; (2) the issuing magistrate is not required to view the video to establish probable cause; and (3) suppression is not warranted because the RISP relied upon the Search Warrant in good faith. A Issuing Magistrate’s Review of Alleged Child Pornography The Court first addresses Defendant’s argument that because the issuing magistrate did not view the video himself, the Search Warrant should be deemed invalid. The State counters that the issuing magistrate need not view the alleged child pornography to make a “pre-charge decision” as to whether the video constitutes child pornography. Whether or not an issuing magistrate of a search warrant needs to review an alleged image or video of child pornography is a matter of first impression in Rhode Island. In instances of first impression, and when there is a nearly identical federal statute, our Supreme Court has looked to federal court jurisprudence for guidance. State v. Brown, 62 A.3d 1099, 1109 (R.I. 2013). It has been noted that the State’s child pornography statute is substantially similar to its federal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(B)(iii). Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641 n.11. Therefore, the Court looks to United State v. Brunette, 256 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2001), in which the First 6 Circuit discussed the necessity of a magistrate to review alleged child pornography images or video when issuing a warrant in a child pornography investigation.6 In Brunette, an investigator applied for a search warrant after discovering that a defendant had downloaded thirty-three images of child pornography. 256 F.3d at 15-16. The affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant application did not append any of the allegedly pornographic images and did not contain a description of them. Id. at 16. Rather, the affidavit merely asserted that the images “met the statutory definition of child pornography.” Id. The warrant issued and other allegedly pornographic images were found on the defendant’s computer. Id. Subsequently, the defendant moved to suppress the images contained on the computers seized under the warrant, arguing that the affidavit had a “nondescript legal conclusion” and the warrant lacked probable cause because the issuing magistrate did not view the images and determine that they were child pornography. Id. In its review of the grant of the search warrant, the First Circuit held that “[a]lthough the affidavit included sufficient indicia to link the images to the defendant, i.e., that the postings originated from the defendant’s [] Internet access account, it did not specify with any detail the 6 Defendant has alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and article I, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution, both of which prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures. The applicability of Brunette in the instant suit is illustrative of the protections awarded by the Federal and State Constitutions. For instance, the First Circuit has held Brunette awards certain protections to citizens under the Fourth Amendment. As “[t]he Federal Constitution only establishes a minimum level of protection,” the Rhode Island Constitution must provide the same protections as the Federal Constitution, and thus utilize the standard set forth in Brunette in analyzing searches and seizures. Pimental v. Dep’t of Transp., 561 A.2d 1348, 1350 (R.I. 1989). The Supreme Court of the United States clarified that “state courts [are] final interpreters of state law ‘to impose higher standards on searches and seizures [under state constitutions] than required by the Federal Constitution.’” Id. (citing Cooper v. California, 386 U.S. 58, 62 (1967)). Accordingly, the State Constitution may offer protections against searches and seizures that award more protection than Brunette, but Brunette must be found as the minimum protections under the Fourth Amendment, and thus any state constitution. 7 basis for believing that those images were pornographic.”7 Id. at 17. Further, the First Circuit noted that “[t]he evidence on the nature of the images consisted solely of [the investigator’s] legal conclusion parroting the statutory definition.” Id. The Brunette court concluded the following: “[a] court reviewing a warrant application to search for pornographic materials ordinarily is unable to perform the evaluation required by the Fourth Amendment if the application is based on allegedly pornographic images neither appended to, nor described in, the supporting affidavit . . . If copies cannot feasibly be obtained, a detailed description, including the focal point and setting of the image, and pose and attire of the subject, will generally suffice to allow a magistrate judge to make a considered judgment.” Id. at 20. Here, Detective Macera’s description of the “Jamtien” video as “a prepubescent female on the beach removing her bathing suit exposing her genitals” is sufficient to withstand the requirements of Brunette, and the issuing magistrate thus was not required to view the video before issuing the warrant. See 256 F.3d at 20. Detective Macera described the setting of the video—a beach; the pose of the female—undressing; the attire the female was wearing—a bathing suit; and the focal point of the video—a prepubescent female and her genitals. See id.; Aff. at 5. While sparse, Detective Macera’s definition does not merely “parrot” the statutory definition of child pornography. Instead, it describes the contents of the “Jamtien” file. See Brunette, 256 F.3d at 17. The Court notes that while Detective Macera’s description meets the requirements of Brunette, it barely does so. See id. In fact, the Court deems such description as the bare minimum—anything less would not be sufficient to provide an issuing magistrate with enough information to make a probable cause determination. Accordingly, the Court finds 7 The image was described as “a prepubescent boy lasciviously displaying his genitals.” The Brunette court held that this was “an attempt on [the investigator’s] part to mirror the language” of the child pornography statute. Id. at 17. 8 Detective Macera’s description of the “Jamtien” file sufficient under Brunette. See id. However, the sufficiency of the description is a question separate from whether the Affidavit as a whole was supported by probable cause. B Affidavit Supported by Probable Cause Defendant avers that the Affidavit did not establish probable cause because Detective Macera did not provide a sufficient description of the video to enable a magistrate to determine that the video constituted “child pornography” as statutorily defined. Specifically, Defendant maintains that based on Detective Macera’s description of the video in the Affidavit, the video was not a graphic or lascivious exhibition of the genitals. The State argues that the Affidavit need only establish probable cause, not a certainty, that the picture is child pornography. The possession, transfer or production of child pornography is prohibited by § 11-9-1.3. A finding that an image or video depicts child pornography “requires more than mere nudity.” United States v. Amirault, 173 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1999). Under § 11-9-1.3, child pornography is defined as: “any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct where: [...] “(ii) Such visual depiction is a digital image, computer image, or computer-generated image of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct . . .” “Sexually explicit conduct” is defined as actual “[g]raphic or lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.” Sec. 11-9-1.3(c)(6) (emphasis added). “Graphic,” “when used with respect to a depiction of sexually explicit conduct, means that a viewer can observe any part 9 of the genitals or pubic area of any depicted person or animal during any part of the time that the sexually explicit conduct is being depicted.”8 Sec. 11-9-1.3(c)(8). Despite defining what constitutes a “graphic” image, § 11-9-1.3 does not define what amounts to a “lascivious” depiction of the genitals. In defining “lascivious,”9 state courts have looked to federal jurisprudence and have employed the six factors articulated in United States v. Dost, 636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal. 1986), which was adopted by the First Circuit in Amirault, 173 F.3d at 33. See Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641 n.11 (noting the similarities between § 11-9-1.3 and its federal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(B)(iii)). In Dost, a defendant sought to dismiss the indictment against him, arguing that the images that he possessed did not display or constitute a lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of the minor that he photographed. 636 F. Supp. at 830. In denying the motion to dismiss, the Dost court considered the following factors instructive on whether the image depicted “lascivious” conduct: “(1) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child’s genitalia or pubic area; “(2) whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with sexual activity; “(3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child; “(4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude; 8 The Court recognizes that the application of the definition of “graphic” is circular. See § 11-9- 1.3(c)(8). For instance, “sexually explicit conduct” is a “graphic” exhibition of the genitals; and a “graphic exhibition of the genitals” means a depiction of any part of the genitals or pubic area during “any part of the time that the sexually explicit conduct is being depicted.” Compare §§ 11-9-1.3(c)(6) with (8). Simply, an image is sexually explicit conduct when it is graphic, and the image is graphic when it is sexually explicit. See id. 9 Our Supreme Court has addressed “lascivious” only once, observing that “visual depictions of clothed genitalia may fall within the meaning of ‘lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area,’ and thereby qualify as child pornography.” Byrne, 972 A.2d at 640 n.11 (quoting United States v. Knox, 32 F.3d 733, 743-51 (3d Cir. 1994)). 10 “(5) whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a willingness to engage in sexual activity; “(6) whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer.” Id. at 832. The Dost court explained that “[o]f course, a visual depiction need not involve all of these factors to be a ‘lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.’ The determination will have to be made based on the overall content of the visual depiction, taking into account the age of the minor.” Id. Further, in employing the Dost factors, the Amirault court cautioned that the factors are “neither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in every situation.” 173 F.3d at 32. The court explained that “[a]lthough Dost provides some specific, workable criteria, there may be other factors that are equally if not more important in determining whether a photograph contains a lascivious exhibition. The inquiry will always be case-specific.” Id. While § 11-9-1.3 and Dost may be instructive on what constitutes child pornography, such a determination is not required for a finding of probable cause for a search warrant. See Byrne, 972 A.2d at 642 (“Probable cause exists when the affidavit demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood that an offense has been or is being committed”). The question before the Court is not whether the “Jamtien” video constitutes child pornography under § 11-9-1.3, but whether the Affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance of the Search Warrant. It is important that the instant task of the Court not be confused with that of the jury, whose task is to decide beyond a reasonable doubt whether the “Jamtien” and other images or videos found on Defendant’s computer constitute child pornography. State v. Guzman, 752 A.2d 1, 4 (R.I. 2000) (“[T]he existence of probable cause . . . does not require the same degree of proof needed to determine whether that person is guilty of the crime in question.”); see also United States v. Frabizio, 459 F.3d 80, 85 (1st Cir. 2006) (“it is up to the 11 jury to determine whether the images identified in the bill of particulars . . . constitute visual depictions of ‘sexually explicit conduct.”’). In fact, in the purview of child pornography, our Supreme Court has held that in addition to the fact alleged in the Affidavit, the nature of the offense can lend reasonable inferences to support probable cause for a search warrant. Byrne, 972 A.2d at 640-42. The Byrne Court explained that “‘[t]he requisite nexus between the criminal article or activity described in the affidavit and the place to be searched need not be based on direct observation.’” Byrne, 972 A.2d at 640 (quoting Commonwealth v. Anthony, 883 N.E.2d 918, 926 (Mass. 2008)). Instead, “it may be found in ‘the type of crime, the nature of the . . . items [sought], the extent of the suspect’s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide [items of the sort sought in the warrant].’” Id. (quoting Anthony, 883 N.E.2d at 926). For instance, child pornography, like the crime of voyeurism, “is, by its nature, a solitary and secretive crime.” Id. at 641. The Court noted that: “The observation that images of child pornography are likely to be hoarded by persons interested in those materials in the privacy of their homes is supported by common sense and the cases. Since the materials are illegal to distribute and possess, initial collection is difficult. Having succeeded in obtaining images, collectors are unlikely to destroy them. Because of their illegality and the imprimatur of severe social stigma such images carry, collectors will want to secret them in secure places, like a private residence.” Id. (quoting United States v. Riccardi, 405 F.3d 852, 861 (10th Cir. 2005)). The type of the crime, viewed in conjunction with any instrumentality sought to be seized, also may provide reasonable inferences necessary to establish probable cause. Id. at 641-42. For example, it would be a reasonable inference that a camera containing sexually explicit material would be in a defendant’s residence, charged with the illegal possession of the sexually explicit images. Id. 12 Here, the Court finds that the Affidavit established probable cause. The definitions in § 11-9-1.3(c) and the factors in Dost provide guidance on what constitutes child pornography, although such an affirmative finding on the merits is not necessary at this stage in the proceedings. See Byrne, 972 A.2d at 642. Still, the Court looks to § 11-9-1.3 and Dost to “guide the inquiry” in determining whether the Affidavit supplied information that amounted to establishing probable cause. See Brunette, 256 F.3d at 18. At the outset, the Court notes that the “Jamtien” video file is likely “graphic” as defined by § 11-9-1.3(c)(8) because the minor female’s genitals can be seen during the video. See Aff. at 5; § 11-9-1.3(c)(8). While the definition of “graphic” may appear circular in its application, the Court also finds that the video is likely lascivious. See supra n.6. Turning to the factors in Dost, the Court notes that the first factor is not necessarily met as the description of “Jamtien” does not state whether the focus of the video is on the minor female’s genitals or pubic area. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. It also cannot be said with certainty that the beach is a place that is sexually suggestive or generally associated with sexual activity. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. Despite the fact that the beach may be a place for romantic encounters, Detective Macera’s description does not provide any details to allow the Court to make such an inference as to the setting of the photograph. See Aff. at 5. However, a prepubescent female taking off her bathing suit in a public place (such as a beach) does seem to be an unnatural pose for a person of her age. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. Furthermore, Detective Macera described the female in the video as “removing her bathing suit” and “exposing her genitals,” allowing the Court to infer that the female was either nude or partially nude at the time the “Jamtien” video was being taken. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. A female undressing in front of a camera also likely suggests some degree of sexual 13 coyness or willingness to engage in sexual activity, making the “Jamtien” video likely to be intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. In reviewing Detective Macera’s description of the “Jamtien” video file in conjunction with all the Dost factors, and without making an affirmative finding that the “Jamtien” video file is child pornography, the Court is satisfied that the Affidavit and Detective Macera’s description therein were sufficient to provide and trustworthy information to demonstrate a likelihood that child pornography images or videos were in 15 Harding Street. As previously stated, at the search warrant stage of the investigation, all that was required was that the Affidavit demonstrate “in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood” that child pornography was in 15 Harding Street, which it did. See id. The Affidavit asserted that the Jamtien video file—which is likely to be child pornography—was downloaded from IP address 100.10.41.6, a member of a peer-to-peer sharing network that was suspected of containing child pornography. See Aff. at 5. IP address 100.10.41.6 was registered to Heather, who lived at 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island. Id. The video downloaded was named “Jamtien” and was described as “a prepubescent female on the beach removing her bathing suit exposing her genitals.” Id. Based on these facts, the Affidavit has provided sufficient and trustworthy facts to establish a “likelihood” that a resident of 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island was downloading and possessed child pornography. See Byrne, 972 A.2d at 642. The facts of the Affidavit are further supported by the reasonable inferences that may be made by the inherent nature of the crime and the instrumentalities used in the commission of the crime. See id. at 641. The nature of the crime of child pornography reasonably infers that evidence of the crime is within the defendant’s personal residence. See id. Specifically, evidence of the crime would be on a device that was capable of connecting to IP address 14 100.10.41.6, including a computer or cellphone. See id. The Search Warrant was directed at “the premises located at 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island 02893,” which identified the Defendant’s home. See Aff. at 2; Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641. Further, it was directed at “mobile devices, computer hardware, computer software, computer-related documentation,” among others, all of which are used in the commission of an Internet-related crime, and able to connect to IP address 100.10.41.6. See id.; Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641. In viewing the information in the Affidavit in the totality of the circumstances, awarding appropriate deference to the issuing magistrate’s finding of probable cause, and making reasonable inferences from the inherent nature of the crime and instrumentalities used, the Court finds that the Affidavit provided the issuing magistrate a “substantial basis from which to discern probable cause.” See Gates, 462 U.S. at 238-39; see also Byrne, 972 A.2d at 638. IV Conclusion In conclusion, the Court denies Defendant’s motion to suppress because the issuing magistrate was not required to review the alleged child pornography and the Affidavit established a substantial basis from which the issuing magistrate could conclude that probable cause existed. Counsel shall submit an appropriate Order for entry. 15 RHODE ISLAND SUPERIOR COURT Decision Addendum Sheet TITLE OF CASE: State of Rhode Island v.

Before the Court is Ralph Reisner’s (Defendant) motion to suppress evidence seized within his home, arguing that the affidavit in support of the search warrant (the Affidavit) did not establish probable cause. Conversely, the State of Rhode Island (the State) maintains that the Affidavit was sufficient and established probable cause. Jurisdiction is pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 8-2-15. For the following reasons, the Court denies Defendant’s motion to suppress.', 'I', 'Facts1 and Travel', 'Detective Brian Macera (Detective Macera) is a ten-year veteran of the Rhode Island State Police (RISP), and is currently assigned to the Computer Crimes Unit (CCU) and the Rhode Island Internet Crimes against Children (ICAC) Task Force. 2 Aff. at 3.

Id. To be a participating member, a computer user must install a file-sharing software and “sharing folder” in which files can be stored and shared with other participating members of the peer-to-peer network. Id. Members of the peer-to-peer network can search the network and download any shared file in that network. Id. at 3-4. Each file in the peer-to-peer network is attached to the Internet Protocol (IP) address3 of the computer that is sharing the file. Id. at 2. Further, each file in the peer-to-peer network is identifiable by a “hash” value, which is an “alpha-numeric string . . . that is calculated by applying a mathematical algorithm to the electronic data that is contained in the electronic file.” Id. Therefore, if an electronic file has identical content to another file, their hash values will also be identical. As a result, hash values are “commonly referred to as electronic fingerprints.” Id. Any changes to the content of an electronic file, no matter how slight, will change the file’s hash value. Id. Law enforcement, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), and the ICAC Task Force have identified certain hash values as confirmed child pornography. Id.', 'In June 2015, Detective Macera was contacted by Detective Lieutenant Stephen Riccitelli—a detective in the North Smithfield Police Department and member of the ICAC Task Force—who informed him that the ICAC Task Force computer system had downloaded a file suspected to be child pornography from IP address 100.10.41.6.4 Id. at 5.

These computers are programed to continuously look for child pornography files on the peer-to-peer network, and will download files from another participating member’s computer when such files contain certain hash values or descriptions that match child pornography.

On the same day, the Search Warrant was approved. Subsequently, on August 3, 2015, RISP executed the Search Warrant, seizing Defendant’s computer—a Mac Pro desktop (serial number WCAU40341527) (Defendant’s Computer). A police forensic examination of Defendant’s Computer revealed seven videos of child pornography. Based on this evidence, the RISP obtained an arrest warrant for Defendant, and Defendant was subsequently arrested. On December 24, 2015, the State filed a criminal information, charging Defendant with possession of child pornography, in violation of § 11-9-1.3(b)(2); and delivery or transfer of child pornography, in violation of § 11-9-1.3(b)(1).', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution, prohibits the issuance of a search warrant absent a showing of probable cause.” Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 94. “The United States Supreme Court has indicated that the existence of probable cause should be determined pursuant to a flexible ‘totality-of-the- circumstances analysis.’” Id. (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238-39 (1983)). The Supreme Court of the United States explained:', '“The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical,', 'common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set', 'forth in the affidavit before him, including the ‘veracity’ and ‘basis', 'of knowledge’ of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a', 'fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be', 'found in a particular place. And the duty of a reviewing court is', 'simply to ensure that the magistrate had a ‘substantial basis for . . .', '4', 'conclud[ing]’ that probable cause existed.” Gates, 462 U.S. at', '238-39. “In other words, the approach to the probable cause question should be pragmatic and flexible.” Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 94 (citing State v. Spaziano, 685 A.2d 1068, 1069 (R.I. 1996); State v. Correia, 707 A.2d 1245, 1249 (R.I. 1998); State v. Hightower, 661 A.2d 948, 959 (R.I. 1995)). Therefore, “[t]he magistrate is permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the affidavit presented to him or her.” Id. (citing State v. Pratt, 641 A.2d 732, 736 (R.I. 1994)).', '“Because there is ‘a strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant,’ affidavits are to be interpreted in a realistic fashion that is consistent with common sense, and not subject to rigorous and hypertechnical scrutiny.” Byrne, 972 A.2d at 638 (quoting Gates, 462 U.S. at 235-39); see also United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 109 (1965) (“[W]hen a magistrate has found probable cause, the courts should not invalidate the warrant by interpreting the affidavit in a hypertechnical, rather than a commonsense, manner.”).', 'In fact, “[i]t is incumbent upon the trial justice and the reviewing court to accord great deference to the issuing magistrate’s probable-cause determination, so long as there is a showing of ‘a substantial basis from which to discern probable cause.’”5 Id.

(quoting United States v. Santana, 342 F.3d 60, 65 (1st Cir. 2003)). 5', 'Our Supreme Court has held that “a deferential standard of review should be applied when reviewing a magistrate’s decision to issue a warrant because ‘[t]he Fourth Amendment demonstrates a strong preference for searches conducted pursuant to a warrant . . . and the police are more likely to use the warrant process if the scrutiny applied to a magistrate’s probable-cause determination to issue a warrant is less than that for warrantless searches.’” Id. (internal citations omitted).', '5', 'III', 'Analysis', 'Defendant argues that evidence seized as a result of the Search Warrant should be suppressed because (1) Detective Macera’s description of the video was insufficient; (2) the video was not child pornography as defined by § 11-9-1.3(c)(1)(ii); and (3) the issuing magistrate did not view the video to determine if it was, by law, child pornography. The State maintains that the Search Warrant was supported by probable cause because (1) the Affidavit established a fair probability that the evidence of crime would be located at 15 Harding Street; (2) the issuing magistrate is not required to view the video to establish probable cause; and (3) suppression is not warranted because the RISP relied upon the Search Warrant in good faith.', 'A', 'Issuing Magistrate’s Review of Alleged Child Pornography', 'The Court first addresses Defendant’s argument that because the issuing magistrate did not view the video himself, the Search Warrant should be deemed invalid. The State counters that the issuing magistrate need not view the alleged child pornography to make a “pre-charge decision” as to whether the video constitutes child pornography.', 'Whether or not an issuing magistrate of a search warrant needs to review an alleged image or video of child pornography is a matter of first impression in Rhode Island. In instances of first impression, and when there is a nearly identical federal statute, our Supreme Court has looked to federal court jurisprudence for guidance. State v. Brown, 62 A.3d 1099, 1109 (R.I. 2013). It has been noted that the State’s child pornography statute is substantially similar to its federal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(B)(iii). Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641 n.11. Therefore, the Court looks to United State v. Brunette, 256 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2001), in which the First', '6 Circuit discussed the necessity of a magistrate to review alleged child pornography images or video when issuing a warrant in a child pornography investigation.6', 'In Brunette, an investigator applied for a search warrant after discovering that a defendant had downloaded thirty-three images of child pornography. 256 F.3d at 15-16. The affidavit submitted in support of the search warrant application did not append any of the allegedly pornographic images and did not contain a description of them. Id. at 16. Rather, the affidavit merely asserted that the images “met the statutory definition of child pornography.” Id. The warrant issued and other allegedly pornographic images were found on the defendant’s computer. Id. Subsequently, the defendant moved to suppress the images contained on the computers seized under the warrant, arguing that the affidavit had a “nondescript legal conclusion” and the warrant lacked probable cause because the issuing magistrate did not view the images and determine that they were child pornography. Id.', 'In its review of the grant of the search warrant, the First Circuit held that “[a]lthough the affidavit included sufficient indicia to link the images to the defendant, i.e., that the postings originated from the defendant’s [] Internet access account, it did not specify with any detail the 6', 'Defendant has alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and article I, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution, both of which prohibit unreasonable searches and seizures. The applicability of Brunette in the instant suit is illustrative of the protections awarded by the Federal and State Constitutions. For instance, the First Circuit has held Brunette awards certain protections to citizens under the Fourth Amendment. As “[t]he Federal Constitution only establishes a minimum level of protection,” the Rhode Island Constitution must provide the same protections as the Federal Constitution, and thus utilize the standard set forth in Brunette in analyzing searches and seizures. Pimental v. Dep’t of Transp., 561 A.2d 1348, 1350 (R.I. 1989). The Supreme Court of the United States clarified that “state courts [are] final interpreters of state law ‘to impose higher standards on searches and seizures [under state constitutions] than required by the Federal Constitution.’” Id. (citing Cooper v. California, 386 U.S. 58, 62 (1967)). Accordingly, the State Constitution may offer protections against searches and seizures that award more protection than Brunette, but Brunette must be found as the minimum protections under the Fourth Amendment, and thus any state constitution.', '7 basis for believing that those images were pornographic.”7 Id. at 17. Further, the First Circuit noted that “[t]he evidence on the nature of the images consisted solely of [the investigator’s] legal conclusion parroting the statutory definition.” Id. The Brunette court concluded the following:', '“[a] court reviewing a warrant application to search for', 'pornographic materials ordinarily is unable to perform the', 'evaluation required by the Fourth Amendment if the application is', 'based on allegedly pornographic images neither appended to, nor', 'described in, the supporting affidavit . . . If copies cannot feasibly', 'be obtained, a detailed description, including the focal point and', 'setting of the image, and pose and attire of the subject, will', 'generally suffice to allow a magistrate judge to make a considered', 'judgment.” Id. at 20.', 'Here, Detective Macera’s description of the “Jamtien” video as “a prepubescent female on the beach removing her bathing suit exposing her genitals” is sufficient to withstand the requirements of Brunette, and the issuing magistrate thus was not required to view the video before issuing the warrant. See 256 F.3d at 20. Detective Macera described the setting of the video—a beach; the pose of the female—undressing; the attire the female was wearing—a bathing suit; and the focal point of the video—a prepubescent female and her genitals. See id.; Aff. at 5. While sparse, Detective Macera’s definition does not merely “parrot” the statutory definition of child pornography. Instead, it describes the contents of the “Jamtien” file. See Brunette, 256 F.3d at 17. The Court notes that while Detective Macera’s description meets the requirements of Brunette, it barely does so. See id. In fact, the Court deems such description as the bare minimum—anything less would not be sufficient to provide an issuing magistrate with enough information to make a probable cause determination. Accordingly, the Court finds 7', 'The image was described as “a prepubescent boy lasciviously displaying his genitals.” The Brunette court held that this was “an attempt on [the investigator’s] part to mirror the language” of the child pornography statute. Id. at 17.', '8 Detective Macera’s description of the “Jamtien” file sufficient under Brunette.', 'See id. However, the sufficiency of the description is a question separate from whether the Affidavit as a whole was supported by probable cause.', 'B', 'Affidavit Supported by Probable Cause', 'Defendant avers that the Affidavit did not establish probable cause because Detective Macera did not provide a sufficient description of the video to enable a magistrate to determine that the video constituted “child pornography” as statutorily defined. Specifically, Defendant maintains that based on Detective Macera’s description of the video in the Affidavit, the video was not a graphic or lascivious exhibition of the genitals. The State argues that the Affidavit need only establish probable cause, not a certainty, that the picture is child pornography.', 'The possession, transfer or production of child pornography is prohibited by § 11-9-1.3. A finding that an image or video depicts child pornography “requires more than mere nudity.” United States v. Amirault, 173 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1999). Under § 11-9-1.3, child pornography is defined as:', '“any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video,', 'picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture,', 'whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other', 'means, of sexually explicit conduct where:', '[...]', '“(ii) Such visual depiction is a digital image, computer image,', 'or computer-generated image of a minor engaging in', 'sexually explicit conduct . . .” “Sexually explicit conduct” is defined as actual “[g]raphic or lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of any person.” Sec. 11-9-1.3(c)(6) (emphasis added). “Graphic,” “when used with respect to a depiction of sexually explicit conduct, means that a viewer can observe any part', '9 of the genitals or pubic area of any depicted person or animal during any part of the time that the sexually explicit conduct is being depicted.”8', 'Sec. 11-9-1.3(c)(8). Despite defining what constitutes a “graphic” image, § 11-9-1.3 does not define what amounts to a “lascivious” depiction of the genitals.', 'In defining “lascivious,”9 state courts have looked to federal jurisprudence and have employed the six factors articulated in United States v. Dost, 636 F. Supp. 828, 832 (S.D. Cal. 1986), which was adopted by the First Circuit in Amirault, 173 F.3d at 33. See Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641 n.11 (noting the similarities between § 11-9-1.3 and its federal counterpart, 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(B)(iii)). In Dost, a defendant sought to dismiss the indictment against him, arguing that the images that he possessed did not display or constitute a lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area of the minor that he photographed. 636 F. Supp. at 830. In denying the motion to dismiss, the Dost court considered the following factors instructive on whether the image depicted “lascivious” conduct:', '“(1) whether the focal point of the visual depiction is on the child’s', 'genitalia or pubic area;', '“(2) whether the setting of the visual depiction is sexually', 'suggestive, i.e., in a place or pose generally associated with', 'sexual activity;', '“(3) whether the child is depicted in an unnatural pose, or in', 'inappropriate attire, considering the age of the child;', '“(4) whether the child is fully or partially clothed, or nude; 8', 'The Court recognizes that the application of the definition of “graphic” is circular. See § 11-9- 1.3(c)(8). For instance, “sexually explicit conduct” is a “graphic” exhibition of the genitals; and a “graphic exhibition of the genitals” means a depiction of any part of the genitals or pubic area during “any part of the time that the sexually explicit conduct is being depicted.” Compare §§ 11-9-1.3(c)(6) with (8). Simply, an image is sexually explicit conduct when it is graphic, and the image is graphic when it is sexually explicit. See id. 9', 'Our Supreme Court has addressed “lascivious” only once, observing that “visual depictions of clothed genitalia may fall within the meaning of ‘lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area,’ and thereby qualify as child pornography.” Byrne, 972 A.2d at 640 n.11 (quoting United States v. Knox, 32 F.3d 733, 743-51 (3d Cir. 1994)).', '10', '“(5) whether the visual depiction suggests sexual coyness or a', 'willingness to engage in sexual activity;', '“(6) whether the visual depiction is intended or designed to elicit a', 'sexual response in the viewer.” Id. at 832. The Dost court explained that “[o]f course, a visual depiction need not involve all of these factors to be a ‘lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.’ The determination will have to be made based on the overall content of the visual depiction, taking into account the age of the minor.” Id. Further, in employing the Dost factors, the Amirault court cautioned that the factors are “neither comprehensive nor necessarily applicable in every situation.” 173 F.3d at 32. The court explained that “[a]lthough Dost provides some specific, workable criteria, there may be other factors that are equally if not more important in determining whether a photograph contains a lascivious exhibition. The inquiry will always be case-specific.” Id.', 'While § 11-9-1.3 and Dost may be instructive on what constitutes child pornography, such a determination is not required for a finding of probable cause for a search warrant. See Byrne, 972 A.2d at 642 (“Probable cause exists when the affidavit demonstrates in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood that an offense has been or is being committed”). The question before the Court is not whether the “Jamtien” video constitutes child pornography under § 11-9-1.3, but whether the Affidavit was sufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance of the Search Warrant. It is important that the instant task of the Court not be confused with that of the jury, whose task is to decide beyond a reasonable doubt whether the “Jamtien” and other images or videos found on Defendant’s computer constitute child pornography.', 'State v. Guzman, 752 A.2d 1, 4 (R.I. 2000) (“[T]he existence of probable cause . . . does not require the same degree of proof needed to determine whether that person is guilty of the crime in question.”); see also United States v. Frabizio, 459 F.3d 80, 85 (1st Cir. 2006) (“it is up to the', '11 jury to determine whether the images identified in the bill of particulars . . . constitute visual depictions of ‘sexually explicit conduct.”’).', 'In fact, in the purview of child pornography, our Supreme Court has held that in addition to the fact alleged in the Affidavit, the nature of the offense can lend reasonable inferences to support probable cause for a search warrant. Byrne, 972 A.2d at 640-42. The Byrne Court explained that “‘[t]he requisite nexus between the criminal article or activity described in the affidavit and the place to be searched need not be based on direct observation.’” Byrne, 972 A.2d at 640 (quoting Commonwealth v. Anthony, 883 N.E.2d 918, 926 (Mass. 2008)). Instead, “it may be found in ‘the type of crime, the nature of the . . . items [sought], the extent of the suspect’s opportunity for concealment, and normal inferences as to where a criminal would be likely to hide [items of the sort sought in the warrant].’” Id. (quoting Anthony, 883 N.E.2d at 926). For instance, child pornography, like the crime of voyeurism, “is, by its nature, a solitary and secretive crime.” Id. at 641. The Court noted that:', '“The observation that images of child pornography are likely to be', 'hoarded by persons interested in those materials in the privacy of', 'their homes is supported by common sense and the cases. Since', 'the materials are illegal to distribute and possess, initial collection', 'is difficult. Having succeeded in obtaining images, collectors are', 'unlikely to destroy them. Because of their illegality and the', 'imprimatur of severe social stigma such images carry, collectors', 'will want to secret them in secure places, like a private residence.”', 'Id. (quoting United States v. Riccardi, 405 F.3d 852, 861 (10th Cir.', '2005)). The type of the crime, viewed in conjunction with any instrumentality sought to be seized, also may provide reasonable inferences necessary to establish probable cause. Id. at 641-42. For example, it would be a reasonable inference that a camera containing sexually explicit material would be in a defendant’s residence, charged with the illegal possession of the sexually explicit images. Id.', '12', 'Here, the Court finds that the Affidavit established probable cause. The definitions in § 11-9-1.3(c) and the factors in Dost provide guidance on what constitutes child pornography, although such an affirmative finding on the merits is not necessary at this stage in the proceedings. See Byrne, 972 A.2d at 642. Still, the Court looks to § 11-9-1.3 and Dost to “guide the inquiry” in determining whether the Affidavit supplied information that amounted to establishing probable cause. See Brunette, 256 F.3d at 18.', 'At the outset, the Court notes that the “Jamtien” video file is likely “graphic” as defined by § 11-9-1.3(c)(8) because the minor female’s genitals can be seen during the video. See Aff. at 5; § 11-9-1.3(c)(8). While the definition of “graphic” may appear circular in its application, the Court also finds that the video is likely lascivious. See supra n.6.', 'Turning to the factors in Dost, the Court notes that the first factor is not necessarily met as the description of “Jamtien” does not state whether the focus of the video is on the minor female’s genitals or pubic area. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. It also cannot be said with certainty that the beach is a place that is sexually suggestive or generally associated with sexual activity. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. Despite the fact that the beach may be a place for romantic encounters, Detective Macera’s description does not provide any details to allow the Court to make such an inference as to the setting of the photograph. See Aff. at 5. However, a prepubescent female taking off her bathing suit in a public place (such as a beach) does seem to be an unnatural pose for a person of her age. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. Furthermore, Detective Macera described the female in the video as “removing her bathing suit” and “exposing her genitals,” allowing the Court to infer that the female was either nude or partially nude at the time the “Jamtien” video was being taken. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. A female undressing in front of a camera also likely suggests some degree of sexual', '13 coyness or willingness to engage in sexual activity, making the “Jamtien” video likely to be intended or designed to elicit a sexual response in the viewer. See Aff. at 5; Dost, 636 F. Supp. at 832. In reviewing Detective Macera’s description of the “Jamtien” video file in conjunction with all the Dost factors, and without making an affirmative finding that the “Jamtien” video file is child pornography, the Court is satisfied that the Affidavit and Detective Macera’s description therein were sufficient to provide and trustworthy information to demonstrate a likelihood that child pornography images or videos were in 15 Harding Street.', 'As previously stated, at the search warrant stage of the investigation, all that was required was that the Affidavit demonstrate “in some trustworthy fashion the likelihood” that child pornography was in 15 Harding Street, which it did. See id. The Affidavit asserted that the Jamtien video file—which is likely to be child pornography—was downloaded from IP address 100.10.41.6, a member of a peer-to-peer sharing network that was suspected of containing child pornography. See Aff. at 5. IP address 100.10.41.6 was registered to Heather, who lived at 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island. Id. The video downloaded was named “Jamtien” and was described as “a prepubescent female on the beach removing her bathing suit exposing her genitals.” Id. Based on these facts, the Affidavit has provided sufficient and trustworthy facts to establish a “likelihood” that a resident of 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island was downloading and possessed child pornography. See Byrne, 972 A.2d at 642.', 'The facts of the Affidavit are further supported by the reasonable inferences that may be made by the inherent nature of the crime and the instrumentalities used in the commission of the crime. See id. at 641. The nature of the crime of child pornography reasonably infers that evidence of the crime is within the defendant’s personal residence.', 'See id.', 'Specifically, evidence of the crime would be on a device that was capable of connecting to IP address', '14 100.10.41.6, including a computer or cellphone. See id. The Search Warrant was directed at “the premises located at 15 Harding Street, West Warwick, Rhode Island 02893,” which identified the Defendant’s home. See Aff. at 2; Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641. Further, it was directed at “mobile devices, computer hardware, computer software, computer-related documentation,” among others, all of which are used in the commission of an Internet-related crime, and able to connect to IP address 100.10.41.6. See id.; Byrne, 972 A.2d at 641.', 'In viewing the information in the Affidavit in the totality of the circumstances, awarding appropriate deference to the issuing magistrate’s finding of probable cause, and making reasonable inferences from the inherent nature of the crime and instrumentalities used, the Court finds that the Affidavit provided the issuing magistrate a “substantial basis from which to discern probable cause.” See Gates, 462 U.S. at 238-39; see also Byrne, 972 A.2d at 638.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'In conclusion, the Court denies Defendant’s motion to suppress because the issuing magistrate was not required to review the alleged child pornography and the Affidavit established a substantial basis from which the issuing magistrate could conclude that probable cause existed.

Is a motorist, who had been charged with a first violation of operating a motor vehicle after his license has been suspended, entitled to have his records sealed under the provisions of Rhode Island General Laws § 12-1-12?

This case came before us pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause as to why the issues raised by this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth below, we quash the order of the District Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In October 2017, a Coventry police officer stopped Charlwood for driving a motor vehicle after his license had been suspended. Thereafter, Charlwood was charged in District Court with a violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-11-18, specifically that he “did * * * operate a motor vehicle * * *', '-1- after his license to operate had been suspended[,]” first violation. The charge was later dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure because defendant’s license had been reinstated. Charlwood then moved to seal his court records under G.L. 1956 § 12-1-12. The trial judge granted this motion in an order dated October 24, 2017 (October Order). On November 1, 2017, however, the trial judge sua sponte denied the same motion by handwriting “DENIED” on the original order (November Order).', 'Charlwood filed a petition for writ of certiorari asking this Court to review the denial of his motion. On September 25, 2018, we granted defendant’s petition, summarily vacated the order denying defendant’s motion to seal, and remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to “conduct a hearing forthwith on the petitioner’s motion to seal with all parties present.” We also ordered that the papers be returned to this Court, subsequent to the “entry of an order granting or denying petitioner’s motion to seal.”', 'On remand before the trial judge, Charlwood made both procedural and substantive arguments. He argued that, because this Court had vacated the November Order denying his motion, the October Order granting his motion was still in effect. Thus, he asserted, the trial judge did not have the authority to vacate the October Order because there was no motion pending before her to do so. With respect to the merits of his motion, Charlwood contended that, under the provisions of § 12-1-12(b), the sealing statute applies to persons “detained by police, but not arrested or charged with an offense,” precisely the situation in which, Charlwood maintained, he found himself. The state did not object to defendant’s motion.1 1', 'The state made an additional argument as to why defendant’s motion to seal should be granted and referred the trial judge to G.L. 1956 § 12-1.3-2(g): “[A] person may file a motion for the expungement of records related to an offense that has been decriminalized subsequent to the date of their conviction[.]”', '-2-', 'The trial judge denied Charlwood’s motion to seal and determined that “the language of the sealing and expungement statute makes it clear that that statute is for criminal offenses only, not civil.”2 Because defendant was charged with a first violation of driving with a suspended license, a civil violation, the trial judge found that no relief was provided to defendant by the plain and ordinary meaning of § 12-1-12. The trial judge looked to the language of the statute and noted that the statute speaks only to criminal cases and is silent with respect to civil violations; therefore, she concluded that the Legislature had not provided a mechanism to seal or expunge civil violations. Thus, the trial judge denied the motion. The papers were then returned to this Court in accordance with our order of September 25, 2018.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that this Court’s “review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination of the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.” Sandy Point Farms, Inc. v.

Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 392 (1979)).', 'We begin our analysis of § 12-1-12(b)’s application to the facts of this case by noting that the charging document was entitled “State of Rhode Island District Court Criminal Complaint” and assigned a criminal docket number. Moreover, the ultimate disposition of the case was a dismissal under Rule 48(a) of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. It would appear, therefore, that Charlwood was charged with a criminal offense, and thus clearly the provisions of § 12-1-12(b) would not apply to him. A closer analysis, however, reveals several anomalies in the statutory framework at play in the case.', '-5-', 'The “criminal complaint” charges Charlwood with a violation of § 31-11-18, specifically stating that he did “operate a motor vehicle * * * after his license to operate had been suspended.” Further, it indicates that this was Charlwood’s first violation. The complaint also contains a series of four boxes indicating the nature of the illegal act with which Charlwood has been charged; the boxes are designated: felony, misdemeanor, violation, and ordinance. The only box checked on Charlwood’s complaint was “violation[.]” Indeed, § 31-11-18(b) provides that “[u]pon a first violation under this section, a civil penalty of not less than two hundred fifty dollars ($250), nor more than five hundred dollars ($500), shall be imposed.” In light of these circumstances, we conclude that Charlwood was not “charged with an offense” within the meaning of § 12-1-12(b). Although procedurally the charge against Charlwood had the trappings of a criminal complaint, it is clear that he was liable only for a civil penalty.', 'Our analysis is further informed by the statutory language of § 31-11-18, as well as by its statutory history. Subsection (a) provides, in relevant part, that “[a]ny person who drives a motor vehicle on any highway of this state * * * at a time when his or her license to operate is suspended * * * may be guilty of a misdemeanor.” Significantly, the statute was amended in 2016 to enact the current language that any such person “may be guilty of a misdemeanor.” The previous version provided that any such person “shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.” Subsection 31-11-18(b) clarifies, however, that first and second violations are subject to a civil penalty only. It is clear to us, therefore, that Charlwood was charged with a civil violation and not a criminal offense.', 'Section 12-1-12(b) extends the requirements of § 12-1-12(a) “to persons detained by police, but not arrested or charged with an offense, or to persons against whom charges have been filed by the court, and the period of such filing has expired.” Charlwood was in fact detained by police, but he neither was charged with a criminal offense nor were charges against him filed by', '-6- the court in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 12-10-12.3 Accordingly, under the facts of this case we are of the opinion that the defendant falls squarely within the purview of § 12-1-12(b) as a person “detained by police, but not arrested or charged with an offense,” and we hold that the defendant is entitled to the benefits of § 12-1-12(a) with respect to the destruction and sealing of his records.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, this Court quashes the order of the District Court and remands the case for entry of an order consistent with this opinion. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-10-12 contains provisions related to the filing of a criminal complaint “other than a complaint for the commission of a felony or a complaint against a person who has been convicted of a felony or a private complaint.” If such a complaint is filed, the court has discretion to place conditions on such filing, for example, “performance of services for the public good.” Section 12-10-12(a).', '-7- STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET', 'State ex rel.

60,State : v. : Raymond A. Peltier. :,reversal,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on February 4, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The defendant, Raymond A. Peltier (defendant or Peltier), appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury trial of one count of simple domestic assault. The trial justice subsequently denied the defendant’s motion for a new trial and sentenced Peltier to one year’s probation. Before this Court, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he allowed into evidence the fact that Peltier resisted arrest in this case, a complaint to which the defendant had entered a plea of nolo contendere immediately before the start of trial. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. We affirm the judgment of conviction entered by the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'A criminal complaint was filed against Peltier on September 19, 2012. After a bench trial in District Court, defendant was found guilty of one count of simple domestic assault and one count of resisting arrest. The defendant appealed these convictions to the Superior Court and exercised his right to a jury trial.', 'Prior to the commencement of the jury trial in Superior Court, Peltier entered a plea of nolo contendere to the complaint of resisting arrest. The trial justice continued the matter for sentencing after accepting the plea. During the course of the prosecutor’s opening statements, defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial when the prosecutor referenced the resisting arrest. The defense counsel contended that this was evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts by defendant that was irrelevant and inadmissible in accordance with Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. The trial justice overruled defense counsel’s objection and denied his motion for a mistrial. The record of this case discloses that defense counsel was notified of the state’s intention to introduce evidence that Peltier resisted arrest before defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere.', 'The state first called the complaining witness, Kelly Thurber (Thurber), to testify. Thurber recounted that she had known Peltier for almost twenty years and that he is her daughter’s father.', 'Thurber testified that Peltier typically cared for their daughter on Wednesdays. Thurber stated that on Tuesday, September 18, 2012, she attempted, without success, to call Peltier numerous times in order to finalize their plans for the next morning. Thurber testified that on the morning of Wednesday, September 19, 2012, when Peltier did not come to pick up their daughter, she first called defendant repeatedly and then drove to his home in West Warwick with the child. At approximately 8 a.m., Thurber and her daughter walked up', '-2- a flight of stairs to Peltier’s second-floor apartment, and Thurber began knocking on the window and door. After about five minutes, Peltier answered the door. Almost immediately, a verbal spat ensued. According to Thurber, when she extended her hand to separate herself from Peltier, she was pushed back by defendant and fell down a few stairs. Peltier then began to punch her and kick her. Once Peltier saw that his twenty-month-old daughter was crying and throwing herself on the floor, he abandoned Thurber and took the child inside his apartment. Thurber then called 9-1-1.', 'Officer Joshua D. Kennedy (Officer Kennedy) of the West Warwick Police Department arrived at the location, and Thurber recounted the events to him.', 'The second, and final, witness was Officer Kennedy. Officer Kennedy testified that at 8:16 a.m. on September 19, 2012, he was dispatched to defendant’s apartment for a domestic disturbance. Upon arriving at the scene, Officer Kennedy encountered a visibly upset Thurber standing in the driveway. Officer Kennedy called for backup when he learned that the child was inside with Peltier. Moments later three other officers arrived. Officer Kennedy testified that he made contact with defendant and told him to “calm down because he was pacing throughout inside the house.” Defense counsel interposed an objection on the same grounds raised during the state’s opening statement—that the testimony regarding the facts surrounding the charge of resisting arrest was inadmissible under Rule 404(b). The objection was overruled by the trial justice. Thereafter, Officer Kennedy testified that Peltier was not listening to the officers’ instructions and was breathing and sweating heavily. Peltier was then advised that he was being placed under arrest for domestic simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct. Officer Kennedy instructed Peltier to place his hands behind his back, but Peltier did not comply. As the officers began to place Peltier in handcuffs, he actively resisted and tried to pull the officers to the ground. Peltier continued his resistance as the officers walked him down the stairs, and at', '-3- one point he pulled all four officers against an adjoining building—causing one officer to fall down.', 'Throughout Officer Kennedy’s testimony, defense counsel continuously objected to the line of questioning detailing the circumstances of Peltier’s arrest, and he eventually moved to pass the case. After hearing argument, outside the presence of the jury, the trial justice denied defense counsel’s motion, but did grant him a continuing objection to that line of questioning. Additionally, after Officer Kennedy concluded testifying, the trial justice gave the following instruction to the jury:', '“[T]o the extent that you’ve heard testimony that on the morning in', 'question relating to Mr. Peltier’s, the defendant’s, alleged', 'misconduct during the attempt by the West Warwick Police to', 'investigate the complaint by Miss Thurber and to effectuate an', 'arrest, that conduct, of course, goes beyond the charge for which', 'Mr. Peltier is on trial here, which is, of course, simple assault,', 'domestic in nature. I’m instructing you that that evidence, the', 'evidence of the alleged misconduct during the investigation and', 'effectuating of the arrest should be considered by you only to the', 'extent that it may bear on the defendant, Mr. Peltier’s[,] state of', 'mind at the time of the offense to which he’s on trial and not for', 'any other purpose. It is not admitted for purposes of proving the', 'kind of person that Mr. Peltier is or bearing on his character.”', 'The state rested, and the defense opted not to present any witnesses. During closing arguments, attorneys for both the state and defendant referenced the fact that Peltier had resisted arrest. 1 When the prosecutor suggested that Peltier’s “demeanor [was not that] of an innocent man[,]” defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the same grounds that he had previously 1', 'Defense counsel posited to the jury that:', '“Raymond Peltier resisted arrest. He did resist arrest. An innocent person may', 'very well resist arrest when they are falsely accused of a crime. Is it right? No,', 'it’s not right. Is it legal? It’s not legal. Does it mean he’s guilty of this? No. He', 'is not guilty of assaulting her.” Also, although Peltier did not testify at trial, defense counsel argued to the jury that defendant “resisted arrest because he was angry for being arrested for something he didn’t do.”', '-4- argued. The trial justice denied the motion. 2 Peltier was found guilty of simple domestic assault.', 'On July 22, 2013, defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied by the trial justice. Defense counsel indicated that one of the bases of the motion was the fact that the circumstances of his conduct in resisting arrest came before the jury and that he was “incorporating into my argument the arguments I made throughout the trial.” In response, the trial justice informed defense counsel that “the [c]ourt incorporates the rulings I made throughout the trial on those issues.” The trial justice then sentenced Peltier to one year of probation and required him to participate in the batterer’s intervention program and substance-abuse counseling and complete forty hours of community service. 3 The defendant timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', '“In reviewing the admission or exclusion of evidence, it is well settled that ‘[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is apparent.’” State v. Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 838 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Rios, 996 A.2d 635, 638 (R.I. 2010)). When performing this abuse of discretion analysis in the context of Rule 404(b), this Court first looks to the scope of allowable proof under the rule. See Clay, 79 A.3d at 838.', '“Rule 404(b) states that ‘[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of 2', 'Defense counsel also requested that another cautionary instruction be given. The trial justice declined to do so, stating: “I already gave them the instruction. I don’t want to insult their intelligence. I told them how to consider it.” Moreover, the trial justice instructed the jury during his charge that “remarks and statements or personal opinions expressed by counsel during the trial or during their opening statements and final arguments are not evidence and are not to be considered by you as evidence during your deliberations.” There was no objection to the jury charge. 3', 'The defendant was also sentenced at this time for the charge of resisting arrest. He received an additional consecutive year of probation, also conditioned upon his engaging in the batterer’s intervention program, substance-abuse counseling, and community service.', '-5- a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.’” Clay, 79 A.3d at 838 (quoting Rule 404(b)). Conversely, if the evidence is offered “for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident,” it is admissible. Rule 404(b). “This Court has stated that ‘[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is apparent.’” State v. Gautier, 950 A.2d 400, 411 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Brown, 900 A.2d 1155, 1159 (R.I. 2006)). “In reviewing a trial justice’s admission of Rule 404(b) evidence, this Court is ‘disinclined to perceive an abuse of discretion so long as the record contains some grounds for supporting the trial justice’s decision * * *.’” Clay, 79 A.3d at 838 (quoting State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1211 (R.I. 2012)).', 'Additionally, “[e]vidence that may otherwise be admissible under Rule 404(b) is still subject to the Rule 403 [of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence] balancing test, which excludes otherwise relevant evidence ‘if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury * * *.’” Clay, 79 A.3d at 838. This is because “Rule 403 cuts across the rules of evidence and is always a consideration in a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence.” State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 152 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 148 (R.I. 2009)).', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant’s assignment of error solely relates to the admission of testimony and argument regarding the resisting-arrest charge to which defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere prior to the commencement of trial. The defendant argues that, because the assault on Thurber was completed at the time he resisted arrest, that evidence had no bearing on', '-6- defendant’s state of mind when the alleged assault occurred; he further argues that the two crimes were not so interwoven as to lead to the admissibility of evidence surrounding his arrest. Accordingly, defendant asserts that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial justice to allow introduction of facts relating to the resisting-arrest charge and that this error warrants a new trial.', 'Specifically, defendant argues that because the conduct in this case occurred after the alleged crime—as opposed to being evidence of a defendant’s prior conduct—it does not bear on the accused’s “motive, opportunity, intent, plan, common scheme, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake” when committing the charged offense. However, “we have treated the list contained within the second sentence of Rule 404(b) as examples, rather than a complete enumeration, of permitted purposes.” Rodriguez, 996 A.2d at 150.', 'Evidence of prior acts is admissible when the “prior acts are interwoven or in instances when introduction is necessary for a trier of fact to hear a complete and, it is to be hoped, coherent story so as to make an accurate determination of guilt or innocence.” Clay, 79 A.3d at 838 (quoting Rodriguez, 996 A.2d at 150-51); see also State v. Colangelo, 55 R.I. 170, 173-74, 179 A. 147, 149 (1935) (“[E]vidence of other acts * * * may be received when they are interwoven with the offense for which the defendant is being tried * * *.”). In this case, the record discloses that from the time Thurber arrived at defendant’s apartment until the time of his arrest, less than thirty minutes had elapsed. In State v. St. Jean, 554 A.2d 206, 209 (R.I. 1989), this Court held that evidence of acts which occurred twenty-three minutes before an alleged crime was admissible because it “demonstrate[d] that [the defendant] was in a particular frame of mind.” See also State v. Morey, 722 A.2d 1185, 1189 (R.I. 1999) (“Because the uncharged acts were related so closely in both time and place to the charged acts * * * committed by the defendant and were so intricately interwoven with the charged acts, their admission was proper.”', '-7- citing State v. Gomes, 690 A.2d 310, 316 (R.I. 1997); State v. Jalette, 119 R.I. 614, 627-28, 382 A.2d 526, 533-34 (1978)); and United States v. Wright, 392 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir. 2004) (“[E]vidence of [defendant’s resistance to arrest] prior to the discovery of the firearm gives the jury the body of the story, not just the ending. Such evidence was ‘inextricably intertwined’ with the charged offense.”). Simply because the challenged testimony occurred moments after Peltier assaulted Thurber does not change the fact that the acts were related “closely in both time and place” and were “intricately interwoven” with the crime on trial. See Morey, 722 A.2d at 1189.', 'Furthermore, this Court declared admissible evidence that is “related to the defendant’s consciousness of guilt with respect to the crime charged.” State v. Graham, 941 A.2d 848, 861 (R.I. 2008). In fact, consciousness of guilt is incorporated within the term “state of mind.” State v. Santos, 122 R.I. 799, 821, 413 A.2d 58, 70 (1980) (“This statement clearly manifests [the] defendant’s consciousness of guilt, which is incorporated within the term ‘state of mind.’” (emphasis added)). “[W]e have held that activities inconsistent with the defendant’s claim of innocence, such as flight, constitute circumstances bearing on the question of guilt.” State v. Acquisto, 463 A.2d 122, 129 (R.I. 1983) (concluding that threatening a witness had “independent relevance to prove a circumstance indicating consciousness of guilt on the part of the defendant caus[ing] it to be admissible in evidence”). We are satisfied that evidence that defendant resisted arrest likewise is indicative of his consciousness of guilt and is therefore admissible as evidence of an accused’s state of mind.', 'Although this Court has not had the occasion to address whether evidence of resisting arrest is indicative of consciousness of guilt, other state supreme courts have dealt with the issue. In State v. Williams, 919 A.2d 90 (N.J. 2007), the defendant was charged with reckless manslaughter in connection with a shooting death. Id. at 91. The prosecution sought to introduce', '-8- evidence of the defendant’s post-shooting cover-up, specifically hindering apprehension, tampering with a witness, tampering with evidence, and fabricating physical evidence. Id. at 91- 92. The defendant previously had been convicted of these charges in an earlier jury trial that had resulted in a mistrial on the count of reckless manslaughter. Id. The defendant argued that any post-shooting conduct would be irrelevant to the subsequent retrial on the singular charge of reckless manslaughter. Id. at 92. The New Jersey Supreme Court disagreed and concluded that conduct that occurs after the charged offense can circumstantially support inferences about the defendant’s consciousness of guilt. Id. at 96. Thus, the court determined that the defendant’s post-shooting conduct was admissible to demonstrate his consciousness of guilt. Id. at 96-97 (citing 2 John H. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law, § 276 at 122 (Chadbourn rev. 1979)); see also State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758, 769 (R.I. 2009) (“It is universally conceded today that the fact of an accused’s flight * * *, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself.” quoting 2 Wigmore, § 276 at 122 (emphasis added)); People v. Sustak, 153 N.E.2d 849, 854 (Ill. 1958) (concluding that evidence of resisting arrest was properly admitted as probative of guilt).', 'In the case before this Court, the responding officers initially were met with a distraught victim in the driveway of defendant’s apartment. The defendant was inside the apartment with his twenty-month-old daughter. When the officers first made contact with defendant, they were confronted with an agitated individual. When they attempted to effectuate an arrest, defendant actively and continuously struggled to thwart their attempts and resist arrest. The defendant continued his behavior even as the officers were escorting him down the stairs of his apartment building. This behavior is indicative of defendant’s consciousness of guilt. See Palmer, 962', '-9- A.2d at 769. The fact that resisting arrest is an independent criminal act does not negate the relevance of defendant’s action with respect to his state of mind at the time of the assault.', 'As we said in Acquisto, “a defendant has no right to be insulated from relevant truths ‘even if such truths might lead the jury to draw less favorable inferences concerning [the] defendant than if they were not exposed.’” Acquisto, 463 A.2d at 129 (quoting State v. Cline, 122 R.I. 297, 331, 405 A.2d 1192, 1210 (1979)). Additionally, “[t]he defendant is not entitled to a sanitized version of the state’s evidence against him [or her] * * *.” State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 468 (R.I. 2013). The defendant’s plea of nolo contendere to the charge of resisting arrest does not insulate him from conduct that is inextricably linked to the crime on trial. Criminal conduct need not be compartmentalized into separate categories; nor can a defendant choose which category can be excluded from trial by strategically entering a plea before trial. See State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 579 (R.I. 2009) (“A criminal trial is a search for the truth; it is not a game of chess.” quoting State v. Oster, 922 A.2d 151, 163 (R.I. 2007)). The defendant’s conduct in resisting arrest was relevant both because it was interwoven with the charged offense and because it was probative of defendant’s earlier state of mind. The jury could logically infer from such evidence that defendant’s conduct in resisting arrest was indicative of his consciousness of guilt. Allowing a defendant to preclude this relevant evidence by entering a plea of nolo contendere would be tantamount to allowing a defendant to sanitize the evidence that the state may present to a jury. See State v. Marmolejos, 990 A.2d 848, 852 (R.I. 2010) (declaring that the state has the right to present evidence establishing its case in chief).', 'The trial justice concluded that the evidence was admissible because it was interwoven with the charged offense, offered the complete story, and was indicative of the defendant’s state of mind the morning of the offense. Additionally, the trial justice in this instance offered a', '- 10 - cautionary instruction to the jury on the use of the testimony regarding the resisting arrest. “The Court presumes that members of the jury follow the trial justice’s instructions.” State v. Whitfield, 93 A.3d 1011, 1022 (R.I. 2014) (citing State v. LaRoche, 683 A.2d 989, 1000 (R.I. 1996)). It is our opinion that any prejudice to the defendant was cured by the comprehensive cautionary instruction issued by the trial justice, which was timely, appropriate, and a model of clarity. 4 For these reasons, we see no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s decision to admit evidence of the facts regarding the charge of resisting arrest.', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of conviction of the Superior Court and return the papers thereto. 4', 'In a passing reference, defendant contended that the evidence was admitted in violation of Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. We have consistently held that “[a] mere passing reference to an argument * * * without meaningful elaboration, will not suffice to merit appellate review.” State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n.19 (R.I. 2007) (citing and quoting Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n.1 (R.I. 2002) (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”)). Accordingly, defendant’s contention that the trial justice admitted the evidence in violation of Rule 403 has not been sufficiently developed for review by this Court. See id.', '- 11 -', 'Justice Robinson, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I am pleased to concur in the opinion of the majority to the extent that it holds that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting evidence of the defendant’s resisting arrest as constituting evidence of the defendant’s agitated state of mind at the time of the alleged assault. In view of the very close temporal connection between the alleged simple domestic assault and the act of resisting arrest, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the evidence for this limited purpose. However, I respectfully disassociate myself entirely from the majority’s statement that the defendant’s act of resisting arrest is “indicative of his consciousness of guilt” and its suggestion that consciousness of guilt and state of mind are largely indistinguishable concepts.', 'In the first place, I am both mystified and troubled by the choice of the majority to address an issue that is entirely unnecessary to reach—viz., the issue of consciousness of guilt. Significantly, there was no discussion provided by the parties to support any contention that defendant’s act of resisting arrest should have been admitted as evidence of his consciousness of guilt. Moreover, although the trial justice admitted evidence of defendant’s resisting arrest, he did so with an appropriately focused instruction, which simply directed the jury to consider the resistance as revealing defendant’s state of mind at the time of the alleged offense; the trial justice made no mention of consciousness of guilt. The trial justice’s instruction deftly and correctly straddled the competing interests at hand—allowing the prosecution to present its case in an understandable way, while simultaneously cautioning the jury not to draw improper and unjust inferences. As a result of that instruction, the jury had ample information upon which to reach a verdict without the necessity of considering whether the act of resisting arrest was somehow indicative of defendant’s consciousness of guilt. By unnecessarily addressing the issue of consciousness of guilt, the majority has disregarded our strong and oft articulated policy', '- 12 - favoring judicial restraint. See, e.g., Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n. 4 (R.I. 2009) (explicitly adhering to “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”); 1 Barone v. State, 93 A.3d 938, 939 n. 1 (R.I. 2014); State v. Keenan, 68 A.3d 588, 594 (R.I. 2013). It is especially disconcerting to me that the majority chooses to address this issue—which was not the basis of admission of the evidence in Superior Court according to the trial justice’s instruction—after expressly stating in its opinion that “this Court has not had the occasion to address whether evidence of resisting arrest is indicative of consciousness of guilt * * *.”', 'It is even more distressing that, in its entirely unnecessary discussion of consciousness of guilt, the majority seems to suggest that state of mind and consciousness of guilt are close to being synonymous. Unquestionably, when a person takes an action prompted by his or her consciousness of guilt, that consciousness of guilt can rightly be said to be part of that person’s state of mind. See State v. Santos, 122 R.I. 799, 821, 413 A.2d 58, 70 (1980). But state of mind is a broad and generic umbrella covering many different mental stances in addition to consciousness of guilt—including, simply by way of brief example, fear, jealousy, malice, or agitation. Moreover, a person resisting arrest could be in one of many different states of mind at the moment when he or she resists arrest. It is self-evident to me that, as a precondition to admissibility, there must be evidence from which a jury could infer that the state of mind of the person resisting arrest was consciousness of guilt and not one of the other myriad possible states of mind. 1', 'That “usual policy” of ours is consistent with the following jurisprudentially sage observation of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit: “Discretion is often the better part of valor, and courts should not rush to decide unsettled legal issues that can easily be avoided.” United States v. Gonzalez, 736 F.3d 40, 40 (1st Cir. 2013).', '- 13 -', 'Although I feel strongly that the majority has rushed in unnecessarily and imprudently in reaching the issue, in view of the fact that the majority has now opined that the act of resisting arrest is indicative of a consciousness of guilt in the instant case and not simply of an agitated state of mind, I feel compelled to forcefully state that the facts of this case do not lead me to draw the same conclusion. I am not even remotely persuaded by the majority’s argument, which in a conclusory manner treats the act of resisting arrest as the equivalent of fleeing from a crime scene. In reaching its conclusion, the majority cites two cases from jurisdictions that have addressed the issue, neither of which do I find convincing—viz., State v. Williams, 919 A.2d 90 (N.J. 2007), and People v. Sustak, 153 N.E.2d 849 (Ill. 1958). After thoroughly reviewing these cases, I am not at all persuaded that the act of resisting arrest as occurred in the instant case is indicative of consciousness of guilt. First, the defendant in Williams, 919 A.2d at 99, engaged in a cover-up after a shooting in which he was involved; the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that evidence of that cover-up was admissible to show a consciousness of guilt. In the instant case, however, without meaningful analysis, the majority treats defendant’s act of resisting arrest as somehow being factually similar to the cover-up in Williams and thereby deserving of the same evidentiary treatment. In Sustak, 153 N.E.2d at 854, the Supreme Court of Illinois admitted evidence of resisting arrest as being indicative of consciousness of guilt, but it failed to provide a meaningful explanation as to why the act of resisting arrest was actually demonstrative of that mental state.', 'There are myriad reasons, which the majority in the instant case does not acknowledge, and which Sustak, 153 N.E.2d at 854, does not discuss, that could inform a particular defendant’s resisting arrest, including that a defendant simply felt he was being unjustly arrested or because he harbored a deep and long-standing dislike for police officers in general. Therefore, in my view, Williams and Sustak are not instructive in the instant case.', '- 14 -', 'After long and careful perusal of the record, I can find no basis therein for the majority’s inference that defendant resisted arrest because he was conscious of his own guilt. Nor have we ever opined that resistance to arrest alone is sufficient to be indicative of consciousness of guilt. It is clear to me that a person may resist arrest for a variety of reasons unrelated to consciousness of guilt.', 'The majority cites to this Court’s opinion in State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758 (R.I. 2009), to support its contention that resistance to arrest is admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt in the instant case. 2 Specifically, it points to the following language in Palmer, which is actually a quotation from a treatise on the law of evidence:', '“It is universally conceded today that the fact of an accused’s flight', '* * *, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false', 'name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of', 'consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself.” Id. at 769 (quoting', '2 John H. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law, § 276 at', '122 (Chadbourn rev. 1979)). I do not believe that my position is inconsistent with what this Court said in Palmer. The quoted language does not state that resistance to arrest, by itself, is evidence of consciousness of guilt. I readily acknowledge that resistance to arrest coupled with flight or concealment or such related conduct might, in a different case, be sufficient to be admitted to show that a defendant was conscious of his or her guilt. However, such facts are strikingly absent from the case at bar.', 'What the evidence in the record in this case does disclose is that defendant was in an agitated state of mind 3 while he was engaged in very actively resisting arrest just a very few 2', 'It should be borne in mind that the behavior of the defendant that was at issue in this Court’s evidentiary discussion in State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758, 768-69 (R.I. 2009), was his engaging in flight and concealment. 3', 'I note that the majority specifically recognizes that “[w]hen the officers first made contact with defendant, they were confronted with an agitated individual.” I have been unable to', '- 15 - minutes after the confrontation with his child’s mother. I perceive no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s allowance of evidence of defendant’s having resisted arrest in the agitated manner that was testified to—from which evidence the jury could infer that he was in the same agitated state of mind at the time of the temporally proximate alleged simple assault for which he was on trial. Indeed, it is clear to me that the only logical and proper inference the jury could have reached from defendant’s actions was that he was in an agitated state of mind, not that he was conscious of his guilt.', 'For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the judgment of the majority with respect to the defendant’s resisting arrest being admissible to show his agitated state of mind, but I respectfully, yet very vigorously, dissent from every jot and tittle of the majority’s discussion of consciousness of guilt. find in the record any evidentiary basis for a conclusion that defendant’s agitated state of mind and resistance to arrest are, as the majority states, “indicative of his consciousness of guilt.”', '- 16 -', 'Justice Flaherty, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the opinion of the majority in this case. I do so because it is my opinion that the evidence that defendant resisted arrest was admitted in contravention of the provisions of Rules 404(b) 1 and 403 2 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. For the reasons that follow, I would vacate the judgment of conviction and remand this case for a new trial.', 'Rule 404(b) Should Have Barred Admission', 'In my opinion, this case stretches, beyond its limits, the admittedly elastic characteristics of Rule 404(b). At trial, evidence of defendant’s resistance to arrest, which took place both after the alleged assault had occurred and after the complaining witness had left the scene, was admitted over defendant’s objection. The mere fact that defendant may have resisted the police’s efforts to arrest him fits neither into the illustrated examples that are delineated in Rule 404(b) nor the spirit of other permitted purposes. This evidence, I submit, is the classic type of evidence that Rule 404 deems inadmissible because it tends to shed light only on a defendant’s character or disposition.', 'This evidence invited the jury to reach the forbidden inference: because 1', ""Rule 404(a) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence stands for the general proposition that “[e]vidence of a person's character or a trait of the person's character is not admissible for the purpose of proving that he or she acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion * * * .” Rule 404(b) sets forth:"", '“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character', 'of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. It', 'may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive,', 'opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or', 'accident, or to prove that defendant feared imminent bodily harm and that the fear', 'was reasonable.” 2', 'Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence states in full:', '“Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is', 'substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the', 'issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time,', 'or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”', '- 17 - defendant demonstrated aggressive tendencies towards the police, it is more likely he was aggressive towards the complaining witness as well and therefore guilty of assaulting her. This, in my opinion, is pure propensity evidence and it is exactly the type of evidence Rule 404 was promulgated to exclude.', 'In the majority’s opinion, the evidence of resisting arrest should be admitted because it tended to show a relevant fact, defendant’s state of mind, citing to State v. St. Jean, 554 A.2d 206, 208-09 (R.I. 1989), and because it tended to tell the complete story, citing to State v. Colangelo, 55 R.I. 170, 173-74, 179 A. 147, 149 (1935), and others. 3 There can be no argument that this Court has not been entirely consistent on the question of whether Rule 404(b)’s list of acceptable “other purposes” is exhaustive or not. Compare State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 1050 (R.I. 2000) (noting the “general exclusionary rule of Rule 404(b)”), with State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 150 (R.I. 2010) (“we have treated the list contained within the second sentence of Rule 404(b) as examples, rather than a complete enumeration, of permitted purposes”). However, there is no question that this Court has invariably allowed evidence of other crimes or bad acts when those acts are “interwoven with the charged offense,” and when it would “allow a trier of fact to hear a complete and, it is to be hoped, coherent story so as to make an accurate determination of guilt or innocence.” State v. Gomes, 690 A.2d 310, 316 (R.I. 1997). 3', 'The majority’s opinion equates the term “state of mind,” with “consciousness of guilt,” to justify the admissibility of defendant’s alleged resistance to arrest. To support this, the majority cites cases, whose facts I believe are far removed from this case: State v. Williams, 919 A.2d 90, 92-93 (N.J. 2007) (after a homicide, the defendant attempted to make the scene appear to be a suicide and instructed witnesses to lie to police); and People v. Sustak, 153 N.E.2d 849, 854 (Ill. 1958) (the defendant fled police and entered a tavern where he drew a weapon and wounded a responding officer). Both of these cases involved intricate post-crime conduct that was deemed admissible under the guise of “consciousness of guilt.” While I need not agree or disagree with those holdings, it is my opinion their applicability to this case is marginal. Further, I agree with Justice Robinson’s separate opinion that this issue was not part of the trial record.', '- 18 -', 'In its opinion, the majority relies on St. Jean, 554 A.2d at 208. In that case, the trial justice approved the admission of evidence that, twenty-three minutes before an accident giving rise to a charge of reckless driving, an offense that has an element of mens rea, the defendant had been involved in a ‘“tire squealing’ episode,” and had come within inches of striking another vehicle. 4 Id. The Court reasoned that the temporally proximate prior incident was relevant to the defendant’s state of mind with respect to the charge of reckless driving. Id. at 209. Although this Court has never said that it is only prior bad acts that are contemplated by Rule 404, the timing should be a consideration in the analysis of whether evidence is relevant. In the matter before us, the fact that defendant may have resisted arrest after the alleged assault is, in my opinion, less probative of whether he was similarly agitated at the time of the alleged assault. As defense counsel argued to the trial justice, “[a]n innocent person who is falsely accused of a crime * * * sometimes resists arrest.” 5', 'Further, I am not persuaded that the state needed the evidence of resisting arrest to tell a “complete and, it is to be hoped, coherent story” of the simple domestic assault. Gomes, 690 A.2d at 316. The defendant’s interaction with the police happened after the alleged assault, after the complaining witness retreated to the safety of her car in the driveway, after she called 9-1-1, and after defendant had reentered his apartment. The jury had the facts before it necessary to determine defendant’s guilt or innocence of simple assault, G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3, without being informed that defendant had not cooperated with the arresting officers. At trial, the complaining 4', 'Mens rea, Latin for “guilty mind,” is “[t]he state of mind that the prosecution, to secure a conviction, must prove that a defendant had when committing a crime * * * .” Black’s Law Dictionary 1134 (10th ed. 2014). 5', 'The trial justice went on to reply, “[i]f that’s the case, maybe that’s an explanation that can be offered by the defense.” Defense counsel then correctly stated that “the defense shouldn’t have to [offer an explanation]”; however, once the evidence was admitted he felt obligated to address it. In closing argument defense counsel said, “[a]n innocent person may very well resist arrest when they are falsely accused of a crime.”', '- 19 - witness testified, as did the responding officer who testified as to the “red marks” he saw on the complaining witness’s “arms and her face.” There was sufficient evidence before the jury and, even if Rule 404(b) is best described as an inclusive rule, “it is not all-inclusive.” United States v. Briley, 770 F.3d 267, 276 (4th Cir. 2014) (holding that admission of evidence was error because “in this instance [the contested evidence] came too close to pure propensity evidence”). 6', 'Indeed, it is instructive to see how the state made use of the contested evidence once it was determined to be admissible; in my opinion, it was argued that this evidence reflected on defendant’s character. In the prosecutor’s opening remarks he referred to the resistance to arrest and said that it would show that on the day of the incident “[the police] met with a combative person,” and, in his closing argument, the prosecutor reiterated that this conduct showed defendant lacked the “demeanor of an innocent man.” It is my opinion that these remarks were intended to cast light on defendant’s character. Because this is prohibited by Rule 404, the evidence should not have been admitted.', 'Alternatively, Rule 403 Should Have Barred the Evidence', ""In a case where there was only one witness to the alleged assault, the complaining witness, it is my opinion that this evidence was enormously prejudicial and should not have been admitted under Rule 403. It is axiomatic that “Rule 403 cuts across the rules of evidence and is always a consideration in a trial justice's ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence.” State v. Mlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 997 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 148 (R.I. 2009)).

Wright, 392 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir. 2004), but I do not believe that case supports its opinion. The defendant’s resistance to arrest is not a key piece of evidence that “gives the jury the body of the story,” it is instead the opposite; as Wright advises, it is “just the ending.” Id. (holding admission of contested evidence appropriate because it was not simply the end of the story but “inextricably intertwined”).', '- 20 - evidence of resisting arrest, there is nothing on the record that would support any conclusion that the trial justice performed a Rule 403 balancing test. Because we have consistently maintained that Rule 403 is implicated in a Rule 404(b) determination, it is my opinion that the failure to perform that analysis, in and of itself, is fatal. 7 See Mlyniec, 15 A.3d at 997.', 'It is my further opinion that, had the analysis been completed, Rule 403 nonetheless should have barred the admission of the contested evidence. Clearly, this is not an easy burden to meet. We have said that it is only “when evidence is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that a trial justice must exclude it.” State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 950 (R.I. 2008) (citing State v. Silvia, 898 A.2d 707, 717 (R.I. 2006)). However, we have held such evidence to be inadmissible when “its utility was clearly outweighed by the danger that it would confuse, mislead, and unfairly prejudice the jury.” Gaspar, 982 A.2d at 149. In Gaspar, we found that evidence of prior consensual sexual encounters had little bearing on an alleged sexual assault and it “was very likely to confuse the jury and invite an emotional response.” Id. Here, the defendant’s resistance to arrest cast very little light on whether he had earlier assaulted the complaining witness.', 'Instead, in my view, it encouraged the jury to make an emotional response, to associate the defendant with violent behaviors, and to agree with the state’s characterization of the defendant as a “combative person” who lacked the “demeanor of an innocent man.” In a case that featured limited testimony and very little physical evidence, the fact that the defendant may have been violent during the process of his arrest was, in my opinion, enormously prejudicial. 7', 'I disagree with the majority’s characterization that defendant did not properly develop his Rule 403 argument. From the record, it is clear that Rule 403 was raised and argued before the trial justice. Even though defendant’s written argument on Rule 403 before this Court was sparse, it was raised in his Rule 12A statement. See Article I, Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. Because the analysis of Rule 404(b) evidence is always bifurcated with Rule 403 considerations, I believe that it was sufficiently raised to this Court.', '- 21 -', 'For the reasons set forth above, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion of this Court.', '- 22 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

Mr. Judd testified that he wanted to carry out the robbery and that defendant “wanted to go” as well, whereas Mr. Stokes was “hesitant,” “didn’t want to do [the robbery],” and “seemed confused.” Mr. Judd stated that he, along with defendant and Mr. Stokes, drove to the next block and parked the Nissan Altima in a driveway. He added that Mr. Stokes remained in the car talking on the phone as Mr. Judd and defendant exited the vehicle.', 'It was the further testimony of Mr. Judd that, after he and defendant had raised the hoods of their sweatshirts, he went to the side door of the vehicle on the driver’s side where Mr. Moran was seated, while defendant went to the side door on the passenger side where Ms. Kovacs was seated. Mr. Judd added that, at that point, defendant engaged in a “tug-o-war[sic]” with Ms. Kovacs in an effort to take a purse. Mr. Judd further testified that, once defendant had the purse', '-4- in his possession, he began to run away. At about the same time, according to the testimony of Mr. Judd, he approached Mr. Moran, pointed the gun at his chest, and ordered him out of the car. It was the further testimony of Mr. Judd, however, that Mr. Moran then released a large dog from the car that began to chase him. Mr. Judd stated that he ran back to the Nissan Altima, where he found defendant as well as codefendant Stokes. He added that, after defendant drove the trio in the Nissan Altima to a Shell gas station, defendant handed Ms. Kovacs’s purse to codefendant Stokes, who proceeded to remove money from it and then throw it out of the window of the vehicle. The money was then divided among the three occupants of the Nissan Altima.', 'Mr. Judd further stated that, after the three men left the Shell station and began driving along Interstate 95, they were pursued by the police. He testified that, as a result, the fleeing men drove off the interstate highway while he looked for a good place where he might throw the gun—which he said that he did. Mr. Judd stated that, upon reaching Gordon Avenue, the trio abandoned the vehicle and fled. It was Mr. Judd’s further testimony that a police officer thereafter spotted him hiding under another vehicle and proceeded to place him in handcuffs. Mr. Judd explained that he was taken to a nearby “housing unit,” where he was identified by the victims. Mr. Judd also showed the police where he had thrown the gun, and he was then brought to the police station; there, he spoke to the police about the robbery and identified defendant and Mr. Stokes as the other men involved in the criminal activity.', '2. The Testimony of Joan Kovacs2', 'Ms. Kovacs testified that she had been consuming alcoholic beverages at Paul Moran’s house on Georgia Avenue for “a couple of hours” on the morning of the robbery. Ms. Kovacs stated that, while she was sitting with Mr. Moran in her car in front of his house, she observed a 2', 'At the time of trial, Paul Moran (the other victim of the robbery) was unable to testify due to the fact that he was hospitalized.', '-5- “dark gray” “Nissan or Altima” enter the “next-door neighbor’s yard.” She further testified that she saw two “black boys wearing [black] hoods” approach the car and that she noticed that one of them had a “[s]ilver” handgun. According to Ms. Kovacs, one of those individuals went to the driver’s side (where Mr. Moran was seated), while the other came to her side of the vehicle and showed her the gun. Ms. Kovacs testified that she was in fear and that, “[b]ecause of the gun,” she turned over her purse, which contained between $1,000 and $2,000 in cash; upon being further questioned, she denied that there was a “tug-of-war” over the purse.', '3. The Testimony of Kevin Perkins', 'Kevin Perkins, a neighbor of Paul Moran, testified that, on the morning of January 13, 2009, he had spoken with Mr. Moran and Ms. Kovacs while they were sitting in a car in front of Mr. Moran’s home. It was Mr. Perkins’ testimony that, as he was walking away, he observed “two kids” near a gray car parked in a neighbor’s “yard.” Mr. Perkins recalled that the hood of at least one of the “kids” was raised. Mr. Perkins further testified that he continued walking away and that he then observed Mr. Moran’s dog chasing a young man who jumped into the back seat of the gray car as it was driving away. Mr. Perkins acknowledged that, later that day, he had been taken by the police to observe the vehicle abandoned by the suspects on Gordon Avenue, which he identified as the same gray car that he had seen the morning of the robbery.', '4. The Testimony of Detective Stephen Gencarella', 'Detective Stephen Gencarella of the Providence Police Department’s robbery squad testified that, on January 13, 2009, upon hearing a police broadcast that an armed robbery had occurred and that the suspects had abandoned their vehicle near the corner of Gallop Street and Gordon Avenue, he went to that area. He stated that, while canvassing the surrounding area for suspects, he observed a black male jump over a fence and begin running; he added that he', '-6- pursued and apprehended that person. At trial, Detective Gencarella identified defendant as being the person whom he had pursued and apprehended on the day of the robbery.', '5. The Testimony of Officer David DePina', 'Officer David DePina of the Providence Police Department testified that, on February 2, 2009, having been dispatched to Narragansett Avenue, he met with a person (not previously known to him) who had come across a gun; he said that that person pointed out the gun on the sidewalk in front of 116 Narragansett Avenue. A loaded .32 caliber revolver, silver in color and with a black handle was recovered from the sidewalk. At trial, he identified the gun in photographs shown to him as the gun that had been pointed out to him at 116 Narragansett Avenue.', 'D. The Motions for Judgment of Acquittal', 'After the prosecution rested on November 8, 2010, defendant moved, pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, for a judgment of acquittal with respect to Counts One through Five of the indictment; he based that motion on what he contended was the insufficiency of the evidence presented by the prosecution. The trial justice denied defendant’s Rule 29 motion in its entirety.', 'Codefendant Stokes also moved pursuant to Rule 29 for a judgment of acquittal with respect to Counts One through Six of the indictment. The trial justice granted Mr. Stokes’s motion in part, finding that there was insufficient evidence from which a jury could find codefendant Stokes guilty of the conspiracy charge (Count Four) beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial justice found that codefendant Stokes did not participate in any way in the robbery from Ms. Kovacs or in the assault with intent to rob of Mr. Moran. The trial justice said that, for that reason, codefendant Stokes could not be found vicariously liable for the alleged criminal conduct', '-7- of defendant or Mr. Judd as a coconspirator; and the trial justice expressly cited the leading case of Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S. 640 (1946). Accordingly, the trial justice granted Mr. Stokes’s Rule 29 motion only with respect to Counts Two through Five, and he reduced the charge of first-degree robbery (Count One) to the lesser included charge of receiving stolen property. The trial justice denied Mr. Stokes’s motion for acquittal as to Count Six, the charge of carrying a handgun without a license.', 'At the close of all the evidence, defendant, having opted not to present any evidence, renewed his Rule 29 motion for a judgment of acquittal. In reference to the conspiracy charge (Count Four), defendant stated that the state must prove the involvement of at least two people in a conspiracy; and defendant then argued that, in view of that principle and the fact that codefendant Stokes had been acquitted on the conspiracy count and that Mr. Judd was not charged as a coconspirator, defendant must be acquitted of the conspiracy charge. Ruling in a manner that was consistent with defendant’s reasoning and citing State v. DeSanto, 603 A.2d 744 (R.I. 1992), the trial justice granted defendant’s Rule 29 motion as to the conspiracy charge.', 'The trial justice also noted that Mr. Judd’s use of a gun in the attempted robbery of Mr. Moran could not be imputed to defendant under the theory of coconspirator liability in view of the fact that Mr. Judd had not been indicted in the instant case. Accordingly, the trial justice reduced the first-degree robbery charge against defendant to that of second-degree robbery. The trial justice stated: “The case will go to the jury with regard to Mr. Gadson only as to Joan Kovacs, either as second-degree robbery or as larceny from the person.”', 'E. The Jury Instructions and the Ensuing Verdict', 'After both the prosecution and the defense had made their closing arguments, the trial justice instructed the jury as to the “Verdict Form;” he stated in pertinent part:', '-8-', '“[W]ith respect to Nayquan Gadson, it asks whether or not you', 'find him guilty * * * of second-degree robbery [from] Joan', 'Kovacs. * * * [T]hen you should ask yourselves whether or not he', 'committed the lesser offense, as I’ve explained to you, of larceny', 'from the person. There’s a line for that as well. If you find', '[defendant] guilty of second-degree robbery, then you need not', 'consider the issue as to whether he’s guilty of the lesser included', 'offense of larceny.”', 'After deliberating, the jury returned to the courtroom to render its verdict. Of pertinence to this appeal, the foreman orally announced that defendant was guilty of second-degree robbery but not guilty of larceny from the person.3', 'Outside the presence of the jury, the trial justice stated that defendant was “exonerated,” but the prosecutor interjected that defendant had been found guilty of second-degree robbery. At that point, the trial justice, looking at the verdict form, stated that he had “misheard [the verdict] entirely.” The jury was escorted back into the courtroom, at which time the trial justice made the following statement:', '“Ladies and gentlemen, I’m sorry to trouble you, but some of the', 'lawyers and, indeed, the Court misheard the foreman’s', 'announcement as to the nature of the verdict. The prosecutors', 'heard one thing. The defense heard another. I heard a different', 'thing.” The trial justice had the verdict form passed back to the foreman, who stated that the verdict form accurately reflected the finding of the jury to the effect that defendant was guilty of second- degree robbery.4 The jurors were then polled individually, and the foreman’s statement was 3', 'The jury found codefendant Stokes guilty of receiving stolen property and not guilty of unlawfully carrying a pistol without a license. 4', 'The verdict form, as it was provided to the jury, reads in pertinent part as follows:', '“DO YOU FIND DEFENDANT NAYQUAN GADSON GUILTY OR NOT', 'GUILTY OF THE FOLLOWING OFFENSES:', '-9- unanimously confirmed. However, neither the foreman nor the individual jurors were asked to report a finding as to the charge of larceny from the person that was included on the verdict form but had been left blank. At that point, the following significant exchange took place:', '“[Defense Counsel]: The only thing I would add, Your Honor, is', 'that not reflected on the jury verdict form is that Madam Clerk', 'asked the jury foreman, as to the larceny, whether they found', 'guilty or not guilty, and they did indicate not guilty, but we knew', 'that was a lesser included charge, and that is not indicated or', 'marked as to section 1(a), larceny from the person, which I don’t', 'believe is necessary in any event.', '“[Trial Justice]: All right. I don’t know, frankly, at this point,', 'what the court reporter’s notes indicate, but, since it’s a lesser', 'included offense, he was found guilty of the second degree murder', '(sic), the larceny from person is of no moment. Agreed?', '“[Defense Counsel]: Second-degree robbery, yes, Your Honor.', '“[Trial Justice]: Thank you; correct. It’s of no moment, correct?', '“[Defense Counsel]: Correct, Your Honor. I agree.”', 'On December 9, 2011, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. In due course, defendant was sentenced to a total of thirty years imprisonment, with twelve years to serve and the remaining eighteen years suspended, with probation. The defendant appealed to this Court.', '1. SECOND DEGREE ROBBERY OF JOAN KOVACS:', 'GUILTY________ NOT GUILTY _________', '1A. LARCENY FROM THE PERSON OF JOAN KOVACS:', 'GUILTY________ NOT GUILTY _________”', 'We note that, after the jury had deliberated, the line on the verdict form relating to “GUILTY” with respect to the second-degree robbery charge was marked with an “X,” while both the “GUILTY” and “NOT GUILTY” lines with respect to the charge of larceny from the person were left blank.', '- 10 -', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred: (1) in failing to dismiss the second- degree robbery charge in view of what defendant contends was a “not guilty” finding by the jury on the lesser included offense of larceny from the person; (2) in denying defendant’s motion to sever Count Six, which charged codefendant Stokes (and him alone) with carrying a handgun without a license; and (3) in denying defendant’s motion in limine seeking to “preclude the State from submitting or referring to: * * * any alleged connection between Gadson and the firearm used by Judd to commit the robbery.”', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A. The Failure to Dismiss the Robbery Charge', 'The defendant contends that the trial judge should have dismissed the robbery charge against him after the jury foreman announced a verdict of not guilty on the lesser included charge of larceny from the person.', ""This Court’s settled raise or waive rule “requires parties to raise an issue first in the trial court before raising it on appeal.” See, e.g., State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 (R.I. 2011) (“This Court staunchly adheres to the ‘raise or waive’ rule, which requires parties to raise an issue first in the trial court before raising it on appeal.”); State v. Hak, 963 A.2d 921, 927 (R.I. 2009) (“This Court's familiar raise-or-waive rule precludes us from considering issues at the appellate level that were not properly presented before the trial court.”); Bouchard v. Clark, 581 A.2d 715, 716 (R.I. 1990). A corollary principle is that this Court will not review issues that were not presented to the trial court “in such a posture as to alert the trial justice to the question"", '- 11 - being raised.” Pollard v. Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429, 433 (R.I. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Diefenderfer, 970 A.2d 12, 30 (R.I. 2009); State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828–29 (R.I. 2008).', 'Our review of the record reveals that defense counsel did not at any point during the colloquy that followed the jury’s rendering of its verdict assert that the jury foreman’s oral announcement of a not-guilty verdict on the lesser included charge of larceny from the person required acquittal on the more serious charge of second-degree robbery. The defendant seeks to raise that issue for the first time on appeal.', 'It is true that, after the jury had been polled individually with respect to the finding of guilt on the charge of second-degree robbery, defense counsel drew the trial justice’s attention to the fact that the jury foreman had initially announced a verdict of not guilty with respect to the larceny charge whereas no such verdict was indicated on the verdict form. However, the fatal flaw in defendant’s argument before this Court is that he explicitly told the trial justice that he did not believe that it was necessary that there be an indication on the verdict form of the jury’s verdict concerning the charge of larceny from the person. Defense counsel went as far as to expressly agree with the trial justice that the charge of larceny from the person was “of no moment” in view of the fact that defendant had been found guilty of second-degree robbery. Accordingly, it is our view that defendant did not properly preserve this issue for appeal; therefore, we shall proceed to consider the next issue on appeal.', 'B. Joinder and the Motion to Sever', 'The defendant contends that he was unduly prejudiced by the joinder of Count Six, which related only to codefendant Stokes, in the same indictment with Counts One through Five, which related to both defendants. In order to evaluate defendant’s contention, we look to Rule 8 and', '- 12 - Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. See State v. Cassey, 543 A.2d 670, 673-74 (R.I. 1988); see also State v. Pereira, 973 A.2d 19, 25-28 (R.I. 2009).', 'We shall begin our inquiry by determining whether, as defendant asserts, it was inappropriate under Rule 8 to bring a single indictment against both defendants instead of charging them in two separate indictments. While it is not entirely clear which subsection of Rule 8 defendant contends was violated,5 we have carefully scrutinized the record, and we perceive nothing therein that would cause us to conclude that the joinder of Count Six against codefendant Stokes with Counts One through Five against both defendants constituted a violation of either subsection. Whether viewed through the prism of Rule 8(a) or Rule 8(b), there is more than sufficient relationship between the factual basis of Count Six and the factual bases of Counts One through Five to justify their joinder as a matter of law. Accordingly, we next turn to defendant’s contention that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to sever under Rule 14.6', 'Even when (as in this case) joinder under Rule 8 is proper, a defendant may nonetheless seek to show that he or she faces the possibility of being prejudiced to such an extent that relief from joinder is appropriate under Rule 14. See, e.g., Pereira, 973 A.2d at 25-28. This Court has repeatedly stated that severance under Rule 14 is “not a matter of right but rather is an issue 5', 'Rule 8(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure is entitled “Joinder of Offenses,” while Rule 8(b) is entitled “Joinder of Defendants.” 6', 'The pertinent portion of Rule 14 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure reads as follows:', '“If it appears that a defendant or the State is prejudiced by a', 'joinder of offenses or of defendants in an indictment, information,', 'or complaint or by such joinder for trial together, the court may', 'order an election or separate trials of counts, grant a severance of', 'defendants or provide whatever other relief justice requires.”', ""- 13 - directed to the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Ashness, 461 A.2d 659, 668 (R.I. 1983); see State v. Botas, 71 A.3d 430, 433 (R.I. 2013); State v. Vanasse, 593 A.2d 58, 66 (R.I. 1991); Cassey, 543 A.2d at 673. In considering whether there is sufficient prejudice to warrant severance, the trial justice must balance “efficiency and convenience in judicial administration on the one hand and the defendant's right to a fair trial without prejudice on the other.” State v. Viveiros, 45 A.3d 1232, 1241 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Pereira, 973 A.2d at 28; State v. Day, 898 A.2d 698, 705 (R.I. 2006). Accordingly, “denial of a motion to sever will not be reversed on [appellate] review unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion.” Cassey, 543 A.2d at 673; see Vanasse, 593 A.2d at 66; see also State v. Goulet, 21 A.3d 302, 309 (R.I. 2011). To prevail in an effort to show that a trial justice has abused his or her discretion in this regard, “[t]he defendant must affirmatively show that in fact he has suffered prejudice as a result of the joint trial to the extent that it has impinged upon his right to a fair trial.” Cassey, 543 A.2d at 673; see Ashness, 461 A.2d at 669; State v. Gibbons, 418 A.2d 830, 835 (R.I. 1980)."", 'In our judgment, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant’s motion to sever. The evidence which the state needed to introduce in order to meet its burden of proof with respect to Count Six (which related to Mr. Stokes’s possession of a handgun on January 12, 2009) would be easily distinguishable by a reasonable jury as being applicable only to Mr. Stokes and not to defendant. See Cassey, 543 A.2d at 674 (holding that denial of the motion to sever was not an abuse of discretion where the evidence was relatively simple and straightforward and the jury would have no significant difficulty in separating out the evidence against each defendant); see also Day, 898 A.2d at 705. Moreover, in our opinion, a charge of possession of a handgun without a license is not the type of charge that would tend to confuse', '- 14 - and mislead the jury, nor is it a charge that would cause the jurors to become more easily convinced of defendant’s guilt with respect to the robbery than would be the case in the absence of such evidence. See Zafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 539 (1993) (stating that severance should be granted “only if there is a serious risk that a joint trial would * * * prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence”). In addition, and significantly, among the instructions given to the jury before it began deliberations was one that specifically instructed the jury not to let the guilt or innocence of one defendant influence its verdict with respect to the other defendant.', 'In addition, we are not persuaded that defendant has shown that he in fact suffered real and substantial prejudice from the joinder of Count Six to such a degree that he was denied a fair trial. See Day, 898 A.2d at 705 (“It is not sufficient for the defendant to cite the potential for and the likelihood of prejudice. His burden is to demonstrate substantial prejudice resulting from the joinder.”) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); Ashness, 461 A.2d at 669 (“Mere allegations of potential prejudice are not sufficient. The defendant must support his motion with more than a showing of disadvantage.”). We note that Mr. Stokes was ultimately acquitted of unlawfully carrying a handgun without a license. Moreover, defendant was not convicted of any crime involving a firearm since the trial justice reduced the first-degree robbery charge against him to that of the lesser included offense of second-degree robbery, which offense is statutorily defined as “robbery or other larceny from the person by force or threat, where there is no weapon and no injury * * * .” Section 11-39-1(b). In the absence of a showing of substantial prejudice or unfairness that would outweigh this Court’s consideration of the trial justice’s legitimate concerns for judicial economy, we perceive no basis for holding that the trial justice abused his discretion in denying defendant’s motion to sever Count Six.', '- 15 -', 'C. The Motion in Limine', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion in limine seeking to “preclude the State from submitting or referring to: * * * any alleged connection between Gadson and the firearm used by Judd to commit the robbery.” “The preliminary grant or denial of an in limine motion need not be taken as a final determination of the admissibility of the evidence referred to in the motion.” State v. Torres, 787 A.2d 1214, 1220 (R.I. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 238 (R.I. 2008). This Court has consistently held that a failure to object “in the vital context of the trial itself (except where the in limine ruling was unequivocally definitive) [constitutes] a waiver of the evidentiary objection and [is] therefore an issue that may not be raised on appeal.” State v. Andujar, 899 A.2d 1209, 1222 (R.I. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 108 (R.I. 2005) (“[E]xcept when the in limine ruling is clearly definitive, it would at the very least be prudent for counsel to articulate the objection once again in the vital context of the trial itself.”) (emphasis in original). In the present case, the record does not reflect that the trial justice’s ruling on the defendant’s motion at issue was “unequivocally definitive.” Andujar, 899 A.2d at 1222. Therefore, we conclude that the defendant did not preserve this evidentiary challenge for appellate review because defense counsel did not renew his objection to the admission of the contested evidence at the trial itself.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction.

62,: State v. : Antonio O. Whitfield. :,reversal,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case stems from the brutal, late-night beating of a young man that occurred on the East Side of Providence. The complainant suffered a head wound that required eight stitches, a severe concussion, a broken nose, and multiple lacerations and contusions over his entire body. After a four-day jury trial, the defendant, Antonio O. Whitfield (Whitfield or defendant), was convicted of two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of simple assault for his role in the fracas. On appeal, the defendant argues that (1) the trial justice abused his discretion by allowing the state to impeach his credibility with fourteen prior criminal convictions and (2) the trial justice erred by denying defense counsel’s motion to pass the case after the prosecutor allegedly vouched for the credibility of two witnesses during her closing argument. The parties appeared before this Court on February 25, 2014, pursuant to an order directing them to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. We are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the convictions.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'Michael Newell (Newell or complainant) lived in a third-floor apartment on Angell Street in Providence.', 'The basement of the building housed a club: the Liquid Lounge.', 'At approximately 3:30 a.m. on November 27, 2008, a friend of Newell’s—a bouncer at the Liquid Lounge—knocked on his door and asked whether Newell had a wire coat hanger because another Liquid Lounge employee, named Kelsey, was locked out of her car. Although he could not find a wire hanger, Newell went outside to assist Kelsey with her attempts to access her vehicle, which was parked in the driveway adjacent to the building.', 'Within minutes, Newell watched as another female employee left work and began walking down Angell Street toward her car. She did not walk far. A black Dodge Charger stopped on Angell Street and the occupants began shouting catcalls at the woman, who immediately turned around and began walking back toward the group gathered in the vicinity of Kelsey’s car, which included the complainant, Kelsey, three Liquid Lounge bouncers, and two patrons. Undeterred, the Charger reversed direction and pulled into the driveway where the group was standing. At that point, Newell and the bouncers told those in the Charger to leave. According to Newell, rather than depart, the occupants of the Charger responded by hurling unopened beer bottles at them from the rear driver’s side window.', 'Newell testified that as he approached the rear driver’s side door of the Charger, he was pulled through the window of the vehicle, and the Charger backed out of the driveway and sped forward about 150 feet. When the vehicle came to a stop, the door opened, and Newell fell to the ground. As he attempted to stand, he was struck in the temple with an unopened beer bottle and again fell to the ground. Newell was repeatedly kicked and stomped on his head and upper body by three individuals for an extended period of time. Newell testified that he knew that there were', '-2- three assailants during the attack because there were distinct sets of legs and feet simultaneously assaulting him; however, he could not see the faces of his attackers.1 According to Newell, the bouncers finally reached the Charger and attempted to intervene. Eventually, the police arrived on the scene; Newell was transported to Rhode Island Hospital, where he received eight stitches around his temple. Newell also suffered “a severe concussion, a broken nose, and multiple lacerations and contusions from head to toe.”', 'A Providence police officer and a Brown University security officer responded to the melee: Providence police officer Joshua Greeno (Officer Greeno) and Brown University security officer Nicholas Gonsalves (Gonsalves).', 'Gonsalves was on foot patrol—checking the University’s Environmental Lab—when he heard a loud commotion coming from Angell Street. Gonsalves testified that as he walked toward the noise, he saw a Dodge Charger stopped in the middle of the road and that individuals in the car and on the sidewalk were shouting at each other. Gonsalves testified that a beer bottle was thrown from the rear of the vehicle towards Newell, who was standing on the sidewalk.', 'Gonsalves then saw Newell approach the vehicle “towards the rear window” and “actually go into the vehicle,” at which time the car started to move and then abruptly stopped.2 Gonsalves testified that three men exited the vehicle: “[t]he driver, * * * a lighter-skinned male; a rear passenger, * * * also a lighter-skinned male; and a darker-skinned male, [from] the front passenger side, who later identified himself to police as Keeron Hardmon.” “Keeron Hardmon” was later identified as defendant, Antonio Whitfield. Gonsalves made an in-court identification 1', 'Newell also admitted that he had consumed about eight beers that night. 2', 'It is not clear from the direct examination of Gonsalves whether he was referring to the driver’s or passenger’s side rear window. Furthermore, in contrast to Newell’s testimony, during his cross-examination, Gonsalves testified that the car moved only one to two feet forward.', '-3- of defendant.3 Gonsalves testified that defendant threw a beer bottle at Newell, striking him in the face. He next saw a white male approach the vehicle from the sidewalk, and a fight ensued between Newell, defendant, “the other darker-skinned male,” and the white male who had just approached.4 Gonsalves testified that defendant and “the other male” got Newell and the other man onto the ground and began kicking them; the kicks were so forceful that Gonsalves could hear “knocking sounds” from his vantage point fifty feet away.', 'According to Gonsalves, he did not approach the fracas because his job was limited to that of a security officer with no arrest power; however, he broadcast a call to Brown University police.', 'Within minutes, a police cruiser approached with audible sirens.', 'At that point, Gonsalves saw two assailants return to the vehicle, while defendant fled on foot. The vehicle was stopped by police, and a Brown University police unit located defendant and brought him back to the scene for a show-up. Gonsalves identified him as one of the assailants.', 'While these events were unfolding, Officer Greeno arrived on the scene to find Newell on the ground. He then learned that the black Dodge Charger had been stopped by the police a short distance away, with two suspects in the vehicle and that the third suspect also had been apprehended.', 'After the close of the state’s case, defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal was denied by the trial justice. Before the start of the defense’s case, defense counsel inquired about whether the state intended to introduce defendant’s prior convictions, in the event he testified on 3', 'For clarity, when the officers refer to “Keeron Hardmon,” we will refer to that person as defendant because no identity issue was raised and defendant later admitted to having an ID bearing that name. 4', 'It is unclear who the “other darker-skinned male” is, given that Gonsalves initially testified that two “lighter-skinned” males and only one “darker-skinned male”—whom he identified as defendant—exited the vehicle.', '-4- his own behalf. The state sought to admit fourteen prior convictions, and defendant argued that the convictions were inadmissible under Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. The trial justice, however, overruled defendant’s motion and allowed the prior convictions in accordance with Rule 609.', 'The defendant testified in his own defense and gave an account of the events that markedly differed from the state’s case. According to defendant, in the early morning hours of November 27, 2008, he had just left a club in Providence with two friends: Mario and Kenny. As Kenny proceeded down Angell Street, Mario was trying to talk to a girl, but she “was running away from something.” According to defendant, Kenny then reversed direction and pulled into a parking lot where there was a group of men. The defendant testified that the group of men started hitting the car and yelling obscenities. The defendant contends that, while he sat in the rear driver’s side seat, someone hit him in the face and then tried to pull him through the window. He did not, however, identify that man as Newell. At the same time, a similar altercation began through the front passenger window, but that passenger—presumably Mario— got out of the car. The defendant testified that he was unable to exit the vehicle because of the child locks, but that the door was opened from the outside. At that point, according to defendant, a fight erupted with him and Mario against four or five other people. The defendant admitted that he had a beer bottle in the car, but testified that it fell to the ground when he was pulled partially through the window. He denied throwing a beer bottle or striking anyone with it. The defendant testified that, during the altercation, he turned around “like when everybody went to go run back to the car, because there [were] so many other people, [and] the car was gone, Kenny had left.” Knowing that the police were coming, defendant testified that he ran away because he knew he had an outstanding warrant for failure to pay court fines.', '-5-', 'On cross-examination, defendant’s credibility was impeached through the introduction of his fourteen prior criminal convictions. The trial justice immediately gave a limiting instruction, informing the jury that evidence of defendant’s prior convictions could only be considered in relation to his credibility and not for propensity purposes. Additionally, on cross-examination, defendant stated that he did not give the police the name “Keeron Hardmon,” but that he had his cousin’s ID in his pocket, and the police took that ID as his. The defendant admitted that he did not correct the police officers’ misimpression regarding his identity because he was aware of the outstanding warrant for his arrest.', 'On two occasions during the prosecutor’s closing arguments, defense counsel objected and moved to pass the case. The defendant argued that the prosecutor’s remarks amounted to a comment on his right to remain silent and also alleged that the prosecutor had vouched for the credibility of Officer Greeno.5 The trial justice refused to pass the case, but stated that he would give a limiting instruction on both points.', 'Although defense counsel wanted a limiting instruction in the event the trial justice refused to pass the case, he argued nonetheless that he did not think that “there’s any instruction that can cure the prejudice that’s inured to Mr. Whitfield.” In addition to an instruction regarding defendant’s right to remain silent, the trial justice instructed the jury that the drawing of inferences and the assessment of credibility is a function exclusively reserved for the jury.', 'The defendant was found guilty on all counts: assault with a dangerous weapon (beer bottle), assault with a dangerous weapon (shod foot), and simple assault. After trial, defendant moved for a new trial, and the trial justice denied the motion. He was sentenced to four years at the Adult Correctional Institutions with six months to serve and three-and-a-half years suspended 5', 'The right to remain silent issue is not before us on appeal.', '-6- with probation on count 1; four years with six months to serve and three-and-a-half years suspended with probation on count 2, to run concurrently with count 1; and one year suspended with probation on count 3.', 'Additionally, defendant was ordered to complete an anger management program and to pay $5,178.58 in restitution for the victim’s medical bills.', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews evidentiary rulings under an abuse of discretion standard. See State v. Tetreault, 31 A.3d 777, 782 (R.I. 2011). A trial justice “has broad discretion in deciding whether or not to admit evidence of prior convictions under Rule 609.” Id. (quoting State v. Silvia, 898 A.2d 707, 718 (R.I. 2006)). “‘This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s finding regarding the admissibility of prior conviction evidence for impeachment purposes unless our review of the record reveals an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice’ that prejudices the complaining party.” Id. (quoting State v. Rodriquez, 731 A.2d 726, 731 (R.I. 1999)).', 'Similarly, “a decision to pass a case and declare a mistrial are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. McRae, 31 A.3d 785, 789 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Suero, 721 A.2d 426, 429 (R.I. 1998)). This Court defers to the trial justice on such a motion because he or she “has a ‘front row seat,’ allowing him or her to ‘best determine the effect of the improvident remarks upon the jury.’” Id. (quoting State v. Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198, 1207 (R.I. 1995)). “As such, the trial justice’s determination concerning the prejudicial effect of evidence and the jury’s ability to render a fair and impartial verdict are reviewed by this Court under an abuse of discretion standard.” Id.', '-7-', 'Analysis', 'Prior Criminal Convictions', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice abused his discretion by allowing the state to impeach his credibility with fourteen prior criminal convictions. The defendant accumulated those fourteen convictions in less than five years after his eighteenth birthday. The convictions include possession of marijuana, operating under the influence of alcohol, resisting arrest, and numerous assaults and batteries, among other offenses. In his ruling, the trial justice considered defendant’s “series of crimes”—detailing the different types of offenses involved—and, although he was concerned about the jury’s potential consideration of the convictions as propensity evidence, he concluded that the potential danger to defendant could be cured by a limiting instruction at the appropriate time.', '“Rule 609 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence permits the admission of a witness’s prior conviction to attack that witness’s credibility unless the court determines that the prejudicial effect of the conviction substantially outweighs its probative value.” McRae, 31 A.3d at 791. “In making a determination under Rule 609, a trial justice must consider the remoteness of the conviction, the nature of the crime, and the defendant’s disdain for the law as reflected by his or her criminal record.” Tetreault, 31 A.3d at 784. Rhode Island’s Rules of Evidence do not limit the types of prior criminal convictions that may be admitted to impeach a witness, as opposed to the more limited set of convictions set forth in Rule 609 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, because this Court has declared that “the jury should be able to consider whether or not a person who has previously broken the law may have such disrespect for the law as to render him or her unwilling to abide by the oath requiring truthfulness while testifying.” State v. Remy, 910 A.2d 793, 798 (R.I. 2006).', '-8-', 'In 2011, this Court decided two cases on nearly the same issue as presented in this case. In Tetreault, 31 A.3d at 781-82, 783, the trial justice allowed the state to impeach the defendant with fifteen prior convictions which spanned sixteen years. On appeal, the defendant argued that eleven of the fifteen convictions were too remote and unduly prejudicial. Id. at 783. We agreed with the trial justice that “given defendant’s long and continuous record of criminal behavior throughout most of his adult life, the jury was entitled to consider the proffered convictions.” Id. at 784. Accordingly, we upheld the admission of the convictions “[i]n light of the defendant’s voluminous criminal record and the probative value of prior convictions as bearing on his credibility as a witness * * *.” Id.', 'In McRae, 31 A.3d at 791, the trial justice allowed the state to impeach the defendant with seven prior convictions. On appeal, the defendant argued that three different categories of prior convictions were inadmissible: convictions involving “assaultive behavior,” misdemeanor convictions, and a conviction for obtaining food or accommodations with the intent to defraud. Id. at 792-93. We held that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion as to any of the groups of crimes for impeachment purposes. Id. Specifically, although the defendant was charged with domestic assault, we held that the defendant’s prior “assaultive” convictions were no more prejudicial than those admitted in other cases decided by this Court. Id. at 792.', 'Here, because at the time of trial all of defendant’s prior convictions were less than five years old, none of the convictions were remote. While some of defendant’s prior convictions were for assault and battery—the same type of offense with which defendant was charged—we repeatedly have declared, most recently in McRae, 31 A.3d at 792, that the similarity of the prior offenses does not render them per se inadmissible for the purpose of impeaching a testifying defendant’s character for truthfulness. Finally, although his record was not as lengthy as the', '-9- defendant’s record in Tetreault, defendant nonetheless displayed his disdain for the law by accumulating fourteen adult criminal convictions before his twenty-third birthday. A crime spree spanning fewer than five years that resulted in fourteen criminal convictions is relevant on the issue of whether a testifying defendant will honor his oath to testify truthfully, given his demonstrated disrespect for the law. Thus, considering the factors set out in Tetreault, the prejudicial effect of evidence of defendant’s prior convictions did not substantially outweigh their probative value. In addition, we note that the trial justice gave a limiting instruction to the jury before the prosecutor asked a series of questions about his prior convictions. Accordingly, in these circumstances, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion by allowing the state to impeach defendant’s credibility with his prior criminal convictions.', 'Motion to Pass', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred by denying defense counsel’s motion to pass the case after the prosecutor allegedly vouched for the credibility of two witnesses during her closing argument.', 'First, we must address whether and to what extent this issue was preserved. To preserve an objection to a prosecutor’s closing argument, defense counsel “must not only make an objection at the time, but must make a request for cautionary instructions * * * or move for a mistrial.” State v. Horton, 871 A.2d 959, 964 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Portes, 840 A.2d 1131, 1141 (R.I. 2004)).', 'Although defendant contends that the prosecutor vouched for the credibility of Gonsalves, it is clear that defense counsel made no objection during the prosecutor’s remarks concerning Gonsalves. Defense counsel’s two objections, posited during closing argument, solely related to the prosecutor’s comments about defendant’s flight from the scene (which defendant does not contest on appeal) and the prosecutor’s comments about Officer Greeno', '- 10 - (which are discussed below). Therefore, the issue of the prosecutor vouching for Gonsalves is waived. See Horton, 871 A.2d at 964 (noting that the defendant must object at the time of the comment and either request a cautionary instruction or move for a mistrial to preserve a claim of prejudicial error in a closing argument).', 'Regarding the prosecutor’s remark about Officer Greeno, it is the state’s position that the issue was not preserved because defense counsel failed to move for a mistrial or object to the trial justice’s cautionary instruction. Although the state contends that the transcript of the hearing at sidebar is clear on this point, we are not convinced. The defendant raised two objections in a single, mid-argument sidebar, and each objection separately was argued by counsel.', 'The trial justice declared that he would give a cautionary instruction as to each objection. Defense counsel immediately responded, “Just note, Judge, my exception. I don’t think there’s any instruction that can cure the prejudice that’s inured to Mr. Whitfield.” Because the trial justice’s ruling encompassed both of defendant’s objections, it is unclear whether defendant’s exception related to one objection or to both. We are cognizant of the setting: the parties and the trial justice were at sidebar, in the midst of a closing argument, during a criminal trial that spanned several days. A fair reading of defense counsel’s remark is that he was objecting to the trial justice’s refusal to pass the case and to give a cautionary instruction as to both of his objections. Therefore, we conclude that the issue was preserved for our review.', 'Satisfied that the issue properly is before us, we next address whether the prosecutor’s comments about Officer Greeno actually constitute vouching for the credibility of a witness. During closing argument, the prosecutor stated, “Do you think Officer Greeno, who appears, I would suggest to you, to be a very by-the-book officer, he stood there at military attention the whole time that he testified to you, do you think he’s going to risk his career?” This sentence', '- 11 - contains two remarks of questionable appropriateness: the reference to Officer Greeno being a “by-the-book officer” and the reference to the risk to the officer’s career, presumably in the event that he gave false testimony. We address the latter instance first.', 'The proper divide between appropriate remarks about an officer’s credibility and improper comments regarding the impact of perjured testimony on an officer’s career can be difficult to discern. This tension was highlighted in a decision by the Court of Appeals of Maryland when confronted with the following closing argument by a state’s attorney:', '“You have to weigh the credibility of each individual. Who has a', 'motive to tell you the truth. The Officer in this case would have to', 'engage in a lot of lying, in a lot of deception and a conspiracy of', 'his own to come in here and tell you that what happened was not', 'true. He would have to risk everything he has worked for. He', 'would have to perjure himself on the stand.', '“* * *', '“[Y]ou have to understand that Officer Williams has no motive to', 'lie, because he has everything to risk in this case. Because he', 'doesn’t have to go out and make up drug arrests. Because he has', 'plenty of legitimate drug arrests. There’s absolutely no incentive', 'for him to come in here and tell a story about Mr. Spain.” Spain v.', 'State, 872 A.2d 25, 28, 29 (Md. 2005). The court’s reaction to this argument was twofold. The court first declared that the prosecutor’s remarks regarding the officer’s motivation to lie did not constitute improper vouching because there was no expression of the prosecutor’s personal belief about the credibility of the officer and the comment did not “explicitly invoke the prestige or office of the State or the particular police department or unit involved.” Id. at 31. Nevertheless, the court also held that the prosecutor’s comments about the adverse consequences to the police officer’s career were improper:', '“Although the State is free to highlight the incentive, or lack of', 'incentive, of a witness to testify truthfully, courts consistently have', 'held that it is improper to argue that a police officer may be', 'deemed more credible simply because he or she is a police officer.', '* * * By invoking unspecified, but assumed, punitive', 'consequences or sanctions that might result if a police officer', 'testifies falsely, a prosecutor’s arguments imply that a police', '- 12 -', 'officer has a greater reason to testify truthfully than any other', 'witness with a different type of job. Although the factfinder', 'generally is made aware that a witness who is a police officer is', 'testifying as to events witnessed while on duty as a police officer, a', 'prosecutor must be careful not to insinuate that the credibility of', 'statements made in this capacity may be assessed at a level of', 'scrutiny other than that given to all witnesses.” Id. at 32.', 'We also find the First Circuit’s decision in United States v. Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d 136 (1st Cir. 2000) persuasive and evincive of the sensitivity regarding comments about a government agent’s career. In Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d at 142, the court addressed a comment during closing argument of an Assistant United States Attorney that, if the jury believed a statement by a codefendant, the jury “would also have to believe that [a FBI agent who testified] would actually jeopardize [his] ten years [as an FBI agent].” The First Circuit began its analysis by analyzing whether this remark actually constituted vouching—it contained no statement of personal belief and the FBI agent’s service time was in evidence, yet the use of the term “jeopardize” in relation to the agent’s career, while falling short of vouching, did suggest “some knowledge outside the record of punishment that [the FBI agent] could receive for lying in court.” Id. The court declared:', '“[W]e hold that this kind of general appeal to believe the police or', 'FBI because of their history, integrity, or public service is', 'inappropriate, although not the worst offense that a prosecutor can', 'commit. While not vouching in the most familiar sense, it does', 'invite the jury to rely on the prestige of the government and its', 'agents rather than the jury’s own evaluation of the evidence; to this', 'extent, the argument presents the same danger as outright', 'vouching.” Id. (citing United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 18-19', '(1985)).', 'Thus, although courts tend to allow a general reference to a specific officer’s credibility or lack of motive to lie, a prosecutor’s reference to the “risk” to an officer’s career should he or she commit perjury is not appropriate. See Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d at 142; Spain, 872 A.2d at 32; see also United States v. McMath, 559 F.3d 657, 667 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding that', '- 13 - prosecutor’s comment that police witnesses would lose their jobs if they lied was improper); People v. Adams, 962 N.E.2d 410, 414 (Ill. 2012) (holding that prosecutor’s comment that officer was “risking his credibility, his job, and his freedom” was improper).6 While a witness’s status as a police officer certainly mandates that he or she testify truthfully, we are mindful that, in the context of the criminal justice system, all witnesses are expected to give truthful testimony. We agree with the First Circuit’s evaluation that a comment during closing argument about the risk to an officer’s career may invite the jury “to rely on the prestige of the government and its agents rather than the jury’s own evaluation of the evidence.” Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d at 142. Therefore, in the circumstances of this case, the prosecutor’s rhetorical question about whether Officer Greeno would risk his career, while not vouching in the true sense, nonetheless was inappropriate.', 'Regarding the remaining portion of the challenged remark—“Officer Greeno, who appears, I would suggest to you, to be a very by-the-book officer, he stood there at military attention the whole time that he testified to you”—we perceive no impropriety given the full context of the prosecutor’s comment. It is important to note that the prosecutor preceded her comment with “I would suggest,” and followed it with a reference to his demeanor on the witness stand: “he stood there at military attention the whole time that he testified to you.” It is common to instruct the jury, as occurred here, that they may consider the appearance and 6', 'Notably, despite holding that the comments were improper, in none of these cases did the appellate court vacate the jury’s verdict for this reason. See United States v. McMath, 559 F.3d 657, 668 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding that remark did not jeopardize the fairness or integrity of the trial); United States v. Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d 136, 142-43 (1st Cir. 2000) (holding that prosecutor’s comment was harmless); People v. Adams, 962 N.E.2d 410, 416 (Ill. 2012) (holding that comments did not amount to plain error); Spain v. State, 872 A.2d 25, 34 (Md. 2005) (court was “convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in no way influenced the verdict”).', '- 14 - demeanor of a witness when assessing the witness’s credibility.7 Therefore, considering the whole of the prosecutor’s remark and the jury instructions, the argument that Officer Greeno appeared to be a “by-the-book officer” was merely a comment meant to draw the jury’s attention to his demeanor while testifying. Accordingly, that comment was not improper vouching.', 'Although we conclude that a portion of the prosecutor’s closing argument was akin to vouching, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err by refusing to pass the case. A trial justice is vested with considerable discretion when ruling on a motion to pass a case. See McRae, 31 A.3d at 789; State v. Nelson, 982 A.2d 602, 607 (R.I. 2009). The trial justice’s front- row seat at the trial places him or her in the best position to determine the effect of the remarks on the jury and the proper remedy for any prejudice. See McRae, 31 A.3d at 789. “As such, the trial justice’s determination concerning the prejudicial effect of evidence and the jury’s ability to render a fair and impartial verdict are reviewed by this Court under an abuse of discretion standard.” Id.', 'Here, the trial justice was faced with an objection to a comment that was on the borderline of improper vouching. In his cautionary instruction, the trial justice told the jury that findings of fact and assessment of credibility were exclusively within their province. Specifically, he stated,', '“I can assure you that no one, from the State to the defense', 'counsel, to the witnesses, have any inside information. There is no', 'magical formula with regard to credibility. The witnesses were', 'sworn to tell the truth; and the assessment of their credibility is', 'exclusively within your prerogative once the final 12 are chosen to', 'deliberate.” 7', 'In this case, the trial justice instructed the jury that they “may be guided by the * * * appearance of a witness, as well as the conduct and demeanor of that witness while testifying * * *.”', '- 15 - The Court presumes that members of the jury follow the trial justice’s instructions. State v. LaRoche, 683 A.2d 989, 1000 (R.I. 1996). We are satisfied that this cautionary instruction was sufficient to quell the effect of any prejudice caused by the prosecutor’s remark about Officer Greeno’s career. See Torres-Galindo, 206 F.3d at 142-43 (holding prosecutor’s remark harmless because “(1) * * * it was not a severe infraction, (2) * * * the court properly instructed the jury that the statements and arguments of counsel are not evidence, and (3) the substantial weight of the evidence against appellants”); LaRoche, 683 A.2d at 1000 (concluding that instructions “were more than adequate to cure any possible prejudice that may have resulted from the prosecutor’s arguably overzealous remarks”); see also supra, note 6 (noting several appellate court decisions refusing to overturn jury verdicts for similar vouching remarks during closing argument). Accordingly, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in declining to pass the case.', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the defendant’s convictions.

In this case, we are confronted with a ten-hour police standoff in Hopkinton, Rhode Island, precipitated by a 911 call by the longtime girlfriend of the defendant, Michael Neugent, arising from a domestic dispute. The defendant’s mother—who was also his landlord—provided the responding officer with keys to the defendant’s apartment. The defendant was barricaded inside the dwelling and threatened to shoot the officer if he entered. Within minutes, officers from multiple police departments, including the Rhode Island State Police SWAT team and approximately twenty police vehicles, surrounded the apartment building. After hours of fruitless negotiations, the SWAT team, garbed in full tactical gear and armed with assault weapons and explosives, executed a forced entry into the defendant’s apartment.', 'The defendant struck the first officer who came through the door with an approximately three-foot-long construction level. A brief struggle ensued; and, despite strenuous resistance, the defendant was apprehended. He was later charged with several counts, ultimately being convicted of assault with a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest.', '-1-', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on October 2, 2019, on a writ of certiorari from a judgment of conviction following a jury trial.1 Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for a new trial because, he alleges, the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence. The parties were directed to appear and show cause why the issues raised in the case should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the case at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On February 11, 2015, defendant was charged by criminal information, in W2/15-54A, with one count of assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (count one), and one count of resisting arrest, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 12-7-10 (count two).2 A jury trial commenced on October 25, 2016, and the jury heard from several witnesses, including defendant and his girlfriend. We summarize the testimony presented at trial.', 'Detective John Forbes (Det. Forbes) of the Hopkinton Police Department testified that, on October 11, 2014, he responded to a 911 call from defendant’s longtime girlfriend, Joyce 1', 'Because defendant’s trial counsel failed to file a timely notice of appeal from the judgment of conviction, the public defender’s office filed a petition for a writ of certiorari on defendant’s behalf, to which the state had no objection. 2', 'The defendant was also charged by a separate criminal information, in W2/15-70A, with one count of threatening a public official, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-42-4, one count of domestic assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3, and one count of disorderly conduct, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-45-1. The charges of domestic assault and disorderly conduct were dismissed in accordance with Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure after defendant’s longtime girlfriend refused subpoena service, thereby depriving the state of the direct evidence necessary to proceed to trial. The charge of threatening a public official was tried along with the counts of assault with a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest, and the jury found defendant not guilty on that count. Therefore, W2/15-70A is not before us in this case.', '-2- Kreyssig (Kreyssig), about a domestic dispute at a duplex apartment building located at 5 Side Hill Street in the town. Kreyssig told Det.

Forbes that there was a .22–caliber rifle in the bedroom.', 'Detective Forbes testified that he proceeded to the common doorway of the building, knocked on the separate inside door for apartment 5A, announced himself as a Hopkinton police officer, and requested that defendant open the door. After receiving no response, Det. Forbes obtained keys to the apartment from defendant’s mother and landlord, Sandra Neugent. When Det. Forbes returned to defendant’s apartment, he unlocked the doorknob; but before he could unlock the deadbolt, he heard someone lock the door from the inside. Detective Forbes again announced himself as a police officer and instructed defendant to open the door. The defendant refused, stating, among other things: “I have a weapon pointed at you through this door. If you come through this door, I’m going to use it on you.” Detective Forbes immediately evacuated the remaining residents in the building, took cover, and called for backup. A phalanx of police officers from the state police and the Hopkinton and Richmond police departments responded to the scene and surrounded the apartment building.', 'Sergeant David Bassignani (Sgt. Bassignani), the commander of the state police SWAT team, testified that, when he arrived, state troopers from the Crisis Negotiation team were communicating with defendant by cell phone. However, at some point, defendant ended all communication. Because the police believed that defendant’s phone was no longer working, the SWAT team approached the house, broke the front window, and tossed a phone in a box—aptly described as a “throw phone”—into the residence. The defendant threw the box back out through the window. He then stood in the broken window, “yelling and screaming” and holding', '-3- an approximately three-foot-long construction level.3 Sergeant Bassignani decided to send in the SWAT team to apprehend defendant.', 'The entry team breached the door and entered defendant’s apartment, announcing their presence by yelling the words, “State Police.” Sergeant Bassignani, who was holding a ballistic shield, entered first and immediately saw defendant, who was wielding the construction level. The defendant swung the level and struck the front of the shield, forcing it against Sgt. Bassignani’s face, causing injury above his right eyebrow. The entry team swarmed defendant, who, Sgt. Bassignani testified, “was in full resist mode.” He was ordered to stop resisting and get on the ground.', 'Corporal Thomas Chabot (Cpl. Chabot) of the state police testified that his role on the entry team was to cover Sgt. Bassignani.4 When the entry team entered the apartment, everyone yelled “State Police[,]” as they do, according to Cpl. Chabot, “prior to entering any residence or upon making entry and crossing any threshold[.]” Although it was dark, Cpl. Chabot saw defendant lunge at Sgt. Bassignani with a long instrument, forcing the shield against Sgt. Bassignani’s face. According to Cpl. Chabot, as they struggled to apprehend him, defendant was agitated and uncooperative.', 'The state rested its case, and defendant called Kreyssig. Kreyssig acknowledged that she had called the police after a dispute with defendant.', 'She testified that she informed the responding officer that defendant was “just pretty miserable.” Kreyssig also informed the officer that there was a gun in the apartment.

During the exchange of text messages, they requested that he go outside, but defendant refused and stopped responding. Later that night, defendant testified, after an explosion shattered his front window, he saw the throw phone box fly through the window, and he immediately threw it back outside. Less than five minutes later, defendant testified, his door was breached, and he immediately “jumped with the level and swung.”', 'The defendant claimed during his testimony that he did not hear anyone announce themselves as police officers, nor did he receive a warning that the police were coming through the door. After he swung the level, defendant testified, he immediately dropped it and backed', '-5- up, then he was rushed by the entry team. According to defendant, they struck him in the back of the head, tased him, and brought him down to the ground. The defendant testified that he was having difficulty breathing, and he passed out. The defendant testified that, when he regained consciousness, his hands were handcuffed behind his back, and the officers were punching him.', 'The jury returned a verdict of guilty on the counts of the information in W2/15-54A, and not guilty on the remaining count in W2/15-70A. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial that was heard and denied on December 6, 2016. On February 20, 2017, defendant was given a five-year suspended sentence, with probation, on count one, and a concurrent one-year suspended sentence, with probation, on count two. The defendant filed a petition for writ of certiorari, which this Court granted on May 18, 2018.', 'Standard of Review', 'When reviewing a motion for a new trial, this Court accords “‘great weight to a trial justice’s ruling’ when that justice ‘articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.’” State v. Najera, 211 A.3d 938, 943 (R.I. 2019) (quoting State v. Kizekai, 19 A.3d 583, 589 (R.I. 2011)). If the trial justice complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, “his or her decision will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” State v. Rogers, 207 A.3d 457, 461 (R.I. 2019) (quoting State v. Phannavong, 21 A.3d 321, 325 (R.I. 2011)).', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because, he asserts, the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence concerning the charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and resisting arrest. As to the charge', '-6- of assault with a dangerous weapon, defendant contends that he acted in self-defense when he swung the level because he did not know that the individuals who pushed his door in were police officers.5 As to the charge of resisting arrest, defendant asserts that he immediately dropped the level and surrendered when he realized that the individuals in his apartment were police officers. The defendant argues that his injuries were not consistent with that of someone who resisted arrest, his apartment showed no signs of a struggle, and none of the state troopers who arrested him sustained any injuries or damage to their equipment. We deem defendant’s arguments to be without merit and therefore reject them.', 'Under Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “the court may grant a new trial to the defendant if required in the interest of justice.” When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice, acting as the thirteenth juror, “must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Lopez, 149 A.3d 459, 462 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Staffier, 21 A.3d 287, 290 (R.I. 2011)). If the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if “reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Rogers, 207 A.3d at 462 (quoting State v. Perkins, 966 A.2d 1257, 1260 (R.I. 2009)). Conversely, if the trial justice finds that the state did not meet its burden on the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, a new trial must be ordered. E.g., id.; State v. Peoples, 996 A.2d 660, 666 (R.I. 2010).', 'In this case, the trial justice, in his bench decision denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, summarized the trial testimony, exercised his independent judgment as to the credibility of 5', 'The defendant asserted the defense of self-defense at trial, and the trial justice properly instructed the jury on self-defense and the state’s burden of proof.', '-7- each witness and the weight of the evidence, and declared that he agreed with the jury’s verdict. The trial justice found Sgt. Bassignani to be “very professional” and a “credible witness.” The trial justice also noted that the testimony of Cpl. Chabot was consistent with that of Sgt. Bassignani. By contrast, regarding Kreyssig’s testimony that defendant did not know where the gun was located in the apartment, the trial justice stated: “I don’t believe what she said for a minute. All I believe is that she told * * * [Det.] Forbes that he was in there and he had access to a gun. Anything else was an afterthought after she saw the predicament that her boyfriend got himself into.” Further, he stated that Kreyssig’s testimony in support of defendant’s “ludicrous” defense at trial was, according to the trial justice, nothing but “an effort to defend the indefensible[.]” What is more, the trial justice found that defendant’s “suggestion that [he] didn’t know that there were police outside [who] wanted to arrest him” was “absolutely incredible.” The trial justice further acknowledged defendant’s position at trial that he did not know who was on the other side of his door and did not even look outside, declaring, “I don’t believe it for a second.”', 'Finally, the trial justice concluded that he would have reached the same result as the jury:', '“In the final analysis I find absolutely no fault whatsoever with the', 'jury’s verdict in this case. All things considered, if I were trying', 'the case, myself, without a jury, I would have come to the same', 'conclusions; that is, except for, as I previously mentioned, I would', 'have found him guilty of * * * the threat to public official charge.', 'So for all these reasons, I think the jury did a good job in', 'evaluating the evidence, the credibility of the witnesses, making a', 'realistic common sense assessment of what went on that day, and I', 'think they applied the law as I gave it to them, and I agree with the', 'result[.]”', 'After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the trial justice complied with the directives contained in Rule 33 and articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion. We therefore afford deference to the trial justice’s findings, mindful that he was a front-row observer', '-8- for all phases of the trial and was in an especially good position to assess the credibility of the witnesses and evaluate the weight of the evidence. E.g., Rogers, 207 A.3d at 462; State v. Baptista, 79 A.3d 24, 29-30 (R.I. 2013). The trial justice weighed the evidence establishing that the defendant was aware of the police presence outside his apartment. He found the state’s witnesses to be credible and both the defendant’s and Kreyssig’s testimony to be completely unbelievable. After the trial justice declared that he would have reached the same result as the jury, his analysis was complete. Therefore, we conclude that the trial justice did not err in denying the motion for a new trial.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction and remand this case to the Superior Court with our decision endorsed thereon.', '-9- STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'State v.

64,State : v. : Josephine L. Medina. :,reversal,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. After a trial in Providence County Superior Court, a jury found the defendant, Josephine Medina, guilty of one count of domestic assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-5-2 and 12-29-5. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred by granting two of the state’s motions in limine, which precluded the jury from (1) hearing evidence of the victim’s arrest for gun charges and (2) viewing videos of the victim having engaged in acts of violence. This case came before the Supreme Court on December 4, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 17, 2016, the state filed a criminal information against defendant alleging that, on April 3, 2016, she assaulted Emily Correa, her half-sister, with a knife. At trial, Correa testified that she and defendant had enjoyed a close relationship, would always “hang out,” and even lived together along with the father of Correa’s son, Garen Bartlett. However, Correa testified that her relationship with defendant soured after Bartlett kicked Correa out of the house and engaged in a relationship with defendant.', 'According to Correa, on April 3, 2016, she called Bartlett to get money for diapers and wipes for their son, and they agreed to meet. After she determined Bartlett’s location, Correa obtained a ride from Corina Walker, who was like a sister to Correa, to meet him. Correa testified that, when she and Walker arrived at the location, Bartlett pulled up behind them, driving defendant’s vehicle. Correa testified that she got out of Walker’s car, approached the driver’s side of defendant’s vehicle, and opened the door to ask Bartlett for the money. When she approached defendant’s vehicle, she noticed defendant sitting in the front passenger’s seat. Correa testified that she saw defendant reach toward the center console and retrieve a black case. She further testified that defendant then pulled the case open and threw it into her vehicle. Correa testified that she reached into the car to see what the object was; and that, by the time she turned around, defendant had exited the car, run around the back of it, and was standing approximately a foot away from Correa when she stabbed Correa in the chest. Correa testified that she held her chest and tried to run, but that defendant continued to swing the knife, and that defendant cut Correa’s left wrist as she was rushing at Correa. Correa testified that defendant', '-2- eventually stopped chasing her with the knife, but only after Walker helped Correa back into Walker’s car.', 'Although defendant did not testify at trial, her recorded interview with the police was admitted into evidence as a full exhibit. In her interview, defendant admitted that she stabbed Correa, but claimed that her action was in self-defense because Correa had rushed at her and wielded a knife of her own. According to defendant, Correa initially attacked Bartlett while he sat in the driver’s seat of her vehicle, then tried to reach over Bartlett to attack defendant. The defendant told police that she then got out of the vehicle, and Correa rushed at her. According to defendant, Correa saw defendant’s knife, but she attempted to stab defendant anyway; however, according to defendant she stabbed Correa first. The defendant further claimed that Correa hated her and had reason to attack her because Correa blamed defendant for “snitching on her,” which had led to the previous arrest of Correa and Bartlett for gun and drug charges.', 'Prior to trial, the state filed a motion in limine regarding Correa’s prior contacts with police and her criminal convictions. The state acknowledged that Correa had a conviction for possession of a controlled substance and conspiracy to violate the Controlled Substances Act, but it sought to prevent the portion of defendant’s statement wherein she indicated to police that the drug for which Correa was convicted of possessing was heroin. The state also sought to preclude the jurors from learning that Correa had been arrested on gun-related charges. The state argued that any mention of guns was irrelevant because Correa did not plead to any gun charges, nor had she been convicted of any—only Bartlett had pled to those charges. The state further noted that Correa did not use a gun in this incident.', 'In opposition to the motion in limine, defendant argued that the gun charges against Correa were relevant to defendant’s claim of self-defense; specifically, regarding Correa’s', '-3- alleged bias toward defendant and defendant’s state of mind and motive for stabbing Correa. According to defendant, Correa believed that defendant had “snitched” and caused Correa and Bartlett to be charged with the gun crimes. However, the trial justice granted the state’s motion, finding significance in the fact that Bartlett “pled to the specific gun charges and [Correa] didn’t” and that “this [wa]s not a gun case[.]” The trial justice further found that the record of the drug conviction itself was admissible, but she noted that the defense could not “use the word heroin or the term heroin.”1 The trial justice also found that defendant would be permitted to question Correa at trial regarding “the issue of snitching[,]” motive, and bias toward defendant through her conviction for drug charges alone.', 'The state also filed a motion in limine to preclude defendant from introducing into evidence three videos that had been posted to Facebook that showed Correa engaged in prior acts of aggression. The state contended that the videos were inadmissible under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence because they were needless, cumulative, and inflammatory, and that any probative value to defendant was outweighed by unfair prejudice. The state claimed that Correa was expected to testify that she had carried a knife on prior occasions, that she had been arrested in December 2015 with a knife in her possession, had stabbed someone before, and that she had fought with others. Moreover, the state argued that, in accordance with this Court’s holding in State v. Tribble, 428 A.2d 1079 (R.I. 1981), defendant had to prove she was aware of each of these acts of aggression prior to the incident in question and that that would “turn into a minitrial within a trial, just to prove when each video was taken, [and] when the defendant learned of the acts depicted in each video[.]” Therefore, the state argued, the videos were not necessary to prove that Correa had engaged in violent behavior in the past, were cumulative in 1', 'On appeal, defendant does not take issue with this part of the trial justice’s ruling and only alleges error based on excluding any reference to Correa’s arrest on gun charges.', '-4- that Correa would testify to those acts, and that the only purpose the videos served was to inflame the passions of the jurors.', 'The defendant contended that the three videos were admissible because “[t]he video of these instances is what [defendant] saw. That is what created the fear in her.” The defendant further argued that the videos actually showed the level of Correa’s aggression and what she was capable of doing.', 'After viewing the three videos in chambers, the trial justice granted the state’s motion in limine because “such evidence would be cumulative” given that Correa would testify to the information contained in the videos and would not deny that she had stabbed people in the past. The trial justice found that the first video, from 2013, was remote in time from the April 2016 incident and was therefore not admissible. Additionally, the trial justice noted that the second and third videos were cumulative and would be offered solely to inflame the passions of the jurors. Finally, the trial justice determined that the videos would “cause confusion as to what the ultimate issue in this case was.” As such, none of the videos were admitted into evidence.', 'Following four days of trial, the jury found defendant guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon. Subsequently, defendant filed a motion for a new trial. The trial justice denied the motion and sentenced defendant to five years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, but suspended the sentence and placed her on probation for five years.', 'The defendant timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s', '-5- decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v. Perez, 161 A.3d 487, 493 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Mohapatra, 880 A.2d 802, 805 (R.I. 2005)). “The trial justice will not have abused his or her discretion as long as some grounds supporting his or her decision appear in the record.” Id. (quoting State v. Evans, 742 A.2d 715, 719 (R.I. 1999)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, defendant asserts that the trial justice “caused continual constitutional problems throughout [defendant]’s trial” by granting both motions in limine.', 'Specifically, defendant claims that she was prevented from demonstrating Correa’s proclivity to use physical violence when angered, which established, according to defendant, that it was reasonable for her to act “quickly, and forcefully” when Correa charged at her with a knife. We address each evidentiary argument in turn.', 'A', 'The Gun Charges', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred by precluding evidence that Correa had been arrested on gun charges because, defendant argues, it prevented the jurors from fully understanding why defendant was afraid on the date in question, and the extent of Correa’s bias toward defendant. The defendant argues that this would have helped the jury to understand why defendant struck the “first physical blow” during the altercation and why that blow was in self-defense. In support of her contention, defendant asserts that gun charges are a more violent offense than drug charges with longer mandatory sentences and that, because Correa believed defendant had caused her to be arrested for the gun charges, Correa would be even more biased toward defendant.', '-6-', 'After careful review of the record, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion. The trial justice provided more-than-adequate grounds to support her decision to grant the state’s motion in limine to prevent defendant from mentioning that Correa had been arrested on gun charges. Specifically, the trial justice noted that such charges were eventually dismissed as to Correa and that only Bartlett had pled to them. She further noted, importantly, that use of a gun was not in issue in the present case. Moreover, the trial justice determined that there were “sufficient ways to establish [the snitching] without * * * the gun piece.” Indeed, at trial, defendant established that Correa had been arrested in December 2015 with a knife on her person; Correa believed defendant was engaged in a relationship with Bartlett, the father of her child; and Correa blamed defendant for her arrest with Bartlett on the drug charges. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she prevented any mention that Correa had been arrested on the gun charges.', 'B', 'The Facebook Videos', 'Next, defendant maintains that the trial justice “looked at the evidence the wrong way round” when she determined that the Facebook videos illustrating Correa’s acts of violence were cumulative in light of Correa’s testimony regarding those acts. According to defendant, due to Correa’s “misleading and sanitized recollection of events[,]” the jurors were unable to appreciate the level of fear that defendant had of Correa. The defendant further claims that she could not adequately cross-examine and impeach Correa regarding her misleading statements about the fights depicted in the videos, which was essential to defendant’s self-defense claim. Again, we disagree.', '-7-', 'With regard to “the admissibility of specific-acts evidence, pursuant to Rule 404(b) [of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence], our ruling in Tribble is controlling.” State v. Dellay, 687 A.2d 435, 439 (R.I. 1996). In Tribble, this Court held that a defendant claiming self-defense is “entitled to adduce relevant evidence of specific acts of violence perpetrated by the victim against third parties, provided however, that the defendant was aware of these acts at the time of his [or her] encounter with the victim.” Tribble, 428 A.2d at 1085. However, we noted that this rule is “not to be implemented without limitation[,]” as in cases where “such evidence might allow the principal issue to become lost in a maze of collateral matters[.]” Id. Accordingly, a defendant must show awareness of the specific “acts of violence and that the act or acts sought to be introduced are not too remote in time and are of such a quality as to be capable of contributing to the defendant’s fear of the victim.” Id. It is within the trial justice’s sound discretion “to limit the extent to which the incidents are sought to be proved.” Id. at 1086.', 'Additionally, Rule 403 provides that relevant evidence “may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of * * * needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”', 'Turning to the case at bar, our careful review of the record leads us to conclude that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion. The trial justice viewed all three videos and found that the first video, from 2013, was remote in time. Moreover, she found that the second and third videos would be cumulative because Correa was expected to testify to the specific acts depicted in them, and the videos were “highly inflammatory and would be offered solely to inflame the passions of the jurors.”', 'The trial justice further determined that the videos would “cause confusion as to what the ultimate issue in this case was[,]” pointing out that the ultimate issue was defendant’s perception of Correa, not the substance of the videos.', '-8-', 'At trial, both the state and defendant questioned Correa regarding the Facebook videos. Correa admitted during her testimony to stabbing twin sisters and telling defendant about it. She described that she had been in a fight while defendant was present and testified that defendant had joined in that fight. Correa admitted that she regularly carried a knife, especially when she was selling drugs. Correa testified that she did not have a knife in her hand on the date in question, but candidly acknowledged that, if she did, she would have used it and “stabbed [defendant] and Garen Bartlett.”', 'On cross-examination, defendant impeached Correa’s testimony, after Correa had claimed that she had abandoned her reputation as a fighter, by questioning her regarding a recent video of her fighting.', 'Moreover, the trial justice determined that the videos were cumulative, would inflame the passion of the jurors, and would “cause confusion as to what the ultimate issue in this case was.” This leads us to conclude that the trial justice’s findings with regard to the videos were significantly supported by the record and that her exclusion of them was in no manner an abuse of discretion.', 'Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion by granting either of the state’s motions in limine.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

65,State : v. : Jamal Rogers. :,reversal,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on March 5, 2019, on appeal by the defendant, Jamal Rogers (defendant), from a judgment of conviction entered in the Superior Court following a jury finding of guilty on five counts of second-degree sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4. Before this Court, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial and that the verdict failed to serve the interests of justice. The case is before us pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 25, 2012, a grand jury returned an indictment that charged defendant with one count of first-degree sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-2 (count one); five counts of second- degree sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-4 (counts two through six); and one count of assault with intent to commit first-degree sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-1', '-1- (count seven). In January 2017, a jury trial was held in Providence County Superior Court; the state presented two witnesses: Molly,1 the complaining witness, and Detective Sergeant Matthew Ryan (Det. Ryan), the lead investigator. We summarize below the pertinent testimony presented at trial.', 'Molly testified that, in February 2012, she was fifteen years old and a sophomore at Woonsocket High School; at that time, she was participating in an after-school online English makeup class, which took place Monday through Thursday at the high school, from 2:30 p.m. until five in the evening. On Mondays, Molly would walk a short distance to her grandparents’ home after class, and her father would pick her up there.', 'On Monday, February 6, 2012, Molly testified that, after a “really rough day at school[,]” she decided to skip the online course. Instead, she went to Cass Park, a playground adjacent to the high school, to sit on the swings and “reflect and think about [her] day * * * before [she] went home[.]” Noticing that dusk was fast approaching, Molly approached a passing stranger, a “big, chubby’ish” man, and asked if he knew the time. This stranger was defendant.2 The defendant replied in the negative and asked her, “[W]ould you happen to have any weed on you[?]” Molly responded in the negative, and defendant walked away. After waiting on the swings for several more minutes for someone else to walk by, Molly reluctantly decided to walk back to the high school in order to check the time in the main office.', 'The defendant suddenly approached Molly from behind, grabbed the hood of her jacket, and dragged her up a hill in the park, behind the swings. Molly attempted to dig her feet into the ground to make him stop dragging her, and put her hands behind herself to make him let go of 1', 'We refer to the complaining witness in this case by a pseudonym. 2', 'The fact that defendant weighed over 300 pounds on the date of the incident was excluded from evidence.', '-2- her jacket but, at approximately 104 pounds, she “was not strong enough and after a while [she] gave up.” At the top of the hill, hidden in a wooded area near a big rock, defendant continued to restrain Molly and asked her name, her bra size, and whether she was a virgin. “Out of fear,” Molly answered each question. She testified that, as defendant asked her the questions, “[h]e touched my breasts over my clothes and * * * he touched in between my legs and my butt.”', 'When defendant began to kiss Molly, she testified, that she submitted because she was afraid that “something worse would happen.” The defendant removed Molly’s shirt and bra, and touched her breasts. Molly testified that she “attempt[ed] to stop him and gave up because [she] was too weak.” At trial, she explained that she was crying and had her eyes closed “a lot” of the time, because she was afraid. The defendant next asked Molly to “give him a blow job for $20[.]” She refused. The defendant proceeded to unzip his pants and “tried to force [her] to give him a blow job” by pushing her head down towards his penis. Molly struggled to lift her head up, and, after a few attempts, defendant released her head. The defendant pushed Molly onto the ground and pulled her pants and underwear off. She testified: “He undid his pants and boxers and pulled them down to his ankles and then got on top of me.” As Molly lay on her back, defendant laid “99 percent” of his body on top of her and “stuck his penis inside of [her] vagina.” After a few minutes or so, defendant stopped, got up from the ground, and began to put his clothes back on. According to Molly, when his back was turned, she jumped up, grabbed her clothes and ran, naked, down the hill.', 'At this point it was getting dark outside, and, as she ran to her grandparents’ home, crying and vomiting, she put her clothes back on. Although it was rush hour and she ran past homes and open businesses, Molly testified, she saw no one, nor did anyone ask if she needed help. When Molly arrived at her grandparents’ home, it was past 5:30—when she was expected', '-3- to be home—and her grandparents were irate. She did not tell her grandparents about the incident because she was not “comfortable telling them what happened” and she was “ashamed”; she testified: “I felt defiled. * * * I felt dirty. Disgusting.” When Molly’s father arrived to pick her up, he was also furious. At trial, Molly testified that she and her father had a contentious relationship and that her late arrival home that night had made matters worse. After he shouted at her and used demeaning names, the two went home; and, shortly thereafter, she was grounded. Molly did not tell her father about the assault because, she testified, she “was scared and ashamed and embarrassed and it is definitely something that I was not comfortable talking with my father about, something that he wouldn’t understand.”', 'The next day, Molly went to her guidance counselor, Robin Corrigan (Corrigan), and told her that defendant kissed and touched her inappropriately the night before—Molly did not mention that defendant allegedly had raped her. Corrigan contacted the school resource officer, Officer David Chattman (Officer Chattman), to report the assault, and Molly told him what she had told Corrigan. Officer Chattman contacted Det. Ryan, who was the officer in charge of the Juvenile Division of the Woonsocket Police Department, and informed him that a sexual assault had occurred at Cass Park next to the high school. Later that day, Molly met with Det. Ryan at the police station and positively identified defendant from a photo lineup as the man who assaulted her in Cass Park. She placed her initials and the date underneath his photograph; she confirmed her identification of defendant as the man who had sexually assaulted her in court during trial.3', 'Shortly thereafter, Woonsocket police officers were dispatched to locate defendant, who was found in Cass Park. He was taken in for questioning. At the police station, Det. Ryan 3', 'Eyewitness identification is not an issue before the Court.', '-4- interviewed defendant about Molly’s allegations of sexual assault. The defendant stated that when he was in Cass Park the day before, he “got to be friends with this girl” named Molly. After he explained that they spoke for approximately thirty minutes, defendant stated that he asked Molly if he could remove her clothes and “kiss her[.]”4 The defendant stated that she consented and explained that “there was no force or nothing.” He then admitted that he asked Molly to perform fellatio on him but, given the lateness, she instead asked defendant if they could meet up at another time.', 'The detective made no mention to defendant of Molly’s allegation of vaginal penetration because, at that time, he was not aware of such an allegation. At the conclusion of the interview, defendant was charged with second-degree sexual assault.', 'Approximately one week later, Molly went back to Corrigan and told her the “full story”—that defendant also vaginally penetrated her. Molly testified that she had not initially told Corrigan everything that had occurred on the night in question because she felt “very ashamed[.]” On March 14, 2012, Det. Ryan went to Molly’s home and asked her to write a statement of the events that transpired during the incident, including the touchings as well as the alleged penetration.5 The defendant was charged and subsequently indicted.', 'Almost five years later, on January 23, 2017, a jury found defendant guilty of five counts of second-degree sexual assault (counts two through six). The defendant was acquitted of both first-degree sexual assault (count one) and assault with intent to commit first-degree sexual assault (count seven).

The defendant, Javier Merida (Merida or defendant), appeals pro se from an order of the Superior Court denying his motion to correct sentence, pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. On February 28, 2019, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, further briefing or argument is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons explained herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This Court thoroughly recounted the underlying facts of this matter in our consideration of defendant’s direct appeal and postconviction-relief appeal.1 Therefore, we only recount facts relevant to this appeal and other facts necessary for context. 1', 'See Merida v.

State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 230, 231 (R.I. 2008). On July 7, 2006, the trial justice sentenced defendant to two forty-year terms of imprisonment, with twenty years to serve and twenty years suspended, with probation, on the two first-degree child molestation sexual assault counts; and one thirty-year term, with ten years to serve and twenty years suspended, with probation, on the second-degree child molestation sexual assault count; all sentences were to be served concurrently. Id. at 230.', 'From May 2004 until his determination of guilt in May 2006, defendant was on what he characterizes as “twenty-four hour electronic home confinement” as a condition of bail.2 In October 2016, following the completion of defendant’s direct and postconviction-relief appeals, he filed a “motion for correction of sentence” pro se, pursuant to Rule 35, which was later heard by the same trial justice who presided over Merida’s trial. Merida also filed a motion to appoint counsel for the hearing, but the trial justice denied the motion.', 'At the hearing on his motion to correct his sentence, defendant argued that the twenty-four months he spent on home confinement should be credited toward his overall sentence, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-19-2(a). Specifically, he argued that this Court’s opinion in State v. Quattrocchi, 687 A.2d 78 (R.I. 1996), established that home confinement was a form of “imprisonment” for which credit could be given pursuant to § 12-19-2(a). The trial justice then reviewed several relevant cases decided by this Court, taking time to explain each case to defendant and 2', 'The record reveals that defendant’s motion to set bail was granted on May 10, 2004, and a pretrial order was entered for pretrial community confinement pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 42-56-20.2, specifying that “[e]lectronic monitoring devices shall be used.”', '-2- distinguishing the cases based on their facts.3 Merida also argued that a prisoner, whom he knew, had received credit toward his sentence for the time he spent on home confinement while awaiting trial. However, at that hearing, defendant could not remember all the details of that case. The trial justice therefore continued the hearing, at defendant’s request, so that defendant could obtain more information regarding the case he had mentioned.', 'One week later, on November 9, 2016, at the continued hearing, Merida argued that two of his cellmates, Mr. Bagley and Mr. DePina, received credit for home confinement toward their overall sentence. However, the trial justice found those cases distinguishable, explaining that, “[i]t appears that Mr. Bagley was sentenced for bail violation and asked for credit for time served and home confinement, but it wasn’t a sentencing after trial where he was held in home confinement as a condition of bail prior to trial.” She further explained that Mr. DePina was sentenced after a plea agreement with a “capped” plea, stating that, “if I did give him credit for time served in home confinement, it was in accordance with an agreement whereby he agreed to plead guilty and he pled guilty.” Having heard defendant’s arguments, the trial justice issued a bench decision denying defendant’s request to receive credit for time spent on home confinement.', 'Merida filed a timely notice of appeal on December 1, 2016.4 Before this Court, Merida argues that: (1) the trial justice erred in her interpretation of case precedent, specifically our opinion 3', 'Most of the cases that the trial justice discussed involved home confinement as a condition of parole or a plea agreement.

The only case that the trial justice found to be relevant to the issue of whether home confinement should count as credit toward a completed sentence was a case from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. See United States v. Zackular, 945 F.2d 423, 424-25 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding that a defendant is not entitled to credit toward an overall sentence for a period spent in home confinement). 4', 'This Court remanded the case to Superior Court for the entry of the order denying defendant’s motion, and an order entered to that effect on November 8, 2018.

Mlyniec, 78 A.3d 769, 771 (R.I. 2013)). “We have a ‘strong policy against interfering with a trial justice’s discretion in sentencing matters,’ and thus ‘our review of a trial justice’s ruling on a Rule 35 motion is extremely limited.’” Id. (quoting State v. Rivera, 64 A.3d 742, 745 (R.I. 2013)). “Accordingly, ‘we only will interfere with that discretion in rare instances when the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.’” Id.

He bases this contention on certain language in § 12-19-2(a), which provides, in relevant part:', '“Whenever it is provided that any offense shall be punished by a', 'fine or imprisonment, the court imposing punishment may, in its', 'discretion, select the kind of punishment to be imposed, and, if the', 'punishment is fine or imprisonment, its amount or term within the', 'limits prescribed by law; provided, if the punishment to be imposed', 'is imprisonment, the sentence or sentences imposed shall be reduced', 'by the number of days spent in confinement while awaiting trial and', 'while awaiting sentencing * * *.” (Emphasis added.)', '“We have previously held that the General Assembly’s enactment of the so-called dead- time provisions of § 12-19-2 was a benevolent effort to assist the person who, because of an inability to make bail, has been cast into a sort of limbo as he awaited the disposition of the charge or complaint which had caused his incarceration.” State v. Ilacqua, 765 A.2d 822, 824 (R.I. 2001) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Skirvin, 113 R.I. 443, 446, 322 A.2d 297, 299-300 (1974)). “Such an individual is ‘in limbo because the time spent awaiting trial or sentence can not be credited towards any future parole.’” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Skirvin, 113 R.I. at 446 n.1,', '-5- 322 A.2d at 300 n.1). This Court has previously stated that “the phrase ‘while awaiting trial and while awaiting sentencing’ must be construed as embracing confinement time spent for any reason whatsoever in connection with an offense for which a defendant is subsequently sentenced.” Id. (quoting State v. Holmes, 108 R.I. 579, 582, 277 A.2d 914, 916 (1971)).', 'In Holmes, we noted that § 12-19-2 “is subject to administrative rather than judicial application.” Holmes, 108 R.I. at 585, 277 A.2d at 917. Thus, it is for the director of the ACI to apply the provisions of § 12-19-2 and to give credits to those persons who were forced to await trial in confinement prior to their conviction. See id. However, G.L. 1956 § 42-56-20.2(j), entitled “No incarceration credit for persons awaiting trial[,]” states that “[n]o detainee shall be given incarceration credit by the director [of the ACI] for time spent in community confinement while awaiting trial.” (Emphasis added.) That provision specifically prohibits the director from granting a person credit for time spent on home confinement prior to trial and prior to conviction.', 'This Court has stated that, “when we are faced with statutory provisions that are in pari materia, we construe them in a manner that attempts to harmonize them and that is consistent with their general objective scope.” State v. Dearmas, 841 A.2d 659, 666 (R.I. 2004). Because both § 12-19-2 and § 42-56-20.2 govern sentencing of a person convicted of a crime, they may be read together as part of a greater statutory sentencing scheme created by the General Assembly. See id. Reading the two provisions together, it is clear that, if the accused is unable to make bail and must await trial at the ACI, then, pursuant to § 12-19-2, the director of the ACI must grant credit for that time if the accused is later convicted. On the other hand, if the accused makes bail and is able to', '-6- await trial in his home, then, pursuant to § 42-56-20.2(j), the director cannot give credit for that time, even if the accused is confined in his home as a condition of bail.6', 'Nevertheless, Merida argues that our opinion in Quattrocchi, where we held that “[w]e are persuaded that home confinement is a form of imprisonment during which an employee’s liberty is significantly restrained[,]” when read in conjunction with § 12-19-2, entitles him to a reduced sentence for the time he spent on home confinement. Quattrocchi, 687 A.2d at 79. However, that case involved an application of G.L. 1956 § 28-33-17.1(c) of the Workers’ Compensation Act, which prohibits an injured employee from collecting workers’ compensation benefits “for any period during which the employee was imprisoned as a result of a conviction of a criminal offense.” Id. As such, Quattrocchi is inapplicable here, where an application of the plain meaning of § 42-56-20.2(j) would bar the director of the ACI from awarding credit to a person convicted of a crime for the time that the person spent on community confinement while awaiting trial.', 'We also note that prohibiting credit for time spent on home confinement, as a condition of bail, is consistent with the spirit of § 12-19-2(a). The purpose of that statute is to relieve those persons who were unable to make bail from the burden of their confinement at the ACI before trial. See Ilacqua, 765 A.2d at 824. That concern is inapplicable where, as here, the accused was able to make bail and remain at home pending the outcome of trial. Therefore, we hold that the trial justice’s interpretation of § 12-19-2(a) and § 42-56-20.2(j) was correct, and that Merida should not be credited with the time he spent on home confinement. 6', '“[T]he right to bail, although guaranteed, is not absolute and may be granted subject to conditions reasonably calculated to further the purpose of bail itself, that is, to ensure the presence of the accused at court.” Bridges v. Superior Court, 121 R.I. 101, 105, 396 A.2d 97, 99 (1978).', '-7-', 'B', 'Equal Protection', 'For the first time on appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice’s failure to award him custody credits for time served on home confinement, while purportedly awarding said credits to others who were similarly situated, violated his due-process and equal-protection rights under the United States Constitution and the Rhode Island Constitution. However, because defendant did not raise this argument below, we deem it waived.', 'The raise-or-waive rule is well settled in this state, and this Court generally “will not consider on appeal an issue that was not raised before the trial court.” Harvey Realty v. Killingly Manor Condominium Association, 787 A.2d 465, 466-67 (R.I. 2001). We have recognized that the raise-or-waive rule “will not be disturbed unless ‘basic constitutional rights are concerned.’” State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Donato, 592 A.2d 140, 141 (R.I. 1991)). “To fall within this exception, the defendant must show: (1) that the error complained of amounts to more than harmless error; (2) that a sufficient record exists to permit a determination of the issue; and (3) that ‘counsel’s failure to raise the issue before trial must be premised upon a novel rule of law that counsel could not reasonably have known during the trial.’” State v.

However, because defendant has not identified any of the criteria to this narrow exception to the raise-or-waive rule as applicable to his equal-protection claim, we hold that his argument is waived.7 7', 'Although we need not reach the issue because it was not raised below, we note, nonetheless, that a review of the record fails to reveal any error. In each of the fact patterns that Merida offered to the trial justice as examples of persons receiving credit for time spent on home confinement, the defendant was provided credit as a condition of a plea, or in the context of parole.

See State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1253 (R.I. 2010). However, in Chase, “we [did] not address the question of whether the dictates of fundamental fairness and due process might require [a] * * * defendant to be appointed counsel in a Rule 35 proceeding in an appropriate case[,]” because the defendant had not raised that particular issue.

While Merida does raise due-process and fundamental-fairness concerns in the instant case, we nevertheless hold that his arguments are without merit.', 'We have followed the lead of the federal courts, which have held that “[a] criminal defendant’s right to counsel ‘flows from different constitutional provisions, depending on the confinement were not held at home as a condition of bail and, therefore, were not similarly situated to defendant.

Moreover, defendant has filed requests for counsel that show that he is indigent and cannot afford his own attorney. Nevertheless, a Rule 35 motion is not a “critical stage of a prosecution” where the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches, because the proceeding occurs after a prosecution has been completed. See Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 308-09. As this Court has stated, a Rule 35 motion “is essentially a plea for leniency.” See, e.g., Ciresi, 151 A.3d at 754 (quoting Farooq, 115 A.3d at 964). Additionally, the issue at bar—whether § 12-19-2 afforded defendant time off his sentence for the time he spent on home confinement—was not so complex as to require the appointment of counsel as a matter of fundamental fairness and due process.', 'In this case, a review of the record fails to reveal any error.

Simpson was sentenced to fifty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions with thirty years to serve and twenty years suspended with probation.

A', '-1- three-day violation hearing was held in February 2016. Below, we summarize the evidence adduced at the hearing.', 'The complaining witness, whom we shall refer to as Valerie,1 testified that, on December 14, 2015, she traveled to Woonsocket for a medical appointment. After the appointment, she crossed the street to a bus stop to take a bus home. There, she met a man named “Reggie,”2 who, as Valerie testified, asked her if she “wanted to get high with him.” She answered in the affirmative, and the two proceeded to a nearby park. After about fifteen minutes in the park, they headed to Diamond Hill Road, where Simpson lived, because Simpson “didn’t want to get high in the park.” About ten to fifteen minutes after leaving the park, they arrived at Simpson’s house, where they went into an unfinished basement with a dirt floor and a couple of mattresses in the corner.', 'Valerie testified that Simpson “laid one of the mattresses down on the ground” and then, when she “tried to turn and walk away, * * * he grabbed [her] and threw [her] * * * face down[] on the mattress.” Simpson then put Valerie’s hands behind her back; and, when she tried to leave, he told her “that he was a member of the police force.” He then “pulled [her] pants down and put his penis into [her] vagina.” Valerie testified that she “struggled” but could not get away. She said that Simpson then “put his penis into [her] mouth” but that she “kind of like threw up on him a little bit” so he “inserted his penis” into her vagina again. Valerie further testified that, “when [they] went to switch positions, * * * [she] pretended [she] was going to * * * put his penis in [her] mouth, but * * * instead [she] leaned over him and grabbed [her] bag * * * and started to run * * *.” When Simpson caught her, she screamed for help.

Additionally, the state introduced into evidence photographs taken by the police of Simpson’s basement, which depicted a basement with two mattresses within it.', 'Patrolman Justin Mowry of the Woonsocket Police Department testified that he responded to a phone call the police department had received from an unknown female who was screaming and running down the roadway in the area of Diamond Hill Road and Wood Avenue. Upon his arrival in the area, Valerie waved him down and told him she had been assaulted by a man she referred to only as “Reggie.” Officer Mowry testified that Valerie directed him to the location of the assault, 594 Diamond Hill Road. He also stated that the police were able to determine that a Walter Simpson, who used “Reggie” as an alias, resided on the third floor of that address. Officer Mowry proceeded to investigate the multifamily dwelling. He observed a dirty basement with two mattresses in the corner leaned against a pole. He then went up to the third floor, where Simpson resided, and spoke to Simpson’s girlfriend, who informed him that Simpson was at school.', '-3-', 'Simpson testified on his own behalf.

At the bus stop, Valerie “was soliciting gentlemen”; one man went with her to the park across the street, and then he returned to the bus stop. Valerie then gave Simpson a napkin with her phone number written thereon.', 'He later discovered that the phone number was incorrect.', 'The defendant testified that Valerie began asking about drugs. “She * * * was interested in crack,” and Simpson told her that he did not smoke crack.', 'Simpson testified that he and Valerie went across the street to the park and Valerie “attempted to perform oral sex” on him, but it started raining; so she asked if they could go to his house. Simpson “told her no” because “[his] girl [wa]s at [his] house.” Simpson testified that Valerie decided “it would be best” if they went to his house and that she “was under the impression that [he] was a drug dealer.” They then walked to Diamond Hill Road and went to the basement of Simpson’s house. Simpson testified that Valerie “went to perform oral sex” on him and then they began to have sexual intercourse. He further testified that, “[i]n the process of having sexual intercourse, [he] came to realize that” he was cheating on his girlfriend and “pushed her away a little bit” and told her to “just leave.” Valerie “cussed [him] out and stormed up the stairs,” and that was the last Simpson saw of her.', 'At the conclusion of the evidence, the hearing justice found that Simpson had violated his probation and executed eighteen years of Simpson’s twenty-year suspended sentence.

Valerie’s testimony, which the hearing justice accepted as true, bespoke of behavior by defendant that clearly can be described as a sexual assault whereas defendant’s testimony, even if given credence, amounted to an admission that he solicited a prostitute, conduct that would also support a violation adjudication.

The defendant did not object to this at the hearing and, in fact, conceded at oral argument that he was not challenging the burden of proof standard that the hearing justice applied.', 'Finally, defendant asserts that the hearing justice abused her discretion in sentencing him to serve eighteen years of his previously suspended sentence. He argues that the “invocation of 18 years to serve suggests that the sentence is motivated by a decision to punish Mr. Simpson for a criminal offense for which he is presumed innocent and has yet to be tried.', 'It is well established, however, “that a hearing justice has ‘wide discretion to determine whether to execute any or all of a defendant’s previously suspended sentence.’” State v.

We have often stated that rehabilitation is a “factor to be considered in sentencing.” Fairweather, 138 A.3d at 829.', '-8-', 'Therefore, we are of the opinion that, by executing eighteen years of his original suspended sentence, the hearing justice was acting well within the ambit of her discretionary authority.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

68,State : v. : Ricardo Romero. :,reversal,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. After a trial in Providence County Superior Court, a jury found the defendant, Ricardo Romero (Romero or defendant), guilty of three counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.3 and 11- 37-8.4. On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice improperly admitted testimony regarding previous restraining orders against defendant and erred in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. On September 25, 2018, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and reviewing the memoranda submitted by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, further briefing or argument is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons explained herein, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', '1', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On December 18, 2013, the state charged defendant by indictment with two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault and one count of second-degree child molestation sexual assault for acts alleged to have been committed against the victim, Mary,1 then six years old.2 Mary is the daughter of defendant’s then-girlfriend, Joann, and, at the time of the alleged incidents, Mary and Joann lived together in a small, two-bedroom apartment. In August 2012, Joann began dating defendant and he occasionally stayed overnight at the apartment.', 'According to the testimony at trial, on or about February 8, 2013, defendant spent the night at the apartment.', 'Joann testified that she was aware that defendant got up from the bed two or three times during the night. Joann further testified that, when she asked defendant “if he was okay and why he kept getting up[,]” he became defensive and agitated; Joann found defendant’s reaction to be odd. Joann testified that, the next day, she asked Mary if defendant had gone into her room the night before and that Mary had responded in the affirmative. That same day, Joann called defendant and confronted him about his having gone into Mary’s room the previous night. Joann testified that defendant became defensive and confirmed that he had been in Mary’s bedroom, but he stated that he had “always” checked on Mary. However, Joann testified that this upset her because that was not true and defendant “ha[d] no reason to be in [her] daughter’s room.” After the phone call with defendant, Joann asked her sister to attempt to elicit more information from Mary concerning defendant’s presence in her bedroom the night 1', 'Throughout this opinion, we use pseudonyms to identify the complaining witness and her mother. 2', 'During the course of trial, counsel for both sides, as well as the trial justice, refer to Mary as a six-year-old, as do we. However, the record reveals that Mary had, in fact, recently turned seven years old at the time of the alleged sexual assaults.', '2 before. Joann’s sister took Mary out to eat; when the two returned, Joann’s sister reported that Mary told her that defendant had “rubbed her butt.”', 'According to Joann, later in the day on February 9, 2013, defendant arrived at the apartment unannounced.', 'While there, defendant warned Joann, in what she characterized as a “very aggressive” manner, to “keep [her] windows locked.” That same day, Joann called the police. When the police arrived, they spoke with Joann and then took Joann and Mary to Hasbro Children’s Hospital. Mary was interviewed at a later date by the Child Advocacy Center. Defendant was arrested and the grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with three counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault on December 18, 2013.', 'Mary, who was ten years old at the time of trial, testified as to three separate times— comprising the three separate counts of the indictment—that defendant entered her bedroom on the night in question. Mary testified that defendant came into her bedroom while she was sleeping and pulled down her pants and underwear; Mary then felt a fingernail and a finger go inside her buttocks. Mary then testified that defendant again “did something bad” to her. According to Mary, she heard someone stomping in her room and remembers feeling something wet on her buttocks. Mary testified that defendant again pulled down her pants and underwear; she testified that, when she tried to move toward the wall, defendant grabbed her on the stomach. According to Mary, “[i]t was kind of in, but not that much”; she testified that defendant was moving a little and she knew it was in her buttocks because it “hurted” her. Finally, Mary testified that the final time defendant entered her bedroom she felt a hand, fingers, and fingernails squeeze her buttocks.', 'The state also called Joann as a witness. Defense counsel, during his cross-examination of Joann, attempted to elicit a motive for the accusations against defendant. In that inquiry,', '3 defense counsel asked Joann if she desired to have children with defendant, if she was aware that defendant had five children, and if she knew that defendant had previously had a vasectomy. During this line of questioning, Joann denied wanting to have children with defendant, confirmed knowledge of the fact that he had had a vasectomy, and further stated that defendant was “not able to see” his children. The state’s redirect examination of Joann on the topic of defendant not being able to see his children, discussed in more detail below, is at issue in this appeal.', 'At the conclusion of two days of trial, the jury found defendant guilty of the lesser- included offense of second-degree child molestation sexual assault on the first two counts, and also guilty of second-degree child molestation sexual assault on the third count. Thereafter, defendant moved for a new trial, arguing that the trial testimony lacked any indication of the necessary element of sexual gratification as to all three counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. Moreover, defendant averred that Mary’s testimony indicating that there were two instances of penetration, particularly in light of the jury’s finding of not guilty on the two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, precluded a finding of guilty on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. Ultimately, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial and sentenced defendant to three concurrent twenty-year terms of imprisonment, with seven years to serve and the remainder of the sentences suspended, with probation. Defendant timely appealed to this Court, arguing that the trial justice erred: (1) in overruling defendant’s objection to Mary’s testimony about existing restraining orders that prevented defendant from seeing his children and failing to strike that portion of Joann’s testimony; and (2) in denying his motion for a new trial.', '4', 'II', 'Standards of Review', 'A', 'Admission of Testimony Regarding Prior Restraining Orders', '“Evidentiary rulings * * * are reviewed for abuse of discretion.” State v.

Specifically, defendant contends that the trial justice’s failure to respond to the objection or to strike Joann’s testimony allowed the jury to “speculate on why such an order had been necessary and what behavior it was intended to forestall.” The following exchange occurred during the state’s redirect examination of Joann:', '“[THE STATE:]', 'Defense counsel asked you about', 'wanting to have a child with the', 'defendant.

Accordingly, failure to make a specific objection—or any objection—will trigger the longstanding “raise-or-waive” rule. The record reveals that defense counsel did not object to the state’s question to Joann confirming her prior testimony on cross-examination as to her knowledge regarding whether defendant could see his children, and defense counsel similarly did not object or move to strike after Joann answered that defendant “has restraining orders.” Instead, defense counsel made a blanket objection to the state’s question, “Why is that?” The defendant never articulated a specific reason for the objection, and likewise did not specify which part of Joann’s testimony he believed should be stricken from the record. Moreover, defendant did not request a limiting instruction or move for a mistrial at any point during the questioning or thereafter. For these reasons, the “raise-or-waive” rule precludes defendant from raising the issue of the admission of Joann’s testimony—that defendant “has restraining orders”—into evidence at trial.', 'Even if defendant had properly preserved this issue on appeal through a timely and specific objection, the record reveals that defense counsel opened the door to the state’s inquiry on the topic during his cross-examination of Joann. Notably, during the cross-examination, defense counsel asked Joann if she was aware that defendant had had a vasectomy. Moreover, defense counsel asked Joann whether she was aware that defendant had five children of his own. In response, Joann testified that she knew defendant had five children and that “he can’t see', '8 them.” Accordingly, even if a proper objection to the testimony had been raised, it would not have been an abuse of discretion to allow Joann’s testimony on this issue because defendant opened the door during his cross-examination of Joann. See Virola, 115 A.3d at 997 (holding that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in overruling the defendant’s objection, because the defendant opened the door during cross-examination of the witness).', 'B', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant also appeals the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial. Specifically, defendant posits that the trial justice abused his discretion because the jury finding defendant “guilty of second degree assaults instead of first degree assaults as charged was an insufficient response to testimony that was essentially vague and incredible.”', 'Moreover, defendant maintains that the trial justice’s analysis regarding Mary’s testimony was “entirely conclusory.”', 'As we have noted, “when ruling on a motion for a new trial, the ‘record should reflect a few sentences of the justice’s reasoning on each point.’” Virola, 115 A.3d at 991 (quoting State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 947 (R.I. 2012)). In denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice thoroughly explained his reasoning and rationale. He first reviewed the language of his jury instructions, which included the admonition to the jury that the state was required to prove that defendant engaged in the alleged activity “for the specific purpose of achieving sexual gratification or arousal[.]” He concluded that defendant’s actions were for the purpose of arousal, “irrespective of whether it was also for sexual gratification.” The trial justice then addressed Mary’s testimony and acknowledged that certain aspects were not as clear on cross- examination as they were on direct regarding the “penetration element.” However, the trial', '9 justice also noted that the victim was testifying as a fourth-grader to events that transpired when she was merely six years old and in the first grade. Additionally, the trial justice explained that Mary’s testimony, in his view, was “unembellished, unvarnished, and, in a word, credible, to the point of the sexual misconduct.” Finally, the trial justice expressed his agreement with the jury’s verdict and their decision to render guilty verdicts on the first two counts of the indictment for second-degree child molestation sexual assault, rather than first-degree child molestation sexual assault as charged, due to the lack of sufficiently explicit testimony on the issue of penetration. The trial justice specifically found it clear that “the jury gave careful attention to all the evidence. They deliberated several hours, they asked pertinent questions * * *. It is clear * * * that these jurors did not rush to judgment.” For these reasons, we accept the credibility determinations of the trial justice, and we see no reason to disrupt his decision denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

At a jury trial in Washington County Superior Court, two contrasting versions of events were described by defendant and the complaining witness, Jane.2 The nine-day trial included seventeen witnesses, both lay and expert, and a large number of exhibits pertaining to serious allegations of sexual assault by defendant. Additionally, evidence of several surgeries that resulted in a lengthy recovery period for Jane was introduced.', 'After the close of the state’s case-in-chief, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal as to count one (first-degree sexual assault based on anal penetration). Later, the defense presented its case, the parties rested, and closing arguments were heard by the jury. After the state’s closing argument, defendant objected to what he characterized as an “improper plea to the passions of the jury” when, according to defendant, the prosecutor cried at the end of her closing argument.', 'The trial justice remarked that she had not noticed the prosecutor cry, but she added that the issue had been brought to her attention. The trial justice 2', 'We refer to the complaining witness in this case by a pseudonym to protect her privacy.', '-2- questioned the prosecutor, who admitted that she had become “choked up[,]” but stated that she “didn’t cry.” The trial justice suggested the following curative instruction for the jury:', '“As is the case in many trials, emotions run high.

That’s fine.” The curative instruction was then given to the jury, with no objection.', 'Also during her instructions to the jury, the trial justice informed the jurors that they would be given a verdict form with six questions, one for each of the six remaining counts of the indictment. Each question referred to the specific acts that formed the basis for that particular count. Ultimately, after deliberations, the jury found defendant not guilty on counts two and three, first-degree sexual assault based upon two alleged acts of oral penetration. The jury also found defendant not guilty on count four, assault with a dangerous weapon, which was based on the allegation that defendant had choked Jane with his hands, and count seven, assault and battery, which was based on the allegation that defendant had bitten Jane’s arm. The jury found defendant guilty on count six, assault and battery, which was based on a bite to Jane’s cheek. On count five, first-degree sexual assault based upon anal penetration, the jury deadlocked and did not reach a verdict.', 'Based on the mistrial resulting from the hung jury, the trial justice scheduled a status conference for February 8, 2017, because it was evident that the state would retry defendant on', '-3- the deadlocked count.', 'The state and defendant then filed several pretrial motions.', 'The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the sole remaining count, arguing that double jeopardy barred a retrial of acquitted conduct that arose from the same set of facts previously decided by the jury and further arguing that the prosecutor had engaged in conduct that was intended to cause a mistrial. The defendant also filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude any reference to acquitted conduct from the first trial. The state objected to defendant’s motions and moved in limine to permit evidence related to the acquitted conduct.

According to defendant, the state would be relying on the same facts upon which a jury has already found defendant not guilty, in violation of his right to be free from double jeopardy.', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'When a defendant alleges a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, it “presents this Court with a mixed question of law and fact.” State v.

The defendant is not being prosecuted for the same offense after a conviction, and he will not be punished twice for the same offense. The defendant merely asserts that admitting the acquitted conduct into evidence would force him to relitigate issues already decided by a valid judgment of acquittal.', 'The defendant cites to two United States Supreme Court cases, Yeager v. United States, 557 U.S. 110 (2009), and Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436 (1970), for the proposition that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes the state “from relitigating any issue that was necessarily decided by a jury’s acquittal in a prior trial.” Yeager, 557 U.S. at 119. The defendant correctly states that those two cases explained that “‘when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment’ of acquittal, it ‘cannot again be litigated’ in a second', '-6- trial for a separate offense.” Id. (quoting Ashe, 397 U.S. at 443). The defendant, however, does not argue that the jury in the first trial necessarily decided the ultimate issue in count five, which resulted in a deadlocked jury and is the only count for which the state seeks a retrial. Instead, defendant argues that the jury necessarily decided certain issues when they acquitted him on counts two, three, four, and seven, and that admitting that acquitted conduct into evidence, pursuant to Rule 404(b), would force defendant to relitigate those same issues already decided by a valid judgment of acquittal, in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. This argument conflates a double jeopardy contention with one that is evidentiary.', 'We have consistently held that collateral estoppel does not bar the use of acquitted conduct and that such evidence may be admissible. See, e.g., State v. Hewes, 666 A.2d 402, 403 (R.I. 1995); State v. Bernier, 491 A.2d 1000, 1005 (R.I. 1985). “The fact of acquittal goes to the weight, not the admissibility, of the evidence.” Hewes, 666 A.2d at 403. Whether defendant’s acquitted conduct is admissible under Rule 404(b) at his retrial on count five is an issue that is not properly before us at this time, as evidentiary issues are matters to be left to the time of trial and do not “fall within the exception * * * which permits a party to appeal, on double jeopardy grounds, before the entry of a final judgment.” State v.

Detective Black testified that, when he administered the test to a small sample of the substance in the bag, it turned purple, indicating the presence of heroin. The defendant objected to the lack of a full toxicology report on the substance, and questioned the validity of the field test.', 'Detective Black stated that he had noticed that a nearby liquor store had video surveillance cameras facing the street, and he requested that the store’s owner or manager allow him to view any footage of the arrest.

Thornton also filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, motions to assign the matters for a hearing and status conference, a motion to proceed in forma pauperis, and a motion to appoint counsel. About three months later, on October 30, 2009, Thornton filed further motions and supporting materials: a motion to correct an illegal sentence; a motion to reopen for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence; and a supplemental memorandum in support of his motion to dismiss or vacate.', 'The motions filed in August and October 2009 set forth two grounds for relief. First, Thornton contended that his conviction on both count 3 (assault with a dangerous weapon) and count 5 (felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury) violated the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. Second, he argued that the prosecutor had violated Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure by failing to produce certain victim-impact statements in response to his discovery requests.', 'Counsel was appointed to represent Thornton on October 30, 2009.

Counsel wrote that the rule announced in Stravato should not be applied retroactively and therefore should not serve as a basis on which relief could be granted.', 'In a letter to the Superior Court justice who would soon conduct a hearing on Thornton’s claims for relief, Thornton objected to the positions taken by his counsel in the Shatney memorandum. On April 8, 2010, the parties appeared before that hearing justice.

Thornton’s counsel then briefly reiterated the arguments in his Shatney memorandum. The hearing justice then permitted Thornton to respond.', 'Thornton took issue with his counsel’s conclusion that the prosecution’s failure to produce certain victim-impact statements could not serve as grounds for postconviction relief. He stated, “I am not asking you [the hearing justice] to decide if Stravato applies. I am asking you to decide the [longstanding] case law of the rule of Brady v. Maryland to determine if a Rule memorandum in which counsel “lists each issue the applicant wished to raise, and explains why in [his or her] professional opinion those issues and any others that he or she may have investigated lacked merit.” Id.', '-3- 16 violation occurred.” 3 Thornton contended that Stravato “[did] not create a new rule,” but rather “reinforce[d]” the state’s obligation to comply with Rule 16.', 'Thornton also submitted an affidavit from the attorney who had served as his standby counsel at trial. That attorney confirmed that the state had not produced the victim-impact statements at issue in response to Thornton’s initial discovery request. Additionally, he averred that the state had objected to a subsequent discovery request filed by Thornton and, at a hearing before the trial justice, had stated that it had produced everything required by Brady and Rule 16.

This supplemental Shatney memorandum concluded that Thornton had “suffered no demonstrable procedural prejudice” as a result of the state’s inadvertent nondisclosure of the victim-impact statements and that those statements did not meet Brady’s standard of materiality. The state also filed a memorandum in which it urged the court to reject Thornton’s arguments.', 'Another hearing on this matter was held on September 27, 2010.

On October 21, 2010, the hearing justice filed a written decision, denying Thornton’s claim for relief. At the outset, the hearing justice stated that “Thornton ha[d] abandoned any claims under Stravato.” He concluded that Thornton was not entitled to a new trial based on Brady “because the information in the victim[-]impact statements was either immaterial or already provided in discovery.” He found that the statements provided “neither exculpatory nor impeachment evidence.” He also observed that the statements had been filed with the court and were thus “readily available to both Thornton * * * and his standby counsel.” Accordingly, the hearing justice concluded that Thornton was not entitled to a new trial under Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 6', 'In an order entered on October 27, 2010, Thornton’s postconviction counsel was granted permission to withdraw.

However, as the state concedes, “the standard for obtaining a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is the same under Rule 33 as it is in the [postconviction-relief] context, see, e.g., Ferrell v. Wall, 889 A.2d 177, 184 (R.I. 2005).” 7', 'We treat Thornton’s appeal as timely even though it preceded the Superior Court’s entry of final judgment. See State v.

The state contends that Thornton’s claim is not only barred by res judicata, but also is meritless. Furthermore, the state argues that Thornton has not satisfied the test set forth in G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1, which permits the granting of a new trial based upon newly discovered evidence.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'Rhode Island’s statutory postconviction remedy is set forth in chapter 9.1 of title 10.

Thornton was indicted in September 1996. Shortly thereafter, on October 2, 1996, he filed a request for discovery. This request more or less mirrored the provisions of Rule 16; it included a request for prior statements of the prosecution’s expected trial witnesses. The state responded to Thornton’s request on October 21, 1996. This response included police statements from Debra Means and Diane Sullivan; both were dated June 19, 1996.', 'One month after the state responded to Thornton’s discovery request, on November 21, 1996, the state filed with the court copies of signed victim-impact statements that had been completed by Means and Sullivan in connection with requests for information from the Victim Witness Assistance program. About eight months later, on July 30, 1997, the state filed with the court a “Further Victim[-]Impact Statement” by Means. In this statement, dated July 28, 1997, Means reported that she had recently undergone surgery to repair a hernia that developed after Thornton stabbed her. It is undisputed that the state did not formally disclose any of these three victim-impact statements to Thornton.', '-8-', 'On October 9, 1997, Thornton filed a second motion for discovery, which more or less mirrored the first request he had filed one year earlier. 9', 'He also filed a motion for exculpatory evidence on October 23, 1997.

The hearing justice stated that he was “satisfied the [s]tate ha[d] complied pursuant to Brady and Rule 16,” and he denied Thornton’s request for further discovery. The case then proceeded to trial.', 'Years later, on August 3, 2009, Thornton filed a pro se motion for discovery and inspection of victim-impact statements from 1996 and 1997. During the ensuing postconviction- relief proceedings, the state produced the victim-impact statements on April 8, 2010.

Thornton attempted to release appointed counsel on March 13, 1997, but the court did not release his counsel until September 5, 1997.

See Anderson, 45 A.3d at 602 (barring claim of prosecutorial misconduct because grounds were available to applicant through counsel when he filed his initial postconviction-relief application).

A ‘reasonable probability’ is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.” United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985). The Bagley court also clarified that “[i]mpeachment evidence * * * falls within the Brady rule.” Id. at 676.', 'We conclude that, even if the state had disclosed the victim-impact statements to him before trial, Thornton has failed to demonstrate that the result of his trial would have been different.

This speculation falls far short of “‘reasonable probability’ * * * sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome” of his trial. See Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682. Because Thornton cannot satisfy Bagley’s standard of materiality, his claim under Brady must fail.', '- 11 -', 'C', 'Rule 16', 'In addition to Brady’s mandate, prosecutors must also comply with the discovery obligations set forth in our court rules. Rule 16(a) allows a defendant to seek discovery from the prosecution “[u]pon written request.” Among other things, defendants may seek production of “all written or recorded verbatim statements” of the prosecution’s expected trial witnesses. Rule 16(a)(8). The rule imposes upon the prosecution (and the defendant, if the state seeks reciprocal discovery from him or her) a continuing duty to disclose additional discoverable material, if requested. Rule 16(h). Subsection (i) of Rule 16 allows the court to impose sanctions for noncompliance.', 'In Stravato, 935 A.2d at 953, the state admitted that the prosecutor had deliberately withheld a victim-impact statement from the defendant based on her good-faith belief that Rule 16 did not require her to produce it. We vacated the judgment of conviction, holding that because “the state’s nondisclosure was deliberate, * * * prejudice is presumed and the defendant [was] entitled to a new trial.” Id. We also observed that “[t]he [state’s] nondisclosure [was] particularly significant in a case such as this in which the prosecution relie[d] primarily on the testimony of the witness whose statement was withheld from [the] defendant.” Id. at 955.', 'Here, by contrast, the state characterized the nondisclosure of the victim-impact statements as “inadvertent” and denied that they were “consciously excluded” from the state’s responses to Thornton’s requests for discovery. Indeed, if the state had intended to conceal the presence of these statements from Thornton, filing them with the clerk of the court would have been a poor way to do so. We do not presume prejudice unless the nondisclosure was deliberate. See Stravato, 935 A.2d at 951 (citing State v. Vocatura, 922 A.2d 110, 118 (R.I. 2007)).

The defendant, Craig Van Dongen, was found guilty of domestic simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct by a Superior Court justice sitting without a jury. He now appeals from the judgment of conviction, arguing that the trial justice erred by: (1) overlooking and misconceiving material evidence; (2) failing to apply the correct burden of proof with respect to his claim of self-defense; (3) barring evidence and cross- examination as to motive and bias and abusing her discretion concerning a number of evidentiary rulings; and (4) denying his motion for a new trial. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument.

We deem it necessary, therefore, to summarize in some detail the unfortunate events as recounted by both Ms. Andrew and defendant—omitting, however, much of the expletive-laced epithets that each party claims the other copiously employed.', 'Ms. Andrew testified that she met defendant at the Kent County courthouse in 2006 when they were both involved in separate divorce proceedings.

In August 2009, however, their relationship ended for a period of approximately six months.', 'Ms. Andrew testified that the couple resumed dating when defendant visited Ms. Andrew at her parents’ house and proclaimed that “he couldn’t live without [her].

In November of 2010, they moved into a house in North Kingstown, which defendant had purchased.', 'On January 13, 2012, the couple had an argument that led to the underlying charges against defendant. The facts of the altercation were very much in dispute at trial. Ms. Andrew testified that she and defendant had returned home from dinner and were watching television in the living room, when defendant “instigated an argument.” She explained that they “were watching TV, and [defendant] was packing for his [weekend] trip. And he started to complain about the house, and that it was a mess and complained that it was [her] fault and [her] children’s fault and yelled at [her].” Ms. Andrew testified that she refused to engage defendant and told defendant that she was going to bed. At approximately 11 or 11:30 p.m., she took out her contact lenses, went to bed, and fell asleep. Ms. Andrew described that sometime thereafter she was awakened when defendant “came to bed yelling.” She testified that defendant was yelling that the house was a mess and that it was her fault. Ms. Andrew asked defendant not to yell, but', '-3- he did not respond. He then said, “[h]ow much f’ng money is it going to take me to get rid of you?” Ms. Andrew testified that she told defendant, “I love you” and “[i]t’s not about the money.” Ms. Andrew stated that defendant then called her “a fucking whore” and exposed himself to her. She said that she was “afraid” and “shocked.”', 'Ms. Andrew testified that she got out of bed, picked up the suitcase defendant had packed for the weekend, and walked “toward the [bedroom] door to ask him to go sleep down in the basement [bedroom], because he was scaring [her],” but that defendant “jumped out of the bed and grabbed the bag.” Ms. Andrew added that defendant pushed her in her abdomen. She attempted to “slap [defendant] to make him stop,” but defendant “grabbed [her] and screamed, ‘I hate you * * *’ [and he] threw [her] down on the floor.” Ms. Andrew further testified that she landed on her left side and covered her face with her hands to protect herself while defendant held her down and punched her head, ear, and neck. Ms. Andrew also testified that defendant “was kicking [her] in the back, in the buttocks, [her] legs, [and her] ankle. He stomped on [her] hips. Then he punched [her] head some more.” She added that, while she was on the ground, defendant had been screaming, “I wish you were dead * * * I hate you.” She said she told defendant that “[she] was bleeding from [her] head and that [she] needed help,” but he responded, “[y]ou’re not hurt you fucking drama queen,” and he kicked her in the back “three, four more times” before it stopped. Thereafter, defendant left the room and Ms. Andrew crawled to her phone on the bureau and called 911.', 'Conversely, defendant testified that, around 11 p.m. on January 13, 2012, he and Ms. Andrew decided to watch a television program. He stated that Ms. Andrew had fallen asleep on the couch when he got up to pack his bags for the weekend because he was going to play tennis early the next morning and then travel to see his sister in Maine. After he packed his bags, he', '-4- woke Ms. Andrew to tell her “it was time for bed.” He said that he went to bed and then she came into the room and started arguing with him. He testified that he did not “recall how it actually got started, but [he] kn[ew] she was upset that [he] was going up to Maine by [him]self * * *.” The defendant said that, at approximately 1:30 a.m., he told Ms. Andrew that he “had to get up in the morning and [he] wanted some sleep. * * * [He] picked up [his] bags to leave the room, and she got up and just blocked the door.” He described Ms. Andrew’s stance as that of a “linebacker” who would not let him leave. He said Ms. Andrew told him, “we’re going to finish this,” so he put his bags down and got back into bed, while they continued to argue. According to defendant, they argued for a “couple of hours” primarily about his family, her drinking, and financial matters. The defendant testified that Ms. Andrew referred to his daughter and his former wife in derogatory terminology.', 'The defendant testified that, after arguing for another forty-five minutes, he got out of bed a second time and told Ms. Andrew that he had to go to sleep, but that she again blocked the door. He continued: “I was going to go downstairs. Um, I got out of bed, picked my bags up, * * * and that’s when she kind of came right up to me.” The defendant described Ms. Andrew as having “kind of a crazed look in her eye,” stating that “it was kind of a scary look that she gets.” He testified that she swung at him “with a closed fist.” He added:', '“She hit me with her right hand in my left eye. And she hit me so', 'hard that, um, I, I kind of blacked out momentarily. * * * I came', 'to, and she was swinging at me with her left hand, and at that point', 'I must have dropped the bags because I was able to deflect her', 'swing a little bit.

I hit her above her left eye in the forehead. * * * I hit her hard.” He described punching her as a “reflex.” He stated that they continued to fight, describing it as a “wrestling', '-5- match.” He remembered that he “pushed her across the bed” and “she was wailing” on the floor. Thereafter, he left the room as he saw Ms. Andrew making a phone call.', 'A compact disc containing a recording of Ms. Andrew’s call to 911 was admitted into evidence at trial. During the call, Ms. Andrew acknowledged that she slapped defendant after he called her a “fucking whore.” She stated that, subsequently, defendant threw her to the floor. Throughout the call, Ms. Andrew reiterated that she was in pain.', 'Detective Jesse Jarvis 4 of the Town of North Kingstown Police Department and Lieutenant Ernest Robin, a paramedic for the Town of North Kingstown, were part of the team who responded to Ms. Andrew’s 911 call. At trial, Det. Jarvis stated that, when he arrived at the house, Ms. Andrew opened the door and was “hysterical.” “She was crying, bleeding, * * * seemed pretty out of it.” Detective Jarvis observed blood “[o]n the right side of her head,” describing that “she ha[d] light-colored blond hair, * * * it looked pretty bad.” He testified that Ms. Andrew told him that “her fianc[é] had beat her and kicked her, punched her, stomped on her.” Thereafter, Det. Jarvis searched the house for defendant and found him in a basement bedroom. Detective Jarvis testified that defendant told him, “I’m sorry, I hit her. I lost control. * * * She slapped me, so I hit her.”', 'Lieutenant Robin testified that, when he arrived at the scene, he noticed Ms. Andrew “was visibly upset, crying * * * she had some bleeding in * * * one of her ears.” He also observed that her right hand “was swollen and bruised distal from her wrist and then encompassed her thumb and forefinger.” He stated that he took Ms. Andrew to Rhode Island Hospital in an ambulance. 4', 'Detective Jarvis was a patrolman at the time he responded to the 911 call.', '-6-', 'Doctor Elizabeth Nestor, an attending physician at Rhode Island Hospital, testified at trial based on the medical records. She stated that she treated Ms. Andrew for “an ear contusion and lacerations, hand contusion, and ankle abrasion * * * and a leg contusion and a blow to the head.” Four days later, Ms. Andrew returned to the hospital complaining of blood in her urine. Doctor Francesca Lynne Beaudoin, an emergency physician at Rhode Island Hospital, testified that she treated Ms. Andrew for complaints of “hematuria, which is blood in the urine, and bruising to her flank, which is basically the side of her abdomen.” Doctor Beaudoin explained that Ms. Andrew “probably had suffered some minor bruising to her kidney,” and she believed that “the report of hematuria was related to trauma.”', 'Ms. Andrew’s therapist, Terry Giblin, and the couple’s therapist, Peter Olivieri, also testified at trial. However, the trial justice denied defendant’s request to question these witnesses on whether Ms. Andrew argued with defendant about his family during therapy sessions, stating that it was not relevant to whether the assault had happened.', 'After the state rested its case, defendant made a motion to dismiss count 1, assault with a dangerous weapon.', 'The trial justice granted defendant’s motion to dismiss the count as originally styled, i.e., “assault with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a foot,” and the charge was amended to simple assault, a misdemeanor. 5 After the trial concluded, the trial justice issued a written decision on April 1, 2014, finding defendant guilty of simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct.', 'In her decision, the trial justice accepted Ms. Andrew’s testimony as “wholly credible,” stating that her “in-court testimony [was] compellingly reinforced by the 911 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-5-3(a) reads: “Except as otherwise provided in § 11-5-2, every person who shall make an assault or battery or both shall be imprisoned not exceeding one year or fined not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or both.”', '-7- recording, [Det.] Jarvis, the photographic evidence of her injuries and the expert testimony of the physicians who cared for her.”', 'Subsequently, defendant made a motion for reconsideration of his motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, to grant a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice denied both motions. The defendant was sentenced to a one-year suspended sentence with probation on count 1 and six months probation on count 2. The defendant timely appealed from the judgment of conviction.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant raises four issues. First, defendant contends that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence when considering the credibility of the witnesses. Second, he asserts that the trial justice failed to apply the correct burden of proof with respect to his claim of self-defense. Third, he asserts that the trial justice abused her discretion “by barring evidence and cross-examination as to motive and bias” and “allowing evidence that purportedly supported the prosecution and disallowing similar evidence that supported the defense.” Fourth, defendant argues that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence when considering his motion for a new trial.', 'A', 'Credibility Determinations', '1. Standard of Review', 'Recognizing that credibility assessments are inherently the function of the trial court and not the appellate court, this Court is very deferential when reviewing the credibility determinations of a trial justice sitting without a jury. “[We] will not disturb the trial justice’s', '-8- findings unless they are clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1222 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. LaCroix, 911 A.2d 674, 679 (R.I. 2006)). “It is well-established that we ‘accord a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.’” State v. Erminelli, 991 A.2d 1064, 1069 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Gonzalez, 986 A.2d 235, 242 (R.I. 2010)). “When ‘the record indicates that competent evidence supports the trial justice’s findings, we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for his [or hers] even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.’” South County Post & Beam, Inc. v. McMahon, 116 A.3d 204, 210 (R.I. 2015) (quoting JPL Livery Services, Inc. v. Rhode Island Department of Administration, 88 A.3d 1134, 1142 (R.I. 2014)).', '2. Credibility of Ms. Andrew’s Testimony', 'As defendant acknowledges in his papers, “the standard for overturning factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury is quite high”; nevertheless, he maintains that “[t]his [case] is the rare outlier which exceeds that bar.” He recites a number of purported inconsistencies between Ms. Andrew’s testimony at trial and statements she made to medical personnel and the police. He claims that her “accounts of a vicious beating with repeated kicks to her lower back” were belied by photographs and medical records documenting only minor injuries.', 'The defendant also asserts that the trial justice’s finding that Ms. Andrew was “wholly credible” was “impossible to reconcile with irrefutable objective evidence,” and that the trial justice abused her discretion by disregarding counseling records that contradicted Ms. Andrew’s testimony', '-9- concerning her relationship with defendant. Moreover, defendant contends that the trial justice erred by failing to explain why she rejected evidence that Ms. Andrew struck the first blow, injured her ear by hitting it on furniture or the floor, sought monetary damages from defendant after the incident, and had made false assertions in sworn court documents about being sexually assaulted by defendant.', 'Even if we were to conclude that Ms. Andrew’s testimony as to the extent of her injuries was exaggerated or that her account of the incident was indeed embellished or that the trial justice’s characterization of her testimony as “wholly credible” was somewhat hyperbolic, we are nevertheless satisfied that competent evidence existed on the record to support the convictions.', 'Neither the purported inconsistencies in Ms. Andrew’s testimony nor any contradictory evidence undermines the ultimate finding of the trial justice that the state proved that defendant had committed both the offenses of simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct.', '“We have defined simple assault as an ‘unlawful attempt or offer, with force or violence, to do a corporal hurt to another, whether from malice or wantonness.’” State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 620 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Pope, 414 A.2d 781, 788 (R.I. 1980)).', 'Domestic disorderly conduct occurs under §§ 12-29-2(4) and 11-45-1(a)(1) when a family or household member “[e]ngages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior” against another family or household member. Section 11-45-1(a)(1).', 'In the case at bar, the trial justice predicated her decision upon, in addition to the testimony of Ms. Andrew, the 911 recording, the testimony of Det. Jarvis, the photographic evidence of Ms. Andrew’s injuries, and the testimony of Drs. Nestor and Beaudoin. The 911 recording provides a contemporaneous audio account of the immediate aftermath of the incident', '- 10 - in which Ms. Andrew’s distress is palpable. To be sure, she explains to the operator that she slapped defendant before he threw her to the floor, yet there can be little doubt that she had just endured a very distressing and tumultuous episode.', 'Detective Jarvis testified that, when he responded to the house, Ms. Andrew was hysterical, “[s]he was crying, bleeding, * * * seemed pretty out of it. * * * It looked pretty bad.” She told him that “her fianc[é] had beat her and kicked her, punched her, stomped on her.” He observed bruises on her forehead, face, and chin area. He also noticed blood on her right ear, but he testified that she told him she had hit her head on a piece of furniture when defendant had pushed her down. After searching for defendant and announcing himself as “North Kingstown Police” in a loud voice approximately twenty times, Det. Jarvis located defendant in a basement bedroom. Significantly, defendant admitted to Det. Jarvis that he had hit Ms. Andrew after she had slapped him, stating, “I’m sorry, I hit her. I lost control.” Detective Jarvis also testified that defendant said, “I punched her” and made a punching motion with his hands.', 'Lieutenant Robin also responded to defendant’s house that morning in his capacity as a paramedic. He described Ms. Andrew as bleeding from a minor laceration and having a swollen right hand. Lieutenant Robin testified that Ms. Andrew told him that the physical altercation had started when defendant had called her a whore, then she slapped him in the face and he pushed her to the floor and “started to punch and kick her, and he wouldn’t stop when she cried.”', 'The court also heard testimony from Drs. Nestor and Beaudoin, the two emergency room physicians who treated Ms. Andrew. Doctor Nestor testified that, on January 14, 2012, Ms. Andrew presented with “an ear contusion and lacerations, hand contusion, and ankle abrasion * * * and a blow to the head.” Her primary complaint was the head injury. No lab tests were ordered, however, and she was discharged after receiving ten sutures. Doctor Beaudoin, who', '- 11 - was qualified as an expert witness in emergency medicine, was on duty in the Rhode Island Hospital Emergency Room on January 18, 2012, when Ms. Andrew presented with complaints of blood in the urine, and bruising to the side of her abdomen. The doctor stated that she examined Ms. Andrew and observed “significant bruising” to her right flank. Although a urine test did not reveal the presence of blood, Dr. Beaudoin indicated that she assumed the hematuria was temporary, and she did not change her diagnostic impression. She further testified that, in her opinion, Ms. Andrew’s complaint of hematuria was related to trauma to the kidney.', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice was “obligated to clarify why she rejected” evidence contrary to Ms. Andrew’s testimony.', 'We have stated that “[t]he failure to refer to other evidence contradictory to that on which the trial justice relied * * * does not constitute misconceiving or overlooking material evidence, if the trial justice refers to the evidence on which he [or she] did rely and in so doing clearly indicates that evidence to the contrary is rejected by him [or her].” DiMaio v. Del Sesto, 102 R.I. 116, 122, 228 A.2d 861, 864 (1967). “It is well settled that where the testimony of two witnesses is conflicting and the trier of facts expressly accepts the testimony of one of the witnesses, he implicitly rejects that of the other.” Blecha v. Wells Fargo Guard-Company Service, 610 A.2d 98, 102 (R.I. 1992) (quoting Turgeon v. Davis, 120 R.I. 586, 592, 388 A.2d 1172, 1175 (1978)). Thus, the trial justice impliedly rejected defendant’s testimony by her express acceptance of Ms. Andrew’s conflicting testimony. See id.', 'Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive any evidence.', 'We are of the opinion, therefore, that sufficient competent and credible evidence exists in the record to support the trial justice’s finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the offenses of simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct. The trial justice, an', '- 12 - experienced justice who observed the demeanor and conduct of the two principal witnesses, emphatically accepted the testimony of Ms. Andrew. The defendant’s arguments on appeal provide inadequate cause to reject her credibility determinations.', 'B', 'Self-Defense', 'The defendant contends that he presented “sufficient evidence to raise a self-defense claim,” and that the trial justice erred by failing to require the state to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'The defendant maintains that the trial justice “erroneously overlooked significant evidence of self-defense,” specifically, his testimony that Ms. Andrew struck the first two blows, and his facial injuries. The defendant also asserts that Ms. Andrew “admitted to the 911 operator, investigating police officer, paramedic, and emergency room nurse that she initiated the physical attack.” 6', '“It is well settled that ‘[u]nder the law relating to self-defense, one may defend oneself whenever one reasonably believes that he or she is in imminent danger of bodily harm at the hands of another.’” State v. Urena, 899 A.2d 1281, 1288 (R.I. 2006) (quoting State v. D’Amario, 568 A.2d 1383, 1385 (R.I. 1990)). Although “[o]ne ‘need not wait for the other to strike the first blow[,] * * * such a person must use only such force as is reasonably necessary for his [or her] own protection.’” Id. (quoting D’Amario, 568 A.2d at 1385). “The permissible degree of force used in defense of oneself varies with the particular set of circumstances in which he or she acts, but in no set of circumstances may one apply more than that degree of force necessary to prevent bodily injury.” State v. Linde, 876 A.2d 1115, 1129 (R.I. 2005) (quoting D’Amario, 568 A.2d at 6', 'Although Ms. Andrew admitted to slapping defendant, the record is devoid of any evidence that she admitted to initiating the attack, and defendant fails to point to specific evidence in the record to support his allegations that Ms. Andrew made these admissions.', '- 13 - 1385). “In addition, a defendant who was the initial aggressor of the combative confrontation is generally not entitled to rely on self-defense.” Urena, 899 A.2d at 1288.', 'In the case under review, the trial justice credited Ms. Andrew’s testimony that defendant was the initial aggressor by “jump[ing] toward her and push[ing] her in the abdomen.” Moreover, the trial justice specifically rejected defendant’s contention that the state failed to carry its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant’s use of force was unreasonable in the exercise of self-defense. Based upon our review of the record, we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to support the trial justice’s conclusions. In addition to Ms. Andrew’s testimony that defendant had punched and kicked her after throwing her to the floor, defendant testified that he had punched her “hard” and admitted to Det. Jarvis that he had “lost control.” Also, photographic exhibits and medical evidence demonstrate that Ms. Andrew did in fact sustain injuries and that her reported hematuria was related to trauma.', 'The pith of defendant’s argument concerning self-defense is again a challenge to the credibility determinations and factual findings of the trial justice. It is a most difficult hurdle to overcome in a jury-waived trial. As we have often stated: “[F]actual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are granted an extremely deferential standard of review.” State v. Gianquitti, 22 A.3d 1161, 1165 (R.I. 2011).', 'C', 'Evidentiary Rulings and Cross-Examination', 'The defendant also takes issue with a number of evidentiary rulings that the trial justice made during the course of the trial. He maintains that he “unsuccessfully sought to introduce evidence and elicit cross-examination to prove that Ms. Andrew, fueled by his rejection and her', '- 14 - precarious financial position, was vengeful and motivated to instigate the incident, fabricate her claims, and extract money from him.”', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice violated his constitutional rights and committed an abuse of discretion “by barring evidence and cross-examination as to motive and bias,” and “by allowing evidence that purportedly supported the prosecution and disallowing similar evidence that supported the defense.” Specifically, defendant contends that the trial justice erred by barring him from cross-examining Ms. Andrew as to her finances and by refusing to admit counseling records that referenced Ms. Andrew’s financial conflicts with defendant, “her fear of being on her own,” her conflicts with his family members, her alcohol use, and a “showdown” over setting a wedding date. He contends that the trial justice either prevented him from introducing such evidence or “failed to appreciate its significance” and that she barred impeachment evidence that “exposed Ms. Andrew’s lack of candor and credibility.” Moreover, defendant maintains that the trial justice erred by admitting only those portions of counseling records that purportedly supported Ms. Andrew’s account of the altercation.', '1. Standard of Review', 'Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution, this Court has held that “it is axiomatic that ‘the trial justice may not totally prevent the defendant from exploring the issues of motive, bias, or prejudice in the testimony of the state’s chief witness.’” State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1122 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Parillo, 480 A.2d 1349, 1357 (R.I. 1984) (emphasis omitted)). As such, the “trial justice has no discretion at all under the confrontation clause to completely prohibit defense counsel from attempting to elicit testimony from a crucial witness to demonstrate bias upon his part.” Id. (quoting Parillo, 480 A.2d at 1357 (emphasis omitted)). “For cross-examination to', '- 15 - satisfy constitutional guarantees, the trial justice is required to afford the accused ‘reasonable latitude’ to establish or reveal bias, prejudice, or ulterior motives as they may relate to the case being tried.” Id. at 1122-23 (quoting State v. Hazard, 745 A.2d 748, 756 (R.I. 2000)).', '“[O]nce sufficient cross-examination has been allowed, the constitutional safeguards are satisfied, and any further cross-examination is left within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Oliveira, 882 A.2d at 1123 (quoting Hazard, 745 A.2d at 756). Thus, when “the trial justice does not totally prevent or completely prohibit the defendant from exploring the issues of motive, bias, or prejudice of the witness, we employ an abuse-of-discretion standard on review.” Id. at 1122. “It is well settled that this Court will not disturb a trial justice’s ruling on an evidentiary issue unless that ruling constitutes an abuse of the justice’s discretion that prejudices the complaining party.” Thomas v. Proctor, 63 A.3d 881, 884 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Tetreault, 31 A.3d 777, 782 (R.I. 2011)).', '2. Analysis', 'In this case, defendant conducted an extensive cross-examination of Ms. Andrew, which included questioning Ms. Andrew on her finances, the engagement, and setting a wedding date. Thus, defendant was not barred from “exploring the issues of motive, bias, or prejudice” in Ms. Andrew’s testimony. See Oliveira, 882 A.2d at 1122 (quoting Parillo, 480 A.2d at 1357). Nor do we perceive any abuse of discretion in her rulings limiting cross-examination.', 'The record further reflects that, at the conclusion of the testimonial evidence, defendant moved to admit into evidence many of the counseling records from Ms. Andrew’s individual therapist and the couple’s therapist. He argued that “the records are probative of her increasing anger towards him for rejecting her and her bias against him, which apparently flowed from his expressed intent to terminate their lifestyle arrangement, and as a motive to pick a fight and a', '- 16 - motive to exaggerate her injuries in this case.” The trial justice admitted eight such records and ruled six as inadmissible. In excluding the evidence, the trial justice stated that evidence of the couple’s past arguments and disagreements at therapy sessions was not relevant, and would not help determine factually what happened on the night of the alleged assault. Moreover, the trial justice allowed testimony as to the couple’s (as she characterized it) “sometimes tempestuous[] relationship,” and their disagreements over families, household work, and finances, which the couple worked on at therapy. We agree with the trial justice that there was sufficient evidence presented concerning the night of the altercation and the relationship of the parties. Thus, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her considerable discretion or prejudice defendant by excluding certain counseling records.', 'D', 'Motion for New Trial', 'Finally, defendant avers that the trial justice erred by overlooking and misconceiving material evidence in denying his motion for a new trial. Specifically, defendant contends that the trial justice overlooked that Ms. Andrew’s testimony was not supported by her 911 call and the evidence presented at trial describing her injuries, and he also contends that Ms. Andrew varied her accounts of the incident and evaded answers about the state of her relationship with defendant. The defendant maintains that the trial justice erred by ignoring his testimony about self-defense and refusing to consider or admit evidence of Ms. Andrew’s bias and motive, including counseling records. We see no merit to these contentions.', '1. Standard of Review', 'Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides in part: “On motion of the defendant the court may grant a new trial to the defendant if required in the interest of', '- 17 - justice. If trial was by the court without a jury, the court * * * may vacate the judgment, take additional testimony, and direct the entry of a new judgment.” In reviewing the denial of a Rule 33 motion in a jury-waived trial, this Court “appl[ies] the same deferential standard of review as would be applied to the Superior Court justice’s factual findings on the merits.” State v. DiPetrillo, 922 A.2d 124, 131 (R.I. 2007). “Such determinations are entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed unless the trial justice has overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting State v. Champagne, 668 A.2d 311, 313 (R.I. 1995)).', '2. Analysis', 'In denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice incorporated her written decision in which she found the defendant guilty of both charges. As we stated above, there is competent evidence in the record to support the trial justice’s findings. See South County Post & Beam, Inc., 116 A.3d at 210 (stating that this Court will not substitute a trial justice’s findings when there is “competent” evidence on record to support that trial justice’s findings). Accordingly, we hold that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived evidence or otherwise clearly erred.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

This case came before the Supreme Court on May 8, 2019, on appeal by the defendant, Joel Najera (defendant), from a judgment of conviction entered in the Providence County Superior Court following a jury trial. Before this Court, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence.1 The parties were directed to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 23, 2016, defendant was charged by way of criminal information with one count of assault with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a machete, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (count 1), and one count of malicious injury to property, to wit, a car window and basement 1', 'Before the Superior Court justice, defendant’s motion for a new trial was based on two grounds: (1) newly discovered evidence, and (2) the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. On appeal, defendant challenges only the part of the decision in which the trial justice found that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence.', '-1- window, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-44-1 (count 2). A five-day jury trial commenced on October 30, 2017, in Providence County Superior Court. Several witnesses, including defendant, presented conflicting versions of events in this case, which occurred during the early hours of Christmas Day 2015. We proceed to summarize the pertinent testimony of the witnesses in the case.', 'The complaining witness, Luis Portillo (Portillo), testified that, on December 25, 2015, he was listening to music and having drinks with a group of friends in the basement apartment of a building located at 164 Regent Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island. Portillo testified that defendant knocked on the basement door and asked the group to turn down the music because “he had children upstairs”; defendant also indicated that if the volume was not lowered, “he was going to call the police.” Portillo testified that defendant looked “bothered” when he was speaking to the group and that “[h]is eyes, they were angry, and he talked really upset.” After the group turned the music off, defendant then asked Portillo to move his car because it was parked in defendant’s designated parking space; the two walked to the parking lot together.', 'As Portillo was getting into his car, he noticed in the driver’s side mirror that defendant was approaching him with a “bladed weapon” in his hand; Portillo subsequently described the bladed weapon as a machete. The defendant swung the machete at Portillo, who ducked and tried to back away. The defendant swung the machete a second time, slicing the left side of Portillo’s face from his left eye to his left nostril. As Portillo retreated to the basement of the apartment building, Rafael Sanchez, Sr. (Sanchez), another tenant of 164 Regent Avenue, walked into the parking lot, approached defendant, and told him to “calm down.”', 'While Portillo was cleaning his wound in the basement apartment, his friend, Steven Figueroa, called 911 and told the dispatcher that there was a “guy with a machete.” The dispatcher notified the Providence Police Department that a “male with the machete hit another', '-2- man in the face with the machete.”2 As they waited inside the house for the police officers to arrive, Portillo testified, he heard defendant breaking his car windows and the basement windows and heard defendant yell, “Come out. Come out because I’m going to kill you.” Once the police arrived and Portillo came outside, he noticed that his rear car window and his right rear passenger window had been shattered. An officer asked Portillo who had assaulted him, and Portillo told the officer that it was defendant. The police detained defendant, and Portillo was subsequently taken to the hospital.', 'At trial, Sanchez also testified for the prosecution. He recalled that, when his girlfriend dropped him off at 164 Regent Avenue on December 25, 2015, Portillo’s car was parked in defendant’s designated parking space. When Sanchez went to tell the group in the basement that they needed to move Portillo’s car, he “realized that [Portillo] was already going to move the car.” He returned to the parking lot and witnessed defendant take a machete from the trunk of his vehicle and hit Portillo in the face; Sanchez yelled, “Don’t do it,” to no avail. Sanchez proceeded to grab Portillo, brought him inside the house “so that he wouldn’t have more trouble,” and detained the group of friends in the basement so “they couldn’t go out because that was just going to make more problems[.]” Sanchez testified that he also heard defendant smash the car windows and the basement windows and heckle the group in the basement. Sanchez also went outside and spoke to the officers when they arrived.3 Sanchez testified that, during their investigation, the officers looked around the parking lot and inside defendant’s vehicle, but they did not find the machete. 2', 'The 911 tape was played for the jury. 3', 'Because Sanchez does not speak English, the statement that he made to the police was translated by his son’s friend.', '-3-', 'Maria Chevez (Chevez), Sanchez’s girlfriend, next testified that, at approximately 12 a.m. on December 25, 2015, she dropped Sanchez off at 164 Regent Avenue and proceeded to drop another friend at his home about five minutes away. When she returned to 164 Regent Avenue, she parked her car at the entrance of the driveway because her parking space was blocked by defendant’s vehicle. Chevez testified that, as she got out of her car, she approached defendant, who had a machete in his hand and appeared “nervous.” When she asked him what happened, defendant said, “Neighbor, I didn’t want to do it. I didn’t want to do it, Neighbor.” Chevez testified that she did not say anything else to defendant, but that, as she ran up the driveway, she noticed that the windows of a car were broken and that defendant’s sister was exiting the apartment building and appeared to be “scared.” As Chevez entered the building, she began to hear sirens and watched defendant throw the machete in the trunk of his vehicle. Chevez then saw Sanchez coming out of the basement while “trying to keep the kids who were inside from going outside.” She testified that when she spotted a bloodied Portillo with Sanchez, she went into the apartment building for a wet towel to help clean him. When Chevez went back outside, the police had arrived and defendant was inside a police cruiser. She also testified that she observed the officers searching the outside area for the machete, including defendant’s vehicle.', 'Patrolman Kyle Richards (Officer Richards) of the Providence Police Department was on duty on December 25, 2015, when he responded to a call at 164 Regent Avenue. Officer Richards testified that when he arrived he encountered two males and a female in the driveway, including Portillo. While Officer Richards and another Providence police officer were speaking with Portillo, defendant came from behind the apartment building “yelling in Spanish” and “kind of frantic.” After Portillo told the officers what occurred, Officer Richards immediately placed defendant in custody; Officer Richards testified that defendant was not bleeding, nor did he', '-4- appear to have any injuries. After defendant was placed in the police cruiser, the officers searched the area surrounding the apartment building for the machete, but it was not located.', 'After the state rested its case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the trial justice denied. The defense presented Stacy Rosario (Rosario), who also resided at 164 Regent Avenue on December 25, 2015. Rosario’s account of what happened markedly differed from that of the state’s witnesses. She testified that defendant woke her by knocking on her door, at approximately 1:30 a.m., to ask if her car was parked in his parking space, to which she responded in the negative and told him that it was probably a person from downstairs because they usually “take my parking” space. When defendant walked downstairs, Rosario testified, she heard people arguing about defendant’s parking space.', 'She then went to a window that overlooked the parking lot and observed defendant and “three or four boys” arguing with him. She testified that one of the boys got closer and closer to defendant and eventually pushed him. In response, defendant punched the boy in the face and the boy fell to the ground. The boy, whose face was bleeding, stood up with the aid of his friends and went back to the basement.', 'According to Rosario, she then went downstairs because, as someone who works in the medical field, “that’s something that you do naturally[.]” As she made her way outside to the parking lot, she encountered defendant’s sister; however, she did not see Sanchez, who, she testified, was not outside when the boy was punched and did not accompany the boy to the basement. She did, however, observe defendant break the windows of a car with his bare hands. Rosario testified that she attempted to calm defendant. At this point, according to Rosario, Sanchez appeared and she told him what happened. When asked whether she saw a machete in defendant’s possession, she responded, “No, I didn’t.” She also confirmed that the officers looked in the backyard at 164 Regent Avenue and opened the door to defendant’s vehicle, but did not locate a weapon.', '-5-', 'The defendant also called his sister, Jelen Najera, to testify.4 According to her testimony, it was between 2 and 3 a.m. when defendant arrived home and there was a car in his parking space. She recalled that he first went upstairs to see if it was a second-floor tenant’s car, then he went to the basement to see if the car belonged to anyone down there. Although she could hear arguing, Jelen testified, she could not discern what was being said. She then observed defendant come upstairs from the basement and walk out to the parking lot, followed by three men.', 'Jelen testified that, once everyone arrived in the parking lot, one of the men pushed defendant “in the throat.” Jelen testified that, in response, defendant “slapped” the man, who fell to the ground, “[a]nd that’s where he got cut.” The other men helped the injured man inside the house; Jelen noticed that the man who fell was bleeding from his face. She also noticed that two female neighbors from upstairs were standing in the parking lot as the police officers arrived. Next, Jelen testified that defendant “was furious and broke the car windows * * * [w]ith a fist.” She testified that she never saw defendant with a machete in his hands, but that she observed that his hands were “bleeding all over” after he broke the car windows. Jelen recalled that the officers took defendant into custody but failed to take any statements from Jelen or her female neighbors.', 'The defendant testified last and repeated much of Rosario and Jelen’s testimony. According to defendant, at approximately 2 a.m. on December 25, 2015, he arrived at 164 Regent Avenue and discovered that an unknown car was parked in his parking space. The defendant testified that he first went to the second floor of the apartment building and knocked on his neighbor’s door to ask about the vehicle. His neighbor told him that he should go ask the tenants who lived on the first floor or those who lived in the basement. The defendant testified that he went to the basement because he heard some music; and, when he knocked on the 4', 'For clarity, we refer to Jelen by her first name; we intend no disrespect by doing so.', '-6- basement door, defendant testified, he first asked the group in the basement to lower the music because he was going to rest; he testified that the group of people “were bothered” by his request and began arguing with him. The defendant testified that he told the group that “if they didn’t calm down that I was going to call the police[,]” and then asked that the car be moved.', 'The defendant testified that he went out to the parking lot to wait; after a couple of minutes, three men came out and continued to argue with him. The defendant testified that one of the men pushed him and, in response, he hit the man with his fist; the man “fell hard” to the pavement. The defendant testified that his sister told him to “calm down[,]” and the two other men picked up their friend, whose face was bleeding, and took him back to the basement. While the group retreated to the basement, defendant stayed outside because he was “very angry” and yelled at the group to “come outside.” When they did not exit the building, defendant testified, he punched two car windows so hard that the windows broke. While defendant was breaking the car windows, he testified, his sister and his two female neighbors were also outside standing behind him in the parking lot.', 'According to defendant, when the police arrived, one officer went inside the building, while the other officer remained outside with him. A few minutes later, the first police officer exited the apartment building with a group of people from the basement, who pointed to defendant as the person causing the problem. The defendant testified that the police officers: “grabbed me by my hands, they put my hands back, and they arrested me.” Contrary to Officer Richards’ testimony, however, defendant testified that his “right hand was bleeding a lot.” He also testified that the officers took the key to his vehicle and searched it “[f]or about five minutes.” When asked by his counsel whether he attacked anyone with a machete that evening, defendant replied in the negative and stated that he did not own a machete.', '-7-', 'The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts, and on November 29, 2017, defendant’s motion for a new trial was heard and denied. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced to three years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with one year to serve and two years suspended, with probation, on count one; and one year suspended, with probation, on count two. The defendant timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'When this Court reviews a motion for a new trial, we accord “great weight to a trial justice’s ruling” when that justice “articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” State v.

Specifically, in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice independently assessed the credibility of each witness. Beginning with Portillo, the trial justice noted that he found him “to be a credible witness. * * * I believe that he truly related how this happened, how this assault occurred, and I found his testimony as to how the assault occurred and the Defendant’s use of a machete to be credible.” In addition, the trial justice found Sanchez and Chevez to be credible witnesses, stating: “Both corroborate Mr. Portillo’s version of events, and I believe their testimony * * * [i]n all essential respects was reasonably consistent.”', '-9-', 'Alternatively, turning to defendant’s credibility as a witness, the trial justice found defendant and his witnesses to lack credibility.

He also concluded that defendant was the aggressor, especially given defendant’s admission that he broke the windows of Portillo’s car; accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'After a careful review of the trial testimony and of the decision denying the motion for a new trial, we are satisfied that the trial justice “articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion[.]” Grantley, 149 A.3d at 131 (quoting State v.

He specifically noted the shortcomings and inconsistencies of certain witnesses, but he ultimately concluded, based on his own credibility determinations, that the weight of the evidence supported guilty verdicts as to both counts.

After a jury convicted the defendant of two counts of felony assault and one count each of possession of a controlled substance, resisting arrest, and reckless driving, the defendant petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the trial justice’s jury instructions constituted reversible error because the instructions amounted to commenting on the evidence and were “confusing, misleading, unnecessary and bolstering.” 1', 'The matter came before this Court for oral argument on February 23, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why this appeal should not summarily be 1', 'The defendant, having failed to file an appeal within the period allowed, petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, and we granted the petition.', '-1- decided.', 'After considering the parties’ oral and written arguments, and after thoroughly reviewing the record, it is our opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On the evening of July 6, 2011, Sgt. Gregory Sion, a supervisor in the Providence Police Department’s narcotics unit, was operating an unmarked car on patrol in the north end of the city. As Sgt. Sion was traveling east on Ledge Street, he “observed two vehicles approaching [him] at a high rate of speed.” One of those vehicles was a silver SUV bearing Massachusetts license plates, and the other vehicle had New York license plates. It appeared to Sgt. Sion that the silver SUV was chasing the vehicle with New York plates and, as the two vehicles approached him, the silver SUV veered across the center of the road and into Sgt. Sion’s lane of travel. Sergeant Sion said that, to avoid a collision, he “had to swerve to the right to get out of [the silver SUV’s] way,” causing the right-front wheel of the police vehicle to go up onto the sidewalk. In response, Sgt. Sion quickly executed a U-turn in an attempt to follow the two vehicles. He said that he initially lost sight of both vehicles but, with the aid of a passerby who was walking his dog, he quickly located the vehicles near 33 Marietta Street. By the time Sgt. Sion came upon the vehicles, both were unoccupied.', 'Using his police radio, Sgt. Sion alerted the six other members of his narcotics squad about the incident that had occurred on Ledge Street, which he described as “a road rage type of incident.” While Sgt. Sion had been driving around the block to see if he could locate the drivers of the two vehicles, Det. John Bento and his partner Det. Leo Pichs, both of the Providence Police Department’s narcotics unit, drove to Marietta Street and parked their unmarked police', '-2- vehicle approximately halfway down the street, facing towards Charles Street. Shortly after arriving at Marietta Street, Det. Bento saw the silver SUV “pull out of the parking lot of 33 Marietta” and come towards him. Detective Bento alerted Sgt. Sion that the silver SUV had pulled out onto Marietta Street.', 'Soon, Sgt. Sion positioned his car behind the silver SUV, and Detectives Bento and Pichs were in front of the car. Sergeant Sion observed a lone male driver in the silver SUV, who appeared to be the same person who was driving the car when it ran Sgt. Sion off the road. He then ordered Detectives Bento and Pichs “to move in.” Detectives Bento and Pichs got out of their vehicle and approached the driver of the silver SUV, which was being driven by defendant, José Angeles.', 'There is conflicting testimony about what happened after the police “boxed in” the silver SUV. According to the testimony of Sgt. Sion and Det. Bento, the emergency lights on Det. Bento’s vehicle were activated, and Detectives Bento and Pichs, who were in plainclothes, verbally identified themselves as police officers, and Det. Pichs’ badge was clearly visible. Several eyewitnesses, however, testified that the police did not turn on their emergency lights nor did they identify themselves as they approached the silver SUV. And two of the eyewitnesses testified that they believed that defendant was getting “jumped” by random people.', 'Detective Bento testified that, as he walked toward the silver SUV, he observed defendant “manipulate something in his hand and put it under his leg.” Then, defendant put the silver SUV into reverse, striking Sgt. Sion’s vehicle, and proceeded to drive back and forth, ramming into both Det. Bento’s vehicle and Sgt. Sion’s vehicle repeatedly until he had enough room to escape. The defendant drove the silver SUV onto the sidewalk towards Det. Bento, at which point Sgt. Sion drew his service pistol and at “point blank range shot the left rear tire of', '-3- the vehicle in hopes that it would somehow disable the vehicle from running down [Det.] Bento.” However, Det. Bento was struck 2 and defendant fled the scene. A high speed chase ensued.', 'The chase soon ended after defendant crashed into a parked car and lost control of the SUV, which went down a driveway, and ultimately through a yard and into a fence. The defendant fled on foot, but the police quickly apprehended him. Officer Andres Perez, who at the time of this incident was a detective in the Providence Police Department’s narcotics unit, participated in the pursuit and capture of defendant. After defendant was taken into custody, Officer Perez returned to the abandoned SUV to see “if there was any evidence left there.” As it turned out, Officer Perez “seized [from the driver’s side floor] a clear plastic bag, and that clear plastic bag contained nine individually wrapped bags of suspected crack cocaine.”', 'The state filed a criminal information, charging defendant with the offenses enumerated earlier in this opinion. Before trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress the seized bag of cocaine, alleging that the police lacked probable cause to stop his vehicle or to arrest him, and that the cocaine had been seized illegally. After a hearing on the issue, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion. 3', 'During defendant’s jury trial, several references were made, especially during defendant’s cross-examination of the police witnesses, about whether the cocaine that Officer Perez seized from the silver SUV had been in plain view, and whether the police had probable cause or a warrant allowing them to search the vehicle.

When she returned from work on the afternoon of March 28, 2011, the front door of her family’s two-story condominium in Johnston, Rhode Island was unlocked, but Bryant assumed that her', '-1- daughter Essence had been careless when leaving their home that morning.1 The house looked as Bryant had left it; save for the unlocked door, nothing seemed out of place. It was not until Bryant’s son Jarell returned home from school and noticed that his Nintendo Wii gaming console was missing that Bryant realized that something was wrong. Upon further inspection, Bryant discovered that the dresser drawers in her second-floor bedroom were open; her jewelry boxes and a teapot in which she stashed coins were empty; a diamond necklace and other jewelry were missing from her bedroom closet; and a computer and digital coin bank were nowhere to be found. Essence, now home from school, noticed that her brother Oginga’s bedroom door was ajar, even though the door usually remained closed when he was away at college. Looking inside Oginga’s bedroom, located at the ground level, Essence found the window open and the bed pushed out from its usual spot against the window. Bryant called 9-1-1 and reported a break-in.', 'Several officers from the Johnston police department responded to the dispatch. Detective Raymond Peters (Det. Peters) of the department’s forensic unit took photographs and dusted the scene for fingerprints. The detective recovered fingerprint evidence from the window in Oginga’s bedroom, Bryant’s jewelry box, the door handle to her bedroom closet, and from other areas throughout the home. For the purpose of determining which fingerprints belonged to persons rightfully on the premises—and to eliminate them from the investigation—Det. Peters also obtained fingerprints from Bryant and her daughter Imani.

After concluding that certain fingerprints extracted from Oginga’s bedroom window came from an unknown source, he searched a database known as the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) to identify a potential match. From the three and a half million fingerprints contained in the database, Downing’s search returned the name “Curtis M. Isom,” born on January 4, 1959, as the closest potential match.2 Downing then manually compared the left index fingerprint exemplar displayed on a fingerprint card attributed to “Curtis M. Isom” side-by-side with the photograph of the fingerprint from the window.', 'By way of expert testimony, Downing opined that the exemplar and the latent fingerprint from the window originated from a common source. He also concluded that another latent fingerprint—a left thumbprint—extracted from Bryant’s jewelry box matched another exemplar on the AFIS- generated fingerprint card ascribed to “Curtis M. Isom.”3 2', 'In addition to listing “Curtis M. Isom” as the number-one possible match, AFIS also returned forty-nine other exemplars from fingerprint cards, taken from other individuals, as possible matches. 3', 'Detective Peters testified at trial that he did not record which of the four fingerprints were recovered from which item. But based on his recollection, Det. Peters testified that the photograph he marked as “35”—which contained an image of a fingerprint that Downing identified as a likely match to defendant’s left thumbprint—came from the jewelry box. He further recalled that the image labeled “52” was a photograph of the fingerprint he found on the window, and Downing testified that that fingerprint was consistent with defendant’s left index fingerprint. As for the remaining two fingerprints prompting further inspection by Downing, Det. Peters testified at trial that they came from the door handle to Bryant’s bedroom closet and the television in the living room. Downing determined that one fingerprint belonged to Imani and the other originated from an unknown source. Neither he nor Det.

App. 1983).', '-4- ridge that’s running for a short time [and] then splits into two separate lines or two separate ridges.”', 'On cross-examination, defense counsel asked the fingerprint expert several questions about the general reliability of fingerprint identification and the procedures he employed in making his identification.', 'Counsel then directed Downing’s attention to an image of the fingerprint found on the jewelry box—specifically, a copy of the photograph on which Downing had based his identification. Downing testified that a mark within that fingerprint “appears to be a bifurcation or an ending ridge. You can’t always tell which is which.” The following exchange ensued:', '“Q', '* * * [I]s it possible that in one [fingerprint] impression, * * * what', 'appears as a bifurcation or ridge ending may actually be something', 'else in an inked print?', '“A', 'Yes, sir.', '“Q', '* * * [A]nd it’s important when you’re looking at a latent or partial', 'print to know whether you are looking at a bifurcation or ridge', 'ending, correct?', '“A', 'It would be of assistance, yes.', '“* * *', '“Q', 'But if you * * * can’t tell whether a characteristic is a ridge ending', 'or a bifurcation in the latent, there is a chance of making a mistake,', 'right?” The court sustained the state’s objection to the question. Defense counsel then asked: “Is it possible you could make a mistake because you can’t tell whether or not something is a ridge ending or a bifurcation?” After the court again sustained the state’s objection, defense counsel pursued a new line of questioning. At another point during cross-examination, the defense sought to ask Downing about the impact of a recent high-profile investigation conducted by the', '-5- Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) on the field of fingerprint analysis. Sustaining the state’s objection, the trial justice disallowed the question.', 'Also on cross-examination, Downing acknowledged that his analysis was limited to comparing the AFIS card attributed to “Curtis M. Isom” with the photograph of the latent fingerprint found in the Bryant home. He had not been provided with fingerprints obtained from defendant after his arrest.', 'The state also presented former Det. Mary Ann Pimental (Det. Pimental) of the Johnston police department, who testified that she had arraigned a man named Curtis Isom in the District Court on July 13, 2011, for the crime on trial and that his birthdate was January 4, 1959.6 Detective Pimental indicated that she had ordered that personnel from the Bureau of Criminal Identification take defendant’s fingerprints after the arraignment, but she had no personal knowledge as to whether this task was completed.', 'At trial, the state did not introduce fingerprints taken from defendant after his arrest in July 2011, nor did any witness with personal knowledge testify that the fingerprints attributed to “Curtis M. Isom” belonged to defendant.7', 'After the state rested, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the trial justice denied. The defendant did not present a case. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the trial justice subsequently denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. The defendant was sentenced to fifteen years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with five years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation.', 'Based on the conviction in this case, the defendant also was adjudged to be a habitual offender in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21. Consequently, the 6', 'When asked if that “Curtis Isom” was in the courtroom, Det. Pimental testified that “[t]here is a gentleman in the courtroom that is familiar to me * * *. Yes. He is sitting there at the defense table with a turtleneck on.” 7', 'Evidence of defendant’s middle initial was not offered at trial, and the jury verdict form identified him as “Curtis Isom.”', '-6- trial justice sentenced defendant to fifteen years, with five nonparolable years to serve and ten years suspended with probation, to be served consecutively to the sentence for the breaking-and- entering conviction. This timely appeal followed.', 'Discussion', 'I. Denial of Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal', ""On appeal, defendant first claims that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. Our review of the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal is governed by the same standard applied by the trial justice. State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 148 (R.I. 2010). Accordingly, this Court “must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state's witnesses, and draw therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” Id. (quoting State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1159 (R.I. 2009)). The defendant may prevail on a motion for a judgment of acquittal “only if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, is insufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Armour, 110 A.3d 1195, 1203 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Long, 61 A.3d 439, 445 (R.I. 2013)). The case against the defendant will survive, however, upon the determination that “a reasonable juror could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.”"", 'Id. (quoting Long, 61 A.3d at 445).', 'As we previously have held, “circumstantial evidence, including fingerprint evidence, may be sufficient to support a conviction * * * ‘as long as the totality of the circumstantial evidence presented to the finder of fact constitutes proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.’” State v. Rodriguez, 798 A.2d 435, 437 (R.I. 2002) (quoting State v. Otero, 788 A.2d 469, 473 (R.I. 2002)).', 'The gravamen of defendant’s appeal from the denial of his motion for a judgment of acquittal is his contention that the state failed to establish “that the AFIS-generated exemplars to', '-7- which the [latent fingerprints] were matched[] actually belonged to * * * Isom” and that the absence of such evidence amounts to a “gap in proof.” In support of this claim, defendant points to cross-examination testimony from Downing, the fingerprint expert, that he lacked personal knowledge of whether the fingerprints on the fingerprint card returned from AFIS were in fact defendant’s fingerprints. The defendant further cites the acknowledgment by Downing that neither he nor the police had obtained fingerprints from defendant during the course of the investigation.', 'These arguments do not help defendant, however, because they relate to the weight of the evidence and not its legal sufficiency.', 'In Sansom v. State, 562 N.E.2d 58 (Ind. Ct. App. 1990), a similar issue arose when the defendant in that case argued that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction of burglary because the police had matched latent fingerprints recovered from the crime scene only to a fingerprint card on file that was attributed to a man with the same name and birthdate as the defendant. Id. at 59, 60. The prosecution did not present direct evidence that the fingerprints on the card had belonged to the defendant. Id. at 59. Other information contained on the card, including hair and eye color, height, place of birth, and distinctive marks, also closely matched the defendant. Id. The court concluded that, based on the similarities, the jury could reasonably infer that the exemplars on the fingerprint card belonged to the defendant. Id. at 60.', 'In this case, there was evidence that latent fingerprints found both on the window—the suspected point of entry—and the jewelry box from which items were missing matched an exemplar attributed to one “Curtis M. Isom” with a birthdate of January 4, 1959. The defendant in this case was named Curtis Isom, and the state introduced evidence that he had the same date of birth. Further, unlike in Sansom, there was testimony that defendant was known to Bryant and her family and that he previously had been in the home, but not in the area where the latent', '-8- fingerprints were found.', 'From the facts that defendant, Curtis Isom, was known to the complainant in this case, had been in the home on a previous occasion, and had the same date of birth as the “Curtis M. Isom” whose fingerprints matched those recovered at the scene, a reasonable jury could conclude that defendant was the perpetrator of the crime on trial.', 'Although the investigation by the Johnston police department could have been more comprehensive—including the establishment of a link between defendant’s fingerprints and the latent fingerprints—we cannot conclude that the evidence was legally insufficient to give rise to a judgment of acquittal. Viewing the evidence—the identical date of birth and defendant’s connection to the home—in the light most favorable to the state, we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to connect the exemplars from the fingerprint card to defendant.', 'II. Cross-Examination of Fingerprint Expert', 'The defendant also argues on appeal that the court deprived him of his right to a full and fair cross-examination of Downing. The right of a criminal defendant to be confronted by witnesses against him is ingrained both within the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution8 and the Declaration of Rights, article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', '“Embodied in this guarantee is a defendant’s right to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses * * *.” State v. Parillo, 480 A.2d 1349, 1356 (R.I. 1984) (quoting State v. Freeman, 473 A.2d 1149, 1153 (R.I. 1984)). However, “the right to cross-examination is not unlimited and does not include an absolute right to ask any and every question that the defendant may desire.” State v. Werner, 831 A.2d 183, 209 (R.I. 2003). “Once there has been ‘sufficient cross-examination to satisfy a defendant’s constitutional confrontation rights,’” State v. Manning, 973 A.2d 524, 531 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 473 (R.I. 8', 'See Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403 (1965) (incorporating the Sixth Amendment to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment).', '-9- 1998)), the trial justice may, in the exercise of sound discretion, “limit cross-examination on the basis of concerns of witness harassment, jury prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness’s safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.” State v. Wiley, 676 A.2d 321, 324 (R.I. 1996); see also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986). This Court will not “disturb such a limitation absent a clear abuse of discretion ‘and then only when such abuse constitutes prejudicial error.’” Brown, 709 A.2d at 473 (quoting State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921, 924 (R.I. 1980)).', 'The defendant attacks the restriction of his cross-examination of Downing on two fronts. First, he argues that the trial justice erroneously prevented him from asking the fingerprint expert about possible inaccuracies that could arise from misidentifying ridge endings and bifurcations. Specifically, the court did not permit him to ask about the “chance of making a mistake” or whether it is possible “you could make a mistake.” The trial justice sustained the state’s question because it called for speculation, and it was within his sound discretion to do so. See, e.g., State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 906 (R.I. 2010) (finding no abuse of discretion when trial court limited question that called for speculation).', 'The defendant wages a second line of attack on the refusal of the trial justice to allow a question about the impact of a recent high-profile FBI investigation on procedures employed in the fingerprint-analysis field. Defense counsel had asked Downing, “Are you familiar with what is known as the Mayfield case?,” and the fingerprint expert answered affirmatively. The trial justice sustained the state’s objection to the next question: “And evaluating and guarding against', '- 10 - the errors that the FBI made in the Mayfield case * * * [h]as been a driving force in the fingerprint community for years, right?”9', 'According to defendant, because of Mayfield, there have been major reforms in the field of fingerprint analysis, to the extent that he should have been entitled to inquire whether Downing followed post-Mayfield procedures.', 'However, the impact of a particular FBI investigation on the entire field of fingerprint analysis was irrelevant to the prosecution in this case. Neither the errors made by the FBI nor the historical evolution of the fingerprint-analysis field had bearing on the methodology followed in this particular case or on Downing’s conclusion that the latent and known fingerprints originated from the same source. See, e.g., Werner, 831 A.2d at 209, 210 (affirming trial justice’s decision to preclude, on the grounds of relevance, the defendant’s questions on cross-examination regarding procedures employed by the police department when booking another individual).', 'We further reject defendant’s assertion that the preclusion of this line of questioning interfered with his attempts to impeach the state’s star witness. To the contrary, defendant was afforded substantial leeway to question Downing about the overall reliability of fingerprint evidence and the procedures he followed. The defendant elicited testimony from Downing on cross-examination that fingerprint analysis is not foolproof and that “[e]rrors have occurred in 9', 'The “Mayfield case” arose in 2004 when Spanish investigators recovered latent fingerprints from a bag containing explosive detonators, which was found near the site of a bombing in Madrid, Spain. Mayfield v. United States, 599 F.3d 964, 966 (9th Cir. 2010). A search of the FBI’s fingerprint database returned the fingerprints of Brandon Mayfield, an American Muslim attorney, and nineteen other individuals as possible matches. Id. Multiple fingerprint specialists concluded that a latent fingerprint matched an exemplar originating from Mayfield, which led FBI agents to assert in an affidavit that they had made a “100% positive identification.” Id. at 966, 967. However, the Spanish investigation revealed that the FBI had been incorrect; the fingerprints instead came from an Algerian national. Id. at 967.', '- 11 - the past.” Accordingly, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in restricting defendant’s line of questioning.', 'III. Denial of Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant’s final assignment of error is the denial of his motion for a new trial.10 In support of his argument on appeal, defendant points to the lack of direct evidence tying the exemplars found on the fingerprint card to him, purportedly inconsistent testimony between Bryant and Oginga, and the likelihood that a man of his age could climb through the basement window in the manner the perpetrator purportedly had. The defendant also attacks the quality of the latent fingerprints, the failure of the police to document the items from which they were obtained, and the overall reliability of fingerprint evidence.', 'When passing on a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, the trial justice “sits as the legendary thirteenth juror[,] and, in light of the charge to the jury, must exercise his or her independent judgment in weighing the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses.” State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009). The motion must be denied “[i]f the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or finds that the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome * * *.” Id. This Court will give “great weight” 10', 'We note that defense counsel twice unequivocally stated at the hearing on the motion for a new trial that he based the motion on a sufficiency-of-the-evidence argument. On appeal, defendant contends that his attorney was mistaken and should have stated that he was moving for a new trial based both on the weight of the evidence and its sufficiency. The defendant asserts that, notwithstanding his attorney’s error, he argued both legal sufficiency and weight in the court below, and that the trial justice addressed both in his decision. Because the trial justice indeed did discuss the weight of the evidence among his findings in denying the motion for a new trial and because the state had adequate opportunity to respond to the weight-of-the- evidence argument at the time it was presented below, we are satisfied that this issue was preserved for our review. Cf. State v. Burke, 522 A.2d 725, 731 (R.I. 1987) (noting that the reason for deeming issues unpreserved is to “serve judicial economy by encouraging resolution of issues at the trial level * * * [and to] promote[] fairer and more efficient trial proceedings by providing opposing counsel with an opportunity to respond appropriately to claims raised”).', '- 12 - to the ruling as long as the trial justice sufficiently explained his or her rationale for denying the motion. Id.', 'In ruling on the motion, the trial justice set forth his reasons for denying the new trial. He credited the testimony of Bryant, Oginga, Downing, and Det. Peters, and, unlike the defendant, found Bryant’s and Oginga’s testimony to be mutually corroborative.', 'After painstakingly recounting the evidence adduced at trial, the trial justice stated that the open window and position of the bed in Oginga’s bedroom led to the “inescapable conclusion” that the perpetrator had gained entry through that ground-floor window. The trial justice indicated that he was “satisfied” that the latent fingerprints on the jewelry box belonged to the defendant, and he concluded that the existence of such fingerprints “establish beyond a reasonable doubt that it was the defendant who was the individual who broke into her apartment on March 28, 2011.” We are of the opinion that the trial justice performed the requisite analysis and provided an adequate rationale for denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'We discern no grounds for disturbing that decision.', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of conviction of the Superior Court and return the papers to the Superior Court.', '- 13 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S', 'OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

76,State : v. : Alfred Bishop.,reversal,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Before this Court is an appeal from a judgment of conviction adjudicating the defendant Alfred Bishop guilty of (1) first-degree murder, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1; (2) burglary, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-8-1; (3) three counts of using a firearm while committing a crime of violence, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2; and (4) two counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2. In May 2009, he was sentenced to life without parole on the murder conviction, and he was sentenced to significant further incarceration on the other counts. Bishop filed a motion for new trial, but the motion was denied by the trial justice. Bishop now appeals from the judgment of conviction, arguing that the trial justice erred in refusing to admit evidence about the alleged intoxication and drug possession of certain witnesses for the state and in allowing what he contends was extremely prejudicial information about Bishop’s parole status into evidence. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'Background', '1', 'Underlying Home Invasion', 'The dramatic and ultimately fatal series of events giving rise to the charges against Bishop began to unfold on June 27, 2007. Ceasar and Claire Medeiros, husband and wife, lived in Warwick with Ceasar’s brother, Gabriel, and a pet dog. 1 On the night of June 27, 2007, at around midnight, Ceasar and Claire were awakened by the sound of their dog barking. Ceasar said he got out of bed to investigate, while Claire remained in bed. He went out to the darkened hallway and saw a masked figure holding a shiny object in his hand. Ceasar pleaded with the intruder to not hurt his family and told the intruder that there was money and jewelry in the bedroom. Ceasar returned to the bedroom, and, when he noticed that the intruder had not followed him, he grabbed a golf club and went back to the hallway, where he proceeded to clobber the intruder with a blow to the head—a blow so strong that the head of the golf club separated from the shaft. Ceasar continued to strike the intruder with the shaft of the golf club, and he also began to kick him. During the ensuring fierce struggle, a firearm discharged.', 'Claire testified that she came out of the bedroom and turned on the hallway light for a few seconds so that she could see what was going on. By this time, and as a result of the confrontation with Ceasar, the intruder’s ski mask had become partially dislodged. Both Claire and Ceasar later testified that they were able to view the intruder’s face. Claire turned off the 1', 'Throughout this decision, we refer to some individuals by their first name. This is for the purpose of clarity only, and we intend no disrespect.', '-2- hallway light, ran to a spare bedroom to get a phone, went back to her bedroom, and called the 9- 1-1 emergency system for help.', 'According to Ceasar, the intruder then retreated into the kitchen, which, by this time, had been illuminated by Gabriel, who had arrived from his basement bedroom to investigate the disturbance. Ceasar followed the intruder and observed Gabriel and the intruder engage in a deadly struggle. There was a shot, after which Gabriel and the intruder both fell to the kitchen floor, and then there was another shot. Ceasar began to use the end of the golf club shaft to stab the intruder but fell down during the scuffle. The intruder was able to break away, escaping through a sliding glass door in the dining area and disappearing into the night. Before the intruder fled, Ceasar was able to look at the intruder’s face once again, because, by this time, the ski mask had been completely removed. Ceasar next remembered his wife coming into the kitchen and emergency personnel arriving on the scene.', 'Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel were rushed to the emergency room at Rhode Island Hospital. Claire had incurred a minor gunshot wound in her upper leg, and Ceasar had suffered one gunshot wound to his arm and another to his leg. Gabriel, however, was pronounced dead as a result of a gunshot wound to the torso shortly after he was brought to Rhode Island Hospital.', 'When Claire and Ceasar arrived at the emergency room, they were met by police officers who attempted to obtain descriptions of the intruder from them. Claire described the intruder as a white male with slicked-back, gray hair, who looked over the age of forty. She also described him as four inches taller than her husband, who was about five-feet and seven-inches tall. She believed that the man was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt.', 'Ceasar’s description was similar—he said that the intruder was a man with “wrinkles,” “beady eyes,” a receding hairline, and “slicked back hair” that was either red in color or possibly gray in color with blood matted', '-3- into it. A laboratory report from the hospital, which was later admitted into evidence, indicated that Ceasar’s blood alcohol content was 0.134 shortly after he was first seen at the emergency room.', 'Shortly thereafter, a retired Warwick Police Captain Linda I. Eastman, who was a sketch artist, created a composite sketch based on Claire’s description of the intruder. The sketch was then shown to Ceasar, who suggested that the intruder had more of a receding hairline than was depicted in the first sketch; Claire agreed. The composite sketch was then distributed within the Rhode Island law-enforcement community, resulting in a tentative identification of Bishop as the intruder.', 'Warwick Police Det. Sgt. Robert Bentsen, who was the lead investigator in the case, was advised that the sketch resembled Bishop. On July 1, 2007, Det. Sgt. Bentsen attempted to visit Bishop at his last known address, and when nobody answered the door, Det. Sgt. Bentsen visited another location where he believed Bishop might be visiting—the home of Bishop’s sister and her husband—to no avail. However, Bishop’s brother-in-law called another location where he believed Bishop was living and left a message for Bishop to call Det. Sgt. Bentsen. Later that afternoon, Bishop returned Det. Sgt. Bentsen’s telephone call. In that conversation, Bishop indicated that he wanted to talk about the June 27, 2007 incident, but said that he could not because he had sustained some minor injuries over his left eye—explaining that he had hurt himself at his place of employment. The telephone call ended before any arrangement could be made for the detective to interview Bishop. On July 2, 2007, Det. Sgt. Bentsen then contacted Bishop’s parole officer, Matthew Degnan, who informed him that Bishop had failed to report to him that day, as required by the conditions of his parole. Degnan indicated that he obtained a parole-detention warrant for Bishop because he had failed to attend the scheduled meeting—a', '-4- violation of his parole—and also because he had tested positive for alcohol at an earlier meeting—yet another parole violation.', 'In addition, Warwick Police Det. Barbara Frazier, who worked in the Bureau of Criminal Identification, obtained a warrant authorizing the search of the home of Reine Bishop, Bishop’s ex-wife. Parole logs, in which Bishop was required to memorialize everywhere he went and the persons with whom he was with, were seized from a dresser located in Reine’s bedroom. One of those logs, dated June 27, 2007, reflected the notation: “stayed overnight at Reine’s mothers.” However, another parole log for the same day indicated that Bishop had left Reine’s home shortly before midnight. No satisfactory explanation for that discrepancy ever was offered.', 'Eventually, by tracing a telephone call, Det. Sgt. Bentsen was able to locate Bishop. On July 3, 2007, Bishop was taken into custody without incident. At police headquarters, Bishop’s photograph was taken, and hair samples and DNA samples were obtained.', 'That same afternoon, Ceasar and Claire were asked to report to police headquarters for additional questioning; they were not told specifically what the questions would involve. In fact, Det. Frazier had compiled a photo array. The photo array was shown to Claire and Ceasar, independently of each other, and both identified Bishop as the intruder. 2', '2', 'Forensic Evidence Development', 'After the crime scene was secured, detectives began to develop forensic evidence. Physical evidence—including the ski mask, several bullet casings, a seat cover of a chair from the deck, and the shaft and head of the golf club—was retrieved from the scene, and numerous photographs were taken. Blood samples were also collected from some of the physical evidence, 2', 'Before trial, the trial justice determined that the method employed by the police for this identification procedure was proper. Bishop does not challenge that ruling on appeal.', '-5- as well as from a number of areas within and around the home, including the hallway, kitchen, dining area, and the sliding glass door. The samples were submitted to the Rhode Island Department of Health for DNA analysis, where it was determined that certain samples that were tested—the ski mask, the kitchen and dining room, the seat cover, a portion of one of the venetian blinds, and the golf club head—matched Bishop’s DNA.', 'Further, a forensic examination was conducted on hair that was found inside the ski mask. This also matched a hair sample retrieved from Bishop when he was taken into custody.', 'In addition, although there was no evidence of a forced entry at the Medeiroses’ home, the photographs from the kitchen portrayed a violent struggle, as emphasized by large quantities of blood on the floor, the walls, and the venetian blinds. There was also a trail of blood leading from the sliding glass door that was near the dining area, which allowed the detectives to track the route of the intruder’s escape. Indeed, the blood trail indicated that the intruder exited the house onto the deck, cut through the backyard, passed some foliage and a fence on the side of the house, and then traveled across the street into a parking lot of a school administration building. That parking lot was near Reine’s home.', 'B', 'Pretrial Motions', 'On February 6, 2008, an indictment was returned against Bishop.', 'Before the trial commenced, the state had filed various motions in limine, three of which underlie the issues now before us on appeal. One of the motions filed by the state was “to prohibit evidence of the presence of alcohol or controlled substances in the blood of [Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel],” and', '-6- another was “to prohibit evidence of the fact that marijuana and Inositol[3] were found in the bedroom of Gabriel.” The trial justice did not formally rule on these motions after they were argued. However, evidence of Ceasar’s alcohol consumption was later admitted at trial, but evidence of Ceasar, Claire, or Gabriel’s alleged use or possession of controlled substances was excluded. Indeed, during the trial, when defense counsel attempted to cross-examine Ceasar and Claire about their alleged drug use on the evening in question, the trial justice sustained the state’s objection, ruling that defense counsel had failed to proffer any evidence that the use of drugs had affected the memory or conduct of the witnesses. Similarly, when defense counsel sought to cross-examine Warwick Police Det. Daniel Gillis of the Bureau of Criminal Identification about the marijuana and cutting agent found in Gabriel’s bedroom, the trial justice sustained the state’s objection to the admission of such evidence because defense counsel had not established its probative value.', 'The other relevant motion was the state’s motion to allow the introduction of the following evidence:', '“1. That [d]efendant was incarcerated at the [Adult Correctional', 'Institutions (ACI)] before August, 2006;', '“2. That [d]efendant had been on parole since August, 2006 and', 'remained on parole until July 3, 2007;', '“3. That [d]efendant had a parole officer from August, 2006', 'through July 3, 2007 * * * whom he reported to;', '“4. That [d]efendant failed to appear for a required meeting with', 'his parole officer on July 2, 2007;', '“5. That [d]efendant, as a condition of parole, maintained a log of', 'his daily travels;', '“6. That a [w]arrant for a [v]iolation of his parole was issued on', 'July 2, 2007 and executed on July 3, 2007.” 3', 'Inositol is a common “cutting agent,” which is a substance used to increase the volume of a quantity of a controlled substance.', '-7- Conversely, defense counsel filed a motion in limine to prohibit direct or indirect references by the state and its witnesses to various evidence, including, as relevant to this appeal, “[a]ny testimony of the prior record of the defendant,” “[a]ny testimony or reference to defendant’s parole status,” and “[a]ny testimony or reference to defendant’s parole ‘log,’ or introduction of said log.” When he ruled on these motions, the trial justice excluded any reference to Bishop’s incarceration, but he did allow limited evidence concerning Bishop’s parole status at the time of the incident in question. The trial justice based his decision on a finding that “under the circumstances * * * the parole status of [Bishop] d[id] not substantially outweigh its probative value due to the fact that it is something that’s intertwined through the testimony of a number of witnesses and * * * [Bishop]’s statement [to the police] on July 3.”', 'After the hearing on the motions in limine, a trial before a jury commenced, beginning on February 23, 2009 and ending on March 4, 2009. During the trial, testimony was presented from twenty-one witnesses for the state, including Ceasar and Claire, who testified about the home invasion that occurred on June 27, 2007, and many of the police detectives involved in the investigation and development of the evidence against Bishop. In addition, Kenneth Turchetta, an acquaintance of Bishop’s, testified that he received telephone calls from Reine early on the morning of June 28, 2007. He said that he recognized Bishop’s voice in the background, and he remembered Reine saying that they needed a doctor.', 'Similarly, Daniel Antonelli, who had employed Bishop as a woodworker for about six months starting in August 2006, recalled that Bishop stopped by on June 28, 2007 and asked Antonelli to provide him with a false alibi—that Bishop had been injured while working at Antonelli’s shop and that the injury was caused by some pipe staging. Antonelli initially agreed to go along with the alibi suggestion, but within a day or two, he changed his mind and informed Bishop that he would not lie on Bishop’s behalf.', '-8-', 'Finally, Bishop took the stand and offered a version of the facts that was strikingly different from the description that had been provided by Ceasar and Claire. Bishop did not deny that he was inside the home of Ceasar and Claire on the night in question. However, he explained that he had been at Reine’s house, and, at some point during the night, he saw a shadow pass by the bedroom window. He said he went outside to investigate, but he did not discover any intruder. He claimed that he sat on the front stairs, at which point he heard someone call out his name. He realized that the person who was calling his name was in front of Ceasar and Claire’s driveway. Bishop walked towards the person, who said, “my brother wants to talk to you,” and led Bishop inside the home. Bishop testified that he entered the house, and the door was immediately shut behind him. According to his testimony, he immediately found himself surrounded by three men. One of the men put a gun to Bishop’s ear, while another placed a ski mask over his head and remarked, “he’s looking like a burglar now.” The third man retrieved a golf club and began to strike Bishop with it. Bishop said a gun went off before the first blow from the golf club, but that he was not wounded. The men moved Bishop to the kitchen, where more shots were fired, and Bishop found himself on the floor, struggling with the man who possessed the gun.', 'Bishop explained that he attempted to escape through a sliding glass door, but on an adjacent deck, he saw the man with the gun. The man attempted to shoot him, but the gun merely clicked and the man ran off across the yard. Bishop tried to follow him, but he heard police sirens and retreated, first across the street next to Reine’s house and then to a friend’s house. He claimed that he bandaged his head and called Reine to pick him up.', '-9-', 'The jury found Bishop guilty as to all counts submitted to it.4 Bishop filed a motion for a new trial, which was denied on April 28, 2009.', 'He was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, two additional life sentences—one to run consecutive to the first and the other to run concurrent—and four consecutive twenty-year sentences. Bishop filed a timely notice of appeal on May 22, 2009, challenging the trial justice’s decision to exclude any evidence of drug use by Ceasar or Claire, to exclude any evidence of drug possession by Gabriel, and to admit evidence of Bishop’s parole status.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We have long held, and in this jurisdiction it is beyond peradventure, that “decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are ‘within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” State v.

Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198, 1216 (R.I. 1995)).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Consumption of Intoxicants', 'Bishop argues that the trial justice abused his discretion when he disallowed evidence that Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel had either taken or possessed drugs on the evening of the incident and, thus, violated his constitutional right to cross-examination. Bishop maintains that there was evidence of “heavy alcohol and drug use by those living in the home” and that that supports a finding of intoxication.', 'It is well recognized that proof that a witness consumed intoxicating substances at or around the time of the event that he or she is testifying about is relevant to impeach a witness’s ability to perceive an event, to remember the facts, and to accurately relate those facts at trial. See Avarista v. Aloisio, 672 A.2d 887, 891 (R.I. 1996) (explaining that evidence of intoxication is permissible “to test the witnesses’ accuracy, memory, veracity, or credibility” citing State v. Crowhurst, 470 A.2d 1138, 1143 (R.I. 1984)); O’Brien v. Waterman, 91 R.I. 374, 381, 163 A.2d 31, 35 (1960). This alone, however, is not enough. Contrary to Bishop’s argument—that evidence of the influence of drugs is never excludable on relevance grounds because credibility is always relevant—the admissibility of evidence regarding consumption of intoxicating substances is not completely unfettered: “neither party may question a witness merely to show', '- 11 - that he or she may have consumed some potentially intoxicating substance before an event at issue in the case has occurred” in an attempt to affect credibility. State v. Rice, 755 A.2d 137, 148-49 (R.I. 2000) (citing State v. Amaral, 109 R.I. 379, 386, 285 A.2d 783, 787 (1972)).', 'Bishop improperly conflates the holding that evidence of intoxication is “never excludable on relevance grounds” with the proposition that such evidence is always admissible. State v. Squillante, 622 A.2d 474, 481 (R.I. 1993). This is an incorrect reading of the rules of evidence and does not comport with our longstanding interpretation thereof. Indeed, under Rule 403, relevant evidence can be excluded if its “probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” It is because of the undue potential to cause confusion and unfair prejudice in admitting evidence of intoxication that we established a “gatekeeping procedure” in Handy v. Geary, 105 R.I. 419, 431, 252 A.2d 435, 441 (1969), to determine whether evidence of this kind is admissible for the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness. Clark, 974 A.2d at 582-83 (citing Handy, 105 R.I. at 431, 252 A.2d at 441-42); Avarista, 672 A.2d at 891.', 'Indeed, “[o]nly when [evidence of the consumption of intoxicants] is offered for the purpose of proving ‘intoxication,’ as that term is defined in Handy,[5] is such evidence admissible.” Rice, 755 A.2d at 149.', 'Specifically, under the Handy procedure, before evidence of the consumption of intoxicants may be introduced into evidence, “the trial justice shall conduct a preliminary 5', 'In Handy v. Geary, 105 R.I. 419, 431, 252 A.2d 435, 441 (1969), this Court defined “intoxication” as', '“a situation where, by reason of drinking intoxicants an individual', 'does not have the normal use of his physical or mental faculties,', 'thus rendering him incapable of acting in a manner in which an', 'ordinarily prudent and cautious man, in full possession of his', 'faculties, using reasonable care, would act under like conditions.”', '- 12 - evidentiary hearing on th[e] issue in the absence of the jury” to resolve whether evidence of consumption rises to such a level that it should be admitted at trial. Handy, 105 R.I. at 431, 252 A.2d at 441-42; see Clark, 974 A.2d at 583. Only if the trial justice finds “that the evidence is such that different minds can naturally and fairly come to different conclusions on the question of intoxication, * * * then and only then, may evidence of [consumption of intoxicants] be admitted under proper instruction” given to the jury. Handy, 105 R.I. at 431, 252 A.2d at 442. Accordingly, as a predicate to the admission of evidence of intoxication, the trial justice must be satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to allow a reasonable juror to conclude that the witness was, in fact, intoxicated.', 'In Amaral, 109 R.I. at 387, 285 A.2d at 787-88, we extended the application of the Handy procedure to criminal cases. See also State v. McRae, 31 A.3d 785, 790 (R.I. 2011); State v. Mattatall, 114 R.I. 568, 572, 337 A.2d 229, 232 (1975). We have also applied this test equally to admitting evidence of drug use and other intoxicants. See State v. Ahmadjian, 438 A.2d 1070, 1088 (R.I. 1981) (applying Handy to marijuana); Mattatall, 114 R.I. at 572, 337 A.2d at 232 (applying Handy to narcotics, as well as alcohol). 6', 'With regard to Ceasar, Bishop argues that there was ample evidence of Ceasar’s drug use, which, he argues, was critical to the jury’s assessment of whether Ceasar had accurately perceived and could accurately recount the events of June 27, 2007. Specifically, Bishop points to the laboratory report that indicated traces of cocaine and marijuana in Ceasar’s bloodstream 6', 'We recognize that some cases from this Court have not raised or mentioned the Handy procedure as the prerequisite in evaluating the admissibility of intoxicating substances for the purpose of impeachment, see, e.g., State v. Lemos, 743 A.2d 558, 563 (R.I. 2000); State v. Squillante, 622 A.2d 474, 481 (R.I. 1993); State v. Kelly, 554 A.2d 632, 637 (R.I. 1989); State v. Carrera, 528 A.2d 331, 333 (R.I. 1987); however, we clarified in State v. Rice, 755 A.2d 137, 149 (R.I. 2000), and reaffirmed in State v.

However, based on our review of the record, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in limiting the cross-examination about Ceasar’s alleged drug use.', 'Indeed, before limiting the evidence of Ceasar’s drug use, the trial justice carefully reviewed the challenged evidence. See Clark, 974 A.2d at 564 (emphasizing that a trial justice should “cautiously exercise his or her discretion, ever mindful of the potential for prejudicial error,” when the state seeks to limit or exclude evidence in a criminal case). When he considered the evidence of Ceasar’s drug use, the trial justice determined that defense counsel had not come forward with any evidence about whether the trace amount of cocaine or any other illicit substance that was found in Ceasar’s blood would have affected his memory, conduct, or ability to perceive the events that were occurring on the night in question. Id. 582-83 (Handy standard not met when an individual had been drinking but no proof was presented as to a lack of physical and mental faculties).', 'Although defense counsel emphasizes the laboratory report, which indicated trace amounts of cocaine, opiates, and cannabinoids in Ceasar’s system, 7 the trial justice concluded that there was nothing of evidentiary value that would quantify the amount of 7', 'The report indicated “POS NC*,” or “positive not confirmed,” as to the presence of opiates, cocaine, and cannabinoids. The asterisk is keyed on the report to mean “Critical/Abnormal” and “Abnormal.” Further, a footnote was provided next to opiates, supplementing that', '“[a]ll drug of abuse * * * immunoassays are performed on urine', 'samples unless otherwise noted. Results are from screening', 'methods. * * * Positive results of screening tests are not', 'confirmed and are reported as ‘POS NC’ (positive not confirmed).', 'Confirmed drugs of abuse are reported as positive. If confirmatory', 'testing is desired, it MUST BE REQUESTED as a separate order', 'to the Toxicology Lab WITHIN 5 DAYS OF SAMPLE', 'COLLECTION. Unconfirmed screening result should only be', 'used for medical purposes.”', '- 14 - cocaine that may have been in Ceasar’s system at the time of the incident, nothing to show how long the drug may have been in his system, and nothing of evidentiary value to demonstrate that any cocaine in Ceasar’s system was sufficient to affect his ability to perceive the events. Indeed, the trial justice noted that defense counsel', '“advised the [c]ourt * * * that he d[id] not have an expert to testify', 'whether or not the amount of cocaine [wa]s significant, whether it', 'would affect Ceasar Medeiros’s memory or his conduct on the', 'evening in question, nor [wa]s there a proffer as to what the expert', 'would testify to concerning the issue of how long cocaine and its', 'various forms might stay in the human body * * *.” Based on this lack of proof, the trial justice held that the evidence contained in the laboratory report did not rise to the level where different minds could come to different conclusions as to whether Ceasar was intoxicated, and, therefore, he excluded the evidence of Ceasar’s drug use. See Handy, 105 R.I. at 431, 252 A.2d at 441-42. “This Court will not disturb a trial justice’s decision to limit the scope of cross-examination absent an abuse of discretion,” and we perceive the existence of no such abuse here. Clark, 974 A.2d at 583. Accordingly, we hold that there was no error in the trial justice’s decision to exclude evidence of Ceasar’s use of drugs.', 'Even less evidence was presented by Bishop with regard to Claire and Gabriel’s alleged intoxication. The evidence Bishop’s trial counsel was prepared to offer about Claire was a statement made by Ceasar to Det. DiGregorio that “everyone drank and smoked marijuana” on the night of the incident. Defense counsel argued to the trial justice that smoking marijuana was relevant to “set[] the tone of what was going on in the house before the defendant supposedly entered, and * * * [to explain] what state of mind [Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel] were in before the defendant came in.” However, the trial justice quite correctly found that this offer of proof was insufficient under Handy, Amaral, and Rice, because defense counsel had not come forward with', '- 15 - any evidence “that either the ingestion of illicit drugs, marijuana, or alcohol arose to the level of intoxication.”', 'In a similar vein, defense counsel argued that the existence of marijuana and a cutting agent found in Gabriel’s bedroom should be presented as “part of the climate of what was going on in th[e] house.” The trial justice sustained the state’s objection to this line of inquiry because defense counsel failed to establish the probative value of this evidence. We agree with the trial justice and, accordingly, hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in limiting the cross-examination of Ceasar, Claire, and Gabriel’s alleged drug use and possession.', 'We pause to note that, in our opinion, the trial justice was more than fair when he allowed testimony about Ceasar’s alcohol intake. The jury was well aware of Ceasar’s potential credibility issues with regard to his capacity to recount the events at issue, which had been significantly called into question by his own testimony that he had consumed “a couple of cocktails” when he went out to lunch with his sister-in-law on June 27, 2007. Further, when pressed on cross-examination, he stated that he actually imbibed somewhere around four cocktails at lunch and drank still more when friends stopped by the house earlier that evening. In addition, before it retired to deliberate, the jury was provided with a copy of the hospital laboratory report. Although the references to any illegal substances had been redacted, the report nonetheless indicated that Ceasar’s blood alcohol content was 0.134. Accordingly, because the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he found that the evidence of drug use and possession was inadmissible under Handy and its progeny, and given the fact that defense counsel was provided with a reasonable opportunity to impeach Ceasar about his alcohol usage,', '- 16 - we hold that the trial justice did not violate Bishop’s confrontation rights by limiting defense counsel’s cross-examination with respect to the use of or possession of any drugs. 8', 'Bishop claims, however, that the trial justice erred by requiring expert testimony to prove that consumption reached a level of intoxication. This, he argues, was an error of law because there is no obligation, as a condition precedent to admitting intoxication evidence, for the production of an expert to prove the effect of the substance.', 'We disagree with Bishop’s characterization that the trial justice obligated them to produce expert testimony. 9', 'A close look at the record reveals that the trial justice did not limit the cross-examination because he believed that, as a matter of law, Bishop needed an expert to testify to the intoxicating effects of ingesting cocaine and other illicit substances. Even though he noted that there was an absence of expert testimony, the trial justice was simply considering the evidence before him in deciding whether Bishop had produced the quantum of evidence sufficient to allow evidence of intoxication to come before the jury—a fact-intensive analysis. Indeed, the veteran trial justice concluded that the inference suggested by Bishop—that, based on the presence of cocaine in Ceasar’s bloodstream, the jury could infer that Ceasar was intoxicated—was far too conjectural and speculative to meet the Handy standard.', 'See Ahmadjian, 438 A.2d at 1088 (cross-examination properly limited when the defendant failed to offer an evidentiary basis for 8', 'Similarly, Bishop argues that evidence of Ceasar’s drug use would have been relevant to support the defense’s theory that Bishop had been coaxed into the house by several men, including Ceasar, because evidence of drug use would have made it more likely that Ceasar was disinhibited and in a state to engage in aggressive behavior. However, in accordance with our discussion above, the trial justice properly excluded evidence of Ceasar’s use of drugs because defense counsel failed to offer evidence of intoxication. 9', 'We note that both parties have cited a number of cases from other jurisdictions to advocate for their respective positions as to whether expert testimony should be required before allowing evidence of the consumption of intoxicating substances. However, we decline to adopt a per se rule in this area, as this is a decision left to the sound discretion of the trial justices. State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 147 (R.I. 2009).', '- 17 - his allegation that a witness was intoxicated). The trial justice explained that he had “reviewed the drug treatment of at least hundreds, if not thousands of defendants over the years” and was “aware that some illicit drugs * * * may remain in the human body and its bloodstream for days, even weeks after consumption.” Without an evidentiary link between the presence of illicit substances in Ceasar’s blood and the effect of such substances on his cognitive abilities, the laboratory report had little value and fell far short of meeting the standard of intoxication set forth in Handy. See Mattatall, 114 R.I. at 573, 337 A.2d at 233 (attempting to infer that an individual was intoxicated based on the presence of alcohol and narcotics in his system was “far too tenuous” to meet the Handy standard and, therefore, was properly excluded).', 'Finally, Bishop contends that the trial justice erred as a matter of law because he did not follow the procedure outlined in Handy. We find this argument to be somewhat disingenuous; Bishop—the party who was attempting to introduce evidence of intoxication—never requested a Handy hearing in the first place. Nevertheless, we note that, even if the trial justice did not precisely follow the voir dire procedures outlined in Handy, the conferences that the trial justice did conduct on the record indicate that he “act[ed] within the spirit” of Handy and its progeny. State v. Carvalho, 892 A.2d 140, 147-48 (R.I. 2006) (A hearing on defendant’s motion in limine regarding possible intoxication “indicate[d] that the trial justice * * * act[ed] within the spirit of our decisions in the Handy line of cases.”). Specifically, the trial justice conducted a hearing on the state’s motions in limine and held sidebar conferences when the state objected to defense counsel’s cross-examination on drug use and possession. During the conferences conducted on the record, the trial justice considered the arguments articulated for and against the admissibility of the evidence of the witnesses’ possible intoxication, carefully weighed the proffered evidence,', '- 18 - and ultimately ruled that the evidence was inadmissible because it did not rise “to the level of intoxication.” We hold this to be sufficient. See id. 147-48. 10', 'B', 'Admission of Parole Status', 'Bishop also argues that the trial justice abused his discretion by allowing testimony about Bishop’s parole status. Bishop maintains that this evidence should have been excluded pursuant to Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, because any probative value it may have had was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial wallop. Specifically, Bishop challenges: (1) Det. Sgt. Bentsen’s testimonial references that Degnan was Bishop’s parole officer and that Bishop was arrested on a parole-detention warrant; (2) Degnan’s testimony that Bishop tested positive for alcohol at his last meeting, in violation of the conditions of his parole, and that Bishop failed to report to Degnan on the Monday following the murder; (3) testimony that Bishop was required to catalog his every location and associates; and (4) references to the fact that Bishop’s DNA was taken at the ACI. Bishop maintains that those references to his parole status were immaterial, redactable, superfluous, and unduly prejudicial. We disagree.', 'Before admitting otherwise probative evidence, a trial justice must carefully consider the relevance of the evidence relative to its potential prejudicial effect, pursuant to Rule 403. Rule 403 provides that, “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading 10', 'Bishop also argues that the trial justice erred by excluding this evidence on relevancy grounds. Although the trial justice did say that he was excluding the evidence on relevancy grounds, after a review of the record, we are convinced that the trial justice came to the conclusion that the Handy standard was not satisfied, even if he did not precisely articulate it. Accordingly, we are not confronted with a case in which the trial justice has excluded intoxication evidence on relevancy grounds alone. See Carrera, 528 A.2d at 334 (“[I]t would be error for the trial justice to prohibit this line of questioning [regarding a witness’s drug use at the time of an incident at issue] on relevance grounds alone.”).', '- 19 - the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.” This Court has said that “a trial justice’s discretion to exclude evidence under Rule 403 must be used sparingly”; only when such evidence demonstrate mere marginal relevance and enormous unfair prejudice should the trial justice exclude it. State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008).', 'After a carefully measured and thoughtful analysis, we are of the firm opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in permitting the references to Bishop’s parole status. In considering the motions in limine, the trial justice explained that evidence of Bishop’s parole status was “highly relevant” and “needed by the state to prove its case.” Specifically, he explained that the evidence regarding Bishop’s parole status was relevant to explain Bishop’s “opportunity,” including “his whereabouts at the time of the crimes,” as well as “his knowledge, identity, and intent” regarding June 27, 2007. Indeed, the evidence regarding Bishop’s parole status was relevant to explain how the police detectives identified him as a suspect.', 'For example, the discrepancies in Bishop’s travel logs for the night of the home invasion were probative, not only of his whereabouts at the time, but also of his opportunity to commit the crimes and his attempts to cover his tracks in the aftermath of his criminal activity. Also, Bishop’s uncharacteristic failure to report to his parole officer as scheduled, approximately five days after the murder, was certainly probative of his consciousness of guilt. Thus, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in concluding that evidence of Bishop’s parole status was highly relevant and probative to show Bishop’s opportunity, knowledge, identity, and intent regarding the June 27, 2007, incident. See State v. Mlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 997 (R.I. 2011) (“It is within the sound discretion of the trial justice whether to admit or exclude evidence under Rule 403.” quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 927 (R.I. 2005)).', '- 20 -', 'Further, the trial justice was careful to mitigate any prejudicial impact that evidence of Bishop’s status as a parolee might have had. The trial justice ordered that Bishop’s “parole status w[ould] only be admitted for limited purposes, such as proving opportunity, knowledge, identity, and intent regarding the June 27-28, 2007 incident,” and he instructed the jury as to that. Additionally, in assessing potential prejudice, the trial justice determined that Bishop’s parole status was factually connected to the crimes charged, and was so intertwined with the facts that it became part and parcel of the entire case, such that the probative value substantially outweighed the danger of prejudicial harm.', 'See State v. Woodson, 551 A.2d 1187, 1191 (R.I. 1988) (probative value substantially outweighed undue prejudice when the use of drugs at issue was factually connected to the crimes charged and “so intertwined with the facts that it became part and parcel of the entire case”). Specifically, the trial justice considered the state’s proffer— based on “the discovery materials including the grand jury presentation”—that (1) Bishop “was arrested on a parole warrant”; (2) Bishop “gave a statement to the police on” the day he was arrested, in which he made “several references to his parole status and the parole logs”; (3) Bishop’s parole logs, which were seized at Reine’s house pursuant to a warrant, reflected that Bishop left Reine’s house less than two hours before the incident in question; (4) Bishop did not report to his parole officer on the Monday after the incident, and there was “substantial evidence that the reason [he] failed to report [wa]s because he suffered a serious injury to his head”; (5) Turchetta was to testify that Reine called him on the morning after the murder to ask him for a doctor, explaining that Bishop “c[ould not] go to [just any doctor] because of his probation [sic]”; and (6) Antonelli, who hired Bishop as a condition of his parole, was to testify that “shortly after the murder, [Bishop] asked him to falsely confirm that Bishop had been injured', '- 21 - while at work.” 11 See DeJesus, 947 A.2d at 883 (explaining that evidence is not to be excluded under Rule 403 unless it “is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial”). Based on this, the trial justice concluded that the evidence of Bishop’s parole status was relevant, and the probative value was not substantially outweighed by its potential undue prejudice.', 'Moreover—and although we conclude that the prejudicial effect of this evidence was minimal—we recognize that in addition to carefully weighing the risk of unfair prejudice, the trial justice, in a pretrial order, provided “adequate safety measures * * * to protect defendant” from undue prejudice. See Woodson, 551 A.2d at 1193. For one, he barred the introduction of the circumstances of Bishop’s previous incarceration. Indeed, although the trial justice allowed testimony that Bishop had been previously convicted of a felony, he limited testimony regarding the character of the crime, which was first-degree murder. Further, the trial justice “ordered that the state instruct all of its witnesses that they will not testify to [Bishop]’s incarceration, detention, residence in prison or jail, nor the offenses for which he ha[d] served prison time.” The trial justice was also careful to restrict any reference that it was individuals at the ACI who recognized the composite sketch to be Bishop.', 'The trial justice further safeguarded against the risk of unfair prejudice by issuing an appropriate cautionary instruction to the jury about the very limited purpose for which the evidence concerning Bishop’s parole was offered. Specifically, the trial justice instructed that the evidence could not be used to support a conclusion that Bishop was of bad character and, thus, may have committed the offenses for which he was on trial; the evidence could be used 11', 'Ultimately, Bishop’s police statement was never admitted into evidence, and while both Antonelli and Turchetta testified at Bishop’s trial, Antonelli never testified that he hired Bishop as a condition of his parole and Turchetta never testified that Reine told him that Bishop “c[ould not] go to [just any doctor] because of his probation [sic],” although he did testify that Reine called him to seek medical assistance for Bishop.', '- 22 - only for limited purposes, such as proving opportunity—for example, his whereabouts at the time of the crimes at issue to which the parole logs speak—or to explain his opportunity, plan, or identity regarding the incident in question. 12 See State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1214 (R.I. 2012) (“In cases * * * in which the evidence in question can be used for multiple purposes, some of which are permissible and others of which are not, the trial justice should issue specific instructions to the jury explaining ‘the limited purpose [or purposes] for which the jury may consider it.’” quoting State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 1052 (R.I. 2000)). 12', 'The trial justice’s cautionary instructions provided that:', '“I again instruct you that if there is evidence that the defendant was', 'on parole at the time of the incident in question, you may not use', 'such evidence to conclude that he may be responsible for any of', 'the offenses for which he is now on trial. The fact that the', 'defendant may have been previously incarcerated or has been on', 'parole must not prejudice you into thinking that he may have', 'committed the crimes for which he is now on trial before you.', '“If the State offers such evidence, it will be for a very', 'limited purpose, and that is to provide a possible explanation for', 'the defendant’s actions subsequent to the date of the alleged', 'offenses.” The trial justice made the same point during the final jury instructions:', '“During the trial of this case, there was evidence offered', 'that the defendant was on parole as of late June, 2007. I again', 'instruct you that you may not use such evidence to prejudice you', 'into thinking that he may have committed the crimes for which he', 'is now on trial.

Frazier obtaining a DNA sample from Bishop at the ACI, the trial justice instructed:', '“The last question and answer * * * concerning the location at', 'which detective Frazier took the second buccal swab from the', 'defendant are stricken, and it is not part of the evidence.

Therefore, considering the full scope and weight of the testimonial evidence, as well as the trial justice’s specific and timely cautionary instructions to the jury, we hold that the trial justice’s evidentiary ruling to admit this evidence of defendant’s parole status was wholly within his discretion under Rule 403, because this evidence was relevant and not unduly prejudicial.', 'Finally, given the quantity and quality of the evidence inculpating Bishop, even if there were error—and it is our firm opinion that there was none—it would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Ciresi, 45 A.3d at 1215 (admission of uncharged bad conduct was harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence presented against the defendant at trial). Here, Claire and Ceasar both identified Bishop’s picture from a photo array.', 'Further, the DNA samples collected from the physical evidence at the crime scene matched the samples obtained from Bishop. In addition, the hairs harvested from the ski mask matched exemplars from Bishop’s head. Moreover, Bishop testified on direct examination that he failed to seek medical aid because he did not wish to call attention to himself for fear that he would have to explain the incident to his parole officer, and defense counsel referred to Bishop’s parole in his opening statement—that Bishop was “afraid about violating his parole”—and in his closing argument when he attempted to explain away Bishop’s reluctance to report the incident or to seek medical assistance. Furthermore, Bishop’s version of the incident was riddled with inconsistencies and was ultimately undercut by the testimony of Turchetta, who testified about Reine’s telephone call', '- 24 - seeking medical assistance for Bishop, and that of Antonelli, who testified that Bishop asked him to lie on his behalf about the cause of his injuries.

After the jury returned its verdict, Santiago received a sentence of twenty-five years, with nine years to serve and sixteen years suspended, with probation.', 'The defendant was also required to complete sex-offender counseling, register as a sex offender, and refrain from having any contact with the complaining witness. Before this Court, Santiago argues that the trial justice erred when she permitted the state to elicit testimony from the complaining witness that Santiago alleges was in violation of Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. We entertained this case on December 3, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues in this appeal should not summarily be decided. We have considered the record and the written and oral submissions of the parties, conclude that cause has not been shown, and proceed to decide the appeal without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In August 2008, defendant met a woman named Chely on the internet. 1 During the course of their burgeoning online relationship, Santiago invited Chely to relocate to Rhode Island from Texas, and she eventually moved into defendant’s Central Falls apartment with two of her daughters, then ages six and seven.', 'On February 5, 2009, defendant was home alone with Chely’s daughters while their mother attended night classes. Doreen, the older of Chely’s daughters, asked defendant for permission to play a video game. Doreen said that Santiago told her that, to play the video games, she would have to “do something,” specifically, to “take a shower with him or touch his private part.” According to Doreen, defendant made her touch “his private part” under his clothes and move her hand back and forth. The defendant instructed Doreen to cover her eyes with her other hand so that she would not see. While recounting the events of that night, Doreen also said that after about a minute, defendant told her to go wash her hands because she had “white things around her hands.” She said that she did not know the source of the substance but that it had not been on her hand before she touched defendant. She also said that Santiago instructed her not to tell anyone what had occurred.', 'Despite that admonition, however, the following day Doreen informed her mother about what had happened. Chely and her daughters quickly vacated the apartment, and, a few days later, Chely reported the incident to the Central Falls Police Department. Chely and Doreen were referred by the police to the Child Advocacy Center (CAC) for an interview, and a trained CAC counselor interviewed the young girl on February 11, 2009. The interview was transcribed 1', 'We refer to the complaining witness’s mother by only her first name. Additionally, we employ a fictitious name to protect the complaining witness’s identity.', '-2- and recorded on videotape. During the CAC interview, Doreen provided details of the events of February 5, including the fact that when she touched defendant’s body part it felt hard. Santiago subsequently was arrested and charged with second-degree child molestation sexual assault.', 'Before trial, defendant filed a motion in limine, in which he sought to prevent the state from employing either the video recording or the transcript of the CAC interview of the complaining witness. A justice of the Superior Court agreed in part, ordering that the recording and transcript could not be used as a past recollection recorded. 2 However, the hearing justice was clear that her ruling did not prevent the use of that material to refresh the recollection of the complaining witness.', 'The case was reached for trial in November 2011. The day before the trial was to commence, Doreen met with prosecutors for the purpose of preparing her testimony. During that meeting, Doreen said that, when she touched defendant’s body part, it felt soft. Because that statement was at odds with what she had said in the past, Doreen was shown a copy of the transcript of her CAC interview, during the course of which she said that the body part felt hard. However, the transcript did not refresh her recollection. The state then duly supplemented its discovery, notifying defendant of what Doreen had said and also that her previous statement “did not refresh her recollection.”', 'On November 17, 2011, Doreen took the stand at defendant’s trial.', 'During her testimony, Doreen said that, when she touched defendant, his skin felt soft, but that she could not 2', 'Rule 803(5) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides:', '“A memorandum or record concerning a matter about', 'which a witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient', 'recollection to enable the witness to testify fully and accurately,', 'shown to have been made or adopted by the witness when the', 'matter was fresh in the witness’ memory and to reflect that', 'knowledge correctly.

When the state then attempted to use the transcript of the CAC interview to refresh her recollection, defendant objected. After hearing argument during a sidebar conference, the trial justice allowed the state to ask the witness whether the CAC-interview transcript refreshed the witness’s recollection. 3 After testifying that reading the interview transcript would refresh her recollection, and after actually reading that transcript, Doreen testified that defendant’s body part felt hard. 4', 'At the conclusion of the trial, the jury found defendant guilty.

However, the only objection defendant raised during the questioning of Doreen occurred when the prosecutor showed Doreen her statement before she asked her whether seeing the transcript would refresh her recollection. That objection was sustained.

It includes a requirement that “[w]hen a criminal defendant requests discovery material concerning witnesses the state may call to testify at trial, Rule 16 obligates the state to produce ‘only prior recorded statements of a witness, a summary of the witness’s expected trial testimony, and any records of prior convictions.’” Briggs, 886 A.2d at 754 (quoting State v.

We reasoned, “[t]he fact that a witness statement is not as thorough as [the] defendant desires does not create a discovery violation.”', 'Id. at 250. Furthermore, “[b]ecause the state [had] provided a detailed witness statement that was more than adequate for [the] defendant to determine what [a police officer] might testify to at trial, there [was] no discovery violation.” Id.', 'In State v. Werner, 831 A.2d 183, 202 (R.I. 2003), we similarly held that there had been no discovery violation in a case in which certain photographs previously had been considered during a motion in limine. When an objection to the introduction of the photographs was sustained, the prosecutor explained that she planned to attempt to lay the necessary foundation to connect the photos to the issues in the case. Id. An expert witness was presented to make that connection, and the defendant argued that the testimony violated Rule 16. Werner, 831 A.2d at 202-03. We concluded that the trial justice had not erred when she denied the motion to exclude the expert witness’s testimony because the witness’s expertise had been disclosed to the defendant and the defendant could not have been surprised that the prosecution queried the', '-6- witness about the disputed photographs, which already had been the subject of the motion in limine and the earlier sustained objection. Id. at 203.', 'In the circumstances before us, we cannot say that the trial justice erred when she permitted Doreen to testify that defendant’s body part felt hard. The state, in accordance with its duty to update its discovery responses, notified defendant that, on the eve of her testimony, Doreen had expressed recollections that were inconsistent with her CAC interview and that the interview transcript “did not refresh her recollection.” The defendant already was aware, as a result of the hearing justice’s ruling on the motion in limine, that the CAC interview was fair game if it were to be used to refresh the witness’s recollection, and the state’s amended discovery response should have alerted defendant that it would attempt to do just that if Doreen were unable to recall whether defendant’s body part was hard when she touched it. See Werner, 831 A.2d at 202-03.', 'Unlike Pona, 810 A.2d at 249-50, where discovery was held to be sufficient despite the fact that a witness’s actual, in-court testimony was more detailed than the discovery that had been provided, here the state notified the defendant that Doreen’s memory had failed on the eve of her testimony and that her recollection had not been refreshed by her earlier statement. It is well settled that, when a party refreshes a witness’s recollection, the witness’s present memory of the event, rather than the memorandum used to revive the memory, stands as the evidence. Ricci, 639 A.2d at 67. Thus, the fact that the transcript did not refresh Doreen’s recollection during the preparation for her in-court testimony does not lead to the conclusion that the transcript would not refresh her recollection when she testified at trial. The content of and the inconsistency among Doreen’s statements was disclosed to the defendant and was a proper subject for cross-examination. In our opinion, the fact that the state notified the defendant that', '-7- Doreen’s recollection had not been refreshed on one occasion does not freeze the witness’s memory as of that moment.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

78,Michael Bell : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,reversal,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. On a summer’s evening in June 2007, a group of young people assembled at Murphy Field in the City of Newport, not to play baseball, but to watch a fist fight. The pugilists were two young men, one from the City of Newport, and the other from the Town of Middletown. Michael Bell (applicant) was a spectator, along with several of his friends. A brawl broke out among the onlookers. Mr. Bell armed himself with a baseball bat, allegedly to defend a female friend who he thought was being threatened. In the aftermath of this melee, Bell was charged with and later convicted of felony assault.', 'The applicant appeals from the denial of his application for postconviction relief. Specifically, the applicant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his claim that his trial counsel had provided ineffective assistance by giving him “incorrect legal advice” that “ultimately deprived [him] of the opportunity to consider and accept a favorable plea offer.” For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Among the group that Bell claims was threatening his female friend was one Ian Kerr. Although Bell concedes that Kerr did not physically touch either him or his female friend, Bell struck Kerr in the side of the head with the baseball bat with sufficient force to fracture Kerr’s skull.', 'On October 18, 2007, Bell was arraigned in Newport Superior Court on an information alleging one count of felony assault. Bell was represented by defense attorneys Kevin Dwyer (counsel) and Rebecca Clarke. 1 A bench trial commenced on March 23, 2009 in the Superior Court. At that time, Dwyer discovered that the state intended to call two witnesses whose identities had not been disclosed to him. Attorney Dwyer sought and received a continuance in order to prepare for these new witnesses. The trial justice also ordered that the state obtain written witness statements from the two new witnesses, and continued the trial for nearly two months.', 'On May 18, 2009, trial resumed and, upon cross-examining one of the new witnesses, Dwyer learned for the first time that the witness had been arrested for vandalizing Bell’s truck on the night of the incident. Attorney Dwyer then moved for a mistrial on the basis of this newly discovered evidence. The trial justice ruled that the juvenile records of the witnesses were discoverable, and allowed a further continuance. Trial resumed on June 15, 2009, at which time counsel withdrew his motion for a mistrial. 1', 'Although Attorney Clarke was co-counsel at applicant’s criminal trial, she was not mentioned during applicant’s postconviction-relief hearing, and there has been no allegation that she gave ineffective assistance to Bell.', '-2-', 'Attorney Dwyer presented two affirmative defenses on Bell’s behalf: self-defense and defense of others. On July 1, 2009, the trial justice found Bell guilty of felony assault. Bell’s present counsel entered her appearance on his behalf on July 22, 2009, and on July 27, 2009, Dwyer withdrew from the case. On September 10, 2009, Bell was sentenced to fifteen years, with four to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions, eleven years suspended and eleven years probation. Bell initially appealed this decision, but later withdrew that appeal. 2', 'On February 24, 2010, Bell filed an application for postconviction relief. A hearing was held on November 8 and December 16, 2010 before the same justice as had presided over the trial. Bell, his mother, and Dwyer were the only witnesses who testified. On May 10, 2011, the trial justice filed a written decision denying Bell’s application for postconviction relief. On May 20, 2011, applicant filed a notice of appeal. Final judgment was entered by the court on September 21, 2011. 3', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In Rhode Island, “post-conviction relief is available to a defendant convicted of a crime who contends that his original conviction or sentence violated rights that the state or federal constitutions secured to him.” Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Gordon v. State, 18 A.3d 467, 473 (R.I. 2011)).

To prevail on such a claim, the petitioner must satisfy the two prongs of the Strickland test: “[f]irst, the applicant must demonstrate that counsel’s performance was deficient, to the point that the errors were so serious that trial counsel did not function at the level guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.” Id. (quoting Rodriguez, 941 A.2d at 162). “This prong can be satisfied only by a showing that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” Id. (quoting Rodriguez, 941 A.2d at 162). The second prong of Strickland “requires the applicant to demonstrate prejudice emanating from the attorney’s deficient performance such as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.” Id. (quoting Rodriguez, 941 A.2d at 162). “This prong is satisfied only when an applicant demonstrates that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id. at 941-42 (quoting Rodriguez, 941 A.2d at 162)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The applicant argues that he was deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel because his attorney gave him “incorrect legal advice,” which robbed him', '-4- of the opportunity to consider and accept a plea offer. The state counters that applicant cannot show that the prosecution ever made a plea offer, much less that he would have accepted it, given his stated desire to join the military. Further, the state contends that the trial justice would not have accepted a less than jail disposition because the sentencing benchmarks would assign some jail time.', 'An applicant bringing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel can prevail only if he or she can meet both prongs of the test articulated in Strickland. See Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 14 n.7 (R.I. 2012). Accordingly, we will address each prong separately.', 'A', 'Objective Standard of Reasonableness', 'Under the first prong of Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, “the [applicant] must show that counsel’s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.”', '“[T]he [applicant] must show that counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.” Id. at 688. This Court has stated that applicants seeking postconviction relief due to ineffective assistance of counsel are “saddled with a ‘heavy burden,’ in that there exists ‘a strong presumption [recognized by this Court] that an attorney’s performance falls within the range of reasonable professional assistance and sound strategy * * *.’” Rice, 38 A.3d at 17 (quoting Ouimette v. State, 785 A.2d 1132, 1138-39 (R.I. 2001)).', 'On appeal, Bell argues that counsel gave him “inaccurate advice” by telling him he had a “clear-cut” case of defense of another and that he “would not serve jail time.” The applicant asserts that, because of that advice, he did not have the opportunity to entertain a favorable plea agreement.', 'Bell does not appear to argue that counsel’s trial performance amounted to', '-5- ineffective assistance but, rather, that counsel’s understatement of the risks involved in going to trial prevented him from making an informed decision at the outset to avoid trial by entering a plea agreement. 4', 'Bell argues that his decision to go to trial was based on “incorrect advice”; however, at his postconviction-relief hearing he admitted that, from the beginning, he did not want to “take any offer” because he wanted to join the military. 5 Attorney Dwyer testified that his client wanted to go “to trial because he wanted to go into the military, he wanted to clear his name, and he felt that his actions were justified under the circumstances, and I agreed with him.”', 'Unlike the cases upon which applicant relies, in which either a plea offer was not conveyed to the defendant, or its merits were not adequately discussed, in this case, there is no evidence that any plea arrangement was even offered. See, e.g., Missouri v. Frye, 132 S. Ct. 1399, 1404 (2012); Commonwealth v. Napper, 385 A.2d 521, 524 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1978). On the contrary, counsel testified that he did not actively pursue a plea disposition “because [he] was told in no uncertain terms [that they were] going to trial, so [he] remember[ed] being in chambers * * * and [he] remember[ed] saying something to the effect that, ‘Let’s not even talk about a plea deal because he’s not taking a deal. He wants to go to trial.’”', 'Pursuant to Article V, Rule 1.2(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct, “[i]n a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by a client’s decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.” Counsel unquestionably abided by his client’s decision in this case, and Bell now argues that 4', 'The recent United States Supreme Court opinion in Lafler v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 1376, 1384 (2012), reiterated that criminal defendants are entitled to competent counsel during plea negotiations. 5', 'Apparently, defendant was concerned that a felony conviction would render him ineligible for military service.', '-6- counsel underestimated the chance that he would be found guilty at trial and failed to advise him of the possible sentence he would face if convicted. Therefore, Bell asserts that his decision to go to trial was not an informed one.', 'Bell testified that he had met with counsel in person approximately twelve times, in addition to having contact with him by telephone and email.', 'Bell admitted during his postconviction-relief hearing that counsel had explained to him the affirmative defenses of self- defense and defense of others, but he denied that counsel had ever advised him that, if he were to be found guilty, it was possible he could receive a jail sentence. However, Bell did admit that, when he went to trial, he knew that he could go to jail. Attorney Dwyer testified that, while he did not have a specific recollection of a particular conversation with Bell, it was his regular practice to “tell [clients] the upside [and] the downside[:] * * * the downside is there’s always a possibility of going to jail to the maximum * * *.”', 'The applicant testified that, prior to trial, he would not have accepted a plea to a felony, even if it did not involve a jail term, explaining that, because he “really wanted to go in the Army, [he] didn’t want to take a felony charge.” Not only was there never such an offer, but the hearing justice recalled that, “[i]n the pre-trial chambers conference, it was clear that a plea to a non-jail disposition would not be offered and that the [c]ourt would not accept one, in any event, because Benchmark 10 assigns a four to five year sentence to the offense of felony assault.”', '“[A] choice between trial tactics, which appears unwise only in hindsight, does not constitute constitutionally-deficient representation under the reasonably competent assistance standard.” State v. D’Alo, 477 A.2d 89, 92 (R.I. 1984) (quoting United States v. Bosch, 584 F.2d 1113, 1121 (1st Cir. 1978)). “To state and prove a claim under this standard, [an applicant] must allege and demonstrate that his counsel’s error clearly ‘resulted from neglect or ignorance rather', '-7- than from informed, professional deliberation.’” Id. (quoting Bosch, 584 F.2d at 1121). Here, Bell admitted that he thought counsel “did a good job” before he was convicted. It was only after trial that Bell’s opinion of counsel changed, at which point he decided “[counsel] didn’t do a good job at the end.” When asked at his postconviction hearing whether “this whole thing is about the fact that you don’t like the outcome of [the trial],” Bell responded “[y]eah, I guess.”', 'It may well be true that, had Bell known that he would be convicted and sentenced to a fifteen-year term with four years to serve, he may have put aside his hopes for a military career in favor of pursuing a shorter prison term. However, effective assistance of counsel does not involve the ability to accurately predict the future. It is sufficient that counsel informed Bell of his options and then abided by his client’s choice to go to trial. Although he now concedes that the use of deadly force was unjustified, according to counsel, at the time of trial, Bell believed he had been defending others and himself. Counsel pursued the affirmative defenses based on what the trial justice characterized as “a sincere and reasonable belief * * * that Bell had a viable self/third party defense * * *.” We can discern no error in the trial justice’s determination that Dwyer provided “capable, competent and intelligent advocacy” to applicant.', 'B', 'Prejudice', '“Prejudice exists if there is a reasonable probability that, absent counsel’s deficient performance, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Larngar v. Wall, 918 A.2d 850, 856 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Figueroa, 639 A.2d 495, 500 (R.I. 1994)). Although we have found that the first prong of Strickland has not been met, we note that, in any case, the applicant cannot meet this second prong of Strickland because he cannot show that any plea offer was forthcoming, much less that he would have accepted it, given his stated desire to avoid a', '-8- felony conviction in order to join the military. To prove prejudice, the applicant would need to pile supposition upon supposition: (1) that, had counsel sought to open plea negotiations, the state would make a favorable offer; (2) that the applicant would have accepted an offer that, of necessity, would have required him to plead guilty to a felony, thus presumably preventing him from joining the military; (3) that the offer would have been approved by the court; and (4) that the offer would have resulted in a shorter prison term than the four years the applicant is presently serving.

79,State : v. : Francis Kolsoi. :,reversal,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Following a jury-waived trial before a justice of the Superior Court, the defendant, Francis Kolsoi, was convicted of five counts of stalking in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-59-2. The trial justice imposed a sentence of probation on each count to run concurrently. The defendant timely appealed his conviction to this Court. The matter came before us on October 7, 2015, under an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised by this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering counsels’ oral and written arguments and examining the record, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case can be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons given below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In the fall of 2011, as part of her morning routine, Allison, a student at Lincoln High School, would pick up her friends Brianna, Chloe, Danielle, and Emily on her way to school. 1 En route, the girls usually would stop at a local Dunkin’ Donuts for coffee. On four days in 1', 'We have employed pseudonyms to protect the privacy of the complainants.', '-1- September and October 2011, the girls and defendant crossed paths at Dunkin’ Donuts. Allison and Brianna testified that on those four occasions, Kolsoi engaged in disturbing behavior that was directed at them, including looking down their friend’s shirt, staring at them, appearing to photograph them with his cell phone, and following them in his vehicle after they left the coffee shop. Footage from the shop’s security cameras, which was admitted into evidence, captured most of what transpired inside the store. Also, on more than one occasion, Kolsoi tailgated the girls’ vehicle, flashed his car lights at them, or followed them to the school parking lot.', 'Allison testified that the group first encountered defendant on September 23, 2011, when defendant opened the coffee shop’s door for them as he was entering and they were leaving. As they passed through the door, Brianna observed him look down the front of Danielle’s shirt. The defendant did not go into the shop, but instead stood in front of Allison’s car, a black Volvo, “and just stared at [them] getting into the car.” According to Allison, Kolsoi then hurried to his car and “drove very fast to catch up” to them, almost striking her car in the process. Kolsoi continued to follow them very closely, switching lanes when Allison did, and flashing his lights. She testified that she was afraid that he might be trying to collide with her car or, even worse, planning to abduct one of them.', 'On September 30, 2011, when Allison and her friends again visited Dunkin’ Donuts, Brianna noticed that Kolsoi was already inside the shop. While they waited in line to be served, Brianna alerted the group to his presence and Allison noticed that Kolsoi was holding his cell phone in a manner that suggested that he was taking a video or pictures of her and her friends. Allison immediately said, “Let’s go” to her companions and they all ran out of the shop, except for Brianna, who stayed behind waiting for her order. Allison said that, when she returned to get her friend, Brianna was standing in line, looking frightened and holding on to an acquaintance.', '-2-', 'Brianna also testified; she said that she saw Kolsoi sitting at a table, pointing his phone at the girls. She also concluded that he was videotaping or taking pictures of them. She said that she held on to a friend in line because she was afraid that Kolsoi would grab her. When they returned to Allison’s car, they noticed that Kolsoi was already in his vehicle, relaxing with his hands behind his head, staring at them. This time, according to Allison, Kolsoi followed them all the way to school and “drove very slowly past [them] and was smiling and staring at [them] as [they] were standing in front of [her] car.” Brianna also said that, as he drove by the school parking lot, Kolsoi was looking at them and smiling, which caused her to feel “[c]reeped out.” Upset by what had just occurred, for a second time, Allison memorized his license plate number and reported both incidents to the school’s assistant principal.', 'On October 5, 2011, the girls were in the Dunkin’ Donuts when they looked outside and noticed Kolsoi in his car, parked near Allison’s black Volvo. Fearing for their safety, the girls called the police and waited for a police car to arrive before they returned to their car. Although Kolsoi chose not to follow them that day, a security video showed Kolsoi’s car leaving the parking lot behind the police car, shortly after the girls left.', 'On October 6, 2011, the girls again arrived at Dunkin’ Donuts before school. However, this time the Lincoln Police Department had informed them that plainclothes police officers would be inside the building to observe Kolsoi. The students purchased their items while Kolsoi sat in his car in the parking lot. After they backed out of their parking space and left the premises, Kolsoi again began to trail them. Allison said that, although he was two car lengths behind the girls when they left the lot, Kolsoi soon caught up to them and pulled up beside them on the road so that he could look inside their car. This last incident led to Kolsoi’s arrest on October 12, 2011.', '-3-', 'In an information dated January 19, 2012, the state charged defendant with five counts of felony stalking. The case came to trial in the Superior Court later that year. At the close of the state’s evidence, Kolsoi moved to dismiss the charges against him, pursuant to Rule 29(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The trial justice reserved her decision on the motion until the close of all the evidence. Kolsoi then testified in his own defense, making an effort to explain his actions for each encounter with the young complainants. Kolsoi maintained that each situation was coincidental and he denied that he was aware of the girls for more than an instant when their paths crossed. He said that he was at Dunkin’ Donuts on those occasions for innocuous reasons, in particular, to connect with someone for part-time work. He testified that he drove closely behind the girls and flashed his lights because he was frustrated and rushing to get to work. With respect to the complainants’ contention that he appeared to be photographing them with his cell phone, he said that he was holding his phone in a way to avoid sun glare as he looked for a message.', 'The defendant said he went to Dunkin’ Donuts on September 23, 2011, but realized when he looked at the menu board that he did not have enough money to purchase anything and left, rushing to get to a job in Framingham, Massachusetts. He said that he recalled seeing the girls, but asserted that they did not stand out in his mind and he emphatically denied that he had stopped at their car to stare at them. He did admit to following their car very closely and to flashing his lights, but explained that he did that to more than one vehicle as he hurried to get to his job.', 'Kolsoi offered that on September 30, 2011, he went to Dunkin’ Donuts expecting to meet someone about a job. As he viewed the security footage from that day, which had been admitted as a full exhibit, he explained that he was looking at his phone and looking up periodically to see', '-4- if the person he was expecting had arrived and that he was sitting in a particular chair to avoid sun glare. He denied that he had recognized the girls. He did concede that he left the Dunkin’ Donuts right after the girls, but said he was not aware of them. In justifying his presence near the high school, Kolsoi said he was driving to a rental apartment that he owned to fix the toilet and that his route coincidentally brought him by the high school. 2 He said he did not see the girls in the parking lot, but that he did notice the black Volvo. He maintained, however, that he did not pay much attention to it. When asked to explain why he drove so slowly by the school, Kolsoi testified that he slowed down because he did not want to get a speeding ticket.', 'With respect to the incident that occurred on October 5, 2011, defendant said that he went to Dunkin’ Donuts, waited in his car for a phone call about a job, and checked his phone for messages. He said that when he did not receive a call, he left for home. He denied that he had seen the girls that day, saying, “I might have, but I wasn’t paying attention to them.” When he left the parking lot, there was a police car ahead of him; he said that he “might” have seen the black Volvo, explaining, “I think I was already then conscious of the black Volvo because of the 23rd when they blocked me, so I knew about the black Volvo and a bunch of kids.”', 'Finally, he said he went to Dunkin’ Donuts on October 6, 2011, after working a night shift because he thought someone might be contacting him about employment, so he waited for a phone call. He said that he did not recall having seen the girls on that day but, after viewing the security footage, he said, “I might have seen them but not conscious [sic] that these are the girls or any girls.” He denied that he followed the girls out of the parking lot that day but said, “I 2', 'Kolsoi’s tenant, Jacob Langley, said that Kolsoi’s toolbox had been left by the front door to his', 'apartment on September 30, 2011. He also said that Kolsoi would, on occasion, leave the', 'toolbox there to let him know that he had stopped by the rental apartment to make requested', 'repairs.', '-5- might have seen [a black Volvo], but it’s like I was conscious of the black Volvo but I wasn’t paying attention, I was minding my business.” Kolsoi went on to say that he was completely shocked and confused when he was arrested on October 12, 2011.', 'At the close of all the evidence, Kolsoi renewed his oral motion to dismiss, and the trial justice again reserved judgment. Then, on December 6, 2012, without having ruled on the motion to dismiss, the trial justice delivered her decision from the bench finding Kolsoi guilty of five counts of stalking. In support of the oral motions that he made during trial, Kolsoi also filed a motion to dismiss on January 8, 2013. On March 22, 2013, the trial justice heard Kolsoi on the motion to dismiss. Although a transcript of that hearing has not been provided to this Court, the trial justice summarized defendant’s arguments when she delivered her decision from the bench on April 26, 2013. It is apparent that defendant argued that the state had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that his actions were willful or malicious, that there was no evidence that he was formally notified that his activities were unwelcome, and that there was insufficient evidence on counts 3, 4, and 5 because there was no testimony from the complainants named in those counts. That motion was denied and defendant timely appealed.', 'On appeal before this Court, Kolsoi argues that: (1) the trial justice erred when she denied his motion to dismiss because he was “without knowledge that his actions were disturbing;” (2) the trial justice erred when she denied his motion to dismiss counts three through five because the state failed to call three of the five complainants to testify; (3) the trial justice erred when she denied his motion to dismiss because the state failed to prove that the complainants were in “reasonable fear of bodily injury;” (4) § 11-59-2 is unconstitutionally vague; and (5) that the failure to call three of the complainants violated his rights under the Sixth Amendment’s Confrontation Clause and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', '-6-', 'Analysis', 'We begin by noting that defendant waived his right to a jury trial and chose to be tried by a justice sitting without a jury. Therefore, to challenge the legal sufficiency of the evidence, the defendant must file a motion to dismiss under the provisions of Rule 29(a). See State v. Silvia, 798 A.2d 419, 424 (R.I. 2002). When ruling on a motion to dismiss in a jury-waived criminal trial, the trial justice acts as an independent factfinder. See State v. Albanese, 970 A.2d 1215, 1220 (R.I. 2009). Sitting in that role, the trial justice should:', '“weigh and evaluate the trial evidence, pass upon the credibility of the trial', 'witnesses, and engage in the inferential process, impartially, not being required to', 'view the inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, and against the moving', 'party. After so doing, if the trial justice in a criminal case setting concludes that', 'the trial evidence is sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, he or', 'she denies the defendant’s motion to dismiss and, if both sides have rested, enters', 'decision and judgment of conviction thereon. If the evidence is not so sufficient,', 'he or she grants the motion and dismisses the case.” State v. McKone, 673 A.2d', '1068, 1072–73 (R.I. 1996). It is also significant that “[i]n a jury-waived criminal proceeding, this Court gives deference to a trial justice’s finding[s] of facts.” State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1221–22 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Forand, 958 A.2d 134, 138 (R.I. 2008)). Moreover, when we review these “determinations of credibility and findings of fact by a trial justice sitting without a jury, this Court will not disturb the trial justice’s findings unless they are clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence on a controlling issue.” Id. at 1222 (quoting State v. LaCroix, 911 A.2d 674, 679 (R.I. 2006)).', '1', 'Prior Knowledge', 'First, defendant argues that his motion to dismiss should have been granted because he was “without knowledge that his actions were disturbing.” He argues that, in the absence of', '-7- evidence that he approached the complainants, contacted them directly, or knew that his actions were disturbing or unwanted, his case should have been dismissed under the provisions of Rule 29. To buttress his argument, defendant cites to our previous stalking cases, including State v. Stierhoff, 879 A.2d 425 (R.I. 2005); State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50 (R.I. 2001); and State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491 (R.I. 2004). In Stierhoff, 879 A.2d at 428, not only the complainant, but others as well, put the defendant on notice that his attentions were unwanted and unwelcome before any criminal charges were brought against him. Likewise, in Breen, 767 A.2d at 52-53, the defendant had been previously convicted of stalking the complainant and had been sentenced to one year of probation and subjected to a no-contact order. But shortly after his probation ended, he began to harass the complainant again. Id. at 53. Finally, in Grayhurst, 852 A.2d at 499-500, the complainant had sought and had been granted two restraining orders against the defendant before the defendant was later charged with stalking.', 'It is our opinion that these cases are not helpful to defendant. In our view, defendant misconstrues not only the holdings of these cases but also the language of § 11-59-2. Although it is true that each of the cited cases involved defendants who previously had been notified, at least informally, that their contacts with the complainants were unwelcome, there is utterly no foundation to support an argument that we created a hard-and-fast rule that notice must be given to a defendant before criminal stalking charges are justified. Indeed, we foreclosed that precise argument in Stierhoff, 879 A.2d at 436, where we said that “there is nothing in the language of § 11-59-2 to suggest that a criminal defendant must be first served with any such type of official warning before his alarming, annoying, or bothersome conduct falls within the ambit of the statute.”', 'It is significant that the statute prohibits “willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follow[ing] another person with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear of bodily injury', '-8- * * *.” Section 11-59-2(a)(2) (emphasis added). Although the word “following” is not defined in the text of the statute, it has been judicially defined elsewhere. For instance, Connecticut construes the term “following” to require', '“that any following be willful * * * the following must have a predatory thrust to', 'it. [It] does not encompass following that is aimless, unintentional, accidental or', 'undertaken for a lawful purpose. Of course, following implies proximity in space', 'as well as time. Whether someone has deliberately maintained sufficient visual or', 'physical proximity with another person, uninterrupted, over a substantial enough', 'period of time to constitute following will depend upon a variety of differing', 'factors in each case. These are appropriate issues for the trier of fact to decide[.] ”', 'State v. Russell, 922 A.2d 191, 203 (Conn. App. Ct. 2007).', 'Based on the evidence presented at trial, the trial justice found that defendant’s “following” did menace and frighten the complainants, and that his testimony was merely “fabrication and justification” for the threatening behavior towards the girls. The defendant’s repeated actions over the course of four different days cannot be cast as mere coincidence. On each day, he placed himself at Dunkin’ Donuts so that he could see the girls, he arrived at the same time, he clearly knew the car in which they traveled, he was observed peering in the windows of the vehicle, he never purchased anything at the coffee shop, and he used his cell phone camera to intimidate the girls by indicating, or at least leading them to believe, that he was photographing them. Because § 11-59-2 neither imputes a requirement that the defendant be notified his actions are disturbing nor requires direct contact with a complainant, we discern no error.', '2', 'Failure to Call Three of the Five Complainants to Testify', 'Second, defendant contends that the state failed to prove that three of the girls were in reasonable fear because the state did not call them to testify. We do not agree.', '-9-', 'The trial justice rejected defendant’s argument that testimony by Chloe, Danielle, and Emily was necessary to establish that those complainants were in “reasonable fear of bodily injury.” Rather, she found that his intent regarding all five complainants was evident because the complainants were traveling in the same group. Based on the state’s assertion that the other three complainants would testify to the same facts as Allison and Brianna, the trial justice found that their testimony would have been cumulative and, therefore, unnecessary. “Cumulative evidence” is evidence that “tend[s] to prove the same point to which other evidence has been offered.” State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1032 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Coleman, 478 N.W.2d 349, 358 (Neb. 1992)). “[T]o qualify as ‘cumulative,’ the evidence in question need not be introduced only after other evidence tending to prove the same point already has been admitted. Rather, the test is a retrospective one, administered at the close of all the evidence * * *.” Id. After reviewing the record, we agree that the testimony of the remaining girls would have been cumulative in light of Allison’s and Brianna’s testimony and would have added very little to the information the trial justice received in the course of trial.', 'Indeed, it is our opinion that the testimony of the remaining complainants was not necessary. We do not agree with defendant’s argument that § 11-59-2 creates a subjective standard that requires that a victim actually be in reasonable fear of bodily injury. Section 11- 59-2(a) defines the essential element of the crime in objective terms—whether the fear of bodily injury is “reasonable”—and the testimony of the three complainants was not necessary to establish it. Simply put, the complainant’s subjective fear is irrelevant: the statute requires only that the defendant intend to place another person “in reasonable fear of bodily injury” by “harass[ing]” or “willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follow[ing]” that person. Id. (emphasis added).', '- 10 -', 'It has not been disputed that the same girls traveled together and that defendant’s actions were directed toward the entire group. The girls arrived at Dunkin’ Donuts in one car and entered and left together as a group. The testimony of Allison and Brianna, together with the surveillance footage, was sufficient evidence for the trial justice to find that defendant directed his actions towards all five complainants with the same intent to place all of them in a reasonable fear of bodily injury. The trial justice found that the surveillance video was “worth a thousand words” in establishing that defendant repeatedly correlated his movements with those of the group on at least four occasions over a span of two weeks. She found that defendant “trailed them in his car,” flashed his lights, and drove in a “frantic and menacing manner around” them. She found that he “placed himself” at Dunkin’ Donuts at the same time and smiled at all of them in a “creepy” manner, frightening them. She also found that defendant “made unwelcome gestures towards the girls in public,” including aiming his camera at them, and then following them, smiling, “in the midst of a clearly unwelcome pursuit.” We agree with the trial justice that all this evidence is sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant undertook these actions for the purpose of putting all five girls in reasonable fear of bodily injury.', '3', 'The Remaining Arguments on Appeal', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she denied his motion to dismiss because the state failed to prove that the two complainants who did testify were in “reasonable fear of bodily injury.” Specifically, defendant points to Allison’s and Brianna’s testimony in which they said, somewhat defiantly, that they would continue to go to Dunkin’ Donuts despite defendant’s behavior. However, nowhere in the record is it revealed that defendant raised this argument before the trial justice.', '- 11 -', 'Likewise, to the extent that the defendant challenges § 11-59-2 as unconstitutionally vague and contends that his constitutional right to confrontation has been violated, those issues are also not properly before us. A review of the record clearly demonstrates that the defendant did not raise those arguments at any time before the trial justice, including at the post-trial hearings on his motions to dismiss. At oral argument, the defendant’s appellate counsel candidly conceded this point. By failing to raise those arguments, the defendant denied the trial justice the opportunity to rule on these issues, and, for that reason, he cannot assert them now. See Thornley v. Community College of Rhode Island, 107 A.3d 296, 302 (R.I. 2014). This Court “will not entertain on appeal an issue that the aggrieved party did not specifically raise before the trial court.” Town of Richmond v. Wawaloam Reservation, Inc., 850 A.2d 924, 930 (R.I. 2004).', 'Conclusion', 'We affirm the judgment of conviction.

80,State : v. : Anthony Parrillo. :,non-reversal,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This Court issued a writ of certiorari to review a Superior Court order denying the state’s request to adjudge Anthony Parrillo a probation violator. The hearing justice’s decision to deny the state’s request was based upon his finding that Parrillo was no longer on probation at the time that he allegedly committed the offense of felony assault. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the order of the Superior Court and remand the case for further proceedings.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The pertinent facts in this case are not in dispute. In March 1982, Parrillo was charged with two separate counts of murder. Later that year, a Superior Court jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree on count 1 of the indictment and guilty of murder in the second degree on count 2 of the indictment. Parrillo appealed to this Court, and in 1984 we vacated the judgment of conviction. State v. Parillo, 480 A.2d 1349, 1359 (R.I.', '-1- 1984).1 The case was remanded to the Superior Court where, on January 21, 1986, Parrillo pled guilty to two counts of second-degree murder.', 'Significantly, per the judgment of conviction and commitment, he was sentenced to thirty years, the first twenty years to serve with “the remaining 10 years * * * suspended, probation for 10 years, said probation to commence upon [Parrillo’s] release from the [Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI)], each count concurrent.”2', 'On December 22, 1993, after receiving what appear to be credits for time served pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-19-23 and for good behavior pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 42-56- 24,4 Parrillo was released from the ACI on parole. According to an affidavit by Parrillo, 1', 'Although the 1984 case caption was spelled State v.

He sought a dismissal of the Rule 32(f) violation report on the grounds that “he was no longer on probation at the time of either the alleged conduct or the filing of the violation notice, but instead that his probation expired some time before that.” Parrillo attested that he “believed that [his] probation should have ended at the earliest on December 20, 2003, but in any event [he] 5', 'After a jury-waived trial before a Superior Court justice, Parrillo was convicted of aiding and abetting one felony assault and of misdemeanor assault.

He also argued, seemingly in the alternative, that the state should be barred from seeking to revoke his probation because to hold otherwise would constitute a violation of his due-process rights.', 'A violation hearing was held on November 2, 2012, at which time Parrillo argued that he was not “subject to being violated because his probation ha[d] already terminated” in 2009. He maintained that it was “inconceivable” that the state could inform Parrillo that his probation had ended, and then, years later, attempt to adjudge him a probation violator.', 'In response, the state maintained its position that Parrillo was in fact on probation at the time of the 2011 incident. Specifically, the state claimed that Parrillo’s thirty-year sentence in 1986 meant that he would “finish serving the full term of his sentence on January 22, 2016.”', 'The hearing justice disagreed with the state and quashed the Rule 32(f) violation report. The hearing justice rejected Parrillo’s argument that the doctrine of equitable estoppel barred the state from seeking to adjudge him a violator, reasoning that “the probation officer had no authority to modify [the sentence],” and that it was “absurd to even attempt to apply the detrimental reliance [analysis] in the context of the facts of this case.” However, the hearing justice held that the language of § 12-19-8 was clear in that it granted the sentencing justice the authority to set the period of probation. Therefore, he', '-5- concluded that the sentencing justice’s specification that probation would “commence upon [Parrillo’s] release from the ACI” should be given effect.7', 'An order entered denying the state’s request that Parrillo be adjudged a probation violator.', 'The state subsequently filed a motion to reconsider and, on April 5, 2013, its motion was heard.8 The hearing justice explained that his decision to deny and dismiss the Rule 32(f) violation report was based on what he felt was “the only evidence of the intent of the sentencing judge”—the clear language of the judgment of conviction that articulated that the probationary term would “commence upon [Parrillo’s] release from the ACI.” The hearing justice further explained that “[t]he [sentencing] judge could have sentenced [Parrillo] to 30 years, 20 to serve, with the balance of the term suspended and [Parrillo] placed on probation for that period of time[,] [but] [h]e did not.” Therefore, the hearing justice denied the state’s motion to reconsider.', 'The state thereafter filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted on May 27, 2014.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court’s review ‘on writ of certiorari is limited to examining the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.’” Huntley v.

To do so, we must delve into the governing statutory provisions and our jurisprudence interpreting such provisions, most recently pronounced in Rose v. State, 92 A.3d 903 (R.I. 2014).', 'If Parrillo was indeed on probation at that time, then we must determine if the hearing justice committed an error of law in rejecting Parrillo’s equitable estoppel defense against the state.', 'A', 'Parrillo’s Thirty-Year Sentence', 'The determination of whether Parrillo was on probation at the time of the 2011 incident turns on the application and interplay of several statutory provisions, the first of which is § 12-19-8. Section 12-19-8(a) provides, in relevant part, that the sentencing court “may impose a sentence and suspend the execution of the sentence, in whole or in part, or place the defendant on probation without the imposition of a suspended sentence[,]” and that such “suspension shall place the defendant on probation for the time', '-7- and on any terms and conditions that the court may fix.” We have interpreted § 12-19-8 as granting a sentencing justice a wide range of discretion when imposing a sentence so long as that sentence does not conflict with any other statutory provision. See Rose, 92 A.3d at 909. Next at play are §§ 42-56-24 and 12-19-2(a). Section 42-56-24 authorizes the DOC to mitigate a defendant’s sentence by rewarding a prisoner’s good behavior and industriousness with credits towards his or her sentence (herein, good-time credits); meanwhile, § 12-19-2(a) requires that “if the punishment to be imposed [at sentencing] is imprisonment, the sentence or sentences imposed shall be reduced by the number of days spent in confinement while awaiting trial and while awaiting sentencing” (herein, time- served credit). This Court’s recent decision in Rose, 92 A.3d at 907-13, dealt with the interplay of these statutory provisions in light of a mandatory-minimum sentence.', 'In Rose, 92 A.3d at 907, this Court was tasked with deciding “[w]hat effect, if any, [did the defendant’s] credits for (1) good time and (2) time served have on the total length of his sentence[.]” Alexander Rose (Rose) had pled nolo contendere to one count of first-degree child molestation and was sentenced to twenty years—the mandatory minimum at that time pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.2.9 Rose, 92 A.3d at 905. At the sentencing hearing, the Superior Court justice stated that: “the defendant [was] sentenced to 20 years at the ACI, eight years to serve, credit retroactive to December 23, 1992, the balance, 12 years, suspended, and upon release the defendant is placed on 12 years probation.” Id. Rose was subsequently released from the ACI on parole on December 17, 1997, as a result of receiving time-served and good-behavior credits. Id. at 905-06. In July 1999, Rose completed his parole without incident and, in 2010, he filed a petition for 9', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.2 has since then been amended to a twenty-five-year mandatory minimum sentence. See P.L. 2006, ch. 206, § 3.', '-8- a writ of habeas corpus and an application for post-conviction relief—specifically requesting to be discharged from probation. Id. at 906.', 'Rose asserted that his probationary period ended in July 2011—twelve years after his successful completion of parole.10 Rose relied on the sentencing justice’s assertion at sentencing that his twelve- year probationary term would commence “upon release” from the ACI. Id. at 908.', 'In our opinion affirming the dismissal of Rose’s petition, this Court analyzed the language of § 42-56-24’s good-time credits. Rose, 92 A.3d at 907-11. We held that the plain language of the good-time-credit statute suggested that the “only form of mitigation contemplated in that provision [was] a reduction of the amount of time that a defendant must spend incarcerated.” Id. at 908. Thus, any mitigation of Rose’s sentence under § 42-56-24 did not change or reduce his twenty-year sentence, but instead reduced the time that he would be confined at the ACI. See Rose, 92 A.3d at 908. In response to Rose’s argument that he relied on the statements made by the sentencing justice that he would be on probation for twelve years “upon release from the ACI,” we acknowledged that:', '“Although we have previously interpreted § 12-19-8 as', 'affording a trial justice the discretion to determine when a', 'prisoner’s term of probation will commence, * * * we have', 'also held that a sentencing justice’s pronouncement about', 'the commencement of probation will not be given effect to', 'the extent that it conflicts with another statutory provision.', '“* * * [W]e conclude[d] that there [was] no authority', 'which would allow the sentencing justice’s words to', 'effectively reduce the total length of Rose’s sentence below', 'the mandatory minimum.” Rose, 92 A.3d at 908, 909.', 'In analyzing time-served credits pursuant to § 12-19-2(a), we held that although Rose “intellectualized [his] situation differently than the defendant” in State v. 10', 'In his filings, Rose had also argued that his probation ended on December 17, 2009— twelve years after the date of his release from the ACI on parole. Rose v. State, 92 A.3d 903, 906 (R.I. 2014). At oral argument, he abandoned this position. Id. at 907.', '-9- Bergevine, 883 A.2d 1158 (R.I. 2005) (mem.), in essence Rose sought the same outcome that this Court rejected in Bergevine, i.e.,—that Rose’s probation start and end date be dated back due to the fifteen-month credit that he received for time served. Rose, 92 A.3d at 912. In Bergevine, we decisively rejected the defendant’s argument that he was not on probation at the time of an alleged probation violation because the approximate nine- month time-served credit made his ten-year sentence, including his probation, retroactive. Bergevine, 883 A.2d at 1158-59. Accordingly, we concluded in Rose, as had the hearing justice, that “neither Rose’s credits for good time nor his credits for time served entitled him to an acceleration of the end date of his probationary term.” Rose, 92 A.3d at 912.', 'In the case under review, the state argues that this Court should apply Rose and, in view of its holding, reverse the hearing justice’s decision and his finding that Parrillo was not on probation at the time of the 2011 incident. The state also argues that any attempt to distinguish Rose from this case lacks merit.', 'In response, and in support of Parrillo’s assertion that he was not on probation at the time of the 2011 incident, Parrillo raises three key arguments. First, he argues that Rose is inapplicable to his case, as Rose relied heavily on State v. Jacques, 554 A.2d 193 (R.I. 1989),11 and State v. Dantzler, 690 A.2d 338 (R.I. 1997),12 two cases that were decided after Parrillo’s 1986 sentencing. Second, Parrillo argues that even if Rose is applicable, it is distinguishable from his case, as Rose dealt with a mandatory minimum sentence and whether the words of a sentencing justice, together with both the defendant’s good-time and time-served credits, could in 11', 'In State v. Jacques, 554 A.2d 193, 196 (R.I. 1989), we first announced that a probationary period began at imposition of a sentence, even if that meant at the commencement of incarceration. 12', 'In State v. Dantzler, 690 A.2d 338, 341-42 (R.I. 1997), we held that the trial court could revoke a probationary term on the basis of criminal acts committed after imposition of sentence but before the actual probationary portion of sentence commenced.', '- 10 - effect lower the defendant’s sentence to less than the statutory minimum. However, here, Parrillo argues that, unlike Rose, “there was no possibility that the combined length of [the] time [he] will spend incarcerated and on probation will fall below [the minimum mandatory term] if the sentencing justice’s words ‘upon release’ are allowed to control.” Lastly, Parrillo argues that principles of estoppel apply as a matter of due process, barring the state from seeking to adjudge him a probation violator.', 'Rose is central to our analysis of the state’s petition and to our application of good-time credits, time-served credits, and § 12-19-8 to this case. Here, Parrillo, like Rose, claims that the sentencing justice’s pronouncement that his probationary term was to begin “upon [his] release from the ACI” is binding pursuant to the authority granted to a sentencing justice, implying that the clock on his probationary term should have started ticking when he either was released on parole or had successfully completed parole. We reject, however, Parrillo’s contention that Rose does not apply because it was predicated on two decisions decided after he was sentenced. It is well established that a judicial interpretation of a statute “relates back” to the date the statute was enacted and, unlike legislative action, does not implicate ex post facto considerations. State v. Barber, 767 A.2d 78, 79-80 (R.I. 2001) (rejecting the defendant’s contention that Dantzler and Jacques were inapplicable to his case because they were decided after he was sentenced).', 'Moreover, this Court appreciates that here, unlike in Rose, if Parrillo’s probation were to “commence upon [his] release from the ACI,” it would not reduce his sentence below the mandatory minimum. See Rose, 92 A.3d at 909. The reduced sentence, which would range between seventeen and twenty-three years, depending on the operative', '- 11 - date,13 would be well above the ten-year mandatory-minimum for second-degree murder, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-23-2. It is our opinion, however, that this distinction does not require us to stray away from our clearly articulated interpretation of the good-time and time-served credit statutes enunciated in Rose, and the effect that these credits have on the length of a defendant’s overall sentence, nor does this distinction warrant a different outcome. Rose, 92 A.3d at 912, was clear—neither Parrillo’s “credits for good time nor his credits for time served entitle[] him to an acceleration of the end date of his probationary term[,]” because the DOC does not have the “power to modify the overall length of a judicially imposed sentence * * *.” Id. at 911.14 The power to reduce a sentence, either directly or indirectly, is reserved to the judiciary.15 Id.', 'Here, the sentencing justice sentenced Parrillo to thirty years. Although § 12-19-8 permitted the sentencing justice to suspend a portion of the sentence, as he chose to do, any suspended or probationary period did not reduce the sentence from what he specifically articulated was thirty years. 13', 'If his probation were to begin upon his physical release from the ACI in 1993, his sentence would end in 2003, seventeen years after it was imposed in 1986. If his probation were to begin upon his release from parole in 1999, his sentence would end in 2009, twenty-three years after it was imposed. 14', 'We are of the opinion that the dissent’s conclusion that the General Assembly has, by statute, modified Parrillo’s sentence is incorrect and not supported by our well-settled constitutional jurisprudence. The sentence imposed in this case is a final judgment of conviction by the Superior Court. A final judgment may be reopened or amended only according to law and in the exercise of judicial power. See Taylor v. Place, 4 R.I. 324, 363 (1856) (“the exercise of judicial power [is] prohibited to the general assembly” pursuant to the Constitution of Rhode Island). 15', 'A recent amendment to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure now provides a vehicle to amend a sentence. Rule 35(c) provides that: “At any time after a defendant has served at least three (3) years of a term of probation in the community, the probation unit of the department of corrections, either at a defendant’s request or administratively, may review the defendant’s case history and recommend amending the defendant’s sentence to terminate the defendant’s probation.”', '- 12 -', 'Accordingly, because Parrillo was sentenced on January 21, 1986, to a thirty-year term, and because the effect of his good-time or time-served credits reduced his period of incarceration, but did not reduce the overall length of his sentence, his sentence officially ended on January 21, 2016—thirty years later.', 'Consequently, the hearing justice committed an error of law in finding that Parrillo was not on probation at the time of the 2011 incident. Because we hold that Parrillo was on probation and subject to being adjudged a violator at the time of the 2011 incident, we must now address whether the hearing justice committed an error of law when he held that the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not bar the state from seeking to adjudge Parrillo a probation violator.', 'B', 'Equitable Estoppel', 'Parrillo argues that the state should be estopped from seeking to adjudge him a probation violator by invoking the doctrine of equitable estoppel because he relied, to his detriment, on the representation made by the DOC in the form of the 2009 letter informing him that he had completed his probationary term. Parrillo attested that he “conducted [himself] at all times as though [he] was not on probation” in reliance to the representation made. In response, the state insists that Parrillo has failed to meet the necessary elements of the equitable estoppel doctrine.', 'Necessary “to the successful invocation of the doctrine of equitable estoppel is the establishment of: ‘[F]irst, an affirmative representation or equivalent conduct on the part of the person against whom the estoppel is claimed which is directed to another for the purpose of inducing the other to act or fail to act in reliance thereon; and secondly, that such representation or conduct in fact did induce the other to act or fail to act to his', '- 13 - injury.’” Faella v.

Moreover, the applicability of equitable estoppel is dependent upon “[t]he facts and circumstances of each case.” Lerner v. Gill, 463 A.2d 1352, 1362 (R.I. 1983).', '“It must be emphasized that ‘[e]quitable estoppel is extraordinary relief, which will not be applied unless the equities clearly [are] balanced in favor of the part[y] seeking relief.’” Faella, 111 A.3d at 357 (quoting Sturbridge Home Builders, Inc. v. Downing Seaport, Inc., 890 A.2d 58, 67 (R.I. 2005)). “Indeed, ‘equitable estoppel is not a favored doctrine * * * [and should be] applied carefully and sparingly and only from necessity.

As we have previously noted, this authority is limited to the judiciary. See Rose 92 A.3d at 910-11. Accordingly, neither the administrative agent nor any member of the DOC had the power to determine when Parrillo had completed his probationary period.', 'Moreover, in Romano v. Retirement Board of the Employees Retirement System of Rhode Island, 767 A.2d 35, 37-38 (R.I. 2001), a retiree sought to invoke the equitable estoppel principle against the state which, through a retirement system counselor, had provided wrong information regarding the retiree’s retirement benefits. The retiree’s claims failed because neither the counselor nor the board’s executive director possessed any authority to “vary or contradict” state law. Id. at 39 (contrary to information the retiree received from the state employee, G.L. 1956 § 36-10-36(b) specifically provided, in relevant part, that “[p]ension payments shall be suspended” when a state retiree is employed or reemployed by a municipality).', 'Similarly, here, any statement that Parrillo’s probationary period had ended in 2009, was not only in direct contradiction to the judicially-imposed thirty-year sentence, it also contradicted §§ 42-56-24 and 12-19- 2(a), including the effect these credits had on the length of Parrillo’s sentence.', '- 15 -', 'Moreover, the only evidence before the Superior Court was the 2009 letter sent from the DOC administrative officer and Parrillo’s affidavit in which he attested that “he conducted [him]self at all times as though [he] was not on probation.” Parrillo, who bore the burden of proving the elements of equitable estoppel, presented no evidence that the DOC employee intended to induce any specific behavior on his part, nor that his conduct as it relates to the 2011 incident was somehow induced by the 2009 DOC letter. See Faella, 111 A.3d at 357. Our law is clear that no element of the equitable estoppel claim can be left to speculation, and, in any event, we agree with the hearing justice that to even attempt to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel to these facts is “absurd.” See id. It would be preposterous for Parrillo to claim that a letter informing him that his probationary period had ended in 2009 induced him to commit the alleged felony assault in 2011, let alone for him to claim that the DOC employee actually intended to induce him to commit such act as the doctrine of equitable estoppel requires.17', 'Accordingly, it is our opinion that the hearing justice’s denial of Parrillo’s equitable estoppel claim was not an error of law.', 'C', 'Due Process', 'Parrillo’s equitable estoppel argument is firmly predicated upon principles of due process. He first raised a due-process argument in his memorandum of law in opposition 17', 'Parrillo attempts to shoehorn his criminal conduct into the precepts of equitable estoppel by claiming that he “does not argue detrimental reliance on the [s]tate’s representation in committing a new crime; the detrimental reliance was that regardless of what he may have done, he would not suffer a resulting probation violation, and the consequent further punishment for an old crime–a matter wholly separate from the consequences of the underlying offense conduct.” Although we reject his efforts to invoke the doctrine of equitable estoppel, this argument may be more appropriate on remand. See Part III, C, infra.', '- 16 - to the state’s notice of probation violation submitted to the Superior Court, in which he asserted that “he ha[d] not been given fair warning that certain conduct [would] subject him to the penalty associated with a probation violation. The due process transgression [was] thus complete.” Although the hearing justice rejected Parrillo’s equitable estoppel contentions, the hearing justice did not address the due-process argument, ruling rather that Parrillo’s probationary term had terminated under the clear terms of the original sentence.', 'Before this Court, Parrillo again emphasizes the underpinnings of his estoppel argument, stating that “[t]he application of principles of estoppel in the circumstances present here is a straightforward matter of due process” and that “the principles of fundamental fairness, which include due process and fair notice, could not be more in play.”18 Because the trial court decided the case on other grounds, however, we are of the opinion that this case should be remanded to the Superior Court so that a hearing justice may address Parrillo’s contentions in the first instance, making such findings of fact and conclusions of law as he or she sees fit. We do not intend hereby to restrict the Superior Court should it deem it just to otherwise resolve this probation violation proceeding. 18', 'Parrillo also indicates that “[t]his issue was thoroughly explicated not long ago by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in Commonwealth v.

I depart from the majority’s interpretation of G.L. 1956 § 42-56-24 and G.L. 1956 § 12-19-2, and would affirm the Superior Court’s decision that Parrillo’s probation had already ended when he was charged with assault. Accordingly, I respectfully, but vigorously, dissent from the majority’s opinion.', 'A little more than two years ago, in Rose v. State, 92 A.3d 903 (R.I. 2014), this Court was faced with an issue identical to the one presented in the case at bar, except for one critical fact. In Rose, the majority held that good-time and time-served credits could act only to reduce the time a defendant spent incarcerated, but could not reduce a sentence below a statutorily imposed mandatory minimum. Id. at 908, 912. The majority in Rose specifically left for another day the issue of what to do when a defendant’s sentence is not up against a mandatory minimum. Id. at 913. That day has arrived.', 'For the same reasons set forth in my dissent in Rose—which Justice Robinson also joined—I do not agree with the majority’s opinion that extends Rose to all probationers. In Rose, I dissented because, in my opinion, the majority incorrectly interpreted two statutes: § 42-56-24 and § 12-19-2.', 'Rose, 92 A.3d at 914, 918. Specifically, it was my opinion that, when the majority interpreted § 42-56-24, it “focuse[d] on the word ‘sentence’ and equate[d] ‘sentence’ with ‘imprisonment.’” Rose,', '- 18 - 92 A.3d at 914. It was my view then, and it is now, that “nothing cited to by the majority contravene[d] my conclusion that good-time credits reduce the entirety of [the] sentence and not simply the period of incarceration.” Id. I also found fault with the majority’s interpretation of § 12-19-2 on nearly identical grounds. Rose, 92 A.3d at 919. That statute mandates that a “sentence or sentences imposed shall be reduced by the number of days spent in confinement while awaiting trial and while awaiting sentencing * * *.” Section 12-19-2(a). Like § 42-54-24, § 12-19-2 speaks of reducing the “sentence,” as opposed to the period of incarceration.', 'Now, the majority extends the holding in Rose to all probationers, finding that good-time and time-served credits do not reduce the length of a defendant’s overall sentence, irrespective of whether such a reduction would bring that sentence below a mandatory minimum. I disagree because the statutes clearly say that good-time credits should “be deducted from the term or terms of sentence of that prisoner * * *” and time- served credits should be “reduced” from the sentence.', 'Both statutes are clear and unambiguous. Notably, neither statute limits deductions or reductions to only the time of incarceration.', 'The gravamen of my dissent lies in the distinction between “sentence” and “imprisonment.” In addition to incorporating my dissent in Rose, I also observe that “sentence” is defined as “[t]he judgment that a court formally pronounces after finding a criminal defendant guilty; the punishment imposed on a criminal wrongdoer.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1569 (10th ed. 2014). Meanwhile, “imprisonment” is “[t]he act of confining a person, [especially] in a prison.” Id. at 875. Accordingly, it is my opinion that the only conclusion that can be drawn is that, when the General Assembly enacted', '- 19 - the legislation in question and used the term “sentence,” it was referring to the entirety of the judgment imposed against the defendant—i.e., both the period of incarceration and the probationary period. And, when the General Assembly referred to “imprisonment,” it spoke of only the period in which a defendant is incarcerated. Thus, when the General Assembly mandated that good-time credits be “deducted” from a defendant’s “sentence” and that a defendant’s “sentence * * * shall be reduced” by the amount of time served while awaiting trial and sentencing, I am led to what I consider to be the obvious conclusion that the General Assembly intended good-time and time-served credits to act to reduce the entirety of a defendant’s sentence, and not just that defendant’s period of incarceration.19', 'Despite my dissent in Rose, I accept, as I must, that the holding in that case is now the law in this state. Nevertheless, I do not believe that the holding in Rose is applicable here because the issue before us is simply not the same; the reductions that Parrillo received to his sentence did not bring that sentence below a mandatory minimum. The majority’s opinion in Rose was, in substantial part, driven by the conflict between G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.2, which imposed a mandatory minimum sentence, and §§ 42-56-24 and 12-19-2, the good-time and time-served statutes. Here, no such conflict exists. Accordingly, it is my opinion that the statutory interpretation that I endorsed in Rose should control; under that interpretation, Parrillo’s probation would have ended by the time of his December 2011 arrest. As a result, it is my opinion that the order of the Superior Court should be affirmed. 19', 'The majority says that the Department of Corrections has no authority to reduce a sentence, but it is the General Assembly that set the sentence by statute. Through the enactment of G.L. 1956 § 42-56-24 and G.L. 1956 § 12-19-2, the General Assembly has modified the sentence, also by statute.', '- 20 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'State v.

81,"State : v. : Jeffrey Alston, a/k/a Kam Ausar. : ORDER The defendant, Jeffrey Alston 1 (defendant or Alston), appeals from the Superior Court’s denial of his motion for a sentence reduction. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on December 4, 2013, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ arguments and memoranda, we are of the opinion that this appeal may be decided at this time without further argument or briefing. For the reasons set forth in this order, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand for further proceedings. The travel of this case has spanned over a decade. See State v. Alston, 900 A.2d 1212 (R.I. 2006) (Alston I) and State v. Alston, 47 A.3d 234 (R.I. 2012) (Alston II). The following brief history contains only those facts relevant to the instant appeal. 1 The defendant legally changed his name to “Kam Ausar.” He agreed, however, to the use of his birth name, Jeffrey Alston, at trial. In addition, the indictment and two prior opinions of this Court use defendant’s birth name. Accordingly, we refer to him here as Jeffrey Alston. -1- On July 9, 2003, a Kent County Superior Court jury convicted defendant of breaking and entering, conspiring to break and enter, and assault with a dangerous weapon. 2 The trial justice sentenced defendant to a total of seventeen years to serve. After defendant appealed to this Court, we vacated his convictions and remanded the case for a new trial. See Alston I, 900 A.2d at 1221. A second jury convicted defendant on April 7, 2008 of the same three counts. A different Superior Court justice presided over defendant’s second trial. The second trial justice sentenced defendant on August 22, 2008 to a total of forty years to serve. Alston, through counsel, appealed from his second conviction. Shortly after defendant filed the notice of appeal from his second conviction but before that appeal was docketed, he sent a handwritten letter dated August 27, 2008 to the second trial justice. With the letter, defendant enclosed a pro se motion in which he sought “to preserve his rights pursuant to Rule []35 of the Rhode Island Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.” The following handwritten notation appears on the bottom of defendant’s letter: “Relief is denied. This Court imposed the maximum sentence authorized by law. This was a case which warranted a habitual offender enhancement which was not pursued by the state. No hearing. See Rule 43.” The second trial justice’s signature and stamp appears below the note. This handwritten denial is the subject of the instant appeal. On June 22, 2012, this Court affirmed defendant’s second conviction. See Alston II, 47 A.3d at 251. In that opinion, we ordered that the instant appeal be docketed separately from Alston’s appeal of his conviction. See id. at 241 n.13. Thereafter, on October 3, 2012, while the 2 The defendant was also convicted of a fourth count, assault and battery with serious injury resulting. Sometime before sentencing, however, the trial justice dismissed this count on the grounds that it was duplicative of the third count, assault with a dangerous weapon. On remand, defendant was tried on only the first three counts. -2- instant appeal was still pending, defendant filed another motion to reduce his sentence under Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. On February 28, 2013, a third Superior Court justice denied defendant’s second Rule 35 motion. The defendant’s sole contention in this appeal is that the second trial justice deprived him of his right to a hearing on his motion for a sentence reduction. Rule 35 is silent on a movant’s right to a hearing. Nonetheless, we have stressed the “importance of the right to a hearing in most situations where significant liberty * * * interests are involved.” State v. Brown, 865 A.2d 334, 334 n.2 (R.I. 2005) (mem.). We have therefore instructed on more than one occasion that, “although Rule 35 does not explicitly afford the movant a right to a hearing, ‘a hearing should be held with respect to such motions absent truly exceptional considerations.’” State v. Chase, 958 A.2d 147, 148 (R.I. 2008) (mem.) (quoting Brown, 865 A.2d at 334 n.2). Nothing in the second trial justice’s handwritten note suggests that there were truly exceptional considerations justifying his decision to forgo a hearing on defendant’s motion. Thus, the second trial justice erred when he denied defendant’s Rule 35 motion without affording defendant a hearing. The state argues, however, that the issue of defendant’s right to a hearing is moot because defendant received a hearing on his second Rule 35 motion. Indeed, defendant acknowledged at oral argument that he received a full and fair hearing on his second motion. In light of this acknowledgement, we would ordinarily agree with the state’s assertion that this issue is moot. The travel of this case, however, has been anything but ordinary; and, for procedural reasons, we must disagree with the state. Even though the third trial justice rightfully afforded the defendant the hearing to which he was entitled, we are constrained to conclude that the third justice lacked jurisdiction to entertain the defendant’s motion at that time. Due to our express direction in Alston II that the -3- instant appeal be docketed separately, the papers and jurisdiction remained with this Court following our affirmation of Alston’s second conviction. Consequently, jurisdiction never returned to the Superior Court. Since the Superior Court was not vested with jurisdiction at the time that the third trial justice heard Alston’s second Rule 35 motion, that hearing cannot properly be said to have rendered the instant appeal moot. Accordingly, the second trial justice’s failure to afford the defendant a hearing requires us to vacate the judgment denying the defendant’s first Rule 35 motion. This matter is remanded to the Superior Court with the instruction to hold a hearing on the defendant’s motion to reduce his sentence.
