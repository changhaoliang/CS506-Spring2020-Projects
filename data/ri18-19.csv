0,"Glen Hebert et al. : v. : The City of Woonsocket, by and through : its Mayor, Lisa Baldelli-Hunt, et al.",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendants, the City of Woonsocket and the Woonsocket Budget Commission (the WBC) (collectively, the City), appeal from a decision and judgment of the Superior Court that granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, a number of retired Woonsocket police officers. The trial court restrained the City from changing the terms of the plaintiffs’ retiree health insurance. On appeal, the City argues that the trial justice erred by finding the following: (1) that the plaintiffs had a vested contractual right to free lifetime health benefits for themselves and their beneficiaries; (2) that the WBC was not empowered with the statutory authority to make changes to the plaintiffs’ health care benefits; (3) that the WBC violated the Contract Clause of the Rhode Island Constitution when it required the plaintiffs to pay for their health insurance under a new uniform health care plan applicable to', '-1- all retirees and employees; and (4) that the plaintiffs established that they suffered irreparable harm. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The essential facts of this case, which are largely undisputed, are as follows. Within the past two decades, the City of Woonsocket has fallen on hard times.', 'The City has been designated as one of Rhode Island’s seven “distressed communities,” defined as those having the “highest property tax burdens relative to the wealth of taxpayers.”', 'General Laws 1956 § 45-13-12. In fact, as of 2012, 19.9 percent of its families lived in poverty, compared with the state average of 9.7 percent; the median household income was $34,518, compared with the state average of $54,900; 72 percent of its students were eligible for a subsidized lunch, compared to just 46 percent for the state average; and 64.9 percent of its students graduated from high school in four years, compared with the state average of 77.1 percent. Moreover, from 2000 to 2010, the City’s population declined by 4.7 percent, a time during which the state’s population increased by 0.7 percent. The trend was equally distressing in foreclosure rates: in 2009 alone, the City’s foreclosure rate was 3.6 percent, more than double the state’s rate of 1.54 percent. Ominously, major retailers such as Walmart, Lowe’s, and Staples had all left the City.', 'The City’s fiscal woes, perhaps hidden from view, began years earlier, however, when it was confronted with unfunded pension obligations. In 2002, the City faced a pension liability of $81,203,910, but it had only $2,172,718 in assets, or a dangerous 2.68 percent of full funding. In response to the pension woes of Woonsocket and several other communities, the General Assembly enacted legislation—Public Laws 2002, ch. 10—that authorized the City to issue up to $90 million in pension bonds, to be amortized over a thirty year period. See P.L. 2002, ch. 10, §', '-2- 1. The law required, however, that if the City’s pension plan then fell below 100 percent funding, the City was required to eliminate that shortfall within five years and return the funding to 100 percent. See id. at § 8.', 'The bonds that were sold under authority of the legislation replenished the City’s pension back to 100 percent funding, but when the Great Recession struck, the pension fund value again declined. 1 In the five year period from July 1, 2007, through July 1, 2012, the fund’s assets dropped from $90,034,746 to $55,902,219, which caused the assets-to-liabilities ratio to fall below 60 percent and required immediate action under state law. 2', 'In fiscal year 2008, the City was able to contribute only $32,100 of the $2,470,633 that was required by the law; in fiscal year 2010, only $15,612 of the required $7,643,873; and in fiscal year 2012, only $1,006,677 of the required $10,545,371.', 'That was not the only source of fiscal bad news for Woonsocket. The Great Recession also caused the state to impose budget cuts in municipal aid, which had a direct and disastrous impact on the City’s finances. Between 2007 and 2011, the state decreased the City’s general revenue sharing and state aid by a staggering $13,164,929, or 22.3 percent. Indeed, in total, the City lost $54,467,452 in state aid from 2007 to 2013. Further, the Woonsocket Education Department was receiving fewer state education funds than it had received in fiscal year 2007, 1', 'The Great Recession occurred during the mid to late 2000s. It began when the United States housing market crashed and large amounts of mortgage-backed securities and derivatives lost significant value. See In re Fannie Mae 2008 Securities Litigation, 742 F. Supp. 2d 382, 391 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). The housing market crash spiraled into a global phenomenon, drastically affecting countless markets and was considered to be the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. See Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Nomura Holding America, Inc., 104 F. Supp. 3d 441, 538-39 (S.D.N.Y. 2015); City of Roseville Employees’ Retirement System v. Sterling Financial Corporation, 963 F. Supp. 2d 1092, 1101 (E.D. Wash. 2013). 2', 'The fund was also classified as being under “critical status” as defined by the Rhode Island Retirement Security Act, which is defined “as of the beginning of the plan year, a plan’s funded percentage for such plan year is less than sixty percent (60%).” General Laws 1956 § 45-65-4(3).', '-3- even though the state had initiated a gradual phase-in of increased educational funding in 2012.3 As a result of the decreased funding, the City’s budget deficit increased from $197,178 for fiscal year 2008 to $12,247,266 for fiscal year 2010.', 'The record reveals that the City took drastic measures to address its undeniable fiscal crisis. It increased taxes to the maximum permitted under state law and exceeded that maximum by taxing at or above the statutory 4 percent levy cap for most years between 2008 to 2012; it also had the highest average increase in property tax levies over this period among any of the City’s comparable benchmark communities, at 6.44 percent. 4 Moreover, the City imposed a trash collection fee in an effort to generate approximately $1 million annually in revenue, and negotiated payments in lieu of taxes with certain local property owners to generate an additional $3.2 million annually.', 'On the expenditure side of its budget, the City also attempted to reduce its obligations by closing a school, turning off street lights, and abandoning all projects to rebuild its infrastructure and replace equipment except those that required emergency repairs. It also cut back on its contributions to the pension fund, the consequences of which were exacerbated by the reduction in state aid as well as the decline in pension investment income caused by a battered stock market. Even with these actions, however, drastic by any measure, the City continued to experience a budget deficit of roughly $2.5 million.', 'The struggling City sought and received concessions from many of the collective bargaining units that represented its employees. The police union agreed to reduce staff and lower its expected wage increase. Additionally, it agreed that new hires would be required to 3', 'State education aid did not return to its pre-recession level, in absolute dollar terms, until fiscal year 2014. 4', 'In addition to Woonsocket, the benchmark communities are Central Falls, Cranston, East Providence, Johnston, North Providence, Pawtucket, and West Warwick.', '-4- make copayments on their health insurance and, for the first time, that new hires would contribute a 20 percent copayment on health insurance premiums after retirement.', 'The firefighters union similarly agreed to reduce minimum staffing, implement a twenty- four hour shift, revamp its health care plan design, and use civilians for dispatch services in lieu of firefighters. Those measures with the firefighters union saved over $3.5 million for the City over its three year contract period. That, however, did not end the City’s efforts. Woonsocket laid off eleven firefighters in 2009 and was forced to briefly “brownout” a ladder truck in 2010.', 'Finally, the Woonsocket Education Department unions, which already had made concessions to reduce the City’s health care coverage contributions for teachers, paraprofessionals, and other nonteaching personnel, also agreed that their members would make 10 to 20 percent co-share contributions to health insurance costs under a deductible plan similar to a plan that had been accepted by the firefighters union. The teachers also did not receive a salary increase for four years and they gave up altogether a deferred payment that had previously been negotiated for in lieu of a salary increase. Other municipal unions agreed to contribute to health care costs, suspend wage increases for an additional two years, and eliminate positions.', 'The record reveals that those concessions, as far reaching as they were, did not eliminate the budget deficit and, in April 2010, Moody’s Investor Services downgraded the City’s bond rating to non-investment-grade Ba1, or what is more commonly referred to as “junk bond status.” In an effort to further reduce the deficit, the City, in July 2010, issued $11.5 million in deficit reduction bonds, obligating itself to very high interest rates as a result of its poor bond rating. Although that bond issuance may have resulted in an improved cash flow, it also carried the natural consequence of increasing the City’s cumulative debt load to a staggering total of $192,815,937 in fiscal year 2012. At that time, the City’s debt ratio was 14.24 percent of', '-5- equalized weighted assessed valuations. That was by far the highest in the state; the state average was only 1.47 percent.', 'Adding fuel to an already blazing fire, in fiscal year 2010, the Woonsocket Education Department experienced a $3 million deficit. By June 2012, that deficit had increased to nearly $9.78 million, leaving the City with a cumulative unassigned fund deficit of $7.146 million. The City sought authorization from the General Assembly to impose up to $6.6 million in a supplemental tax, but that proposal was not passed by the legislature. Payroll checks began to be dishonored, and the City’s school committee contemplated ending the school year early because it was simply running out of money.', 'By the end of fiscal year 2012, the City was responsible for bills surpassing $10.2 million in total, nearly $4 million of which was more than ninety days overdue. At the same time, the City pension fund for retired police officers and firefighters who were not members of the Municipal Employees Retirement System (MERS) fell into “critical status” as defined by the Retirement Security Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 65 of title 45, which required the City to enact a plan that would enable it to emerge from that status within twenty years. This burden was in addition to the already existing requirement that the City comply with the previously enacted legislation allowing it to borrow $90 million so that it could replenish the pension fund to full funding within five years. To comply with both of those state laws, the City needed to make an annual pension fund contribution of $11,615,000 for each fiscal year from 2013 to 2017. As former Mayor Leo Fontaine elaborated, the situation had turned into a “perfect storm of problems” that the City could not survive without assistance. By that point in time, it is no exaggeration to conclude that the City was in a fiscal death spiral.', '-6-', 'In May 2012, the City requested, and the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue appointed, a budget commission, the WBC, under the Fiscal Stability Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 9 of title 45 (the FSA). The WBC determined that, if the City maintained its status quo, it would face a cumulative budget deficit of $105.5 million by the end of fiscal year 2017. The WBC requested and received advancements in state aid that totaled $3,148,621 into June 2012, $12,422,538 into July 2012, and another $12,799,650 into July 2013, to allocate to the City’s education department. It then tried without success to obtain authorization to impose another supplemental tax, and it worked with vendors to prevent a termination of services, including health insurance.', 'In accordance with the FSA, the WBC developed a five year plan. The WBC’s five year plan first increased revenues in the City in three ways: (1) the General Assembly approved a maximum $2.5 million supplemental property tax for fiscal year 2013; (2) there was a 4 percent levy increase for fiscal year 2014; and (3) the City reduced the homestead exemption for single- family/condominium owner-occupied homes, two-family homes, and three-family homes. Those measures increased the property tax bill for owners of single-family/condominium owner- occupied homes by 22.9 percent in one year. As a result, the City had the highest residential and commercial tax rates among the eight benchmark communities, as well as the highest effective tax rate and the highest median family income tax rate. Additionally, it also had the second highest per capita income adjusted tax rate and the second highest owner-occupied single-family residential effective tax rate among the eight benchmark communities.', 'Next, the WBC reduced staffing and reorganized municipal departments.', 'The City represents that, in fiscal year 2014, the City maintained a complement of eighty-six police officers, far below the prior contractual mandate of 101. That single change saved $1,124,756 in', '-7- fiscal year 2014. Likewise, for fiscal years 2015 through 2018, the City indicates that it reduced the staff of the fire department to 110 employees, below the then contractual mandate of 117, thereby reducing expenditures by $400,000 to $500,000 annually.', 'The City also replaced firefighters who had been serving as dispatchers with lesser paid municipal employees, resulting in an annual savings of over $1 million in fiscal years 2016, 2017, and 2018.', 'The five year plan also reformed the City’s health benefit plans, which accounted for approximately 13 percent of the City’s overall budget in fiscal year 2012. Before the five year plan went into effect, the City had administered nineteen different health care plans for employees and retirees, which contained a wide range of benefits and employee contributions. As part of the five year plan, the WBC chose a single uniform plan for all city employees and retirees (the Uniform Plan). The Uniform Plan required point of delivery charges for certain services and prescription drugs, also known as “co-pays,” and payment of a deductible for other services, up to an annual maximum of $500 under an individual plan and $1,000 for a family plan. According to the City, the Uniform Plan provided the same or better access to a national network of health care providers than had been provided previously.', 'From September 2012 through November 2013, the WBC negotiated and secured concessions, including health care concessions, from all seven of the City’s bargaining units. 5 From that point forward, all employees were required to contribute to the cost of their health care coverage by making a monthly co-share payment. The City saved, from employee health care reform alone, $1,149,172 for fiscal year 2014; $1,369,294 for fiscal year 2015; $1,538,464 for fiscal year 2016; and $1,707,332 for fiscal year 2017. 5', 'With respect to the police and firefighter unions, the WBC implemented changes through resolution, and the City represents that those terms were eventually integrated into their respective collective bargaining agreements.', '-8-', 'The WBC then went one step further and modified the health care coverage of the retirees. The plaintiffs are former Woonsocket police officers who retired before the WBC was appointed.', 'While they were working, plaintiffs had been represented by the International Brotherhood of Police Officers Local 404 (the union), which negotiated salaries and retirement benefits on their behalf. Over the years, the City and the union had entered into numerous collective bargaining agreements, but the last collective bargaining agreement that had been agreed upon between the City and the union before the WBC was appointed was in effect from July 1, 2002, through June 30, 2005 (the 2002-2005 CBA). Significantly, the 2002-2005 CBA provided the following:', '“4.2 The City shall pay the entire cost of Major medical, plus', 'student rider coverage, and $2 Co-Pay Drug Program, for all', 'members of the IBPO Local 404 on active service in City', 'employment and including those members placed on disability or', 'retirement pension after July 1, 1981.', '“* * *', '“4.5 The City shall pay the entire cost, including family coverage,', 'applicable where an employee has a family within Blue Cross', 'definition, for an employee, covered by this Agreement, placed on', 'disability or retirement pension list after July 1, 1981 and the', 'semi-private plan of the Rhode Island Hospital Service', 'Corporation (Blue Cross) and also the Rhode Island Medical', 'Society Physicians, Service Plan 100 in accordance with the rules', 'and regulations of such corporation. The City shall pay the cost of', 'Major Medical for said retirees.', 'Said coverage may be', 'temporarily suspended by the City in avoidance of dual coverage if', 'equal or greater benefits are provided through any other means to', 'said retiree.” (Emphasis added.) From the expiration of the 2002-2005 CBA until 2010, the relevant portions of the 2002-2005 CBA were incorporated by binding interest arbitration awards pursuant to the Municipal Police', '-9- Arbitration Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 9.2 of title 28. 6 In 2010, the union and the City came to a tentative agreement whereby, effective August 15, 2010, any police officer hired after that date would be required to contribute to the cost of his or her health insurance.', 'The tentative agreement also provided that, when police officers who are hired after August 15, 2010 retire, they would continue to be required to contribute to their health insurance costs. The tentative agreement was ratified by the Woonsocket City Council in September 2010 and expired on June 30, 2012.', 'On March 19, 2013, the WBC adopted a resolution, which stated, in pertinent part:', '“Absent agreement to the contrary between the Budget', 'Commission and retiree representatives, all health insurance', 'benefits currently provided to retirees of the City * * * and their', 'beneficiaries, who are not yet eligible or who are ineligible for', 'Medicare benefits shall change, effective July 1, 2013, to [the', 'Uniform Plan] for all City employees and retirees and their', 'beneficiaries, other than those eligible for Medicare, and the City', 'shall cover eighty percent (80%) of the cost, and the retiree, twenty', '(20%) of the cost of such [Uniform Plan] * * *.” That resolution was amended in June 2013. The amendment afforded all retirees the option to join an alternative health care plan with a reduced co-share (10 percent) but a higher deductible ($2,000 for the individual plan, $4,000 for the family plan) than the Uniform Plan (the Alternative Plan). The resolution was amended again in July 2013 and December 2014 to give effect to negotiated agreements with fire and police retirees. 7 Those resolutions reduced the co- share requirements of the Uniform Plan and Alternative Plan from 20 and 10 percent, respectively, to zero percent by fiscal year 2018. In other words, effective July 1, 2017, and thereafter, no police or fire retiree, including plaintiffs, would be required to make any co-share 6', 'Hereafter, all collective bargaining agreements and interest arbitration awards will collectively be referred to as “the CBAs.” 7', 'Hereafter, the resolution adopted on March 19, 2013, and all amendments that follow will collectively be referred to as “the Retiree Resolutions.”', '- 10 - contribution. Through these changes alone, the City saved $2.3 million in fiscal year 2014. Approximately half of those savings came from changes to the police retirees’ health care coverage.', 'Additionally, the WBC, in the Retiree Resolutions, suspended all cost of living adjustments (COLAs) on pension benefits provided to the police and fire retirees and their beneficiaries who were participants in the City’s pension plan. 8 The suspension of COLA benefits, effective July 1, 2013, was projected to save the City $1,515,000 annually for fiscal years 2014 through 2017. The WBC also secured an amendment to the 2002 pension bond enactment that allowed for a period of an additional twenty years for amortization if the pension plan fell below full funding. That action saved the City $5,504,000 each fiscal year from 2014 to 2017. Together, the actions on pension reform lowered the City’s projected annual required contribution to $3,465,000 for fiscal years 2014 through 2017, from its previous projected contribution for that time period of $11,615,000. 9', 'In total, the five year plan generated an average of approximately $13 million in annual savings for the City from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2017 and, if substance followed form, it was anticipated that the City’s cumulative operating deficit would be eliminated by fiscal year 2017. Furthermore, the five year plan assumed that the City would continue to make contributions of more than $3.6 million in fiscal years 2014 through 2017 to pay its other post- employment benefits (OPEB). As of July 1, 2013, the City’s unfunded OPEB liability had been 8', 'According to the City, any firefighter who was hired after July 1, 1985, and any police officer hired after July 1, 1980, participated in the Municipal Employees Retirement System (MERS) and was not affected by this action. 9', 'The annual contribution was projected to rise, however, to $3,925,000 starting in fiscal year 2018.', '- 11 - $224,446,589, the most of any municipality in the state. By following the five year plan, however, the City would be able to reduce that deficit to $117,549,866.', 'It is the City’s position that the $2.3 million savings from altering the retiree health care benefit plans was necessary, and removing it from the five year plan would have “risked disruption of the delicate balance, and the collapse of the comprehensive effort.” It cites for support the trial testimony of the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue, Rosemary Booth Gallogly, who testified at trial as an expert in municipal finance and said that she did not believe there was any other way for the City to have saved $2.3 million other than by altering plaintiffs’ health insurance plans. 10', 'On July 2, 2013, the day after the City implemented the new health insurance plans for the retirees, plaintiffs filed their complaint in Superior Court, seeking injunctive and declaratory relief. The plaintiffs claimed that the City had contractually promised to pay the entire cost of their health care coverage in accordance with the CBAs that were in effect at the time of their retirement. Preliminary injunction hearings commenced soon thereafter, which entailed ten days of testimony over diverse dates from August 2013 through February 2014.', 'The parties conducted discovery and submitted more than one hundred exhibits and affidavits.', 'The trial justice heard testimony from Mayor Fontaine, former school committee and city council member John Ward, and Director Gallogly, all of whom testified as to the narrative above. Additionally, six plaintiffs—retired police officers Glen Hebert, Scott Strickland, Ronald Tetreau, Daniel Turgeon, Steven Nowak, and Earl Ledoux—testified at the preliminary injunction hearing that they had retired before the WBC had been appointed and, importantly, with the firm understanding that they would, under the terms of the CBAs in effect at the time of 10', 'Director Gallogly testified that, in addition to appointing the commission, she attended most of the meetings and was involved in developing the WBC’s five year plan.', '- 12 - their respective retirements, receive free health care for the rest of their lives. Mr. Strickland testified that he could not afford to pay the increased costs of the new health care plan, and Mr. Ledoux said that, with the new health care plan in place, his health care costs had increased by approximately $7,000 per year because he and his children were having personal health issues.', 'In July 2015, approximately one and one-half years after the last preliminary injunction hearing date, and while the decision on the preliminary injunction was still pending, plaintiffs moved to restrain the termination of their health care benefits. The plaintiffs claimed that the City threatened to terminate plaintiffs’ health care benefits because they had not paid any co- share contributions. The trial justice ordered that only those plaintiffs who were receiving disability pensions or those who were earning less than 300 percent of the federal poverty level would be absolved from paying any co-shares or deductibles until a final decision was issued. According to the City, seven plaintiffs fell under this classification and were thus exempt from paying their health care insurance.', 'Approximately two years after the preliminary injunction hearings, in February 2016, the trial justice rendered a decision in this difficult case, and granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. 11 He found that the City and plaintiffs entered into multiple contracts in 11', 'We note that the trial justice did not “order the trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing of the application” for a preliminary injunction, as provided under Rule 65(a)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. “The decision whether or not to consolidate the hearing for preliminary relief with a trial on the merits is left to the sound discretion of the trial justice who may order consolidation and advancement in any appropriate manner as long as his [or her] order protects the parties’ rights to a full hearing on the merits.” Richards v. Halder, 853 A.2d 1206, 1211 (R.I. 2004) (brackets omitted) (quoting Oster v. Restrepo, 448 A.2d 1268, 1270 (R.I. 1982)). Importantly, “[t]he parties are not prejudiced if they have received adequate notice and sufficient time to prepare for consolidation and advancement.” Id. It is our opinion that a trial on the merits should have been advanced and consolidated with the hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction in accordance with Rule 65(a)(2). Nonetheless, the parties have agreed that, because a final judgment has been entered, this Court should treat the preliminary injunction as a permanent injunction. We agree. See', '- 13 - which the City promised to pay for all of plaintiffs’ health insurance and that of their dependents. According to the trial justice, many police officers, including those who testified, “retired based on the contracts’ assurances of continued coverage.” He determined that the City was not vested with the statutory authority under the FSA to alter plaintiffs’ health care benefits. He further found that the City had violated the Contract Clause of the Rhode Island Constitution.12 Specifically, the trial justice held that the City’s alterations to the health insurance benefits provisions constituted a substantial impairment to plaintiffs’ existing contracts. Although the trial justice found that the City had demonstrated that it was in a precarious financial condition when the contractual promises were modified, he also held that “the situation was not necessarily dire” because “[t]he City could not demonstrate that it was on the verge of bankruptcy” and “[a] receiver had not been appointed.” The court reasoned that “[t]he deprivations to the retirees were too broad and too deep to render them of a character appropriate to the public purpose.” As a result, the trial justice determined that plaintiffs had successfully proven a likelihood of success on the merits of their Contract Clause claim.', 'The trial justice further found that injunctive relief was necessary to prevent irreparable harm to plaintiffs because they had “demonstrated that their access to necessary health care [was] threatened by Defendants’ modification of their health care benefits[.]” He also held that the equities favored plaintiffs because the City had participated in the creation of its own fiscal Gregory v.

By treating the trial justice’s decision as the granting of a permanent injunction, we may now “resolve the underlying substantive issues” as we normally would “after the imposition of a permanent injunction.” Gianfrancesco v.

Finally, the trial justice found that preserving the status quo would necessitate granting the preliminary injunction and requiring the City to pay for plaintiffs’ health care benefits. He thus reinstated the postretirement health care benefits as they had been enumerated in the 2002-2005 CBA. 13 The City filed a timely notice of appeal. 14', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court will reverse the decision of a trial justice to grant or deny a permanent injunction only when it can be shown that the trial justice misapplied the law, misconceived or overlooked material evidence or made factual findings that were clearly wrong.” Pelletier v.

Because the trial justice grouped all of those findings under the “likelihood of success on the merits” element of an injunction, we will focus our analysis on that prong.', '- 16 -', 'A', 'Vested Contractual Right to Free Lifetime Health Benefits', 'The City first argues that the trial justice erred when he held that plaintiffs had a vested right to immutable lifetime health care benefits, at no cost, by way of the CBAs that had been negotiated on their behalf with the City. The City claims that such a right could not vest because the CBAs relied on by plaintiffs were, in fact, void ab initio. 15', 'We held in Arena v. City of Providence, 919 A.2d 379 (R.I. 2007), that “‘the right to deferred compensation vests upon meeting the terms of employment, but that vesting is subject to divestment because it is conditioned on continued honorable and faithful service.’ Therefore, in Rhode Island, pension benefits vest once an employee honorably and faithfully meets the applicable pension statute’s requirements.” Arena, 919 A.2d at 393 (brackets omitted) (quoting In re Almeida, 611 A.2d 1375, 1386 (R.I. 1992)).', 'In Arena, the source of the plaintiffs’ retirement benefits was not a collective bargaining agreement because there had been no agreement in existence at the time the plaintiffs retired. Id. at 391. The plaintiffs argued, unsuccessfully, that the terms of the collective bargaining agreement that had expired the year prior to their retirement should govern the gap between the prior agreement’s expiration and the effective date of the following collective bargaining agreement. Id.

Id. at 393. Significantly, that ordinance had been amended in the years 15', 'With all due respect to our concurring colleagues, we believe that this issue should be addressed. The issue was raised before the trial justice and should have been decided at trial. It is the primary issue raised by the City on appeal, and the City has thoroughly briefed and argued the matter.

Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 318 F.3d 599, 604, 605 (4th Cir. 2003).', 'Therefore, in the case before us now, we must look to the CBAs in existence at the time of plaintiffs’ retirement to determine what rights they were entitled to under the agreements. The City maintains, however, that those agreements cannot be the source of the health care rights sought by plaintiffs because those agreements were void ab initio. In reaching that conclusion, the City relies on the well settled principle in this state that “any contract made by a governmental authority involving the performance of a governmental function that extends beyond the unexpired terms of the governmental officials executing the contract is void because such an agreement improperly ties the hands of subsequent officials.” Rhode Island Student Loan Authority v. NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d 624, 626 (R.I. 1988); see Parent v. Woonsocket Housing Authority, 87 R.I. 444, 447, 143 A.2d 146, 147 (1958) (“[L]egislative bodies and municipal agencies having legislative powers may not by contract impair or prevent a succeeding body or agency from exercising a legislative or governmental function.”). The City argues that the CBAs in question related to the performance of police officers’ authority to enforce the laws of this state, and therefore “involv[ed] the performance of a governmental function[.]” NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d at 626. The City further argues that, to the extent that those CBAs were effective for a period extending past the unexpired terms of the members of the Woonsocket City Council, the CBAs “tie[d] the hands of subsequent officials” and were thus void. Id.', 'Before we grapple with this difficult question, we believe it wise to define certain terms. A “governmental function” is “a function so intertwined with governing that the government is', '- 18 - obligated to perform it only by its own agents or employees.” 16 Xavier v. Cianci, 479 A.2d 1179, 1182 (R.I. 1984). Governmental functions typically “involve[] a high degree of discretion such as governmental planning or political decision making.” Roach v. State, 157 A.3d 1042, 1051 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Catone v. Medberry, 555 A.2d 328, 333 (R.I. 1989)).', 'In contrast, “‘[p]roprietary’ functions are those ‘actions normally performed by private individuals.’” Roach, 157 A.3d at 1052 (quoting Graff v. Motta, 695 A.2d 486, 489 (R.I. 1997)). Indeed, proprietary functions are essentially the inverse of governmental functions, and this Court has defined them as such, saying that “a ‘proprietary function’ [is] ‘one which is not so intertwined with governing that the government is obligated to perform it only by its own agents or employees.’” Id. (quoting Lepore v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 524 A.2d 574, 575 (R.I. 1987)).', 'The distinction between governmental functions and proprietary functions is important to the case before us because, as we have noted supra, “any contract made by a governmental authority involving the performance of a governmental function that extends beyond the unexpired terms of the governmental officials executing the contract is void because such an agreement improperly ties the hands of subsequent officials.” NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d at 626. On the other hand, “if the contract merely involves a proprietary function of a governmental body, its validity is upheld and may bind successors for as long a period as is necessary to accomplish the contract’s goal.” Id. Therefore, if we determine that the CBA provisions that provided health care benefits to plaintiffs were executed in furtherance of a governmental function and that they “extend[ed] beyond the unexpired terms of the governmental officials executing the contract[s,]” 16', 'Determining whether a governmental function exists also can be critical when examining the public duty doctrine, which “immunizes the state from ‘tort liability arising out of discretionary governmental actions that by their nature are not ordinarily performed by private persons.’”', 'Roach v.

Id. On the other hand, if we determine that the CBAs were executed in furtherance of a proprietary function, then we will uphold them so long as those contracts lasted no longer than was “necessary to accomplish the contract’s goal.” Id.', 'We have recognized “the somewhat murky nature of deciphering when the state executes a proprietary versus a governmental function.” Roach, 157 A.3d at 1053. That miasma thickens further when we consider that “a governmental entity can exercise both governmental and proprietary functions.” NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d at 627. That said, however “murky” the distinction, “[i]n both inquiries, this Court pinpoints the function at issue and examines whether it is so significantly tied to governing that private persons or entities could not possibly fulfill it.” Roach, 157 A.3d at 1053.', 'In Parent, we considered a contract between the Woonsocket Housing Authority and an attorney named Parent, whereby Parent “agreed to perform ‘all and necessary legal services for a period of five years[.]’” Parent, 87 R.I. at 447, 143 A.2d at 147 (deletion omitted). Unfortunately for Parent, that five year term extended beyond the terms of some members of the housing authority, whose terms of office were staggered so that one member stepped down and a new member was added to the authority every year. Id. at 446, 143 A.2d at 146.', 'After determining that the housing authority had “a dual nature which partakes of a public as well as a private character[,]” we held that Parent had been employed to carry out a governmental function because the housing authority depended on him to carry out some of its many duties which were governmental in character, such as the exercise of its investigatory power and its power of eminent domain. Id. at 448, 449, 143 A.2d at 148.', '- 20 -', 'In contrast, we found the contract at issue in NELS to have been executed in furtherance of a proprietary function. NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d at 627. As we explained in that case, the Rhode Island Student Loan Authority (RISLA) was created by the General Assembly to purchase federal and state guaranteed student loans from lenders, thereby increasing the cash available to those lenders with which lenders could make additional student loans. Id. at 625. RISLA’s management was vested in a board of five members, appointed by the governor, whose terms of office were staggered. Id.', 'The defendant, NELS, Inc., entered into an agreement with RISLA in 1984, under the terms of which NELS agreed to service student loans that the loan authority had purchased, for a fifteen year period, the usual length of time it took to pay off a student loan in that decade, beginning in 1984. NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d at 625-26.', 'That fifteen year period necessarily exceeded the five year terms of RISLA’s board members and, for one reason or another, RISLA filed a declaratory judgment action seeking a declaration that the servicing agreement was void, on the basis that governmental authorities cannot enter into contracts for the performance of a governmental function that bind the hands of subsequent officials. Id. at 626. RISLA’s argument was based on “the Legislature’s description of the powers conferred upon RISLA as ‘a performance of an essential governmental function of the state for public purposes.’” Id. at 626- 27 (brackets omitted). We determined, however, that “such a determination is reserved by our State Constitution for the judicial, rather than the legislative, branch of government.” Id. at 627. We further held that “the particular facet of RISLA’s operations that NELS covers is clearly proprietary.” Id. Significantly, we determined that NELS “could neither exercise discretion nor set policy in the performance of its duties.” Id.', '- 21 -', 'Having determined that NELS was performing a proprietary function, we had only to decide “whether the contract binds RISLA for a period of time longer than necessary to accomplish its purposes.” See NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d at 627.', 'We held that the servicing agreement’s duration was proper because the contract “extend[ed] no longer than the usual time span for which a student loan is outstanding[.]” Id.', 'In our opinion, it is clear that the CBAs at issue in the case before us now are closer in kind to the agreement at issue in NELS than to the employment contract in Parent. In Parent, the employment contract at issue authorized Parent to assist in the performance of duties that were clearly governmental in nature, such as the exercise of the housing authority’s investigatory power and its power of eminent domain. Parent, 87 R.I. at 449, 143 A.2d at 148. That contract necessarily empowered Parent to exercise a certain amount of discretion in how to carry out his duties, and it was impermissible to afford Parent that discretion beyond the terms of those members of the board who had deemed it advisable to hire him. See id.', 'We find no such grant of authority in the CBAs before us. The fact that the CBAs relate to the employment of police officers by a municipality is not dispositive. We must examine the contracts before us, as a whole, to “pinpoint[] the function at issue and examine[] whether it is so significantly tied to governing that private persons or entities could not possibly fulfill it.” Roach, 157 A.3d at 1053. Having examined the CBAs before us, it is clear that the function at issue does not “involve[] a high degree of discretion such as governmental planning or political decision making.” Id. at 1051 (quoting Catone, 555 A.2d at 333). At issue in the CBAs before us are the benefits packages, providing contractual rights to health care and other benefits that have been negotiated for by the police unions with the City of Woonsocket. They have nothing to do with the manner in which the City or the police enforce the law. It cannot be disputed that', '- 22 - private companies also routinely enter into agreements for the provision of employee benefits. Such bargaining, and the resulting contract, is thus an “action[] normally performed by private individuals.” 17 Id. at 1052 (quoting Graff, 695 A.2d at 489). We thus hold that the provision of health care benefits to retirees in the CBAs before us is a function that is proprietary in nature.', 'That being said, we must also determine whether the contracts at issue lasted no longer than was “necessary to accomplish the contract[s’] goal[s].” NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d at 626. All of the CBAs at issue in this case were in effect for various periods of no more than three years. That three year period is typical for collective bargaining agreements of this type, and, because of that short duration, frequent renegotiations occurred between the bargaining unit and the City of Woonsocket. 18 See § 28-9.2-6 (requiring that collective bargaining agreements between a city and a police bargaining agent not exceed a term of three years). The provision did not bind the City for a period of time longer than necessary to accomplish its purpose, which was to settle labor relations for a three year period. See id.', 'Therefore, we are of the opinion that the provisions of the CBAs at issue were valid and that plaintiffs’ rights to the postretirement health care benefits had vested. 17', 'To be clear, our decision today is based on the provisions of the CBAs actually before us in this case. It is conceivable that other collective bargaining agreements might provide for the exercise of governmental functions or might extend beyond the time period necessary to accomplish the agreements’ purposes. When conducting our inquiry into the governmental or proprietary nature of a contract, our review is limited to the contents of the contract or contracts actually before us, and it is from there that the Court “pinpoints the function at issue and examines whether it is so significantly tied to governing that private persons or entities could not possibly fulfill it.” Roach, 157 A.3d at 1053. 18', 'We note that the focus of our inquiry is on the length of time the contracts were in effect, and not on the length of the benefits provided for in the contracts. Retirement benefits are often, by their nature, lifetime benefits, and the contours of those benefits are subject to give and take negotiations every three years. That is the period provided for in G.L. 1956 § 28-9.2-6, and we do not believe that period to be unreasonable.', '- 23 -', 'B', 'Statutory Authority under the Fiscal Stability Act', 'The City next argues that the trial justice erred when he found that the WBC lacked statutory authority when it adopted the Retiree Resolutions that required plaintiffs to contribute to their health care expenses. The trial justice determined that “[t]here was no specific power given in the broadly worded § 45-9-9 or § 45-9-6 to unilaterally alter existing contracts or to alter contract rights given to retired employees.” However, the City contends that the statute’s plain and unambiguous language provides the WBC with necessarily broad and expansive powers and that the statute did not limit the WBC’s authority to adopt the Retiree Resolutions.', '“We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.” Mello v.

However, rating agencies informed state officials at that time that, should a receivership occur, capital markets would view debt financing to other Rhode Island cities and towns as extremely risky, which would in turn raise the price of such financing for all Rhode Island municipalities. Id. at 571. As a result, the General Assembly enacted the FSA “for the purpose of creating a more effective mechanism to identify and respond to dire financial adversity confronting municipalities.” Id.

Under that statute, a budget commission, comprised of five members, is tasked to “initiate and ensure the implementation of appropriate measures to secure the financial stability of the city, town, or fire district.” 20 Section 45-9-6(a). Significantly, the FSA grants “broad and encompassing” powers to the budget commission, see Moreau, 15 A.3d at 577, such as approving all appropriations, borrowing authorizations, and transfers; amending, formulating, and executing budgets; implementing and maintaining budget guidelines for departments; amortizing deficits; approving or disapproving all proposed contracts for goods and services; appointing, removing, supervising, and controlling all city or town employees; altering or eliminating the compensation and benefits of elected officials; increasing fees, charges, and rates for municipal services and activities; and reorganizing, consolidating, or abolishing departments.

Therefore, because § 45-9-6 is clear and unambiguous, is to be liberally construed as required by the General Assembly, grants expansive powers to the WBC, and does not provide an express limitation to alter plaintiffs’ rights to free lifetime health care benefits, it is our opinion that the WBC was authorized, under § 45-9-6, to adopt the Retiree Resolutions.', 'That said, § 45-9-9, on the other hand, does contain a specific and express limitation on a budget commission’s authority with respect to collective bargaining agreements.

Even more important, however, § 45-9-9 mandates that the WBC does not have the authority to “reject or alter any existing collective bargaining agreement, unless by agreement, during the term of such collective bargaining agreement.” (Emphasis added.) It follows that, although plaintiffs’ retirement rights were, and continue to be, derived from the CBAs that were in existence when they retired, see Arena, 919 A.2d at 395, those agreements and awards had long expired when the WBC modified the health care benefits that were part of those CBAs and awards.

After recognizing that there is a split on this issue among federal Circuit Courts of Appeals, our caselaw, and caselaw from the United States Supreme Court with regards to a burden-shifting analysis, and taking note of “the general logic that the [c]ity would have access to the information and motivation to demonstrate its justification for the contractual impairment,” we held that the trial justice did not err when she tasked the city with the burden of production with respect to the reasonable-and-necessary element of the Contract Clause analysis. Id.', 'Significantly, this Court also held in that case that the trial justice did not err by requiring the city to proffer only credible evidence of its justifications and by subjecting the city to “a ‘less deference’ standard.” Cranston, -- A.3d at --, 2019 WL 2332508, at *8. We reasoned that “a duly enacted ordinance carries with it a presumption of constitutionality which will disappear only on a contrary showing beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. (quoting Town of Glocester v. Olivo’s Mobile Home Court, Inc., 111 R.I. 120, 124, 300 A.2d 465, 468 (1973)).', 'We recognized, however, that “complete deference to a legislative assessment of reasonableness and necessity is not appropriate because the State’s self-interest is at stake.” Id. (quoting United States Trust Company of New York v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 25-26 (1977)). Although we noted that neither this Court nor the United States Supreme Court had yet to determine a “specific quantum of proof” that the city must meet under the reasonable-and-necessary element, we nonetheless emphasized that the “government actor is afforded a limited amount of deference', '- 31 - as to that showing.” Id. For these reasons, we held that the trial justice’s decision to incorporate “a ‘less deference’ standard” as opposed to a complete deference standard was appropriate. 23 Id.', 'Consistent with our recent holding in Cranston, we are of the opinion that here the trial justice erred because he applied the wrong standard and gave no deference to the City. As noted above, after a plaintiff has proven that a contract exists and that a modification results in a substantial impairment of that contract, the burden shifts to the municipality to produce evidence that will demonstrate “whether the impairment, nonetheless, is reasonable and necessary to fulfill an important public purpose.” 24 Cranston, -- A.3d at --, 2019 WL 2332508, at *6 (emphasis added) (quoting Nonnenmacher, 722 A.2d at 1202). Instead of incorporating that burden, however, the trial justice in the present case determined the following:', '“The City demonstrated that it was in a precarious financial', 'condition at the time the Budget Commission modified the contract', 'provisions—but the situation was not necessarily dire. The City', 'could not demonstrate that it was on the verge of bankruptcy. A', 'receiver had not been appointed. Rather, remedial efforts had', 'already been enacted by the Budget Commission, the Mayor and', 'the City Council, with ongoing assistance from the state Director', 'of Revenue, which displayed great progress in resolving the City’s', 'fiscal issues.

Of course, such 23', 'In Cranston Police Retirees Action Committee v. City of Cranston, -- A.3d --, No. 2017-36- Appeal, 2019 WL 2332508 (R.I. June 3, 2019), we also held that the trial justice did not fail to shift the burden of production to the city because “it [was] clear that the trial justice required the [c]ity to put forth evidence demonstrating a significant and legitimate public purpose for the 2013 ordinances, and that the 2013 ordinances were reasonable and necessary.” Cranston, -- A.3d at --, 2019 WL 2332508, at *8. 24', 'It is not clear whether the trial justice placed the burden of proof to prove the first two elements of the Contract Clause analysis on plaintiffs or on the City. Nonetheless, upon reviewing the evidence in the record, we discern no error in the trial justice’s determination that contracts existed between plaintiffs and the City that created the rights to free health care benefits, and that there was a substantial impairment of that vested right when the WBC adopted the Retiree Resolutions, which required plaintiffs to contribute to the cost of their health care insurance.', '- 32 -', 'goals are important in any enterprise—public or private—but they', 'do not always justify reneging on a contract.” (Emphasis added.) Under this analysis, the City would have been required to prove, not that the substantial impairment was reasonable and necessary to fulfill an important public purpose, but that the circumstances were so “dire” that the City needed to be “on the verge of bankruptcy” and that there was a need for the appointment of a receiver. We are of the opinion that such a standard imposes a stricter burden on the City than the Contract Clause analysis employed by this Court requires, and is also inconsistent with the purpose and procedures set forth in the FSA. 25 See Moreau, 15 A.3d at 571.', 'Moreover, the standard that the trial justice imposed on the City to prove the reasonable- and-necessary element seems not to have accorded any deference to the City. See Cranston, -- A.3d at --, 2019 WL 2332508, at *8. Although we are cognizant that the WBC could not enact an ordinance as the city did in Cranston, we are nonetheless of the opinion that the FSA grants a budget commission broad powers, see Moreau, 15 A.3d at 577, and even provides that “[a]ction by the budget commission under [chapter 9 of title 45] shall constitute action by the city, town, or fire district for all purposes under the general laws, under any special law, and under the city, town, or fire district charter.” Section 45-9-6(b). That provision, which allows the WBC to essentially assume the role of the City, along with the FSA’s purpose to focus on the needs, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the state and the City, as well as access to capital markets, “all to the public benefit and good[,]” § 45-9-1, makes it clear to this Court that some deference should be accorded to the City when producing evidence on the reasonable-and-necessary 25', 'Of course, there is no question that the overarching purpose of the FSA is to establish a sophisticated process that will, if possible, avoid receivership and/or bankruptcy. See § 45-9-1; Moreau v. Flanders, 15 A.3d 565, 571 (R.I. 2011). The record in this case reveals that, in light of the City’s improved financial situation, the statutory process has been effective.', '- 33 - element of the Contract Clause analysis. We therefore conclude that, consistent with this Court’s opinion in Cranston, this matter must be remanded to the lower court for the trial justice to implement a “less deference” standard where the City is required to prove that the substantial impairment to plaintiffs’ contractual rights was nonetheless reasonable and necessary to fulfill an important public purpose.', 'Moreover, although it appears from the record that, commencing July 1, 2017, plaintiffs would no longer be required to make co-share payments for their health insurance, we note that no such abatement has been enacted with respect to plaintiffs’ requirement to pay for health insurance deductibles. It has been represented to this Court, and the record supports, that the City, through the herculean efforts of the WBC and municipal officials, is now on the mend financially. We therefore are of the opinion that, if the trial court, giving appropriate deference to the City’s actions, determines that the WBC did not violate the Contract Clause, the requirement that plaintiffs pay deductibles on their health insurance should be of a finite and reasonable duration. See Cranston, -- A.3d at --, 2019 WL 2332508, at *2 (suspension of COLA was for a period of ten years). 26', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The record shall be returned to the Superior Court. 26', 'Because we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court on these grounds, we need not, and do not, decide whether the trial justice erred when he determined that plaintiffs had established irreparable harm.', '- 34 -', 'Chief Justice Suttell, concurring. I fully concur with the holding of the majority that vacates the judgment of the Superior Court and remands the case to the trial justice for additional findings.', 'I part company with the majority, however, only with respect to the reasoning underlying its conclusion that the provisions in the CBAs at issue, which provisions grant lifetime health care benefits to retired police officers at no cost, are valid because the granting of such benefits is a proprietary function. In my opinion, the majority’s exposition of governmental versus proprietary functions is unnecessary and irrelevant in the context of this case.', 'I first note that the trial justice did not address defendants’ argument that “any contract made by a governmental authority involving the performance of a governmental function that extends beyond the unexpired terms of the governmental officials executing the contract is void because such an agreement improperly ties the hands of subsequent officials.” (Quoting Rhode Island Student Loan Authority v. NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d 624, 626 (R.I. 1988)). As this Court has previously stated, “we generally do not opine on legal issues that have not been explored and analyzed in the first instance by the trial court.” Felkner v. Rhode Island College, 203 A.3d 433, 460 (R.I. 2019). In light of the fact that this case is being remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings, I would suggest that the most prudent course of action would be to direct the trial justice to address the issue on remand.', 'Nevertheless, based upon the record before us, I believe that the elusive distinction between governmental and proprietary functions has no bearing on the resolution of this appeal. The CBAs at issue in this case are each for a term of three years, which term is specifically authorized by G.L. 1956 § 28-9.2-6. Each CBA, therefore, is valid and enforceable during its respective three-year period.', '- 35 -', 'As the majority correctly notes, “a court must look to a retirement plan’s provisions at the time an employee retires to ascertain whether he or she is entitled to a benefit.” (Quoting Arena v. City of Providence, 919 A.2d 379, 395 (R.I. 2007)). Thus, a Woonsocket police officer who retired during the term of one of the CBAs at issue in this case obtained a vested contractual right to the health care benefits provided therein to retired police officers. The fact that the health care benefits will continue beyond the term of the CBA, and indeed beyond the terms of the officials who executed the agreement on behalf of the City, is of no moment. To hold otherwise would eliminate the possibility of a municipality from ever offering retirement benefits to its employees through collective bargaining.', 'In my judgment, the distinction between governmental and proprietary functions is simply irrelevant to the analysis in this appeal. The CBAs at issue were unquestionably valid, and the right to free lifetime health care benefits had vested for those police officers who retired during their existence. The defendants’ argument in this regard creates a false dichotomy that should be rejected. It appears that the trial justice was not lured down this rabbit hole; neither should this Court.', 'My disagreement with the majority is only as to its reasoning supporting its conclusion that the postretirement health care benefits had vested.', 'I agree with its ultimate holding, however, and with its opinion in all other respects.', 'Justice Goldberg, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur in the decision of the majority declaring that the Fiscal Stability Act provided the City with the requisite authority to adopt the Retiree Resolutions and its holding that vacates the judgment and remands this case to the trial justice for additional findings on whether the substantial impairment was reasonable and necessary to fulfill an important public purpose. However, I take issue with and', '- 36 - dissent from the majority’s holding that the collective bargaining agreements and the numerous arbitration awards before us in this case represent, in any way, a proprietary function of the City of Woonsocket. Collective bargaining agreements between municipal governments and police unions epitomize a quintessential government function—employment of the police for the common good. Indeed, I would suggest that the provision of law enforcement services was one of the first governmental functions provided by a civilized society. Police and fire protection are the sine qua non of governmental functions.', 'Postretirement Health Care Benefits', 'However, although I am convinced that the majority erred in characterizing police collective bargaining agreements as “proprietary in nature” and that this conclusion is both unfortunate as well as wrong, I am also convinced that this Court should have summarily rejected defendants’ contentions that all of the collective bargaining agreements entered into between the City and the police union were void. These arguments have no bearing on the issues in this case. It is therefore understandable that the trial justice failed to address defendants’ contentions that the contracts in this case were void because the provision for postretirement health care benefits extended beyond the terms of office of the various municipal officials who voted to ratify them. Therefore, there are no findings or legal conclusions for this Court to pass upon, which, of course, is what we do. Furthermore, plaintiffs failed to address this issue before both the trial court and this Court. Thus, we are operating in a vacuum. For the reasons set forth herein, this Court should summarily reject defendants’ contentions as irrelevant, rather than proceed to make new law. In the alternative, because we are remanding this case to the Superior Court, we should direct the trial justice to decide this issue in the first instance.', '- 37 -', 'Additionally, and determinatively in my opinion, by their very nature, postretirement benefits—whether pensions, cost of living adjustment (COLA) benefits, or health care for retirees—only become operative after the employee retires. It is oxymoronic to suggest that a contractual benefit that does not vest until one has worked the full contractual period—at least twenty years in the case of a police officer—is void because, as defendants have argued, some “contractual promise” somehow extends “beyond the term of the collective bargaining agreement in which it was made.” Were this the case, all collective bargaining agreements that include postretirement benefits would be subject to challenge.', 'Unfortunately, the majority has elected to address these issues, and, in a marked departure from our settled law, the majority has reached an incorrect conclusion. In doing so, the majority, and defendants, overlook the nature of the continuing contractual relationship between the parties, especially the fact that this so-called “contractual promise” that defendants challenge but fail to identify was renewed in every collective bargaining agreement and the seven arbitration awards before us.', 'Indeed, the 2002-2005 CBA specifically provides for the continuation of the agreement until the next agreement is reached:', '“SECTION XXIII: DURATION OF THE AGREEMENT', '“This Agreement shall be for a term of three (3) years beginning July 1,', '2002 and shall expire on June 30, 2005. This Agreement shall remain in', 'force after its expiration date if negotiations between the City of', 'Woonsocket and the IBPO Local 404 have not resulted in a new', 'agreement, until such time as a new agreement has been reached.”', 'Thus, we are not confronted with a contract that imposed restrictions on the City by a body no longer holding office. The so-called “contractual promise” of postretirement health care benefits has been renewed since its inception and does not become operative until the officer', '- 38 - retires from service, and the provision in the CBA in effect at the time is the controlling provision.', 'Furthermore, in reaching this decision, the majority overlooks the fact that we also are confronted with numerous arbitration awards. Indeed, several years elapsed between the 2002- 2005 CBA and the 2010-2012 CBA. The record reveals that there were seven interest arbitration awards in place of CBAs until the 2010-2012 CBA was ratified. Interest arbitration awards are not subject to a proprietary/governmental analysis. By statute, interest arbitration awards extend into the next CBA. See G.L. 1956 § 28-9.2-17. It is therefore unnecessary for this Court to venture into these waters. Nonetheless, the majority’s conclusions are erroneous.', 'Governmental and Proprietary Functions', 'The majority decision erroneously concludes that the CBAs were “executed in furtherance of a proprietary function” by the City, rather than examining the nature of the work the contracting party has been hired to perform, thereby fulfilling the municipality’s governmental responsibility. This Court’s unwavering focus in these cases is on the work the governmental entity is seeking to accomplish when it enters into the contract. That is the law in this state.', 'The majority has erroneously interpreted this Court’s holdings in Parent v. Woonsocket Housing Authority, 87 R.I. 444, 143 A.2d 146 (1958), and Rhode Island Student Loan Authority v. NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d 624 (R.I. 1988). In Parent, we recognized that the Woonsocket Housing Authority was empowered to perform both proprietary and governmental functions. Parent, 87 R.I. at 448, 143 A.2d at 148. The focus in Parent was on the duties that the plaintiff, Parent, was contracted to perform for the housing authority, not on any particular aspect of the employment contract, such as salary or benefits. Id. at 448, 143 A.2d at 147. This Court looked to the housing authority’s enabling act to determine its authority and found that the', '- 39 - housing authority was “charged with the performance of many duties which are clearly governmental in character. For example, it has the power to make investigations and is vested with the power of eminent domain.” Id. at 448, 143 A.2d at 148. We then concluded that Parent’s appointment as legal counsel “relates to the governmental function of the housing authority.” Id. The same is true here, where the appointment, classification, and promotion of police officers relates to the governmental function of policing.', 'Likewise, the issue in NELS was “whether NELS’s segment of RISLA’s operation [was] governmental or proprietary in nature.” NELS, Inc., 550 A.2d at 627 (emphasis added). The Court in NELS set forth “the distinction between a governmental and proprietary function” of the government agency. Id. “[I]n Rhode Island a proprietary function is one ‘not so intertwined with governing that the government is obligated to perform it only by its own agents or employees.’” Id. (quoting Lepore v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 524 A.2d 574, 575 (R.I. 1987)). Consistent with this well-settled law, this Court then looked to NELS’s duties in relation to RISLA’s operations, and not to the provisions of the contract. Id. We found that “the particular facet of RISLA’s operations that NELS covers is clearly proprietary[,]” and likened it to a sophisticated collection agency for RISLA’s student loans and recognized the fact that NELS could “neither exercise discretion nor set policy in the performance of its duties.” Id. This Court concluded “that that portion of RISLA’s operations serviced by NELS is ‘not so intertwined with governing that the government is obligated to perform it only by its own agents or employees.’” Id. (quoting Lepore, 524 A.2d at 575).', 'The focus in these cases is always on the function the governmental entity is contracting to have performed, and not on some benefit or other provision set forth in the agreement. The Court does not look to whether a private employer may include a contractual provision in the', '- 40 - private employer’s labor agreement. The function in the present case is police work—public safety for the protection of the citizenry. There is nothing proprietary about the delivery of police services. Law enforcement officers are sworn members of a paramilitary organization with arrest powers.', 'Clearly, this is an activity “so intertwined with governing that the government is obligated to perform it only by its own agents or employees.” Lepore, 524 A.2d at 575 (quoting Xavier v. Cianci, 479 A.2d 1179, 1182 (R.I. 1984)).', 'In shifting its analysis to the specific provisions of the CBAs in this case, the majority also misconceives our decision in Roach v. State, 157 A.3d 1042 (R.I. 2017), in which this Court declared that in our task of “deciphering when the state executes a proprietary versus a governmental function * * * this Court pinpoints the function at issue and examines whether it is so significantly tied to governing that private persons or entities could not possibly fulfill it.” Roach, 157 A.3d at 1053.', 'Importantly, there was no collective bargaining agreement or employment contract in Roach; the plaintiff was a per-diem nurse employed at the state owned and operated Veterans Home, a nursing facility for aged and infirm veterans. Id. at 1044. She was injured in a fall, and one of the issues before this Court concerned the public duty doctrine. Id. This Court rejected the state’s attempt to confine our analysis to a discrete aspect of the governmental function, the maintenance of the facility, based on the state’s argument that the Home was a creature of statute “with its management vested in the Director of Human Services.” Id. at 1051, 1052. We viewed the activity more functionally, concluding that “the pertinent government function is resident-patient care.” Id. at 1052. We upheld the trial justice’s refusal to apply the public duty doctrine to the facts in Roach, concluding that “[t]he discrete function here—that is, care for nursing home resident-patients—is not the type shielded from tort', '- 41 - liability[,]” nor did the activity giving rise to the plaintiff’s injuries occur during the performance of “a discretionary governmental function warranting immunity.” Id. at 1051, 1052.', 'In a marked departure from our previous holdings, the majority cites Roach and declares, “[w]hen conducting our inquiry into the governmental or proprietary nature of a contract, our review is limited to the contents of the contract or contracts actually before us”; and it is from there that the Court “pinpoints the function at issue and examines whether it is so significantly tied to governing that private persons or entities could not possibly fulfill it.” Roach, 157 A.3d at 1053. This is incorrect. The focus in this analysis, for purposes of the public duty doctrine or the length of employment contracts, is the activity that the governmental entity is charged with performing. In Roach, this Court observed:', '“Whether a function is so intermingled with governing, such that', 'only government agents or employees can execute it, begs the', 'question of whether nongovernmental employees or private', 'persons can also perform the function. In both inquiries, this Court', 'pinpoints the function at issue and examines whether it is so', 'significantly tied to governing that private persons or entities could', 'not possibly fulfill it.” Roach, 157 A.3d at 1053.', 'I therefore conclude that the collective bargaining agreements in this case between the police union and the City of Woonsocket relate to the performance of a governmental function, and the decision of the majority to look to the provisions of the contract to determine whether those provisions can also be performed by a private entity is simply incorrect.', 'It is my opinion that this issue is wholly irrelevant to the issues before the Court and should have been summarily rejected.

Louttit, II and Caroline Hathaway Louttit, minor children. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This protracted squabble among siblings reaches us after a decade of litigation. At issue are amendments to an inter vivos trust and gifts of interest in a family limited partnership that was established by Augusta Hathaway during the 1990s in an effort to limit the tax liability to her estate. A trial was held in December 2014, after which a jury found that Ms. Hathaway lacked the testamentary capacity to amend her trust and that the defendant, Marion Louttit, Ms. Hathaway’s youngest daughter, had unduly influenced Ms. Hathaway, thereby causing Ms. Hathaway to execute the challenged amendments and gifts. 1 The jury also found that Marion Louttit had breached her fiduciary duty as trustee of the inter vivos trust. Following the jury’s verdict, Louttit renewed her motion for judgment as a matter of law and moved for a new trial. After duly considering those motions, the trial justice denied Louttit’s motion for new trial 1', 'We note that Louttit’s surname is spelled inconsistently throughout the record in this case. For the sake of consistency, we shall spell the surname as it appears in the parties’ briefs.', '-1- and judgment as a matter of law on the claims of testamentary capacity and undue influence. However, the trial justice granted both motions as to the fiduciary duty verdict because, according to the trial justice, the plaintiff, Wenda Branson—Ms. Hathaway’s middle daughter—had failed to prove damages. An order entered on February 4, 2016, to that effect, which also denied the plaintiff’s motion for attorneys’ fees. Judgment entered that same day, and the parties cross- appealed. 2', 'After carefully reviewing the parties’ arguments and thoroughly examining the evidence presented at trial, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in all respects, and we vacate the grant of a new trial as to the plaintiff’s breach of fiduciary duty claim.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The essential facts of this case are not in dispute. Augusta Hathaway lived in her home in Barrington for nearly fifty years. She married twice, and had three daughters: Joan Prout- Oscarsson, Wenda Branson, and Marion Louttit. In 1992, following the death of her second husband, Ms. Hathaway created the Augusta P. Hathaway Living Trust Agreement to distribute her assets upon her death. In addition, the trust contained language that required the trustee to apply “so much of the net income and principal of the Trust Estate, even to the extent of exhausting principal, as the Settlor may at any time or times direct in writing or as the Trustee may deem advisable for the Settlor’s support, maintenance, health, education, or welfare.”', 'In 1997, the trust was amended to include an equalization clause, which provided that:', '“[T]he Trustee shall take into consideration that it is the Settlor’s', 'desire and intention that all of the Settlor’s children share equally in', 'her estate. To that end, in distributing the Trust Estate, per stirpes,', 'to the Settlor’s issue, the Trustee shall consider all gifts and loans 2', 'Joan Prout-Oscarsson, Ms. Hathaway’s oldest daughter, and Kristal Osborn, Branson’s daughter, were joined as third-party defendants in the Superior Court case, but neither has joined in either of the cross-appeals to this Court.', '-2-', 'made by the Settlor to her children or other issue during her lifetime.', 'Gifts and loans made to each child and his or her issue shall be added', 'together to arrive at a total family share for each child. To the extent', 'that the total family shares for each child are unequal, the Trustee', 'shall first allocate to each child and to the issue of a deceased child', 'the amount or amounts necessary which, when added to the total', 'family share for each child will equalize the total amounts given to', 'each child’s family during the Settlor’s lifetime.”', 'Around the same time, Ms. Hathaway also established the A. P. Hathaway Family Limited Partnership, to which she deeded her Barrington home. The partners to the limited partnership were Ms. Hathaway, who retained the general interest, and limited partners Louttit, who also retained an interest for the benefit of her two children, and Branson, who also retained an interest for the benefit of Kristal Osborn, who was then a minor child. 3 Over the next several years, Ms. Hathaway gifted additional interests in the limited partnership to her children and grandchildren. The last unchallenged gifting document, executed in 1999, indicates that Hathaway retained 44.1 percent, Louttit owned a combined 31.06 percent for herself and her children, and Branson owned a combined 24.84 percent for herself and Kristal Osborn.', 'The record reveals that, in the fall of 2000, Louttit and her mother discussed Louttit’s wish to move into the Barrington home with her husband, Jonathan, and their family as soon as some planned construction at the home could be completed. 4 However, Louttit and Jonathan had difficulty securing a loan to pay for the construction because the ownership of Ms. Hathaway’s home was divided among the other members of the limited partnership. 3', 'Kristal Osborn was previously known as Kristal Fahey, which is the name by which she is referred to in Ms. Hathaway’s partnership gifts. Ms. Hathaway’s eldest daughter, Joan Prout- Oscarsson, had no interest in the limited partnership. It seems clear from the record that Ms. Hathaway and Prout-Oscarsson were estranged during all relevant periods. 4', 'To avoid confusion, we will refer to Jonathan Louttit by his first name. No disrespect is intended.', '-3-', 'In October 2000, Louttit and Jonathan met with Ms. Hathaway’s attorney, Andrew Davis, for the purpose of effecting changes to Ms. Hathaway’s estate plan. Mr. Davis’s legal bills for the date in question indicate that the purpose of the meeting was to conduct a “review of partnership documents and prepare [a] new gifting letter.”', 'Facing the trials and increasing infirmities of age, Ms. Hathaway moved into an assisted living facility in November 2000. Sadly, just a few weeks later, she attempted suicide and was admitted to Butler Hospital for care. When asked why she had tried to take her own life, she responded, “to relieve my family of the burden of taking care of me” and that “[t]his is the easiest way to give my house to them.” Ms. Hathaway was discharged from inpatient care on December 1, 2000. In a discharge report, her treating physician diagnosed Ms. Hathaway as having bipolar disorder, type II depressed, and “Alzheimer’s dementia, mild.” Her physician reported that Ms. Hathaway “requires a higher level of care secondary to obvious cognitive deficits” and that “[s]he demonstrates impairments in the areas of safety, medication management, and money management.” Importantly, the physician at Butler Hospital also reported that “[s]he demonstrates significant difficulty in determining negative consequences of her actions and poor coping skills as well” and that “she had difficulty weighing the risks, benefits, and alternatives to suicide for handing her property over to her family.”', 'It is also noteworthy that, in the months following her discharge from Butler Hospital, Ms. Hathaway made several changes to her estate plan, all of which were geared toward shifting the major portion of her estate to the Louttit family and away from Branson and Osborn. Ms. Hathaway signed two documents (the partnership gifts) transferring her remaining interest in the limited partnership, including the general partnership share, to Louttit and her family. She also made several amendments to her trust. The first, signed on December 19, 2000, appointed Louttit', '-4- as trustee. Another amendment, signed on February 28, 2001, made Branson and Osborn’s beneficiary interest in the trust conditional on the transfer of their interest in the limited partnership to Louttit. The relevant language of that amendment provided:', '“Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, it is the Settlor’s', 'specific intent that all of the interests in THE AUGUSTA P.', 'HATHAWAY FAMILY LIMITED PARTNERSHIP be owned by', 'MARION P. LOUTTIT and her family, in spite of the fact that such', 'ownership might result in an ultimate unequal distribution of the', 'Settlor’s estate.

BRANSON and KRISTAL A.', 'FAHEY at such price and upon such terms and conditions as', 'MARION P. LOUTTIT shall deem appropriate.”', 'Around the time of those amendments, Jonathan sent a letter to Branson, in which he asked that she and Osborn surrender their shares in the limited partnership. In that correspondence, Jonathan represented that making the transfers would have the result of “saving the estate almost $200,000 in estimated estate taxes.” He clarified, however, that “it is still your mother’s intention that you, Marion and Joan will eventually share equally in her estate at the time of her death. That will include the value of the house.” Jonathan later testified at trial that, in fact, there would not have been any savings in estate taxes because the house already had been conveyed to the limited partnership in 1997. In any event, Branson and Osborn did not comply with Jonathan’s request and did not surrender their shares in the limited partnership.', '-5-', 'Soon after she received the letter from Jonathan, Branson received another letter, this one purportedly from Ms. Hathaway. The relevant portions of that letter said:', '“As you know, my arthritis has now made it impossible for me to', 'write letters to people. Because of this, I’ve asked one of the', 'secretary’s [sic] at [the assisted living facility] to type this for me.', '“* * *', '“What I would like you to do is to please call Andrew Davis, my', 'attorney and make arrangements to transfer your shares in the', 'partnership back to me. Since you now have a copy of my will you', 'know that I intend to leave you, Marion and Joan equal shares in my', 'estate when I’m gone. However, if we can not resolve the problems', 'with the partnership I may have to rethink my estate planning.” Although the letter was purported to have been written by Ms. Hathaway, Jonathan later testified that, in fact, he had drafted the letter after meeting with Ms. Hathaway at the assisted living facility and that she had not dictated the letter to him. He claimed, however, that he later reviewed the contents of the letter with Ms. Hathaway.', 'Concerned because she was being asked to give up her shares in the limited partnership, Branson set up a meeting with Ms. Hathaway, Prout-Oscarsson, and Osborn over dinner for the purpose of discussing the potentially uneven distribution of Ms. Hathaway’s estate. Branson surreptitiously recorded much of the conversation because, she later testified, she was worried that Ms. Hathaway would not be able to remember the conversation and Branson wanted to be able to play the recording to her mother to remind her of what she had said. 5 Branson and Prout-Oscarsson asked their mother to explain why Louttit was to receive the lion’s share of the limited partnership interest. In her response to that inquiry, Ms. Hathaway said, “It was always meant that you and 5', 'A review of the transcript of their conversation reveals that, when Ms. Hathaway questioned Branson about the recording device, Branson told her that it was “[a] radio, just in case we want to listen to the radio.” Later, Ms. Hathaway asked whether their conversation was being recorded and Branson replied, “So you’ll remember.”', '-6- Joan would get the money and Marion there would take the house” and that she “wanted everybody to get an equal share.” When Branson asked how the daughters would get an equal share if Louttit owned the entire house, the following exchange ensued:', '“BRANSON:', '[D]id Joan and I get equal amounts', 'of money that equal, is the same as', 'what Marion gets in the house?', '“HATHAWAY:', 'I don’t know.', '“BRANSON:', 'Well, how can it be equal if it’s not?', '“HATHAWAY:', 'Well, she’s got an attorney.', '“PROUT[-OSCARSSON]:', 'So do we.', '“HATHAWAY:', 'Yeah, all right.

That amendment made Louttit the trustee and dispensed with any pretense of distributing the trust assets equally upon Ms. Hathaway’s death. Instead, the amendment provided that Branson, Osborn, and Prout-Oscarsson would each receive $2,000 from the trust, while the remaining balance of the trust assets would be distributed to Louttit or her living issue. The amendment also added a no-contest clause, which provided that “[i]f any beneficiary hereunder or heir at law shall contest the validity of this Trust Amendment * * * then all benefits provided for such beneficiary or heir at law shall lapse as if such beneficiary had predeceased the Settlor.”', 'There can be no doubt that Louttit and Jonathan were intricately involved with the changes to Ms. Hathaway’s estate plan during this period. Louttit scheduled her mother’s appointments', '-7- with her attorney and drove Ms. Hathaway to meet with Mr. Davis to discuss drafting the partnership gifts and trust amendments. Louttit and Jonathan were present for all those meetings and they also were present when Ms. Hathaway executed the partnership gifts and amendments to the trust, with the sole exception of the August 3, 2001 trust amendment, which she signed at the assisted living facility rather than at her attorney’s office. Jonathan was also in routine contact with Mr. Davis, and Jonathan sent emails to him on more than one occasion to discuss the limited partnership and the trust amendments.', 'In 2003, Ms. Hathaway inherited $10,000 after the passing of one of her friends. Louttit, who had held Ms. Hathaway’s financial power of attorney since 1997, sent an email to Mr. Davis seeking advice on how to proceed with the inheritance check her mother had received. Louttit wrote of her mother, “She doesn’t want my two sisters to know about this money. She told Jon and I she wants to put the money in our children’s accounts for their education. * * * I don’t want it to look like I just deposited this money into our children’s accounts.” Later, Louttit, on behalf of her mother, deposited the inheritance funds into college savings accounts for her two children.', 'Ms. Hathaway passed away in November 2008. Branson brought this suit in August 2009 seeking to void the 2000 and 2001 partnership gifts and the February 28 and August 3, 2001 trust amendments. Branson also alleged that Louttit had breached her fiduciary duty as trustee by diverting funds from the trust. A jury trial was held in December 2014.', 'At trial, Branson presented the testimony of John Stoukides, M.D., an expert qualified in geriatric medicine and palliative care. Doctor Stoukides, who had practiced in the field of geriatric and palliative care for over twenty-five years, testified that he had reviewed Ms. Hathaway’s medical records from various dates between 1997 and 2004. Doctor Stoukides was asked at trial: “Were you asked to evaluate Augusta Hathaway’s capacity to make gifts to her daughter?” He', '-8- responded: “I was asked to basically look at her cognitive ability as was documented in her medical records and render an opinion whether or not I felt she had the requisite capacity to make complex financial decisions, so I think that’s a yes to your answer.”', 'Doctor Stoukides reported that Ms. Hathaway had been suffering from memory problems since at least 1997, when she visited a neurologist who, after a follow-up appointment in early 1998, diagnosed Ms. Hathaway with early Alzheimer’s disease. Doctor Stoukides also reviewed the report of an occupational therapist who had evaluated Ms. Hathaway during her stay at Butler Hospital in late 2000. According to Dr. Stoukides, the occupational therapist had given Ms. Hathaway a series of coins to count, but, he testified, “she couldn’t even comprehend the value of the coins and give her a value of, you know, what a quarter, a dime, a nickel, and a penny are worth.” He reported that it was the opinion of the occupational therapist that Ms. Hathaway “didn’t have the ability to manage her finances and she didn’t have the ability to recognize the implications of her decisions.”', 'After reviewing those reports, Dr. Stoukides testified that he believed, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that “Mrs. Hathaway at the time she was in Butler Hospital had significant impairments in her memory, her learning ability, her reasoning, her financial skills, and her ability to understand the implications of her actions[.]” He added that “[s]he just didn’t have any cognitive capacity that would allow her to, one, determine what she wanted to do, follow through with it, and understand the implications of what she was doing at that time.” Consequently, it was his belief, again to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that Ms. Hathaway lacked testamentary capacity at the time she executed the amendments to the trust and signed the gift letters. When pressed to give his understanding of the meaning of “testamentary capacity,” Dr. Stoukides answered: “Testamentary capacity is the ability of someone to understand', '-9- their -- the value of their estate; to understand who naturally would get their estate upon their death; and understand the implication -- the process of giving that estate to various people.” He also testified that Ms. Hathaway’s condition had left her susceptible to undue influence, and explained his understanding of “undue influence” as follows:', '“Basically it’s the susceptibility, I guess, of a person to be influenced', 'by another because of either their need for acceptance of the other,', 'their dependence on another person to meet their needs, or to get', 'their information and to make a decision that isn’t their decision', 'based on the influence of another person that would go against their', 'values, against their baseline construct of what that person is and be', 'changed by another person.”', 'At the close of all evidence, Louttit moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that Branson’s claims were barred by the doctrine of laches and that the evidence that had been presented did not support Branson’s claims for breach of fiduciary duty, testamentary capacity, or undue influence. The trial justice denied that motion and submitted the questions of testamentary capacity, undue influence, and breach of fiduciary duty to the jury. The jury returned a verdict in Branson’s favor on all three counts, finding that Ms. Hathaway had lacked testamentary capacity and that she had been unduly influenced by Louttit. The jury further found that Louttit had breached her fiduciary duty, and it awarded damages to the trust in the amount of $441,290.', 'Louttit subsequently renewed her motion for judgment as a matter of law and filed an additional motion for new trial pursuant to Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, and/or for a remittitur, adding to her previous arguments the contention that the jury’s excessive damages award demonstrated that the verdict was the product of impermissible passion, sympathy, and prejudice, and that the trial court should have given certain instructions that she had requested. The trial justice denied Louttit’s motions with respect to the claims of testamentary capacity and', '- 10 - undue influence. However, for reasons discussed in more detail infra, the trial justice granted both motions with respect to the breach of fiduciary duty verdict. Judgment was entered on February 4, 2016, voiding the trust amendments of February 28 and August 3, 2001, and the interests conveyed on December 27, 2000, and January 2, 2001, on the basis of the claims of testamentary capacity and undue influence.

Moreover, “we accord great deference to the trial justice’s assessment of the credibility of witnesses.” Id.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Louttit and Branson each appealed from the trial justice’s decisions on Louttit’s motions for new trial and for judgment as a matter of law. As an initial matter, Louttit argues that the equitable doctrine of laches should have estopped Branson from bringing suit. Alternatively, Louttit argues that the trial justice should have granted her motions for judgment as a matter of law or for new trial on the issues of undue influence and testamentary capacity. Louttit also argues that the excessive damage award by the jury demonstrated that the verdict, as a whole, was tainted by improper passion, sympathy, and prejudice, and that she is therefore entitled to a new trial on all counts. Finally, she argues that, on remand, she is entitled to a new bench trial on the issues of testamentary capacity and undue influence if Branson’s appeal on the sole legal claim of breach of fiduciary duty is sustained.', 'In a cross appeal, Branson argues that the trial justice should not have granted the motions for new trial and for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of breach of fiduciary duty.', '- 12 -', 'A', 'Laches', 'Louttit first argues that Branson’s claims are barred by the equitable doctrine of laches. We do not agree.', '“Laches is an equitable defense that precludes a lawsuit by a plaintiff who has negligently sat on his or her rights to the detriment of a defendant.” Hazard v. East Hills, Inc., 45 A.3d 1262, 1269 (R.I. 2012) (quoting O’Reilly v. Town of Glocester, 621 A.2d 697, 702 (R.I. 1993)). Significantly, “[t]he defense of laches ‘involves not only delay but also a party’s detrimental reliance on the status quo.’” Id. at 1269-70 (quoting Andrukiewicz v. Andrukiewicz, 860 A.2d 235, 241 (R.I. 2004)); see Chase v. Chase, 20 R.I. 202, 203-04, 37 A. 804, 805 (1897) (“Laches, in legal significance, is not mere delay, but delay that works a disadvantage to another.”). “Generally, a party asserting the affirmative defense of laches bears the burden of proof with respect to that defense.” Raso v. Wall, 884 A.2d 391, 395 n.12 (R.I. 2005). The defense of laches sounds in equity and, therefore, the applicability of the defense “in a given case generally rests within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” Hazard, 45 A.3d at 1270.', 'Louttit argues that the doctrine of laches bars Branson’s claims because she chose to wait until August 2009 to challenge the trust amendments and the partnership gifts of 2000 and 2001. Louttit notes that, after all, Branson “began complaining about her share of Settlor’s assets in early to mid-January 2001[.]” The thrust of her argument seems to be that, by delaying suit until after Ms. Hathaway’s death, Branson deprived Louttit of the benefit of Ms. Hathaway’s testimony. However, there is no indication that Ms. Hathaway’s testimony would have been favorable to Louttit and unfavorable to Branson and, as the trial justice noted, Louttit also had the opportunity to adjudicate the validity of the challenged instruments before Ms. Hathaway’s death but chose', '- 13 - not to do so. Therefore, even if we assume for the sake of argument that Branson unreasonably delayed in bringing her suit, we can discern no prejudice that inured to Louttit’s detriment. We therefore affirm the trial justice’s ruling on this issue.', 'B', 'Undue Influence', 'We next address Louttit’s contention that she should have been awarded judgment as a matter of law or, alternatively, a new trial, on the matter of undue influence. “Undue influence is the substitution of the will of the dominant party for the free will and choice of the subservient party.” Bettez v. Bettez, 114 A.3d 82, 85 (R.I. 2015) (brackets omitted) (quoting In re Estate of Picillo, 99 A.3d 975, 982 (R.I. 2014)). “When determining what constitutes undue influence, a trial justice ordinarily examines the totality of the circumstances, including the relationship between the parties, the physical and mental condition of the subservient party, the opportunity and disposition of the person wielding influence, and his or her acts and declarations.” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting In re Estate of Picillo, 99 A.3d at 982). “Ordinarily, ‘the question of whether undue influence exists is a fact-intensive inquiry.’” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting In re Estate of Picillo, 99 A.3d at 982).', '1', 'Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law', 'With respect to the denial of her motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of undue influence, Louttit contends that the trial justice erred because he accorded excessive weight to the testimony of Dr. Stoukides and insufficient weight to the testimony of Andrew Davis, Ms. Hathaway’s estate planning attorney, and to the testimony evincing “Augusta’s love of her home, her desire to keep it in the family, her strong personality, her intact long term memory, and her', '- 14 - statements as to the treatment she received from Wenda, Joan, and Kristal.” In addition, Louttit argues that “[t]here was no evidence introduced at trial to support a finding or inference that [Louttit], as the dominant person, coerced her mother to make the amendments to the Trust and to make the [limited partnership] gifts.”', 'In our opinion, those arguments are unconvincing because they do no more than challenge the weight ascribed to the various witnesses and to the other evidence in this case, even though all inferences must be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party when a trial justice considers a motion for judgment as a matter of law. As we have said on many occasions in the past, on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, we, like the trial justice, are tasked with examining “the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses, and draw[ing] from the record all reasonable inferences that support the position of the nonmoving party.” Filippi, 818 A.2d at 617 (quoting Marketing Design Source, Inc., 799 A.2d at 271). Indeed, our jurisprudence is crystal clear that the trial justice is required to draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party on a motion for judgment as a matter of law. That is precisely what the trial justice did in this case.', 'In addition, and contrary to Louttit’s assertions, the record is replete with evidence that tends to support the jury’s finding that Louttit unduly influenced Ms. Hathaway for her own benefit. Regarding Ms. Hathaway’s susceptibility to the overbearing will of others, Dr. Stoukides testified that Ms. Hathaway had been plagued by memory loss since at least 1997, and that she had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 1998. 6 Her medical records reveal that, when asked why she had attempted to commit suicide in November 2000, Ms. Hathaway replied: “to relieve 6', 'We agree with Louttit that a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, standing alone, is not sufficient evidence to support a finding of susceptibility to undue influence or a lack of testamentary capacity. It is, however, certainly appropriate for the factfinder to consider such a diagnosis.', '- 15 - my family of the burden of taking care of me” and, “[t]his is the easiest way to give my house to them.” An occupational therapist at Butler Hospital reported at that time that Ms. Hathaway “didn’t have the ability to manage her finances and she didn’t have the ability to recognize the implications of her decisions.” Importantly, after reviewing Ms. Hathaway’s medical records, Dr. Stoukides testified that it was his opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that “Mrs. Hathaway at the time she was in Butler Hospital had significant impairments in her memory, her learning ability, her reasoning, her financial skills, and her ability to understand the implications of her actions[.]” He further opined that:', '“in light of her cognitive impairment, her memory loss, her', 'difficulty learning, the fact that she had one person that would take', 'her to all of her appointments, would do everything with her, she', 'clearly had that susceptibility. She had the dependence, she had', 'impairment, she is somebody who could have easily been unduly', 'influenced by another person because she didn’t have the ability to', 'come up with the answer herself, or plan herself.”', 'Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, as we must when reviewing a decision on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, the evidence is more than sufficient to support a finding that Louttit was well positioned to take advantage of Ms. Hathaway’s susceptibility to undue influence, and that she did so. She held Ms. Hathaway’s financial power of attorney at all relevant times. Louttit and Jonathan were present every time Ms. Hathaway discussed her estate plan with her attorney, and they were present when the partnership gifts and trust amendments were signed, with the sole exception of the August 3, 2001 trust amendment. When Ms. Hathaway met with her estate planning attorney, it was Louttit who scheduled the appointments and Louttit who transported Ms. Hathaway to her attorney’s office. Also, Jonathan, Louttit’s husband, routinely contacted Ms. Hathaway’s attorney to discuss the limited partnership and the trust amendments.', '- 16 -', 'Moreover, it is significant to us, as it was to the trial justice, that Ms. Hathaway consistently had expressed her intent to divide her estate evenly among her daughters at least as late as 1997, when she added an equalization clause to the trust. Indeed, Ms. Hathaway continued to maintain that it was her intention to divide her estate evenly among her daughters even when the documents she was signing in 2000 and 2001 specified the very opposite outcome. At her meeting with Branson, Prout-Oscarsson, and Osborn in the summer of 2001, Ms. Hathaway told Branson that “[i]t was always meant that you and Joan would get the money and Marion there would take the house” and that she “wanted everybody to get an equal share.” When Branson pointed out that the recent changes did not bear that out, Ms. Hathaway seemed to believe that an attorney engaged by Louttit, and not by her, was responsible for the change.', 'Given the evidence in the record, we can arrive at no conclusion other than that, at the very least, “there remain factual issues upon which reasonable persons might draw different conclusions,” and thus Louttit’s motion for judgment as a matter of law with regard to undue influence was properly denied. 7 Filippi, 818 A.2d at 617 (quoting Marketing Design Source, Inc., 799 A.2d at 271). 7', 'In her brief to this Court, Louttit quoted the instructions that the trial justice gave to the jury with regard to the claims of undue influence, and then quoted the answer Dr. Stoukides provided when asked to explain his understanding of the term “undue influence,” which answer is set forth above in this opinion. Louttit added that “Dr. Stoukides was then repeatedly asked his opinion, over defense counsel’s objection, as to whether Augusta was susceptible to undue influence. * * * Of course, he said yes and, once again, based his opinions on the contents of her medical records.” We are unclear as to what argument Louttit was attempting to make with those comments. In any event, the argument was not developed, and therefore it has been waived. See McGarry v. Pielech, 108 A.3d 998, 1005 (R.I. 2015) (“[A] failure to raise and develop [an alleged error] in [a party’s] briefs constitutes a waiver of that issue on appeal and in proceedings on remand.”).', '- 17 -', '2', 'Motion for New Trial', 'Alternatively, Louttit argues that she merited a new trial on the issue of undue influence “because (a) the verdict was wrong because it failed to respond truly to the merits and to administer substantial justice between the parties; (b) the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence; and (c) the [c]ourt committed a number of prejudicial errors of law[.]”', 'Louttit’s first two arguments are essentially attacks on the credibility assessments of the trial justice when he ruled on her motion for new trial. Louttit’s chief complaint seems to be that the trial justice credited the testimony of Dr. Stoukides. 8 However, “we accord great deference to the trial justice’s assessment of the credibility of witnesses.”', 'Bajakian, 880 A.2d at 852. Moreover, “when we review a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for new trial, we afford it ‘great weight’” and “[w]e will not disturb such a ruling by a trial justice ‘unless he or she overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong in performing his or her function.’” Id. at 851-52 (quoting Sarkisian, 512 A.2d at 835). Having reviewed the evidence and the decision of the trial justice, we are satisfied that he neither overlooked nor misconceived material evidence.', 'Louttit argues that Dr. Stoukides’s testimony was not credible because he neither treated nor even met Ms. Hathaway and had never actually spoken to Ms. Hathaway’s daughters, friends, treating physicians, or caregivers. Louttit acknowledges, however, that Dr. Stoukides “based his 8', 'In a subheading of her brief, Louttit argues that “It was a Prejudicial Error of Law to Allow, Over the Defendant’s Objections, Dr. Stoukides’s Opinions on Testamentary Capacity and Undue Influence.” However, to support this argument, she directs our attention to other sections in her brief regarding the admission of Dr. Stoukides’s opinion of what constitutes testamentary capacity. Expert testimony regarding testamentary capacity is obviously distinct from the testimony regarding undue influence, but, to the extent that we can identify any overlap between these issues, we can discern no error.', '- 18 - opinions on the contents of [Ms. Hathaway’s] medical records.” This is proper for an expert medical witness. See R.I. R. Evid. 703 (“An expert’s opinion may be based on a hypothetical question, facts or data perceived by the expert at or before the hearing, or facts or data in evidence. If of a type reasonably and customarily relied upon by experts in the particular field in forming opinions upon the subject, the underlying facts or data shall be admissible without testimony from the primary source.”). Importantly, Louttit did not contest Dr. Stoukides’s qualification as an expert in geriatric medicine and palliative care. Absent an adequately presented objection, Dr. Stoukides’s testimony became so much grist for the jury and, on a motion for new trial, the trial justice was free to credit his testimony. See Bajakian, 880 A.2d at 851-52.', 'Louttit also suggests that the trial justice should have given more weight to the', '“substantial evidence of Augusta’s love of her home, her desire to', 'keep it in the family, her strong personality, her intact long term', 'memory, and her statements as to the treatment she received from', 'Wenda, Joan and Kristal. And – importantly – Attorney Davis’s', 'opinion that there was nothing inappropriate about the relationship', 'between Marion and Augusta that caused him to believe that this', 'was not her free act and was in accordance with her wishes.” However, Louttit fails to direct our attention to those portions of the record that contain that evidence. 9 When reviewing a motion for new trial, the party challenging the ruling of the trial justice has the difficult task of demonstrating that the trial justice “overlooked or misconceived 9', 'Indeed, the trial justice considered Mr. Davis’s testimony when he ruled on the motion for new trial, albeit he did so with regard to the issue of Ms. Hathaway’s testamentary capacity, which we do not reach. The trial justice noted that “Mr. Davis testified that he was not told about the admission to Butler, he was not told about the suicide attempt, he was not told about the dementia[.]” The trial justice concluded that, although Mr. Davis testified that he believed Ms. Hathaway understood the estate planning documents at issue, “[t]he [c]ourt does find that he was not fully informed in order to make those observations.” This was a supportable credibility assessment with which we can find no fault. See Bajakian v. Erinakes, 880 A.2d 843, 852 (R.I. 2005). Moreover, we note that Mr. Davis’s testimony regarding the propriety of Ms. Hathaway’s relationship with Louttit was explicitly stricken from the record.', '- 19 - material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong in performing his or her function.” Bajakian, 880 A.2d at 852 (quoting Sarkisian, 512 A.2d at 835). Louttit has not directed us to any evidence that might satisfy that task, and “we will not ‘scour the record to identify facts in support of [her] broad claims, and we will not give life to arguments that [she] has failed to develop on [her] own.’” Terzian v. Lombardi, 180 A.3d 555, 558 (R.I. 2018) (quoting McMahon v. Deutsche Bank National Trust Co., 131 A.3d 175, 176 (R.I. 2016) (mem.)).', 'As for the “number of prejudicial errors of law” that Louttit claims were made by the trial justice, the only claims of error that apply to the matter of undue influence are the trial justice’s decision not to give a requested jury instruction and the admission of Dr. Stoukides’s opinion of what constitutes undue influence. 10', 'Before the Superior Court, Louttit requested that the following jury instruction be given:', '“It is universally accepted that the law jealously guards a person’s', 'right to dispose of his or her property as he or she sees fit. It is not', 'for you to decide whether the final distribution outlined in Augusta', 'Hathaway’s Trust was fair in global terms.” 10', 'Louttit offers a buffet table of claimed errors, including:', '“a.', 'Allowing plaintiff’s counsel, over defense counsel’s', 'objections, to ask the plaintiff’s specially retained medical expert,', 'John Stoukides, M.D., opinions based on Dr. Stoukides’s personal,', 'incorrect definition of testamentary capacity;', '“b.', 'Allowing plaintiff’s counsel, over defense counsel’s', 'objections, to ask his specially retained medical expert, John', 'Stoukides, M.D., opinions based on Dr. Stoukides’ personal,', 'incorrect definition of undue influence;', '“c.', 'Submitting the breach of fiduciary duty claim to the jury; and', '“d.', 'Failing to give certain jury instructions requested by the', 'defendant.”', '- 20 - Louttit argues that, by failing to give this instruction, the trial justice “rubber stamped” Dr. Stoukides’s opinion that Ms. Hathaway was susceptible to undue influence.', 'We have said that a refusal to grant a requested jury instruction “constitutes reversible error only if the requested instruction (assuming that it is otherwise appropriate) is not ‘fairly covered’ in the instructions that the trial justice actually chooses to give.” State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1033 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Price, 706 A.2d 929, 934 (R.I. 1998)). The instruction actually imparted by the trial justice was as follows:', '“If expert testimony is admitted into this case, you will be required', 'to assess the credibility of that testimony and determine how much', 'weight you will give it. Simply because a witness has been', 'identified to you as an expert does not mean that you are required to', 'accept what he or she says as true. You must consider each expert', 'opinion admitted into evidence in this case and give it such weight', 'as you think it deserves.” It is the opinion of this Court that the instruction given was appropriate, and “fairly covered” the jury’s charge to weigh the expert opinions provided and to assess their credibility. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1033 (quoting Price, 706 A.2d at 934).', 'Louttit also argues that it was error to allow Dr. Stoukides to give “his personal, (incorrect) definition[] of * * * undue influence.” Doctor Stoukides testified that he understood the concept of undue influence to be as follows:', '“Basically it’s the susceptibility, I guess, of a person to be influenced', 'by another because of either their need for acceptance of the other,', 'their dependence on another person to meet their needs, or to get', 'their information and to make a decision that isn’t their decision', 'based on the influence of another person that would go against their', 'values, against their baseline construct of what that person is and be', 'changed by another person.” Despite Louttit’s claim to the contrary, we fail to discern any meaningful difference between that testimony and the definition of undue influence that has been adopted by this Court. As recounted', '- 21 - supra, we have defined undue influence to be the “substitution of the will of the dominant party for the free will and choice of the subservient party.” Bettez, 114 A.3d at 85 (brackets omitted) (quoting In re Estate of Picillo, 99 A.3d at 982). Doctor Stoukides’s recitation is largely in line with that definition and therefore the admission of his testimony in that regard did not prejudice Louttit in any way.', 'For all of these reasons, it is clear to us that the trial justice performed his duty properly when considering the motion for new trial and that he did not “overlook[] or misconceive[] material evidence” and was not “otherwise clearly wrong in performing his * * * function.” Bajakian, 880 A.2d at 852 (quoting Sarkisian, 512 A.2d at 835). Accordingly, we will not disturb the ruling of the trial justice with regard to Louttit’s motion for new trial on the issue of undue influence. See id. The challenged trust amendments and partnership gifts of 2000 and 2001 are thus void and of no force or effect.', 'C', 'Testamentary Capacity', 'Louttit argues that Branson failed to present sufficient evidence to support her claim that Ms. Hathaway lacked testamentary capacity to execute the trust amendments and limited partnership gifts. We do not reach that argument, however, because this Court, already having determined that the trust amendments and limited partnership gifts were properly nullified on the ground of undue influence, need not undertake any discussion of Ms. Hathaway’s testamentary capacity, or lack thereof, because the issue has become moot. See Boyer v. Bedrosian, 57 A.3d 259, 272 (R.I. 2012) (“A case is moot if there is no continuing stake in the controversy, or if the court’s judgment would fail to have any practical effect on the controversy.”).', '- 22 -', 'D', 'Passion, Sympathy, and Prejudice', 'Louttit next argues that a new trial is required on all counts because the jury was “influenced, if not overcome, by sympathy, passion and prejudice.” She arrives at this conclusion because the jury found that Louttit had breached her fiduciary duty and awarded the trust the sum of $441,290 in damages—greatly exceeding the $10,000 that Branson had requested during the course of her closing argument. Although the trial justice granted Louttit’s motion for judgment as a matter of law on the issue of fiduciary duty for reasons discussed infra, and thus vacated the award of damages, Louttit argues that only a new nonjury trial can remedy the taint of passion, sympathy, and prejudice that infected the entire verdict.', 'It is true that “when the trial justice determines that prejudice or other improper influences have significantly tainted the jury’s award of the damages, there can be no assurance that the jury’s determination on the issue of liability has not been similarly tainted.” Yammerino v. Cranston Tennis Club, Inc., 416 A.2d 698, 701 (R.I. 1980). Moreover, “[t]o assure the losing party that the substantive issue will be fairly determined on the evidence and according to law, a new trial must be ordered.” Id. However, in this complex case, the jury was confronted with a number of claims and issues with which to grapple, and the jury’s verdict, at least as to the issue of undue influence, was clearly supported by substantial evidence, at least to the point that “there remain[ed] factual issues upon which reasonable persons might draw different conclusions[.]” Filippi, 818 A.2d at 617 (quoting Marketing Design Source, Inc., 799 A.2d at 271). We are unable to agree with Louttit’s assertion that an excessive award of damages on one count, standing alone, is sufficient to support an inference that the jury’s determination on other issues before it was the product of improper passion, sympathy, or prejudice.', '- 23 -', 'E', 'Claim for Nonjury Trial', 'Finally, Louttit argues that she is entitled to a new bench trial on the issues of testamentary capacity and undue influence. Her argument on this issue, in its entirety, is as follows:', '“The trial judge recognized that the only reason that the case was', 'decided by a jury was the presence of the breach of fiduciary duty', 'claim. If that claim remains dismissed, this Court must give the', 'appellant a new trial on the equitable claims of lack of testamentary', 'capacity and undue influence.” We repeatedly have held that “simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.” Dunn’s Corners Fire District v. Westerly Ambulance Corps, 184 A.3d 230, 235 (R.I. 2018) (brackets omitted) (quoting Giddings v. Arpin, 160 A.3d 314, 316 (R.I. 2017) (mem.)). Louttit has not provided any caselaw for our review which might call the trial justice’s decision into question, nor has she engaged in a meaningful discussion of this issue. We note that the trial justice determined, after reviewing this Court’s precedent, that a litigant is entitled to a jury trial when a case presents both equitable and legal issues. 11 Based on that determination, the trial justice empaneled a jury “without prejudice to the issue being revisited” if the legal claims were later dismissed. However, neither party accepted that invitation to later revisit the issue. Accordingly, it is the opinion of this Court that 11', 'We have said that “[t]his state follows the rule of practice that any claims that could have been litigated in an action at law in 1843 must be submitted to a jury upon demand of a party.” Connor v. Sullivan, 826 A.2d 953, 958 (R.I. 2003). Moreover, “when a civil action comprises both legal and equitable claims, the legal claims, if adequately presented, must first be presented to a jury.” Egidio DiPardo & Sons, Inc. v. Lauzon, 708 A.2d 165, 172 (R.I. 1998). In Filippi v. Filippi, 818 A.2d 608 (R.I. 2003), we held that a challenge on the basis of undue influence to a pour-over provision of a will that funded a revocable trust was more akin to a trust action than to a will contest, and that “plaintiffs do not have a constitutional right to a jury trial in this equitable matter.” Filippi, 818 A.2d at 629.', '- 24 - Louttit has failed to preserve or adequately present this argument for our review, and the argument therefore has been waived.', 'F', 'Fiduciary Duty', 'Branson cross appealed from the judgment of the Superior Court. Her sole argument before this Court is that the trial justice erred when he granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of Louttit on Branson’s claim that Louttit breached her fiduciary duty as trustee of Ms. Hathaway’s living trust. Branson argues that, as a beneficiary of the trust, she suffered damage when Louttit deposited the $10,000 inheritance that Ms. Hathaway received in 2003 into college savings accounts for Louttit’s children instead of putting that money into the trust. Branson also argues that Louttit used trust funds to pay for legal fees in connection with the challenged trust amendments and limited partnership gifts.', 'As the trial justice observed, because the trust amendments were rendered a nullity by the verdict on the issues of testamentary capacity and undue influence, the trust reverted to the structure that existed before those amendments were made. As a result, the equalization clause that was added to the trust in 1997 was again in full force and effect. That clause provided:', '“[T]he Trustee shall take into consideration that it is the Settlor’s', 'desire and intention that all of the Settlor’s children share equally in', 'her estate. To that end, in distributing the Trust Estate, per stirpes,', 'to the Settlor’s issue, the Trustee shall consider all gifts and loans', 'made by the Settlor to her children or other issue during her lifetime.', 'Gifts and loans made to each child and his or her issue shall be added', 'together to arrive at a total family share for each child. To the extent', 'that the total family shares for each child are unequal, the Trustee', 'shall first allocate to each child and to the issue of a deceased child', 'the amount or amounts necessary which, when added to the total', 'family share for each child will equalize the total amounts given to', 'each child’s family during the Settlor’s lifetime.”', '- 25 - In accordance with that clause, any money that Louttit received from Ms. Hathaway, whether by means of a legitimate gift or as a result of a breach of fiduciary duty, would be taken into account when allocating each beneficiary’s family share and “will equalize the total amounts given to each child’s family during the Settlor’s lifetime.” Therefore, even if Louttit did breach her duty by diverting the $10,000 inheritance from the trust or by paying legal fees with trust funds, Branson cannot prove that she has been damaged by those actions. 12 Accordingly, Branson’s claim for damages based on Louttit’s alleged breach of fiduciary duty fails as a matter of law, and the trial justice was correct to grant Louttit’s motion for judgment as a matter of law on this issue. Because we affirm the entry of judgment as a matter of law, we vacate the trial justice’s grant of a new trial on the issue of fiduciary duty as superfluous.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed in all respects, and, because the trial justice granted judgment as a matter of law on the issue of breach of fiduciary duty, that portion of the February 4, 2016 order granting a new trial on that issue was unnecessary and is therefore vacated. The papers in this case shall be returned to the Superior Court. 12', 'We observe that nothing in the various trust documents in the record before us required that all of Ms. Hathaway’s assets be placed into the trust, nor did they prohibit Ms. Hathaway from making gifts of her assets while she still lived.', '- 26 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET', 'Wenda Branson v.

2,Daryl Heneault : v. : Kenneth Lantini et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendants, Kenneth Lantini and 1200 Hartford LLC, appeal from an order of the Superior Court denying their motion for a new trial after a jury found in favor of the plaintiff, Daryl Heneault. The defendants argue that the economic loss doctrine bars the plaintiff from recovering damages for the tort of conversion and that the trial justice erred in awarding attorneys’ fees to the plaintiff. This case came before this Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed on behalf of the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case was born of a lease agreement gone bad. The plaintiff entered into a lease with defendants to rent commercial property owned by defendants in the Town of Johnston. On or about October 31, 2013, plaintiff paid defendants the sum of $18,600, which represented $9,300 for a security deposit and $9,300 for the first month’s rent. A document, referred to by the parties as a “receipt agreement,” and dated that same day, was signed by the parties; it contained the following language: “IF FOR ANY REASON, MR KENNETH LANTINI IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE OCCUPANCY, ON OR BEFORE, NOVEMBER 14, 2013, ALL DEPOSITS ARE FULLY REFUNDABLE.” Thereafter, on November 5, 2013, the parties entered into the lease agreement. 1 The term of the lease was scheduled to begin on November 14, 2013. Before the lease period could begin, however, and for reasons further discussed infra, plaintiff was unable to occupy the commercial premises. As a result, plaintiff requested the return of the $18,600 payment he made to defendants. Although a sum of $9,300, representing the first month’s rent, was eventually returned to plaintiff, defendants refused to return the $9,300 security deposit. Consequently, plaintiff filed an action in the Superior Court against defendants, alleging that the refusal to return the security deposit constituted a conversion of plaintiff’s property as well as a breach of contract. 2 1', 'Although plaintiff signed the receipt agreement and lease agreement on behalf of GM Research Group, Inc. (the name of which was corrected to GM Management, Inc. on the lease agreement and was referred to as such in plaintiff’s complaint), the record reflects that plaintiff was the successor-in-interest and assignee to the company. Moreover, Mr. Lantini is the principal of 1200 Hartford LLC. He personally signed the receipt agreement, but signed the lease agreement on behalf of 1200 Hartford LLC. 2', 'Subsequently, defendants filed an answer to the complaint and a counterclaim against plaintiff alleging that plaintiff “has not fulfilled all his duties and obligations” under the lease agreement. As such, defendants claimed that plaintiff’s actions constituted a default and a breach of the lease', '-2-', 'In November 2017, one day before trial was to commence, the Superior Court heard motions in limine. However, defendants also filed a motion to dismiss and/or strike, scheduled to be heard that day, arguing that plaintiff’s claim for conversion was barred by the economic loss doctrine. 3 In response, plaintiff contended that the motion was not timely filed; indeed, plaintiff’s counsel stressed that he did not receive a copy of defendants’ motion until the previous afternoon, while he was preparing for trial. The trial justice denied the motion, ruling that it was not timely.', 'Over the following two days, a jury trial was conducted, and both plaintiff and Mr. Lantini testified. The plaintiff testified that he and his associates intended to grow medical marijuana in the building and that they were certified by the state to do so. 4 The plaintiff said that, prior to the November 14, 2013 start date on the lease, Mr. Lantini permitted plaintiff and his associates to move some equipment into the building. However, plaintiff testified, on November 2 or November 3, an official from the Town of Johnston posted a condemnation notice on the door of the building. According to plaintiff, he and his associates were then allowed to remove their equipment and belongings from the building.', 'The plaintiff testified that, according to Mr. Lantini, a meeting was later held with the mayor of Johnston, and, although Mr. Lantini attended that meeting, plaintiff did not. According to plaintiff, Mr. Lantini told him that the mayor was adamant that the marijuana operation was agreement. Both parties sought compensatory damages, punitive damages, interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees. 3', 'Neither the motions in limine nor defendants’ motion to dismiss appear on the lower court docket. 4', 'We note that, although plaintiff intended to grow medical marijuana in the commercial building, Section 5 of the lease agreement provided: “Use: The Tenant covenants and agrees to use the Premises only for an indoor gardening facility and for no other purpose. Tenant shall not use or permit the Premises to be used for any other purpose without the prior written consent of the Landlord endorsed hereon.” We also pause to remark that Section 18 of the lease agreement read: “The Tenant agrees to observe and comply with all laws, ordinances, rule[s] and regulations of the Federal, State, County, [and] Municipal authorities applicable to Premises and the business conducted by the Tenant at the Premises.”', '-3- illegal, that he did not want such an operation in the proximity of town hall, and that plaintiff and his associates should leave the building. The plaintiff further testified that Mr. Lantini told him to “just forget about it.” The plaintiff recounted that he then asked Mr. Lantini for the return of the $18,600 payment he had made, but Mr. Lantini informed him that plaintiff should contact the real estate broker involved with the lease agreement to retrieve the $9,300 for the first month’s rent. As for the $9,300 security deposit, however, plaintiff testified that Mr. Lantini told him that he was keeping it “for his aggravation.” The plaintiff testified that he never received notice from Mr. Lantini that there was any damage to the property, or any assertion that he was in default under the lease.', 'Mr. Lantini testified that, before October 31, 2013, he agreed to lease the commercial premises to plaintiff for the purpose of growing medical marijuana. Mr. Lantini further testified that he gave the first month’s rent of $9,300 to a real estate broker involved in the transaction as a means of paying the broker’s commission, but that he retained the $9,300 security deposit. Mr. Lantini also agreed that it was the town’s actions that prevented plaintiff from occupying the premises, and that, according to Mr. Lantini, the mayor was dead set against a marijuana operation in town. Mr. Lantini conceded that plaintiff had indeed made a demand for the return of his $18,600 payment. According to Mr. Lantini, he informed plaintiff that he should contact the broker for the $9,300 payment for the first month’s rent, and he added that the broker did in fact return the $9,300 payment for the first month’s rent to plaintiff. However, Mr. Lantini testified that he refused to return the $9,300 security deposit because plaintiff walked away from the lease “without even trying to do anything.”', 'Mr. Lantini also testified that he did not interfere with plaintiff’s right to possess the property in any way, that it was plaintiff’s responsibility, and not his, to obtain the necessary', '-4- permits for his operation, and that he believed that plaintiff was in default of the lease agreement because he had not paid any rent. However, Mr. Lantini was impeached with his deposition testimony, in which he said that he and the real estate broker gave back the $9,300 payment to plaintiff for the first month’s rent. Mr. Lantini also testified at trial that he never executed a termination of the lease agreement and he acknowledged that there was no damage to the building.', 'After the parties rested, 5 the trial justice instructed the jury. Although the trial justice’s instructions included the elements that were necessary to prove plaintiff’s claim for conversion and defendants’ counterclaim for breach of contract, they did not contain the elements with regard to plaintiff’s breach of contract claim. There were no objections to the court’s charge to the jury.', 'On that same day, the jury returned a verdict, finding that defendants had converted plaintiff’s security deposit to their own use. On that count, the jury awarded plaintiff $9,300 in damages. 6', 'Thereafter, posttrial motions were heard. At that hearing, defendants again argued that plaintiff’s claim for conversion should have been barred by the economic loss doctrine—the same argument that was the basis for the motion to dismiss and/or strike that the trial justice had ruled to be untimely before trial. The defendants also argued that they should be granted a new trial 5', 'When plaintiff rested, defendants argued, outside of the presence of the jury, for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In their argument, defendants contended that no evidence had been presented that Mr. Lantini had breached the lease agreement, and therefore defendants sought to dismiss plaintiff’s breach of contract claim. The court denied the Rule 50 motion. However, the record also reflects that defendants never argued at that time, or at any time during the trial, that the economic loss doctrine barred plaintiff from recovering economic damages under the tort of conversion. 6', 'The jury also awarded plaintiff punitive damages, but did not include an amount. Furthermore, the jury found that, with respect to defendants’ counterclaim for breach of contract, plaintiff had not breached or defaulted on the lease agreement.', '-5- because there was no evidence presented to the jury that indicated that defendants had breached a contract, and the jury charge never instructed the jury to find whether Mr. Lantini was in breach.', 'For his part, plaintiff contended that, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-1-45, he was entitled to attorneys’ fees because “against all the evidence, Mr. Lantini continued to claim that he was in the right, he had the right to not only retain the $9,300 security deposit, but also to countersue [plaintiff] for tens of thousands of dollars on breach of contract.”', 'The trial justice found, when addressing the posttrial motions, that the economic loss doctrine did not apply to the case at bar because the case sounded in breach of contract, and he therefore denied defendants’ motion for new trial. 7 Moreover, the trial justice awarded attorneys’ fees to plaintiff under § 9-1-45 in the sum of $24,075 because, according to the trial justice, the case arose out of a breach of contract, there was no justiciable issue of law, and the amount that plaintiff sought to recover for his attorneys’ fees was reasonable. An order entered granting plaintiff’s motion for costs and attorneys’ fees, and denying defendants’ renewed motion to dismiss and/or strike and motion for a new trial. Judgment entered on January 2, 2018, awarding plaintiff compensatory damages plus interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees.', 'For reasons that cannot be discerned from the record, defendants filed a second motion for a new trial, and a hearing took place on January 8, 2018. At that hearing, defendants again argued that they were entitled to a new trial because the economic loss doctrine barred plaintiff from recovering any damages under the conversion claim. Once more, defendants contended that the doctrine applied to this case because plaintiff did not suffer a personal injury, but economic damages only. Although defendants acknowledged that plaintiff included a breach of contract 7', 'The trial justice did, however, grant defendants’ Rule 50 motion in part, with respect to the jury’s finding in favor of plaintiff on his claim for punitive damages.', '-6- claim in his complaint, they pointed out that plaintiff indicated at trial that defendants never breached the contract, and that the jury charge never included an instruction for the breach of contract claim against defendants. Moreover, defendants argued that attorneys’ fees should not have been awarded to plaintiff because plaintiff’s breach of contract claim against defendants was not submitted to the jury and, therefore, it could not be said that the award arose from a breach of contract claim.', 'The trial justice disagreed. He found that he had based the attorneys’ fees award on a breach of contract, even though there was not a specific instruction to the jury on plaintiff’s breach of contract claim. He reasoned that there had been general instructions on contract law and whether the parties had abandoned the contract in the charge. The trial justice also held that the economic loss doctrine did not bar plaintiff’s recovery.', 'Therefore, the trial justice denied defendants’ motion for a new trial and he affirmed the award of attorneys’ fees to plaintiff. An order denying defendants’ motion for a new trial was entered on January 10, 2018. The defendants timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled that our review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial is deferential.” Letizio v.

PJC of Rhode Island, Inc., 184 A.3d 712, 719 (R.I. 2018)). “In considering a motion for a new trial, the trial justice sits as a super juror and is required to make an independent appraisal of the evidence in light of his or her charge to the jury.” Id. (quoting Kemp, 184 A.3d at 719). “If, after conducting this analysis, the trial justice concludes that the evidence is evenly balanced or that reasonable minds could differ on the verdict, she or he should not disturb the jury’s decision.” Id. (quoting', '-7- Kemp, 184 A.3d at 719). “If the trial justice has performed this task, then his or her decision will not be disturbed unless the plaintiff can show that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting Kemp, 184 A.3d at 719). “However, with respect to a motion for a new trial on questions concerning ‘an alleged error of law, our review is de novo.’” Berman v. Sitrin, 101 A.3d 1251, 1260 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Children’s Friend & Service v.

The defendants contend that the economic loss doctrine declares that commercial transactions are more properly suited to the law of contract than to the law of tort, and that sophisticated commercial entities should resort to contract law rather than tort law to seek economic damages. The defendants stress that the parties were commercial entities entering into a lease for commercial property and, therefore, plaintiff should have been barred from recovering under a tort remedy in this case.', '-8-', 'However, upon reviewing the record in the Superior Court, we note that defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on the economic loss doctrine argument just before trial was to begin. The plaintiff objected that he had not received proper notice of the motion to dismiss, and the trial justice, correctly in our opinion, dismissed the motion as not timely. The defendants never raised the economic loss doctrine argument again until the posttrial hearings, which took place well after the jury had rendered a verdict for plaintiff on the conversion claim. We are therefore of the opinion that, because defendants never raised the economic loss doctrine argument during trial, and because the alleged error of law was an entirely new issue raised at the hearing on the motion for a new trial, it has been waived by defendants. In Tyre v. Swain, 946 A.2d 1189 (R.I. 2008), we held that a party may not raise an entirely new issue during a hearing on a motion for a new trial; rather, claims of an alleged error of law may be raised only if the party had previously made that argument at a preverdict stage of the trial. See Tyre, 946 A.2d at 1202. It is well settled that, “in accordance with this Court’s longstanding raise-or-waive rule, if an issue was not properly asserted, and thereby preserved, in the lower tribunals, this Court will not consider the issue on appeal.” Adams v. Santander Bank, N.A., 183 A.3d 544, 548 (R.I. 2018) (brackets omitted) (quoting Miller v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 160 A.3d 975, 980 (R.I. 2017)). We conclude without hesitation that defendants have waived the economic loss doctrine argument and may not now revive the argument on appeal.', 'B', 'Attorneys’ Fees', 'The defendants next contend that the trial justice erred when he awarded attorneys’ fees to plaintiff pursuant to § 9-1-45. The defendants argue that that statute confines an award for attorneys’ fees to situations in which there has been a finding of breach of contract by the party', '-9- against whom the attorneys’ fees are awarded.

We recognize that plaintiff alleged a breach of contract claim against defendants in his complaint. However, plaintiff did not pursue that claim at trial and, significantly, there was no jury charge', '- 10 - instructing the jury on a breach of contract claim against defendants. Further of note, there was no objection to the charge that the trial justice imparted to the jury.

City of Central Falls, 764 A.2d 151, 156 (R.I. 2001) (defining § 9-1-45 as “allow[ing] an award of attorney’s fees for a party’s prosecution of nonjusticiable breach-of-contract claims”) (emphasis added); see also Glassie v. Doucette, 159 A.3d 88, 98 (R.I. 2017) (holding that a dispute over a bequest in a will was “not a ‘civil action arising from a breach of contract’” and that, consequently, there was “no basis under § 9-1-45 for an award of attorney’s fees”). Therefore, it is our opinion that § 9-1-45 cannot be the basis for an attorneys’ fees award in this case, and, consequently, that part of the judgment awarding attorneys’ fees to plaintiff under that statute must be vacated.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the judgment entered in the Superior Court is affirmed in part and vacated in part.

3,"Rollingwood Acres, Inc. et al. : v. : Rhode Island Department of Environmental : Management et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. Rollingwood Acres, Inc. (Rollingwood), Smithfield Peat Co., Inc. (Smithfield Peat), and Smithfield Crushing Co., LLC (Smithfield Crushing) (collectively, plaintiffs) appealed from a Notice of Violation (NOV) issued on November 6, 2006 by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM). The NOV alleged ten discrete violations of the Rhode Island Water Pollution Act, DEM’s Water Quality Regulations, the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control Act, DEM’s Oil Pollution Control Regulations, and DEM’s Regulations for the Rhode Island Pollution Discharge Elimination System. After a hearing before the Administrative Adjudication Division of DEM (AAD), the plaintiffs prevailed on all but two of the alleged violations. The plaintiffs requested reasonable litigation expenses under the Equal Access to Justice for Small Businesses and Individuals Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 92 of title 42 (EAJA). The AAD hearing officer denied their request, finding that DEM’s “decision to initiate and proceed with the enforcement action was based on substantial justification” within the meaning of EAJA. The plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court under the Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 35 of title 42 (APA), which upheld the AAD’s denial of reasonable litigation expenses. The plaintiffs then filed a petition for the issuance of writ of', '-1- certiorari, seeking this Court’s review of the Superior Court’s decision, which we granted. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case has a protracted history dating back to the 1980s. The facts of the case have been recounted many times throughout the various administrative and Superior Court decisions; therefore, we include only details relevant to the case before us now.', 'A', 'Permit Issuance', 'Rollingwood is the record owner of property located at 961 Douglas Pike, Route 7, in Smithfield (the property). Smithfield Peat operates a leaf and yard waste composting facility at the property and is registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a hazardous waste generator.', 'Smithfield Crushing operates a rock crushing facility at the property.1', 'In May 1982, DEM issued a freshwater wetlands permit to Smithfield Peat. The permit authorized Smithfield Peat to alter freshwater wetlands by excavating, filling, and grading within fifty feet of an unnamed swamp to remove peat, construct two stormwater detention basins, install a sewer line, and construct a road. In accordance with the permit, Smithfield Peat was required to use fifteen-inch-diameter discharge pipes as part of its stormwater detention basins. The plaintiffs spent over $100,000 and two years constructing the authorized drainage structure. 1', 'All three entities list their principal place of business as 295 Washington Highway, Smithfield, Rhode Island. Jackson Despres is the Vice President of Rollingwood, President of Smithfield Peat, and Managing Member of Smithfield Crushing.', '-2-', 'B', 'Complaint and Initial Inspections', 'From 1996 through 1997, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation (DOT) carried out a project to improve Route 7. Part of this project was located along Rollingwood’s property. Without plaintiffs’ knowledge and without seeking a permit from DEM, DOT replaced plaintiffs’ fifteen-inch-diameter pipe with an eighteen-inch-diameter pipe. The plaintiffs discovered the larger pipe only after DOT had finished its project. The larger pipe resulted in the drainage system’s increased discharge of turbid, or sediment-laden, water into a stream.', 'To add insult to injury, on December 3, 1996, a DOT employee filed a complaint with DEM stating that plaintiffs’ drainage structure was discharging turbid water into a stream. As a result, DEM, through its Office of Compliance and Inspection (OC&I), made two site inspections in January 1997. Sean Carney, a site inspector, observed a “discharge of sediment into a stream in non-conformity with the permit letter * * * .” DEM concluded that the sediment was discharging from plaintiffs’ detention basin and that the Route 7 project had also contributed to unpermitted discharge levels. On June 3, 1997, DEM issued a Notice of Intent to Enforce (NOIE) to plaintiffs, which required remediation of the drainage structure. The plaintiffs apparently took no action in response to the NOIE, nor did DEM seek to enforce the NOIE; however, DEM’s case file on this matter remained open.', 'C', 'Follow-Up Investigations and Discovery of the Oil Pollution Violations', 'Over eight years later, DEM revisited the property on February 9, 2005, when Peter Naumann, a DEM site inspector, was investigating another complaint in the area. During that inspection, Naumann noticed an “oily sheen” in one of plaintiffs’ retention ponds, which caused', '-3- him to suspect an oil spill. Naumann quickly notified plaintiffs and DEM Emergency Response. The plaintiffs immediately secured Lincoln Environmental, Inc. for remedial work, which, within hours, began containing and cleaning up the oil discharge.', 'On February 10, 2005, Naumann returned to the property for follow-up testing of the oil spill and runoff water. He collected five water samples for a variety of tests, including turbidity and hydrocarbon presence. Four of the water samples were taken from the water on the property or downstream of the property, and one background sample was taken from a nearby, but unconnected, stream. The samples revealed the presence of hydrocarbons, which indicated that a petroleum product had been released on the property. The plaintiffs determined that the oil source came from a pile of stone and waste rock that Smithfield Peat had recently obtained from the Narragansett Bay Commission Combined Sewer Overflow Tunnel project.', 'On April 4, 2006, Patrick Hogan, another DEM site inspector, returned to take additional water samples because the 2005 background sample, taken from an unconnected stream, could not be used. Again, Hogan observed the discharge water’s turbidity. Hogan could not find an appropriate upstream sample, and later testified that he was unable to do so because “[t]here is no upstream with this location * * * [t]he water seems to begin right there.” Due to the lack of a suitable upstream location to take a sample, Hogan collected a sample roughly 1,500 feet downstream from the discharge to function as DEM’s background sample.', 'D', 'DEM’s Issuance of a Notice of Violation and Plaintiffs’ Administrative Appeal', 'On November 6, 2006, DEM issued an NOV against plaintiffs, and assessed an administrative penalty of $31,470. The NOV charged plaintiffs with violations of the Rhode Island Water Pollution Act, DEM’s Water Quality Regulations, the Rhode Island Oil Pollution Control', '-4- Act, DEM’s Oil Pollution Control Regulations, and DEM’s Regulations for the Rhode Island Pollution Discharge Elimination System.', 'The plaintiffs appealed the NOV to AAD. Five years later, an AAD hearing officer conducted an extensive administrative hearing, with six days of testimony from nine witnesses over the course of five months in late 2011 and early 2012. During the course of the hearing, plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss for failure to join DOT as an indispensable party, which was denied before the end of the hearing.2', 'The AAD hearing officer issued a comprehensive decision on June 27, 2012 (Merits Decision). Finding that DEM had not met its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence to support most of the violations, the hearing officer dismissed all but two violations. The water pollution violations were dismissed for lack of a valid background sample. The hearing officer found that the water samples “were not taken in accordance with the Water Quality Regulations and are of no use in proving a turbidity violation by [DEM].” “Without a valid upstream sample[,]” the hearing officer noted, “all of [DEM’s] samples and testing on turbidity are meaningless.” 2', 'We note this action because of plaintiffs’ repeated insistence that DOT was to blame. On December 6, 2011, at the end of DEM’s direct case, plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss for failure to join an indispensable party. The plaintiffs argued that the evidence in DEM’s case established that DOT was an indispensable party to the pending appeal. In his decision and order, the hearing officer recognized that the testimony and documentary evidence showed that, before DOT’s project, plaintiffs’ drainage system was properly permitted and properly operating. The evidence showed that it was, indeed, DOT’s removal of the fifteen-inch-diameter pipe and replacement with the eighteen-inch-diameter pipe that caused the turbidity. The hearing officer, however, citing to Root v. Providence Water Supply Board, 850 A.2d 94 (R.I. 2004) (discussing whether complete relief can be afforded in the absence of the indispensable party), asked: “Can complete relief be granted in the absence of [DOT] as a party?” He stated that although it was “clear that [DOT] could have been cited” for its violations, and that he was “troubled” by DOT’s removal of a properly permitted, properly functioning drainage system without seeking DEM approval, he did not find DOT to be an indispensable party because relief could be afforded to plaintiffs without DOT. The hearing officer further stated that plaintiffs’ evidence regarding DOT’s involvement sounded more like a defense to the water pollution charges.', '-5-', 'David Chopy, director of OC&I, testified at the administrative hearing about DEM’s decision to issue turbidity-related violations to plaintiffs rather than to DOT. He testified, according to the Merits Decision, that “he didn’t know who changed the drainage system but assumed that [plaintiffs], as owners of the property, had either made the change [to the drainage system] or consented to it.” He further testified, the Merits Decision states, that “he didn’t have any other facts or information” that would indicate that plaintiffs were responsible for the change to the authorized drainage system. In the Merits Decision, the hearing officer noted that “[w]hen asked if [Chopy] read the notes to file [on DOT’s involvement] Chopy’s response very often was that he probably read the notes but didn’t recall.” The hearing officer stated: “After hearing all the evidence on the issue of turbidity, it is clear that [plaintiffs] were victimized by [DOT]. Instead of following up and holding [DOT] responsible for its involvement in this matter [DEM] charged [plaintiffs] only.”', 'In dismissing two of the alleged oil pollution violations, the hearing officer at the outset noted that these violations are “separate and apart” from the water pollution violations. He found that plaintiffs were not aware of the oil discharge, thus they were not liable to DEM for failure to immediately notify it of the release, and that, once aware, plaintiffs immediately initiated remediation on the property, and thereby were not liable for failure to immediately clean the oil discharge. The hearing officer did find that plaintiffs received product contaminated with oil and were therefore responsible for the oil discharge into waters of the state under a strict liability theory. The hearing officer reduced the administrative penalty from $31,470 to $2,615. When explaining his decision to do so, the hearing officer noted that Chopy had testified that he had assessed the warranted monetary penalty for plaintiffs’ violation as “moderate” rather than', '-6- “minor”—not because of any factors in the Administrative Penalty matrix,3 but simply because Smithfield Peat was a registered small-quantity generator with oil and he would expect its employees to be familiar with oil releases.', 'Both parties timely appealed the hearing officer’s Merits Decision to the Superior Court, and both appeals were ultimately dismissed.', 'E', 'EAJA Request', 'On July 27, 2012, plaintiffs filed a request for litigation expenses under the EAJA and Rule 1.20 of DEM’s AAD Rules and Regulations, 250 R.I. Code R. § 10-00-1.20.4 Finding that plaintiffs were not “parties” under the EAJA, the hearing officer denied plaintiffs’ request. The plaintiffs appealed that decision to the Superior Court.

Code R. § 130-00-1.10(A)(1)(b). Those factors include:', '“(1) The extent to which the act or failure to act was out of', 'compliance;', '“(2) Environmental conditions;', '“(3) The amount of the pollutant;', '“(4) The toxicity or nature of the pollutant;', '“(5) The duration of the violation;', '“(6) The areal extent of the violation;', '“(7) Whether the person took reasonable and appropriate steps to', 'prevent and/or mitigate the non-compliance;', '“***', '“(9) The degree of willfulness or negligence, including but not', 'limited to, how much control the violator had over the occurrence of', 'the violation and whether the violation was foreseeable[.]” Id. 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 42-92-4 of the EAJA requires agencies that are authorized to conduct adjudicatory proceedings to “establish uniform procedures for the submission and consideration of applications for an award[.]” Accordingly, 250 R.I.

Recognizing that most of the charges against plaintiffs had been dismissed, the hearing officer nonetheless found that DEM was substantially justified both in initiating the investigation as a response to a complaint and in pursuing the NOV. The plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court on March 14, 2014.', 'F', 'Superior Court Decision', 'The Superior Court set a briefing schedule, and plaintiffs and defendants filed memoranda on the AAD EAJA Denial. On December 15, 2014, the trial justice issued her decision upholding the AAD EAJA Denial. The plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider on June 18, 2015, which was heard and denied on September 10, 2015. Final judgment entered on October 9, 2015. The plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court seeking our review, which we granted.', 'II', 'Statutory Framework', 'As this is the first opportunity we have had to review a fee determination initially awarded or denied under § 42-92-3(a), we are mindful of the stated purpose of the EAJA:', '“It is declared that both the state and its municipalities and their', 'respective various agencies possess a tremendous power in their', 'ability to affect the individuals and businesses they regulate or', 'otherwise affect directly. * * * Therefore, in order to encourage', 'individuals and small businesses to contest unjust actions by the', 'state and/or municipal agencies, the legislature hereby declares that', 'the financial burden borne by these individuals and small businesses', 'should be, in all fairness, subject to state and/or municipal', '-8-', 'reimbursement of reasonable litigation expenses when the', 'individual or small business prevails in contesting an agency action,', 'which was without substantial justification.” Section 42-92-1(a) and', '(b). The EAJA is a remedial statute which we are bound to read expansively to effectuate its stated purpose of reimbursing reasonable litigation expenses when contesting “unjust actions by the state[.]” Section 42-92-1(b). That is significant in this case because the actions at issue were perpetrated by two state agencies, only one of which is a party to this litigation.', 'The EAJA sets forth two procedural avenues, one for each of the fora in which the initial fee determination may be made: the agency or the court. See Tarbox v. Zoning Board of Review of Town of Jamestown, 142 A.3d 191, 196-97 (R.I. 2016). The first path occurs when a party is successful on the underlying merits at the agency level. Section 42-92-3(a) provides that “the adjudicative officer shall award to a prevailing party reasonable litigation expenses incurred by the party in connection with that proceeding” unless the officer “finds that the agency was substantially justified in actions leading to the proceedings and in the proceeding itself.” Notably, § 42-92-3(a) explicitly prohibits any other agency official from reviewing the EAJA award. If a party is “dissatisfied with the fee determination by the adjudicatory officer,” he or she may appeal, under § 42-92-5, “to the court having jurisdiction to review the merits of the underlying decision of the agency adversary adjudication.” Section 42-92-5; see also Tarbox, 142 A.3d at 197. The statute further provides for “a de novo review of the record” by the court. Id.', 'The second scenario, with which we are not confronted in this matter, occurs under § 42- 92-3(b). In such a case, a party receives an unfavorable decision on the underlying merits at the administrative level and then appeals to the appropriate court. See Tarbox, 142 A.3d at 196-97. If the court reviews the underlying agency decision and the party is successful in the appeal, “an award for fees and other expenses shall be made by that court[.]” Section 42-92-3(b).', '-9-', 'Either way, whether a party may recoup litigation expenses hinges on whether the administrative agency was substantially justified in its actions. See § 42-92-3. An agency is substantially justified when “the initial position of the agency, as well as the agency’s position in the proceedings, ha[d] a reasonable basis in law and fact.” Section 42-92-2(7). This Court has previously commented that, pursuant to the EAJA substantial justification test, the state “must show not merely that its position was marginally reasonable; its position must be clearly reasonable, well founded in law and fact, solid though not necessarily correct.” Taft v. Pare, 536 A.2d 888, 893 (R.I. 1988) (quoting United States v. 1,378.65 Acres of Land, 794 F.2d 1313, 1318 (8th Cir. 1986)) (expressly adopting the Eighth Circuit’s standard of interpretation).', 'Notably, the substantial justification question “will not be precisely the same as the merits[,]” rather it is “what the Government was substantially justified in believing [the law] to have been.” Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, 561 (1988) (analyzing 28 U.S.C. § 2412, the federal equivalent of the EAJA).5 When considering the EAJA request, the court “reexamine[s] the legal and factual circumstances of the case from a different perspective than that used at any other stage of the proceeding[.]” United States v. Hallmark Construction Co., 200 F.3d 1076, 1080 (7th Cir. 2000). In doing so, the court “look[s] at the merits of the underlying action to determine if the government’s position is justified.” Oregon Natural Resources Council v. Madigan, 980 F.2d 1330, 1331 (9th Cir. 1992). A substantial justification analysis often requires a review of the record of the underlying merits decision to evaluate whether an agency’s position initially was and remained justified. See, e.g., id. at 1331-32; Kali v. Bowen, 854 F.2d 329, 332 (9th Cir. 1988); 5', 'Rhode Island’s EAJA is modeled on the federal EAJA, 28 U.S.C. § 2412. Krikorian v. Rhode Island Department of Human Services, 606 A.2d 671, 674 (R.I. 1992). Accordingly, we may turn to federal caselaw for guidance. Id. (“When a Rhode Island statute is modeled on a federal statute, this [c]ourt ‘should follow the construction put on it by the federal courts, unless there is strong reason to do otherwise.’”) (quoting Laliberte v. Providence Redevelopment Agency, 109 R.I. 565, 575, 288 A.2d 502, 508 (1972)).', '- 10 - Tarbox, 142 A.3d at 198; Krikorian v. Rhode Island Department of Human Services, 606 A.2d 671, 676 (R.I. 1992). To be sure, this Court has previously acknowledged that “any appeal from the grant or denial of a request for reasonable litigation expenses is necessarily intertwined with the agency decision”; such a request “cannot be divorced from the underlying agency action.” Tarbox, 142 A.3d at 198. We further emphasized that “any attempt to separate a request for reasonable litigation expenses under the act from review of the underlying agency decision is wholly artificial.” Id.', 'III', 'Standard of Review', '“We review the trial justice’s denial of the motion for reasonable litigation expenses under the [EAJA], as a question of law, de novo.” Campbell v. Tiverton Zoning Board, 15 A.3d 1015, 1024 (R.I. 2011). Because the question of fee determination is “necessarily intertwined with the [underlying] agency decision[,]” Tarbox, 142 A.3d at 198, we accord deference to the findings of fact in the agency’s decision. See Pierce, 487 U.S. at 559.', 'As the trial justice noted, the statutory scheme of the EAJA creates an apparent conflict concerning the scope of judicial review of the fee determination by the adjudicatory officer. Section 42-92-5 permits the court to modify the fee determination “upon a de novo review of the record.” Section 42-92-7, however, clarifies that the EAJA “is intended to supplement the provisions of” the APA, and that the APA controls in the event of any conflict between the two. The APA provides for a deferential standard of review:', '“The court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as', 'to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may', 'affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further', 'proceedings, or it may reverse or modify the decision if substantial', 'rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the', 'administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:', '- 11 -', '“(1) In violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;', '“(2) In excess of the statutory authority of the agency;', '“(3) Made upon unlawful procedure;', '“(4) Affected by other error or law;', '“(5) Clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and', 'substantial evidence on the whole record; or', '“(6) Arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion', 'or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.” Section 42-35-15(g). To reconcile this seeming conflict, the trial justice appropriately turned to this Court’s analysis in Environmental Scientific Corp. v. Durfee, 621 A.2d 200 (R.I. 1993), wherein we held that an appellate tribunal must defer to the evidentiary findings of an administrative hearing officer when credibility evaluations are implicated. Durfee, 621 A.2d at 206.', '“The [hearing officer’s] impressions as he or she observes a witness and listens to testimony ‘are all important to the evidence sifting which precedes a determination of what to accept and what to disregard.’” Id. (quoting Laganiere v. Bonte Spinning Co., 103 R.I. 191, 196, 236 A.2d 256, 258 (1967)).', 'Here, the hearing officer conducted an extensive hearing on the underlying merits of DEM’s NOV, encompassing at least six separate dates, during which nine witnesses testified. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer made sixty-nine specific findings of fact, in addition to his analysis of the evidence, all of which implicate his assessment of the witnesses’ credibility. We are satisfied that those findings were entitled to deference by the Superior Court. We therefore will proceed to give deference to the findings of facts, but review questions of law de novo. See Durfee, 621 A.2d at 206.', '- 12 -', 'IV', 'Discussion', 'First, plaintiffs argue that the trial justice and hearing officer erred in concluding that DEM was “per se” substantially justified because the initial complaint, filed in 1996, was not cited as a basis for issuing the NOV, filed in 2006.6 DEM maintains that it was substantially justified because it was investigating a complaint, acting under its statutory authority and duty. DEM notes that the file opened when the NOIE issued in 1997 and had never been closed, and that, often, one complaint leads to the next.', 'Second, plaintiffs argue that DEM was not substantially justified leading up to the filing of the NOV as well as throughout the adjudicatory proceedings. The plaintiffs maintain that DEM should have issued the NOV to DOT—and not plaintiffs—because of the evidence demonstrated at the underlying adjudicatory proceeding, particularly with respect to the replacement of their fifteen-inch-diameter pipe with DOT’s eighteen-inch-diameter pipe. The plaintiffs also argue that DEM improperly issued the NOV based on water samples DEM knew could not support a legally- viable claim. Last, plaintiffs contend that DEM had no basis to issue the two dismissed oil violations.', 'DEM counters that it had a reasonable basis to believe plaintiffs were culpable in, or had knowledge of, the drainage alteration. DEM points out that DOT’s involvement has no bearing on whether DEM was substantially justified in bringing action against plaintiffs. Moreover, DEM argues that it is not required to issue NOVs to every potentially responsible party. In response to the failure to include an upstream water sample, DEM argues that the choice of the background 6', 'The trial justice, hearing officer, and parties refer to a situation where an investigation is initiated by a complaint that the agency is statutorily charged with investigating as “per se” substantial justification.', '- 13 - water sample was one based on DEM’s technical expertise and a reasonable interpretation of the regulation given the surrounding circumstances. Finally, DEM maintains that it was justified in issuing the two oil pollution violations—plaintiffs’ alleged failure to immediately respond to the oil discharge and failure to immediately report the violation to DEM—because DEM had reason to believe plaintiffs were aware of the oil discharge before DEM notified plaintiffs of it.', 'A', 'Administrative Decision', 'This case comes to us under § 42-92-3(a) and § 42-92-5, where both the underlying decision on the merits and fee determination were initially made at the agency level. Because the hearing officer relied on the Merits Decision’s factual findings in his AAD EAJA Denial, a brief summary of the pertinent portions of the Merits Decision provides the backdrop for our review.7 With respect to the issue of turbidity, the hearing officer starkly concluded that plaintiffs were “victimized” by DOT, and that DEM, “[i]nstead of following up and holding [DOT] responsible for its involvement[,]” charged only plaintiffs. In support of his conclusion, the hearing officer referenced several “notes to file” submitted by DEM reflecting DEM’s awareness that DOT was involved in the installation of the unauthorized eighteen-inch-diameter pipe. Carney testified that DOT promised a letter explaining its involvement, but the letter never came.', 'The hearing officer further noted a letter to DOT from Harold Ellis, the Supervisor of the Wetlands Compliance Section of OC&I, in which Ellis indicated that DEM had been advised that the original fifteen-inch-diameter pipe had been replaced as part of the Route 7 reconstruction project carried out by DOT. Ellis requested a response from DOT as to how the matter might be 7', 'We rely on the facts in the Merits Decision because we find it to include sufficient details as to the evidence that DEM had before it when it decided to issue the NOV against plaintiffs. We recognize that not all administrative hearings on the underlying merits will be as illuminative and as helpful.', '- 14 - resolved, but again DOT never responded. This correspondence from Ellis was the last action taken by DEM until Naumann’s site inspection several years later in 2005. Significantly, the hearing officer found that Naumann’s “visit was not the result of a complaint but a follow up inspection while he was in the area on another complaint.”', 'The NOV with respect to turbidity was issued by DEM on November 6, 2006. Chopy testified about DEM’s decision to charge plaintiffs with the violations relating to turbidity. According to the Merits Decision, he said that he did not know who had changed the drainage system “but assumed that [plaintiffs], as owners of the property, had either made the change or consented to it.” When asked if he had read the numerous notes and correspondence indicating that DOT “bore some or all of the responsibility[,]” his response often was that he probably had read them but did not recall. The hearing officer allowed that “it is quite possible that Mr. Chopy did not see all the evidence pointing to [DOT’s] involvement in this matter[,]” but he also noted Chopy’s acknowledgment that DOT “often violate[s] environmental laws and regulations[.]”', 'The hearing officer, in the Merits Decision, ultimately concluded that DEM had not sustained its burden of proof that plaintiffs had caused the increased sediment discharge and that “the changes made to [plaintiffs’] drainage system were done by [DOT] without [plaintiffs’] knowledge or consent.”', 'In light of these facts, when deciding plaintiffs’ EAJA request, the hearing officer nonetheless concluded that DEM was substantially justified in initiating and pursuing its actions against plaintiffs. The hearing officer first determined that DEM was entitled to substantial justification because the underlying actions leading to and throughout the proceedings of the Merits Decision were initiated by the December 3, 1996 complaint filed by a DOT employee. The', '- 15 - hearing officer continued to find that, even without the complaint, DEM was substantially justified because turbid water had been found emanating from plaintiffs’ property.', 'B', 'Superior Court Decision', 'In her decision, the Superior Court justice adopted the hearing officer’s determination that DEM was substantially justified because a complaint had initiated DEM’s actions. The trial justice likewise found DEM’s actions were substantially justified even if it was not acting in response to a complaint. She reviewed the evidence in the Merits Decision regarding DOT’s involvement and found that, during the proceedings, DEM “had reason to believe that [plaintiffs] were at least partially involved in the alteration of the drainage structure.” The trial justice found DEM’s actions rational “in determining that the owners of the [p]roperty were the reasonable parties for altering the drainage.”', 'C', 'Substantial Justification', '1', 'The EAJA provides, in pertinent part, that “[a]ny agency charged by statute with investigating complaints shall be deemed to have substantial justification for the investigation and for the proceedings subsequent to the investigation.” Section 42-92-2(2).

Its preliminary investigation into the cause of the turbid water seemed to dwindle to nothing; yet, had DEM followed up on its investigation, it may well have included DOT as a party to the alleged violation. In the Merits Decision, the hearing officer referenced Chopy’s testimony that DOT “has a history of not complying with wetlands statutes and water quality statutes[,]” and that DEM “has issued dozens and dozens of NOVs and informal notices” against DOT for various offenses. Chopy further testified that DEM “attempted to investigate the involvement of [DOT] but never got a satisfactory response.” According to the hearing officer, Chopy “said that if they had issued a[n] NOV to [DOT] that they would have got to the bottom of it.” As the hearing officer ultimately concluded, DEM knew or should have known of DOT’s involvement. Moreover, DEM only revived its action against plaintiffs when a DEM site inspector visited the property as “a follow up inspection while he was in the area on another complaint.”', 'Under these circumstances, we are not satisfied that there is a sufficient nexus between the original complaint in 1996 and the NOV issued in 2006 to entitle DEM to the shield that it was substantially justified in initiating and pursuing the administrative proceedings against plaintiffs. Therefore, DEM’s actions did not warrant the blanket protection of substantial justification afforded by § 42-92-2(2) and Rule 1.20(F)(2)(c).', '2', 'The trial justice also found that, even if the NOV was not the direct result of a complaint, DEM’s actions were nonetheless substantially justified. The trial justice reviewed the evidence surrounding the water samples and found that “DEM’s investigation was not rendered unreasonable by the lack of adequate background samples.” Deferring to the expertise and on-the-', '- 18 - spot judgment required by the site investigator at the time, the trial justice concluded that, although the hearing officer was correct in determining that the lack of a valid background sample rendered the water samples “meaningless” at the adjudicatory hearing, the lack of a valid background sample did not render DEM’s investigation “unreasonable.” Finally, regarding the oil pollution violations, the trial justice concluded that DEM had a reasonable basis to believe that plaintiffs would have known about an oil discharge before DEM’s discovery, particularly in light of Smithfield Peat’s registration as a small-quantity generator of oil with the EPA.', 'Before this Court, plaintiffs argue that (1) at the time the NOV was filed, DEM knew and had evidence that DOT was responsible for the pipe exchange which caused turbid water to discharge; (2) DEM improperly issued the NOV against plaintiffs based on water samples it knew could not support a legally viable claim; and (3) DEM had no basis to issue the two dismissed oil pollution violations.', 'DEM argues that DOT’s culpability is irrelevant to the substantial justification inquiry, and that, while DEM knew DOT was involved, DEM believed plaintiffs were also at fault. Moreover, DEM argues that it is not required to issue NOVs to every potentially responsible party. For example, as evidence of DEM’s belief that plaintiffs, too, might be responsible, DEM points to testimony by Chopy that he was not aware DOT had replaced pipes on private property without the landowner’s consent. DEM essentially argues that, because turbid water was discharging from plaintiffs’ property, it was justified in issuing the NOV to plaintiffs.', 'This argument, however, glosses over what scant evidence DEM had at the time it issued the NOV about both plaintiffs’ and DOT’s involvement. DEM was aware that DOT had a history of ignoring environmental regulations. Chopy provided testimony that DEM issued the NOV not because they had evidence that any of plaintiffs were responsible for the pipe change, but because', '- 19 - Rollingwood was owner of the property.10 The hearing officer also noted that “consider[ing] the length of time from the initial incident to the issuance of the NOV it is quite possible that Mr. Chopy did not see all the evidence pointing to [DOT’s] involvement in this matter.” The fact that an agency official might not review all the evidence before issuing a NOV is particularly troubling and indicative of the very type of governmental abuse the EAJA is intended to remedy.', 'In response to plaintiffs’ background sample argument, DEM argues that it was reasonable to pursue an investigation and rely on those samples even though the samples were inadequate to support the NOV at the administrative hearing. To address the lack of background samples, DEM focuses much on the reasonableness of the site inspector’s decision.', 'To support its contention that the allegation of oil pollution violations was justified, DEM notes that the record indicates the oil had been discharging for two or three days before DEM observed the release. This evidence, however, speaks only to the existence of the oil sheen and not to the knowledge of plaintiffs, which is a key factor in DEM’s issuance of the violations for failure to immediately respond and report. See 250 R.I. Code R. § 130-00-1.10.', 'With respect to the NOV concerning these alleged violations of the Rhode Island State Water Pollution Act and DEM’s Water Quality Regulations, we are of the opinion that DEM was not substantially justified in its actions leading up to the adjudicatory proceedings. As we have explained supra, DEM knew or should have known of DOT’s involvement, and that DOT, not plaintiffs, should have been held responsible. As the hearing officer concluded: “The discharge 10', 'The hearing officer summarized Chopy’s testimony on this point as follows: “He said that they cited the [plaintiffs] because they are the property owners and presumably consented to the smaller [sic] pipe being installed. He said that Smithfield Peat and Smithfield Crushing Co., LLC don’t own the property but Rollingwood Acres, Inc. does. He has no information to support that the [plaintiffs] consented to the installation of the pipe.” The hearing officer found that plaintiffs had not given permission to DOT to alter the drainage structure and were not aware that DOT had changed the drainage structure until the alteration was completed.', '- 20 - [of silt] is due to the unauthorized changes made by [DOT].” DEM’s omission was its failure to complete its investigation of DOT’s culpability, notwithstanding its knowledge that DOT had routinely violated environmental laws and regulations. As a result, DEM resuscitated a long- defunct investigation against plaintiffs, and ultimately charged them with five alleged water quality violations for which they seemingly bore no responsibility.', 'In addition, those five alleged violations were based on water samples that were not taken in accordance with DEM’s own water quality regulations. As the hearing officer found: “Without a valid upstream sample all of [DEM’s] samples and testing on turbidity are meaningless.” While we do not fault the site inspector’s on-the-spot judgment call regarding where to take the water samples, nor would that alone tip the balance of our opinion on DEM’s substantial justification, the lack of valid background samples is further evidence that DEM’s position was “shaky from the start[.]” Sierra Club v. Secretary of Army, 820 F.2d 513, 520 (1st Cir. 1987).', 'Regarding the two oil pollution charges that DEM failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence, we also conclude that DEM was not substantially justified. The charges alleged that plaintiffs failed to report the oil spill immediately and failed to begin containment and removal of the oil immediately. The evidence adduced at the hearing on the merits disclosed that the presence of a petroleum-based product was first discovered on the property by Naumann when he conducted his inspection on February 9, 2005. The record is devoid of any evidence that plaintiffs were aware of the contamination before that time. When notified of the problem, plaintiffs contacted Lincoln Environmental, which responded to the property “while Mr. Naumann was still conducting his initial investigation.” Thus, DEM was fully aware that plaintiffs had acted promptly to contain the petroleum product, and it had no evidence that plaintiffs had any previous knowledge of the', '- 21 - oil discharge. We are satisfied that DEM has failed to show that it acted with substantial justification with respect to those two charges.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'Although we have determined that DEM acted without substantial justification in pursuing various charges against the plaintiffs, we are mindful that it was another state agency, DOT, that made the changes to the plaintiffs’ drainage system without the plaintiffs’ knowledge or consent. DEM’s responsibility stems from its failure to fully investigate the cause of the turbid water on the plaintiffs’ property when it knew or should have known of DOT’s involvement. It was DOT, however, that precipitated the sediment discharge by replacing the fifteen-inch-diameter pipe with the eighteen-inch-diameter pipe without the knowledge or consent of any of the plaintiffs and without obtaining a permit from DEM. As a result, the plaintiffs have been embroiled in a twenty- two-year saga somewhat reminiscent of the Hotel California (“You can check out any time you like / But you can never leave!”).11 In the words of the hearing officer, the plaintiffs were “victimized by [DOT].” We are convinced that this is the type of “unjust action[] by the state” that the EAJA was designed to ameliorate. Section 42-92-1(b).', 'Notwithstanding the hearing officer’s ruling, as affirmed by the trial justice, that the plaintiffs are not entitled to reasonable litigation expenses, he nevertheless made findings of fact and conclusions of law on “the reasonability of the [plaintiffs’] litigation expenses to best present a complete record in the event the matter is appealed.” Neither party takes issue with those findings and conclusions. Accordingly, we quash the judgment entered on October 9, 2015, and remand the record to the Superior Court with directions to enter a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in the 11', 'Don Felder, Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Hotel California, on Hotel California (Asylum Records 1976).', '- 22 - amount of $69,581.25 for attorneys’ fees, and in the amount of $5,628.75 for the stenographic record.

4,Richard DiCarlo : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on April 3, 2019, on appeal by the petitioner, Richard DiCarlo (petitioner or DiCarlo), from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the state, following a written decision denying the petitioner’s appeal from a decision of a Drug Court magistrate upholding a determination by the Sex Offender Board of Review (the board) classifying him as a Level II, moderate-risk, sex offender under G.L. 1956 chapter 37.1 of title 11, the Sexual Offender Registration and Community Notification Act (the act). According to the petitioner, the objective risk-assessment tools employed by the board indicated a classification at a low-risk level, and not a moderate-risk Level II. On appeal, the petitioner argues that, in determining his classification level, the board violated his rights to due process, to the presumption of innocence, and to be spared from double jeopardy, by relying on alleged impermissible hearsay allegations for conduct of which he was acquitted. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On or about May 26, 2006, petitioner was indicted on two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, three counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, and', '-1- one count of third-degree sexual assault. See State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 868 (R.I. 2010). On July 30, 2007, following a jury trial, petitioner was acquitted of the counts charging first- degree child molestation, and the state dismissed the third-degree sexual assault count pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure; but, petitioner was convicted on all three counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. He was sentenced to three concurrent terms of twenty years’ imprisonment at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with eight years to serve and twelve years suspended, with probation.1 See id. at 869, 870.', 'Upon his release from prison, as a consequence of his sexual assault conviction, petitioner was required to register as a sex offender in accordance with the act, in particular, § 11-37.1-3. In determining petitioner’s risk-level classification and the nature and extent of notification to the community, the board reviewed relevant records and information and assessed petitioner’s risk of reoffense, pursuant to § 11-37.1-6. As part of the risk-assessment process, the board utilized the STATIC-99 R, STATIC 2002, and STABLE 2007 tests, which are recognized as validated risk-assessment tools, and it concluded that petitioner fell in the low-risk range. In addition to these assessment tools, the board, as set forth in § 11-37.1-6, considered “any reports and documentation that may be helpful” in making its assessment, including petitioner’s criminal record, treatment information, and institutional, probation, and parole supervision, as well as the mandatory “Sex Offender Risk of Re-Offense Assessment Factors” included in the Rhode Island Parole Board Sexual Offender Community Notification Guidelines.', 'Although the risk- 1', 'This Court subsequently affirmed the Superior Court’s judgment. State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 873 (R.I. 2010).', '-2- assessment scores had placed petitioner in a low-risk category, the board nonetheless recommended that petitioner be classified as a moderate-risk Level II offender.2', 'The petitioner timely objected to the Level II classification and requested a hearing to review the classification, under § 11-37.1-14. Counsel was appointed. The petitioner challenged the assessment factors that the board relied upon in determining his risk of reoffending. Specifically, petitioner claimed that the board erred and abused its discretion in finding that petitioner’s denial of responsibility, his refusal to participate in sex-offender treatment, and an inability to maintain a significant relationship—because he was incarcerated—indicated an increased risk of reoffense. Additionally, petitioner argued that the board improperly relied on insufficient evidence in reaching its conclusion that petitioner presented a moderate risk of reoffending because the risk-assessment results were not accurately reflective of petitioner’s “true risk of re[]offending” because the board “didn’t take proper consideration of what the results were showing them.”', 'On February 4, 2014, oral arguments were heard before a Superior Court Drug Court magistrate.3 Neither party examined petitioner, nor did they present any witnesses or other evidence. Although the magistrate advised petitioner that he was “entitled to a meaningful 2', 'The board issued a seven-page risk-assessment report concerning petitioner. Less than half of the report concerned petitioner specifically; the remainder of the report consisted of a generic description of the risk-assessment instrument that the board used to determine petitioner’s risk of reoffense. We note that, although the board’s report could have been more comprehensive, the remedial course of action is a hearing before a Superior Court magistrate, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 8-2-39.2(f), which petitioner was granted. Accordingly, petitioner, having been represented by court-appointed counsel, was afforded the opportunity to present additional argument and evidence. 3', 'Pursuant to § 8-2-39.2(f), “[t]he drug court magistrate shall be empowered to hear and decide as a [S]uperior [C]ourt justice all matters that may come before the [S]uperior [C]ourt pursuant to chapter 37.1 of title 11[,]” entitled “sexual offender registration and community notification.”', '-3- hearing” and could “call witnesses, present any evidence [and] exhibits,” petitioner’s counsel informed the magistrate that, after conferring with petitioner, “we are going to rely on my memo, and I will proceed with highlighting some of my memo an[d] attached exhibits.”', 'Conversely, it was the state’s position at the hearing that, although the board—as directed by statute—considered the three validated risk-assessment tools, the board is not obligated to confine its analysis to the risk-assessment tools when recommending a classification, but can consider other information in reaching its decision.', 'In a decision rendered from the bench, the magistrate found that the state established a prima facie case based on the validated risk-assessment tools and, further, that reasonable means were used to collect the information. The magistrate, citing to § 11-37.1-6(b), also noted that that “provision makes clear that the scores on the test alone do not determine or mandate the level the person receives[,]” thus, “[a] prudent evaluator will always consider other external factors which may influence risk in either direction” (quoting State v. Germane, 971 A.2d 555, 585 (R.I. 2009)); and here, “the factors considered and documented by the [b]oard are the factors set forth in the guidelines.” Having determined that petitioner failed to show that the board’s assessment was not in compliance with the act, the magistrate affirmed the board’s classification of petitioner as a risk Level II sex offender. The petitioner subsequently filed an appeal to a justice of the Superior Court.4 4', 'Pursuant to § 8-2-39.2(j):', '“A party aggrieved by an order entered by the drug court', 'magistrate shall be entitled to a review of the order by a justice of', 'the [S]uperior [C]ourt.

The petitioner further asserted that because “he is not allowed to re-litigate his guilt[,] * * * he must be given the benefit of the presumption of innocence and those factors supporting first degree sexual assault cannot and should not be considered in his computation.” Notably, at the hearing before the Superior Court justice, petitioner’s counsel never explicitly asserted that petitioner’s constitutional right to due process was violated.', 'drug court magistrate, and for enforcement of contempt', 'adjudications of a drug court magistrate.”', '-5-', 'The Superior Court justice issued a forty-six-page written decision denying petitioner’s appeal and affirming the decision of the Drug Court magistrate. In her decision, the Superior Court justice noted that the act “permits the use of such hearsay, and the Drug Court Magistrate adhered to the legislatively mandated standard of review.” The petitioner timely appealed to this Court.', 'Standard of Review', '“General Laws 1956 §§ 8-2-11.1(e) and 8-2-39(f) provide that final orders of the Superior Court entered in a proceeding to review an order of a magistrate may be appealed to the Supreme Court.” State v. Rosenbaum, 114 A.3d 76, 80 (R.I. 2015). “On appeal, this Court will not disturb the factual determinations of the Superior Court justice unless he or she made clearly erroneous findings or misconceived or overlooked material evidence.” Id. “Furthermore, we shall ‘accord great weight to a hearing justice’s determinations of credibility, which, inherently, are the functions of the trial court and not the functions of the appellate court.’” Id.

(quoting Wilby, 86 A.3d at 372).', 'I', 'Due Process', 'Before this Court, petitioner alleges a violation of his due-process rights under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions because the board, when determining his classification level, relied on impermissible hearsay allegations concerning criminal acts of which petitioner was acquitted. In support of this argument, petitioner asserts that “[t]hese violations stem from the [board’s] placing [petitioner] at a higher risk level than warranted based solely upon', '-6- underlying facts of the first degree child molestation charges that [petitioner] was acquitted of[,]” thereby depriving him “of his liberty without due process.”', 'Fatal to petitioner’s challenge, however, is the fact that he did not raise this argument before the magistrate, and failed to provide any meaningful legal argument to the Superior Court demonstrating that the board’s actions implicated his fundamental rights. At the hearing before the magistrate, petitioner, although carefully advised of his right to present additional evidence, rested on the papers submitted by counsel. Moreover, our review of the record reveals that, when petitioner sought review of the magistrate’s decision, it was the Superior Court justice, not petitioner, who raised the hearsay arguments in her written decision. Thus, we need not address this constitutional challenge because it is clear to us that petitioner has failed to preserve the issue for appellate review.', 'See McKenna v. Guglietta, 185 A.3d 1248, 1251 (R.I. 2018) (concluding that an applicant for postconviction relief lost the opportunity to challenge a magistrate’s constitutional authority by failing to raise the argument in the original proceeding before that magistrate); see also Gordon v. State, 18 A.3d 467, 474 (R.I. 2011) (same).', 'We pause to observe, however, that, even if petitioner’s contention was properly preserved for appellate review, it is without merit. In Germane, this Court held that the act “burdens a protectible liberty interest” and implicates procedural due-process rights, and thus determined that “all sexual offenders who opt to appeal their risk level classifications as determined by the board of review must be afforded an opportunity to be heard before the Superior Court”; and “such hearings must be meaningful.” Germane, 971 A.2d at 578, 580. In Germane, we concluded that the defendant, having been afforded the opportunity to testify, call witnesses to the stand, and submit various exhibits, was provided a meaningful hearing in the Superior Court, and, thus, was not deprived of his procedural due-process rights. Id. at 580, 593;', '-7- see also State v. Dennis, 29 A.3d 445, 450 (R.I. 2011) (holding that the defendant’s right to procedural due process was not violated because the defendant, having been granted the opportunity to develop his arguments and present further evidence before the Superior Court, was afforded a “meaningful hearing”).', 'The record before us discloses that, although the magistrate, on multiple occasions, informed petitioner of his right to present additional evidence, and expressly asked petitioner whether he intended to raise any additional arguments, petitioner nonetheless elected to proceed before the magistrate on the basis of written memoranda and oral argument. Moreover, when petitioner appealed the magistrate’s decision, he was given an additional opportunity to present evidence challenging his classification; he was afforded a second hearing before a Superior Court justice, at which he testified and submitted more evidence. At the conclusion of the hearing, petitioner’s counsel thanked the trial justice: “I would like to thank you for what I consider a meaningful hearing, Judge.” We therefore are satisfied that petitioner was afforded a meaningful hearing and has failed to demonstrate that his right to procedural due process was violated.', 'Turning to petitioner’s contentions regarding the board’s consideration of the facts underlying the first-degree child molestation sexual assault charges filed against him, this argument lacks merit. The General Assembly specifically delineated the records the board is entitled to consider in making its risk determination. Section 11-37.1-12(b)(5) makes clear that the board may review, among other relevant information and records, police reports and records of prior proceedings.5 Additionally, although petitioner asserts that “the [b]oard’s reliance on 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37.1-12(b)(5) provides:', '-8- these facts amounted to their reliance on impermissible hearsay evidence[,]” the act itself provides that, “the rules of evidence shall not apply and the court may rely on documentary presentations, including expert opinion on all issues.” Section 11-37.1-15(b). Moreover, we disagree with petitioner’s assertion that the board’s decision to place petitioner at a higher risk level was “based solely upon underlying facts of the first degree child molestation charges[.]” Looking at the full extent of the material the board set forth as having reviewed—including petitioner’s failure to participate in sex-offender treatment programs and his denial of the underlying offense—the record satisfies us that the board considered numerous factors in making its determination.', 'We briefly call attention to the exception to the raise-or-waive rule “when an alleged error implicates an issue of a constitutional nature and is ‘derived from a novel rule of law that could not reasonably have been known to counsel at the time of trial.’” Dennis, 29 A.3d at 449- 50 (quoting State v. Bouffard, 945 A.2d 305, 312 (R.I. 2008)). In light of Dennis and Germane,', '“Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the sex offender', 'review board shall have access to all relevant records and', 'information in the possession of any state official or agency having', 'a duty under § 11-37.1-5(a)(1) through (6) relating to juvenile and', 'adult offenders under review by the sex offender review board,', 'including, but not limited to, police reports, prosecutors statements', 'of probable cause, pre-sentence investigations and reports,', 'complete judgments and sentences, current classification referrals,', 'juvenile and adult criminal history records, violation and', 'disciplinary reports, all psychological evaluations and psychiatric', 'evaluations, psychiatric hospital records, sex offender evaluations', 'and treatment reports, substance abuse evaluations and treatment', 'reports to the extent allowed by federal law.

In accordance with our well-settled “raise-or-waive” doctrine, we deem these issues waived. See State v.

5,Kevin M. Blais : v. : Rhode Island Airport Corporation et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) and its director, Kelly Fredericks, seek review of a Superior Court judgment that reversed RIAC’s 2015 order prohibiting the plaintiff, Kevin Blais, from entering the North Central State Airport. This matter reaches us by way of writ of certiorari in accordance with the Uniform Aeronautical Regulatory Act (UARA), G.L. 1956 chapter 4 of title 1, and the Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 35 of title 42. In this case of first impression, we are tasked with deciding whether or not RIAC is cloaked with the inherent authority to preclude an individual from entering an airport within its jurisdiction without having first issued a formal order and, if a formal order was required, whether the communications issued by RIAC purporting to bar the plaintiff from North Central State Airport complied with the procedural requirements of the UARA. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the well reasoned decision and judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'RIAC was created as, in the words of the statute, a “subsidiary public corporation” of the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation, in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 42-64-7.1(b) and (h). 1 See In re Advisory Opinion to Governor, 627 A.2d 1246, 1248 (R.I. 1993). The director of RIAC is responsible for the management and safe operation of several airports in Rhode Island, including the North Central State Airport in Smithfield (North Central). See § 1-4-9.', 'In 2010, Kevin Blais purchased a “gate key,” which provided him with operational access to the airfield at North Central and allowed him to store his airplane at that facility. For the next several years, Blais regularly flew his airplane from North Central although, according to RIAC, those years were not without incident. Reports of Blais’s troubling conduct plagued his tenure at North Central and, according to RIAC, prompted RIAC to direct its attorneys to send Blais a “no-trespass” letter that advised him that he was no longer welcome at North Central. That letter, dated February 14, 2014, read, in its entirety:', '“This firm represents the Rhode Island Airport Corporation (the', '‘RIAC’).', '“Please be advised that you are not allowed to enter the premises', 'of North Central State Airport. If you ignore this directive, you', 'will be deemed a trespasser pursuant to Rhode Island General', 'Laws Section 11-44-26 and RIAC will take appropriate legal', 'action.” The no-trespass letter was signed by an attorney from a law firm that represented RIAC, and it did not include any additional information or attachments. 1', 'When RIAC was created, the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation was known as the Rhode Island Port Authority and Economic Development Corporation. See G.L. 1956 § 42-64-1.1.', '-2-', 'Several days after he received the no-trespass letter, Blais attended a safety seminar that was being conducted at North Central, but his presence was soon discovered by airport personnel and airport police escorted him from the airport. In connection with that incident, Blais was subsequently prosecuted for criminal trespass pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-44-26. Blais was convicted in the District Court and appealed to the Superior Court for a trial de novo. However, before the matter could be tried, the Attorney General dismissed the case. 2', 'In May 2015, RIAC issued a Notice of Hearing concerning the February 2014 no-trespass letter. The Notice of Hearing informed Blais that a hearing would be held in June 2015 at North Central and that a hearing officer had been retained to investigate the “facts concerning the potential lifting of the No Trespass issued to Kevin Blais in connection with the North Central Airport.” The hearing officer would be empowered to hear testimony and take evidence from any witnesses who wished to be heard, and he would ultimately author a report and recommendation “regarding whether the No Trespass should be lifted and, if so, under what, if any, restrictions.” The Notice of Hearing made it clear that the hearing would “not proceed in the manner of a formal adversarial adjudication”; that the hearing officer’s report would “not constitute a final determination of the matter”; and that “[t]he Executive Director [of RIAC] shall make such final determination following a review of the report and recommendation.”', 'Even though Blais did not attend the hearing personally, he was represented by counsel who appeared on his behalf. In total, ten witnesses testified and were cross-examined at the hearing. Most of those witnesses testified about incidents involving Blais that had made them feel, at best, uncomfortable and, at worst, unsafe. 2', 'We note that the criminal proceedings are of no particular relevance to the case currently before this Court, and we relay the incident solely for the sake of narrative cohesion.', '-3-', 'Frank Sherman, an eighty four year old flight instructor, testified that late one afternoon he was landing at North Central with one of his students. 3 Sherman said that Blais announced his intention over the radio to make a landing from the direction through which Sherman had just been flying. According to Sherman, “[t]he visibility in the area was terrible” that day and, believing Blais would have difficulty seeing the other planes in the area, Sherman “suggested to him that that wasn’t a good way to come into the traffic pattern.” Later, after both aircraft had landed, Blais approached Sherman and his student as they were securing their airplane. According to Sherman, “[Blais] landed and came over to me in the most belligerent, violent way that you can imagine. I was somewhat frightened. The woman that I was flying with was frightened.” Sherman testified that Blais told him he was “an unfit person” and that Sherman was “trying to teach people to fly on the radio” by “using the common traffic advisory frequency in a way that should not be used[.]”', 'David LaChapelle claimed to have been present for the confrontation between Sherman and Blais, and, according to LaChapelle: “It wasn’t a discussion. It was just yelling, screaming.” LaChapelle, tempering the actual four letter word that had been used, told the hearing officer that he had heard Blais call Sherman “a fricking idiot.”', 'Lance Eskelund testified that he also witnessed the confrontation.', 'According to Eskelund, Blais was acting “threatening, belligerent” and “[h]e actually lunged at Frank.” Eskelund testified that he believed at the time “that Frank was probably going to get punched[,]” but that Blais instead walked away when he saw Eskelund approaching.', 'Paul Harry Smith, the airport manager at North Central, testified about a different incident. According to Smith, in January 2013, Blais entered Smith’s office at North Central, 3', 'It was later clarified that this incident occurred in August 2013.', '-4- demanding to know who had deactivated his gate key. Although Smith explained that the gate key had been turned off because Blais no longer kept a plane at the airport, Smith said that the situation kept escalating. According to Smith, Blais punctuated his disturbance by telling Smith that “bad karma is coming [Smith’s] way” and that Smith “could not be that much of a fucking dick.” Smith said that, because he believed Blais’s foul-mouthed opprobrium to be a threat, he called the RIAC police, at which point Blais “turned around and left.” John Sulyma, a pilot who flew out of North Central, said that he was in Smith’s office immediately after Smith’s confrontation with Blais, and that Smith had told him “[h]e felt threatened by Mr. Blais. He felt his family was threatened.” 4', 'Several more witnesses testified about other minor incidents that involved Blais. Paul Carroll, a pilot of forty years who had previously promoted safety initiatives for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), said that he was concerned about what he termed as Blais’s “cavalier attitude.” Carroll recounted a conversation that he had had with Blais in which Blais had bragged about flying into the clouds. That behavior, Carroll testified, was “an extremely dangerous position for a private pilot, let alone a student pilot” such as Blais. He also related an incident in which Blais had crossed an active runway while Carroll was attempting to land his airplane, and he claimed that Blais had “accosted” him on more than one occasion. According to Carroll, Blais had told him “directly that he has a permit to carry a gun, and he wears a bulletproof vest[,]”—a comment that Carroll took to be a threat.', 'Kevin DiLorenzo, Blais’s flight instructor, testified that he had never seen Blais acting belligerently or disrespectfully. Nevertheless, he recounted an episode in which Blais, then 4', 'Sulyma also testified that he was the sponsor of the safety seminar from which police had escorted Blais in early 2014. According to Sulyma, Blais had cooperated with police, but seemed “dumbfounded” at having been forced to leave.', '-5- DiLorenzo’s student, called to let DiLorenzo know that he intended to make a flight without DiLorenzo’s signature in his logbook. According to DiLorenzo, the flight would not be legal without his signature, so he told Blais not to fly until DiLorenzo could drive to the airport. DiLorenzo told the hearing officer that he believed Blais would have made the flight with or without his signature in the logbook because Blais’s plane was already on the ramp when DiLorenzo intercepted him, and Blais was walking to his plane with a loaded flight bag. Since that incident, DiLorenzo had refused to fly with Blais and had in fact stayed away from the airport for about four to five months—long enough for his obligation to remain as Blais’s flight instructor to expire.', 'John Guerin and Raymond Venticinque also testified that their own interactions with Blais had been less than pleasant. Guerin reported that he had once delivered a letter to Blais while he was in his aircraft and that Blais “started wigging out,” threw the letter out from the cockpit window, and then later complained to RIAC that Guerin had “assaulted his airplane.” Venticinque testified that he thought that Blais “wants to be a pilot, but he doesn’t want to do what is necessary to acquire the license and do the proper practice lessons[.]” According to Venticinque, Blais “goes against the grain” and “likes to do things his way, which obviously isn’t the right way.”', 'Edouard DeCelles, however, provided a very different view of events. DeCelles testified that “[t]here is a group of people at this airport who don’t like Mr. Blais. They just keep attacking him. He has been attacked enough that he just retaliated.” According to DeCelles, Blais acted in the same manner in which DeCelles himself would have acted if confronted with the same situations that Blais had faced.', '-6-', 'The hearing officer provided his report and recommendation to the director of RIAC in September 2015. The hearing officer found that all the witnesses who testified at the hearing were credible and he noted the concern that most of them had over Blais’s alleged conduct. The hearing officer reported that Blais had demonstrated that he was unwilling to follow FAA regulations and that he was “contemptuous” of his comrades’ concern for their safety and that of others. He found that Blais presented “an ongoing risk to himself and fellow pilots[,]” and therefore he recommended that the ban against Blais at North Central not be lifted.', 'On October 8, 2015, the director of RIAC sent a letter to Blais, purporting to be a final order, which stated:', '“I am writing to advise you that I have adopted the findings,', 'conclusion and recommendations of [the hearing officer]. As such,', 'you are directed to remain off the premises of North Central State', 'Airport. This restriction applies only to the North Central State', 'Airport. You may use any of the other Rhode Island Airport', 'Corporation facilities, and may use North Central State Airport in', 'the event of aviation emergency.', '“* * *', '“It is my intention to review this matter within six (6) months of', 'today’s date. I will request that [the hearing officer] reconvene the', 'hearing and would welcome your participation. You will receive', 'notice of the location, date and time of the hearing.” The order was signed by Kelly Fredericks, the director of RIAC, and attached to it was a document entitled “Notice of Appeal Rights of Party Aggrieved by Final Order of Director.” The attached document informed Blais of his right to appeal RIAC’s “final order” by the filing of a complaint in Superior Court within thirty days of the mailing of the order, in accordance with the Administrative Procedures Act.', 'On November 6, 2015, Blais did just that, filing a complaint in Superior Court that appealed RIAC’s October 8, 2015 order, and seeking injunctive and declaratory relief.', '-7- Following briefing by the parties, the trial justice concluded that, although Blais was not entitled to injunctive or declaratory relief, neither the February 14, 2014 letter nor the October 8, 2015 order constituted a valid order because each had failed to comply with the statutory mandates set forth in the UARA. Specifically, she found that the February 14, 2014 letter failed to state the reasons for the order or provide the requirements that needed to be met before the order might be modified, as required for a final order by § 1-4-15. She also concluded that, because the October 8, 2015 order purported to extend the ban imposed by the February 2014 letter, which she had found to be invalid, it followed that the 2015 order was also invalid. Accordingly, the trial justice reversed the decision of RIAC, but denied Blais’s requests for declaratory and injunctive relief.', 'RIAC petitioned this Court for the issuance of a writ of certiorari, which petition we granted on November 27, 2017. 5 Additional facts will be provided as necessary to resolve the issues raised in this review.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When this Court reviews an administrative appeal brought under the Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 35 of title 42, our review is limited to questions of law.

In the alternative, RIAC argues that either the no-trespass letter issued by RIAC’s attorneys on February 14, 2014 or the order issued by RIAC’s director on October 8, 2015 may be considered a valid final order that complies with all statutory requirements. Finally, RIAC asserts that Blais’s administrative appeal is time barred because Blais never appealed from the no-trespass letter issued in 2014.', 'A', 'Mootness', 'Before addressing the merits of this review, we first address the threshold issue of mootness. During oral argument in this case, the parties represented that, subsequent to the appeal of the 2015 order that is the subject of this review, RIAC issued a later order that lifted the ban and allowed Blais to again make use of the premises at North Central, and that that order had itself become the subject of ongoing litigation in other courts. To address potential mootness concerns raised by these representations, we issued a post-hearing order on April 4, 2019, directing the parties “to advise this Court, within five days of the date of this order, of any action pending in any other court that might directly or indirectly relate to this appeal, including the relief sought in those cases.” Pursuant to that order, the parties submitted complaints filed by Blais in two separate actions: a 2016 administrative appeal in Superior Court, No. KC-2016- 0724, and a 2017 civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, No. 1:17-cv-00075-S-LDA.', '- 10 -', 'We previously have said that “[a]s a general rule we only consider cases involving issues in dispute; we shall not address moot, abstract, academic, or hypothetical questions.” Morris v.

Bedrosian, 57 A.3d 259, 272 (R.I. 2012).', 'At first blush, RIAC’s subsequent order allowing Blais to reenter North Central would seem to render our review of Blais’s original administrative appeal moot, because RIAC is no longer preventing Blais from entering North Central. However, in each of the two complaints that were supplied to this Court in response to our April 4, 2019 order, Blais alleged that, while the case presently before this Court was pending, a second hearing was held by RIAC and that a hearing officer had recommended that “it is time that the ‘No Trespass’ order be removed – but his [Kevin Blais] status be reviewed again in six months.” (Emphasis in original.) Both of those complaints concern a final order—which has not been transmitted to this Court as part of the record below and which is not currently before this Court for review—issued by the interim director of RIAC, Peter Frazier, on June 23, 2016, and which allegedly adopted the hearing officer’s report and recommendation. 6', 'In those complaints, Blais alleges that, although RIAC has again allowed him to use North Central, the agency has also attempted to retain jurisdiction over the present controversy 6', 'The complaints that were provided to us pursuant to our order of April 4, 2019 do not explain what occurred after the expiration of that six-month review, or in the years since.', '- 11 - and that it has left the door open to again prohibiting his use of the airport after a subsequent six- month review. If Blais’s allegations in those complaints are true, then his continued use of the airport remains subject to review by RIAC’s director, and his status has in fact not returned to the status quo that existed before the 2014 no-trespass letter or the 2015 order were issued. Thus, our opinion on the merits of this appeal would indeed have a “practical effect on the controversy” currently on review and, therefore, the case before us at present is not moot.

That argument is two-fold. First, RIAC argues that § 1-4-15 authorizes RIAC to issue only generally applicable orders in relation to its broader authority vis-à-vis aeronautical regulation, and that its control over ingress to and egress from its airports flows from the “penumbra” of powers implicit in its “supervision over aeronautics within the state, including: * * * [t]he * * * operation, and use of airports[.]” 8', 'Section 1-4-9(a)(1).', 'Second, RIAC argues that compliance with the procedural requirements in § 1-4-15 and other sections of the UARA, discussed infra, would severely hinder its ability to react to time-sensitive threats to airport security and operations. 9 Neither of these arguments is persuasive.', 'First, we discern no support, in the UARA or elsewhere, for RIAC’s argument that its authority to issue orders is limited to generally applicable aeronautical regulation. Aside from § 1-4-15, which governs “any order requiring or prohibiting certain things to be done,” RIAC’s authority to issue orders is mentioned in two other sections of the UARA: Sections 1-4-10 and 1-4-11. 10 Neither of those sections, either explicitly or implicitly, prevents RIAC from issuing orders that lie outside the realm of generally applicable aeronautical regulation. Section 8', 'RIAC’s authority to supervise and operate the various airport facilities in Rhode Island cannot be disputed. RIAC’s authority in this area is reinforced by G.L. 1956 § 1-2-1(a), which provides that “[t]he director [of RIAC] has supervision over the state airport at Warwick and any other airports constructed or operated by the state[,]” and § 1-2-7.1(a), which recognizes that RIAC “has jurisdiction over the state airports and airport facilities, and the general assembly recognizes that the safe and efficient operation of the airports and airport facilities is of paramount importance to the citizens of the state of Rhode Island.” 9', 'RIAC also briefly argues that § 1-4-15 does not apply because “[t]he February 14 Letter generally prohibited Blais from entering North Central; it did not ‘prohibit certain things to be done.’” We see utterly no merit in this argument. By purportedly prohibiting Blais from entering North Central, RIAC has attempted to set forth a “thing” which may no longer “be done” by Blais—namely, entering North Central. Section 1-4-15 therefore clearly applies. 10', 'The ability to appeal from orders of RIAC’s director, and issues related to such appeals, is also mentioned in §§ 1-4-16, 1-4-18, and 1-4-19.', '- 13 - 1-4-10 requires RIAC’s “orders governing aeronautics” to be “kept in conformity as nearly as may be with the federal legislation, rules, regulations, and orders on aeronautics,” but does not prevent RIAC from issuing orders relating to other matters within its jurisdiction, such as the “safe and efficient operation of airports, airport facilities, and grounds.” General Laws 1956 § 1-2-1(a). On the other hand, § 1-4-11, which relates to the acceptable methods of publicizing orders, plainly contemplates the issuance of orders “applying only to a particular person or persons[.]” Section 1-4-11(b).', 'Moreover, although we agree that the normal incidents of operating and supervising the airports in this state, pursuant to § 1-4-9, may be accomplished without resort to a multitude of formal orders, we do not believe that the indefinite ban RIAC has purportedly imposed here can be plausibly classified as a normal incident of operation. Consequently, we conclude that RIAC’s authority to issue orders “requiring or prohibiting certain things to be done,” § 1-4-15, is not limited to generally applicable matters concerning aeronautical regulation.', 'We are similarly unpersuaded by RIAC’s argument that the procedural requirements attendant to a formal order would hamstring its efforts to protect the safe and secure operation of its airports. Indeed, RIAC has unquestionable “authority to make arrests for violation of the statutes, laws, rules, and regulations relating to aviation and airport security matters[.]” Section 1-4-14(b). That authority no doubt includes the lesser authority to temporarily eject persons from any airport, without issuing a formal order, for behavior that poses an immediate disturbance or pressing threat. 11 Id.; see Perrotti v. Solomon, 657 A.2d 1045, 1048 (R.I. 1995) (holding that the state retirement board’s enabling legislation, which endowed the board with the 11', 'In addition, there is nothing in the statutory framework that would prohibit RIAC from seeking injunctive relief in the Superior Court in appropriate circumstances.', '- 14 - authority to “administer” and “operate” the retirement system, provided “sufficiently broad” authority to decide matters not explicitly provided for elsewhere in the statute).', 'However, it is significant that RIAC has not alleged that Blais violated any law or regulation, and, even though RIAC characterizes Blais’s behavior as a threat to airport safety, it does not advance any argument that any potential menace was pressing or time-sensitive to the extent that might justify circumventing the procedural requirements the General Assembly has imposed on the issuance of a formal order. 12', 'In short, we conclude that RIAC’s authority to issue orders “requiring or prohibiting certain things to be done” pursuant to § 1-4-15 is not limited to generally applicable aeronautics regulation. Thus, it is our opinion that an order issued by RIAC’s director pursuant to § 1-4-15 is the exclusive means of permanently barring an individual from entering onto an airport in RIAC’s jurisdiction. 13 We therefore reject RIAC’s argument that it may bar an individual from an airport in its jurisdiction by means of a no-trespass letter issued through counsel.', 'C', 'Formal Order', 'Having determined that RIAC may permanently prohibit an individual from entering its airports only by issuing a formal order, we now turn our attention to an examination of the communications RIAC sent to Blais to determine whether any of them might plausibly be 12', 'What is more, if RIAC was truly convinced that Blais’s behavior was a time-sensitive threat to security warranting circumvention of the UARA’s procedural requirements, it is difficult to understand why, in its 2015 order prohibiting Blais from entering North Central, RIAC expressly allowed Blais to “use any of the other Rhode Island Airport Corporation facilities[.]” 13', 'Blais argues that a litany of constitutional concerns is raised by orders prohibiting individuals from entering onto public airports.

First, however, we must describe the procedural requirements that must be met before a formal order prohibiting Blais’s access to North Central may be enforced.', 'Section 1-4-15 provides that RIAC’s director may issue an order “requiring or prohibiting certain things to be done[.]” However, § 1-4-15 also provides that, before such orders may be enforced, “the director shall set forth his or her reasons for the order and state the requirements to be met before approval is given or the rule, regulation, or order shall be modified or changed.” Additional procedural requirements are found elsewhere in the UARA.', 'Section 1-4-11(b) provides that “[e]very order applying only to a particular person or persons named in it shall be mailed to, or served upon, that person or persons” and § 1-4-11(c) requires that all orders “adopted by the director shall be kept on file with the secretary of state.” 14 To summarize, RIAC’s director may issue an order “applying only to a particular person or persons,” § 1-4-11(b), which “require[s] or prohibit[s] certain things to be done,” § 1-4-15, if the following 14', 'RIAC contends that any formal order it issued would also need to meet the requirements of § 1-4-11(a), which provides:', '“Every general rule, regulation, and order of the director shall be', 'posted for public inspection in the main aeronautics office of the', 'director at least five (5) days before it becomes effective, and shall', 'be given any further publicity, by advertisement in a newspaper or', 'otherwise, as the director deems advisable.” RIAC argues that such a posting requirement would render impractical, and potentially unsafe, any attempt to prohibit a dangerous person’s entry onto the premises of an airport by way of a formal order. We disagree. Section 1-4-11(a), by its terms, applies to “[e]very general rule, regulation, and order[.]” (Emphasis added.) In contrast, § 1-4-11(b) governs “[e]very order applying only to a particular person or persons[.]” We conclude that, by including the word “general” in § 1-4-11(a), the General Assembly intended the posting requirement to apply only to generally applicable rules, regulations, and orders and not to personal orders that apply only to particular persons and for which § 1-4-11(b) governs the applicable notice requirements.', '- 16 - procedural requirements are met: (1) that the order “be mailed to, or served upon, that person or persons,” § 1-4-11(b); (2) that it “be kept on file with the secretary of state,” § 1-4-11(c); (3) that the director “set forth his or her reasons for the order,” § 1-4-15; and (4) that the director “state the requirements to be met before approval is given or the * * * order shall be modified or changed,” § 1-4-15.', 'RIAC issued, or caused to be issued, two communications that would have prevented Blais from entering North Central, if either or both were found to be a formal order that was in compliance with the procedural requirements just mentioned—the original no-trespass letter issued by RIAC’s attorneys on February 14, 2014, and the director’s order of October 8, 2015, which adopted the hearing officer’s recommendation that RIAC not lift the ban purportedly imposed by the 2014 no-trespass letter.', 'The trial justice found that the 2014 no-trespass letter was not enforceable because it failed to set forth the reasons for the order and further that it “did not state the requirements that needed to be met for purposes of modifying or changing the purported ban[.]” We completely agree, and add that the three sentence letter was not signed by RIAC’s director, did not provide any statutory basis or authority for banning Blais from North Central, and did not hold itself out as a formal order of RIAC’s director.', 'The October 8, 2015 order demands a different analysis. 15 The trial justice concluded that the October 2015 order was invalid because it merely purported to extend a ban established by the 2014 no-trespass letter, which the trial justice also had found to be invalid. Although we agree with the reasoning of the trial justice that RIAC could not extend a ban that was not valid 15', 'Unlike the 2014 no-trespass letter, the 2015 order had several hallmarks of a formal order. It was signed by Kelly Fredericks, the director of RIAC, was mailed to Blais’s home address in compliance with § 1-4-11(b), and included a notice of Blais’s right to appeal, which referred to the communication as a “final order.”', '- 17 - in the first place, we believe the 2015 order might also be viewed as an independent source of the prohibition on Blais’s entry onto North Central because that order “directed [Blais] to remain off the premises of North Central State Airport.”', 'Nevertheless, even were we to assume that the 2015 order is an independent source of the ban, it could not be enforced because it also did not comply with the procedural requirements of the UARA. By stating in the order that the director had “adopted the findings, conclusion and recommendations of [the hearing officer,]” RIAC’s director arguably “set forth his or her reasons for the order,” § 1-4-15, by incorporating the hearing officer’s report and recommendation by reference. 16 We need not decide whether such incorporation was permissible, however, because the director did not in any way “state the requirements to be met before approval is given or the * * * order shall be modified or changed.” Section 1-4-15. This, in our opinion, is a fatal flaw.', 'RIAC argues that § 1-4-15 merely requires the director to state the “requirements to be met” in situations where RIAC would need approval from some other entity before modifying or changing an order. We disagree. The relevant language of § 1-4-15 provides that “[i]n any case where the director, pursuant to this chapter, issues any order requiring or prohibiting certain 16', 'Blais argued before the hearing officer, and implied in his brief to this Court, that the administrative hearing held in June 2015 was not authorized by law because “[t]he Notice of Hearing did not comply with Rhode Island open meeting notice requirements set forth in R.I. Gen. Laws § 42-46-6.” He seems to argue that his opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses at the hearing belied the purported nature of the hearing as an “open meeting/public hearing.” Blais also takes issue with the location of the hearing, as it was “at the one and only location, North Central State Airport, where RIAC had purportedly banned [him] from accessing.” Despite those clamorous protests, Blais does not identify for our review a single requirement that was not met, nor error that was made, in arranging or holding the June 2015 hearing, and he cites no caselaw in support of his apparent dissatisfaction with the hearing process. Because we affirm the decision of the Superior Court, we need not and do not consider Blais’s undeveloped argument regarding the propriety of the Notice of Hearing or the June 2015 hearing itself. We do observe, however, that the UARA gives the director of RIAC “the power to conduct investigations, inquiries, and hearings concerning matters covered by the provisions of [the UARA] and accidents or injuries incident to the operation of aircraft occurring within this state.” Section 1-4-12.', '- 18 - things to be done, the director shall * * * state the requirements to be met before approval is given or the rule, regulation, or order shall be modified or changed.” The statute clearly provides that the director shall provide the requirements to be met “in any case” where the director issues “any order” that requires or prohibits certain things to be done.', 'We are similarly unmoved by RIAC’s urging that “requiring RIAC to forecast what conditions would enable it to lift the ban is impractical[,]” as such a requirement “presupposes that such conditions could be identified” in the first place. However, even if such forecasting is impractical or difficult, it is what the statute requires. As we have said recently, “[i]t is not for this Court to determine whether a statute enacted by the General Assembly ‘comports with our own ideas of justice, expediency or sound public policy.’” State v. LeFebvre, 198 A.3d 521, 527 (R.I. 2019) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. DiStefano, 764 A.2d 1156, 1160 (R.I. 2000)). This is so because “[w]here the General Assembly has lawfully enacted a statute whose terms are clear and unambiguous, ‘the task of interpretation is at an end and this Court will apply the plain and ordinary meaning of the words set forth in the statute.’” Id. at 527-28 (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Marsich, 10 A.3d 435, 440 (R.I. 2010)).', 'We conclude, therefore, that neither the 2014 no-trespass letter nor the 2015 order constituted a valid formal order because neither complied with the UARA’s procedural requirements for an order “requiring or prohibiting certain things to be done.” Section 1-4-15.', 'D', 'The Timely Appeal', 'We are similarly unconvinced by RIAC’s argument that Blais failed to timely appeal RIAC’s decision to ban him from North Central because Blais “never appealed the February 2014 letter.”', 'The UARA provides that anyone aggrieved by an order issued by RIAC may', '- 19 - obtain judicial review under the provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act. See § 1-4-16. Under the Administrative Procedures Act, a complaint must be filed in Superior Court “within thirty (30) days after mailing notice of the final decision of the agency[.]” Section 42-35-15(b).', 'Unfortunately, RIAC’s focus on the 2014 no-trespass letter is misplaced. We agree with the trial justice that the 2014 letter was not a final order.', 'Blais did, however, bring an administrative appeal from the 2015 order, characterized by the agency as a “final order,” within thirty days of its issuance. We thus brush aside RIAC’s argument on this issue and easily conclude that Blais’s administrative appeal was timely made.', 'Therefore, having concluded that Blais’s administrative appeal was timely made and that a formal order is the exclusive means by which RIAC may permanently prohibit an individual’s entry onto any airport in its jurisdiction, and after further concluding that neither the 2014 no- trespass letter nor the 2015 order complied with the procedural requirements of an order “requiring or prohibiting certain things to be done[,]” it is the opinion of this Court that the judgment of the Superior Court reversing RIAC’s order banning Blais from North Central was correct.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. The papers in this case are remanded to the Superior Court with our decision endorsed thereon.', 'Justice Robinson, dissenting in part and concurring in part. I respectfully, but very vigorously, dissent from the majority opinion’s analysis and conclusion with respect to mootness in this challenging case. Contrary to the determination of the majority, it is my opinion that this', '- 20 - case is absolutely moot and that we as a Court should not issue what amounts to an advisory opinion. In my judgment, the presence of mootness should end our consideration of this case.', 'However, given that the majority has chosen to delve into the merits of the case, I likewise feel obliged to comment on some of the substantive aspects of the Court’s opinion— without, however, retreating from my position that the appeal is moot and that this Court should not so very unnecessarily be sailing into uncharted and potentially hazardous waters. I am able to concur in the majority’s holding that “an order issued by [the Rhode Island Airport Corporation’s (RIAC)] director pursuant to [G.L. 1956] § 1-4-15 is the exclusive means of permanently barring an individual from entering onto an airport in RIAC’s jurisdiction.” (Emphasis added.)', 'But, while I concur in that holding, I wish with all due respect to emphatically state my opinion that the director of RIAC (or his or her delegate) has the authority to temporarily bar an individual from airport property without having to issue a formal order pursuant to § 1-4-15.', 'A', 'Mootness', 'I begin by addressing the issue of mootness. “As a general rule, the Supreme Court will only consider cases involving issues in dispute; [it] shall not address moot, abstract, academic, or hypothetical questions.” Campbell v. Tiverton Zoning Board, 15 A.3d 1015, 1022 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). This Court has held that “a case is moot if the original complaint raised a justiciable controversy, but events occurring after the filing have deprived the litigant of a continuing stake in the controversy.” Hallsmith-Sysco Food Services, LLC v. Marques, 970 A.2d 1211, 1213 (R.I. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Boyer v. Bedrosian, 57 A.3d 259, 272 (R.I. 2012). In this case, it was represented at oral argument before', '- 21 - this Court that RIAC has issued an order lifting the ban on Mr. Blais’s access to the North Central State Airport. In my judgment, that simply ends the inquiry. There is no relief that we are able to afford Mr. Blais at this time.

Williams, 990 A.2d 845, 847 (R.I. 2010) (“It is well settled that a necessary predicate to this Court’s exercise of jurisdiction is an actual, justiciable controversy.”); Cicilline v. Almond, 809 A.2d 1101, 1106 (R.I. 2002) (stating that the Court will not adjudicate a moot case because “whenever a court acts without the presence of a justiciable case or controversy, its judicial power to do so is at its weakest ebb”) (internal quotation marks omitted). This appeal should simply be dismissed as moot. I consider it to be unwise and inconsistent with this Court’s traditional jurisprudence to venture where it is not necessary to go.', 'I am not in the least persuaded by the majority’s reference to the complaints pending in the Rhode Island Superior Court and the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, which reference is accompanied by the unstated assumption that the mere pendency of those cases in other courts somehow renders this case something other than moot. It is clear to me that the mere existence of those other cases does not transmogrify this case into a justiciable controversy. See H.V. Collins Co., 990 A.2d at 847. What is more, the majority bases its mootness decision on the purported existence of an order which allegedly stated that Mr. Blais’s status would be reviewed by RIAC in six months from the issuance of that purported order; but the majority candidly acknowledges that we have no such order in the record before us in this case. I cannot countenance arriving at a determination that the case is not moot on the basis of mere speculation, based on complaints filed in other courts and a purported order that is not part', '- 22 - of the record. The reality of the situation with which we are presented is that, based on the record that is actually before us, there is no actual case or controversy on which a decision of this Court could have a practical effect.

Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council, Local 1033, 960 A.2d 529, 533 (R.I. 2008). Consequently, I am of the unshakable opinion that, if this case is not moot, I simply do not know what case would be. 1 While my respect for the author of the majority opinion and for the Court is real, I fear that a major mistake is being made by not simply stopping at the mootness inquiry. To my mind, there is great wisdom in the frequently quoted remark of Shakespeare’s Falstaff: “The better part of valor is discretion * * *.” William Shakespeare, The First Part of King Henry the Fourth, act 5, sc. 4.', 'B', 'The Merits', 'Although I feel very strongly that the determination of mootness should end this Court’s consideration of this case, I feel duty-bound to express my thoughts with respect to the remaining substance of the majority opinion. After considerable reflection, 2 I ultimately agree with the 1', 'I acknowledge that this Court has recognized that “[o]ne narrow exception to the mootness doctrine exists for those cases that are of extreme public importance, which are capable of repetition but which evade review.” Hallsmith-Sysco Food Services, LLC v. Marques, 970 A.2d 1211, 1214 (R.I. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). “For a matter to be deemed of extreme public importance, it will usually implicate important constitutional rights, matters concerning a person’s livelihood, or matters concerning citizen voting rights.” City of Cranston v. Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council, Local 1033, 960 A.2d 529, 533-34 (R.I. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). In my opinion, the invocation of the exception would not be appropriate in this case since we are not confronted with an issue of extreme public importance as defined in our case law. 2', 'I wish to emphasize that, while I now intellectually assent to the majority’s interpretation of the statutory scheme at issue, I did not reach that conclusion because the answer was self- evident or immediately clear to me. In view of the absence of controlling precedent and bearing in mind the historical reality of the need for safety and security in our airports, it was only with difficulty that I acceded to the majority’s reasoning. I do not believe that we should elevate', '- 23 - majority’s holding that “an order issued by RIAC’s director pursuant to § 1-4-15 is the exclusive means of permanently barring an individual from entering onto an airport in RIAC’s jurisdiction.” 3 (Emphasis added.) However, I wish to clearly state that I am of the definite opinion that the director of RIAC (or his or her delegate) undoubtedly has the authority to temporarily bar an individual from an airport (or indeed all airports) under the director’s jurisdiction without issuing a formal order pursuant to § 1-4-15. Any ruling to the contrary would be, in my opinion, a serious threat to airport security in this state.', 'In spite of my agreement with what I understand to be the holding of the majority as to the permanent barring of individuals, I feel compelled to express my view relative to the following sentence in the majority opinion which I find troubling:', '“We therefore reject RIAC’s argument that it may bar an', 'individual from an airport in its jurisdiction by means of a no-', 'trespass letter issued through counsel.” To begin, this sentence seems to me to create some confusion, in spite of what the majority says elsewhere in its opinion, as to the issue of whether or not the director has the power to temporarily bar individuals from airports in this state by issuing a no-trespass letter.', 'I administrative formalism over the need to protect the health and safety of those who use our airports.', 'For the same reason, I do not entirely fault the director for the remedial action that he took vis-à-vis Mr. Blais, even if he did not use the correct means in so doing. (The majority opinion nicely narrates the troubling provocations that resulted in the decision to ban Mr. Blais from the North Central State Airport.) Notably, the director lacked the legal guidance that today’s majority opinion provides; and, although I concur in the majority’s judgment with respect to the action that he took in response to those provocations, I would caution against being too quick to judge him too harshly in a Monday morning quarterbacking fashion. Due process is an important value, but it is not the only important value; there is wisdom in the ancient maxim, salus populi suprema lex. (The well-being of the citizenry is the highest law.) See Beer Co. v. Massachusetts, 97 U.S. 25, 33 (1877). 3', 'I deem it worth noting that I also concur in the conclusion reached by the majority in Part III.C of its opinion that the communications at issue sent to Mr. Blais did not constitute valid formal orders because they did not comply with the dictates of G.L. 1956 § 1-4-15 and other relevant statutory sections.', '- 24 - acknowledge that the letters at issue in this case involved a permanent barring of Mr. Blais, but the issue of the scope of the director’s power in this area is important enough that I feel compelled to make my view known.', 'The RIAC director, by statute, is tasked with the supervision of the airports of this state, including the “operation[ ] and use” of those airports. General Laws 1956 §§ 1-2-1(a); 1-4- 9(a)(1). The director is further charged with promulgating rules and regulations “for the safe and efficient operation of airports, airport facilities, and grounds.” Section 1-2-1(a). The General Assembly has further specifically granted RIAC “jurisdiction” over the airports in this state, and it has expressly indicated that it “recognizes that the safe and efficient operation of the airports and airport facilities is of paramount importance to the citizens of the state of Rhode Island.” Section 1-2-7.1(a).', 'In addition, I would also note that the General Assembly has stated that the RIAC director “shall adopt and promulgate, and may amend or repeal, rules and regulations establishing minimum standards with which all air navigation facilities * * * must comply, and shall adopt and enforce, and may amend or repeal rules, regulations, and orders, to safeguard from accident and to protect the safety of persons operating or using aircraft and persons and property on the ground * * *.” Section 1-4-10. The director also “has the power to conduct investigations, inquiries, and hearings concerning matters covered by the provisions of this chapter and accidents or injuries incident to the operation of aircraft occurring within” Rhode Island. Section 1-4-12.', 'In my opinion these statutes represent a broad statutory authority granted to RIAC and its director to govern the airports of this state. Any argument that a temporary barring of an individual from an airport in this state for good cause must be done by formal order and,', '- 25 - therefore, must meet all of the statutory requirements discussed in Part III.C of the majority opinion would be misguided; it would be, at best, an instance of putting form over substance. See generally New Harbor Village, LLC v. Town of New Shoreham Zoning Board of Review, 894 A.2d 901, 905 (R.I. 2006) (declining to put form over substance and citing other cases similarly declining to do so). In my view, it is absolutely imperative that the director, as a result of the broad statutory authority granted to him or her, have the authority to deal with dangerous and time-sensitive security or general welfare issues of a developing nature without engaging in an administrative process that could be characterized as cumbersome. See Peak v. United States, 353 U.S. 43, 46 (1957) (“That seems to us to be the common sense of the matter; and common sense often makes good law.”). In my opinion, the director’s statutory authority is sufficiently broad to encompass such a situation. See Perrotti v. Solomon, 657 A.2d 1045, 1048 (R.I. 1995) (holding that the enabling legislation for the state’s retirement board was “sufficiently broad so as to include the retirement board’s administrative authority to determine pension eligibility” even when that authority was not specifically mentioned in the statute); Cardenas v. Cardenas, 478 A.2d 968, 970 (R.I. 1984) (holding that the Family Court’s “grant of power by [G.L. 1956] § 8-10-3 [was] sufficiently broad to include the issuing of a restraining order against a third person in order to reach and apply an asset in the hands of that third person in implementation of an order for support”). As such, it is my belief that the statutory scheme with which we are now confronted certainly provides the RIAC director with the authority to temporarily eject or bar someone from an airport under his or her supervision by use of a no-trespass order. I am, however, able to agree with what I understand the holding in the majority opinion to be—i.e., that, in order to permanently bar someone from an airport that is under the director’s supervision,', '- 26 - the director must issue a formal order pursuant to § 1-4-15, which order must then comply with the relevant statutory requirements.', 'C', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, I must record my respectful, but very vigorous, dissent from the opinion of the majority with respect to the issue of mootness.

6,"Jason Boudreau : v. : Automatic Temperature Controls, Inc. et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The pro se plaintiff, Jason Boudreau, appeals from a Superior Court judgment granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Automatic Temperature Controls, Inc. (ATC), Golden Plains Software, LLC, and Russell Turner. 1 This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing argument and examining the memoranda filed by and on behalf of the parties, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The plaintiff filed a stipulation with this Court in which he agreed to dismiss his appeal against Golden Plains Software, LLC and Russell Turner. Accordingly, only plaintiff’s appeal with respect to his claims against ATC is before us.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiff was employed by ATC from September 2009 until June 2011. Shortly before plaintiff’s employment was terminated, Steve Sorel, ATC’s information technology manager, at the behest of Steve Lussier, ATC’s president, installed a software program called System Surveillance Pro (SSP) on plaintiff’s work computer. 2', 'SSP was able to capture intermittent pictures, or “screenshots,” of the content displayed on plaintiff’s computer screen, which were saved to the computer’s hard drive and sent to a remote email address that had been created and managed by Sorel.', 'The information obtained from plaintiff’s work computer through SSP was disclosed to the Warwick Police Department. This disclosure in turn led to plaintiff’s arrest and eventual conviction for possession of child pornography.', 'After he was discharged by ATC, plaintiff filed a claim for unemployment benefits. ATC contested that claim and, on January 24, 2012, a hearing was held on the matter before a hearing officer at the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training Board of Review. At that hearing, with plaintiff present, Lussier testified that ATC had installed the tracking software on plaintiff’s work computer. Lussier further explained that, “[e]very time [plaintiff] clicked on a website, sent an e-mail, [or] opened a program,” a record of the action was logged and emailed to Lussier and Sorel.', 'In 2013 plaintiff filed a lawsuit against Lussier, Sorel, and others in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. See Boudreau v. Lussier, 2015 WL 7720503 2', 'ATC alleges in its brief to this Court that SSP was installed on the work computer because, some time in June 2011, plaintiff asked Sorel to restore electronic mail files to the computer’s hard drive. According to ATC, that process produced a list of “recoverable” files that previously had been deleted from the work computer, which included what ultimately were determined to be numerous child pornographic video and picture files.', '-2- (D.R.I. Nov. 30, 2015). In that case, plaintiff alleged that Sorel and Lussier had violated the Electronic Communications Privacy Act when they installed SSP on the work computer. 3 See id. at *5. When he was deposed during the course of that litigation, plaintiff testified that he was not aware that ATC had installed any tracking software on his computer “until January 24[, 2012] when Steve Lussier testified that that’s what was on the computer.” The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, 4 and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed that decision. See Boudreau v. Lussier, 901 F.3d 65, 76, 77, 78 (1st Cir. 2018).', 'In August 2016, plaintiff filed another lawsuit, this time in the Superior Court. It is that lawsuit that is the subject of this appeal. In his complaint, plaintiff alleged various claims under the Rhode Island Wiretap Act, the Rhode Island Computer Crime Act, the Rhode Island Software Fraud Act, and state privacy laws, as well as claims for negligence, fraudulent concealment, products liability, civil liability for crimes and offenses, and various federal law claims. The case was removed to the District Court, where ATC filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff’s complaint. The District Court dismissed plaintiff’s federal claims pursuant to the relevant statute of limitations and remanded the remainder of the case to the Superior Court to determine ATC’s motion to dismiss with respect to plaintiff’s state law claims. In November 2017, a justice of the Superior Court heard the arguments of the parties on ATC’s motion to dismiss. ATC argued that G.L. 1956 § 9-1-14(b), which provides for a limit of three years from 3', 'Specifically, plaintiff alleged a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2511(1)(a) of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), which occurs when a person “intentionally intercepts, endeavors to intercept, or procures any other person to intercept or endeavor to intercept, any wire, oral, or electronic communication[.]” 4', 'With respect to the ECPA claim, the District Court granted summary judgment on the grounds that the captured screenshots on plaintiff’s work computer were insufficient to show a contemporaneous interception of plaintiff’s communications as required to establish a violation under the ECPA. See Boudreau v. Lussier, 901 F.3d 65, 76 (1st Cir. 2018).', '-3- the date of an injury to a person to file an action, was the applicable statute of limitations. ATC further argued that any injury that plaintiff was alleged to have suffered occurred in June 2011 but that plaintiff did not file his complaint until August 2016, rendering his claims time barred. Moreover, ATC contended that, even if the discovery rule applied to this case, plaintiff’s claims were nonetheless time barred because plaintiff was aware, or, as a matter of law objectively should have been aware, of his claims at his unemployment hearing in January 2012. Finally, ATC argued that the statute of limitations could not be tolled by fraudulent concealment because there had been no express misrepresentation by ATC.', 'Significantly, at the request of plaintiff, the court converted the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, because both parties had referred to matters outside of the pleadings. The hearing justice assumed, arguendo, that the discovery rule applied, but he concluded nevertheless that plaintiff had “more than sufficient knowledge of what transpired relative to the surveillance of his computer activities by the end of January 2012 to place a reasonable person in his place on notice of any potential claim” he might have had against ATC.', 'In coming to that conclusion, the hearing justice found that in June 2011 ATC installed software on plaintiff’s work computer without his knowledge that intercepted plaintiff’s emails and online activities. However, the hearing justice also found that the intercepted information was disclosed to the Warwick Police Department in June 2011, leading to plaintiff’s arrest and ultimate conviction, and also was disclosed during plaintiff’s unemployment hearing in January 2012. Moreover, the hearing justice noted that, in 2013, plaintiff was in possession of enough information to file his complaint in the District Court that outlined his injuries; and the hearing justice found it “both curious and revealing” that, in the case now before us, plaintiff amended', '-4- his complaint to delete a factual allegation that ATC had disclosed the contents of plaintiff’s intercepted communications during the unemployment hearing. Finally, the hearing justice said that there was no evidence that ATC had fraudulently concealed anything from plaintiff. Accordingly, the hearing justice granted summary judgment in favor of defendants.', 'Final judgment was entered on November 27, 2017.

The plaintiff argues that the discovery rule should apply to his claims under the Rhode Island Computer Crime Act and the Software Fraud Act (the computer crime claims). The plaintiff also maintains that the hearing justice erred when he found that there was no evidence indicating that ATC had fraudulently concealed the conduct that forms the basis of plaintiff’s computer crime claims.', 'Further, plaintiff contends that the continuing violation doctrine should apply to his claims under the Rhode Island Wiretap Act.', 'A', 'The Discovery Rule', 'The plaintiff argues that the hearing justice erred in finding that plaintiff was aware of his state computer crime claims 6 in June 2011, and that “at least by the end of January 2012, the 6', 'The plaintiff alleges violations under G.L. 1956 §§ 11-52-3 and 11-52-4.1 of the Rhode Island Computer Crime Act, and G.L. 1956 § 11-52.2-2 of the Rhode Island Software Fraud Act.

It was only after that time, he argues, that he became aware of the name of the software and its functions and configurations. We disagree. 7', '“(6) Make or cause to be made an unauthorized copy, in any form,', 'including, but not limited to, any printed or electronic form of', 'computer data, computer programs, or computer software residing', 'in, communicated by, or produced by a computer or computer', 'network[.]” Moreover, § 11-52.2-2 of the Software Fraud Act provides, in pertinent part:', '“It is unlawful for a person who is not an owner or operator to', 'transmit computer software to the owner or operator’s computer', 'with actual knowledge or with conscious avoidance of actual', 'knowledge and to use such software to do any of the following:', '“* * *', '“(2) Collect, through intentionally deceptive means, personally', 'identifiable information:', '“(a) Through the use of a keystroke-logging function that', 'records all keystrokes made by an owner or operator and', 'transfers that information from the computer to another person;', '“(b) In a manner that correlates such information with data', 'respecting all or substantially all of the websites visited by an', 'owner or operator, other than websites operated by the person', 'collecting such information; and', '“(c) Described in subsection (10)(d), (e), or (f)(i) or (ii) of', '§ 11-52.2-1 by extracting the information from the owner or', 'operator’s hard drive[.]” 7', 'The plaintiff also seems to argue that whether the discovery rule should apply is a factual question for a jury to decide.

The hearing justice determined, and plaintiff concedes on appeal, that the three year statute of limitations is applicable. We agree with the hearing justice, and therefore apply § 9-1-14(b) to this case. See, e.g., Goddard v. APG Security-RI, LLC, 134 A.3d 173, 177 (R.I. 2016) (holding that violations of an employer drug testing statute result in “injuries to the person” as defined in Commerce Oil because the nature of the right from that statute was analogous to an invasion of privacy and thus was subject to the § 9-1-14(b) statute of limitations).', 'Generally, “a cause of action accrues and the applicable statute of limitations begins to run at the time of the injury to the aggrieved party.” American States Insurance Company v.

We have cautioned, however, “that tolling a statute of limitations based upon the discovery rule should occur only in certain narrowly defined factual situations.” Hill, 935 A.2d at 617 (refusing to hold that the discovery rule applied to negligence and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims, but holding that, even if it had applied, the plaintiff’s cause of action would nonetheless have been time barred); see also Parrillo v.

See Hill, 935 A.2d at 617. We are satisfied that plaintiff knew of his alleged injury underlying his computer crime claims at the time he was arrested on child pornography charges, shortly after the police searched his work computer. However, even assuming that the discovery rule was applicable to plaintiff’s computer crime claims, it is our opinion that the latest a reasonable person would have discovered such a cause of action against ATC was at plaintiff’s unemployment hearing, which took place on January 24,', '-9- 2012. See McNulty, 116 A.3d at 181.

We therefore conclude that, in any case, plaintiff’s claims are time barred by § 9-1-14(b) because the cause of action accrued no later than January 24, 2012, and plaintiff did not file his lawsuit until August 2016.', 'B', 'Fraudulent Concealment', 'The plaintiff next argues that § 9-1-20 should toll the statute of limitations for his computer crime claims because, he alleges, ATC fraudulently concealed the existence of said claims. The plaintiff contends that, in the District Court case, both Sorel and Lussier made numerous factual misrepresentations regarding the tracking software used on the work computer because they failed to disclose the software’s functions, capabilities, and configurations.', 'Section 9-1-20 provides:', '“If any person, liable to an action by another, shall fraudulently, by', 'actual misrepresentation, conceal from him or her the existence of', 'the cause of action, the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue', 'against the person so liable at the time when the person entitled to', 'sue thereon shall first discover its existence.” “Pursuant to the provisions of § 9-1-20, if a potential defendant fraudulently conceals a cause of action from a potential plaintiff, the statute of limitations is tolled until such time as the plaintiff discovers the existence of a cause of action.” Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence,', '- 11 - 941 A.2d 174, 182 (R.I. 2008). To prove fraudulent concealment, it is a plaintiff’s burden to show “(1) that the defendant made an actual misrepresentation of fact; and (2) that, in making such misrepresentation, the defendant fraudulently concealed the existence of the plaintiff’s causes of action.” Hyde v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 139 A.3d 452, 465-66 (R.I. 2016) (brackets omitted) (quoting Ryan, 941 A.2d at 182).', 'The plaintiff must therefore “demonstrate that the defendant made an express representation or engaged in other affirmative conduct amounting in fact to such a representation which could reasonably deceive another and induce him or her to rely thereon to his or her disadvantage.” Id. at 466 (brackets omitted) (quoting Ryan, 941 A.2d at 182-83). Importantly, we have recognized that “mere silence or inaction on the part of the defendant does not constitute actual misrepresentation in this context.” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Ryan, 941 A.2d at 182).', 'We agree with the hearing justice’s finding that plaintiff came forward with no evidence of any factual misrepresentation by ATC. The record is devoid of any evidence that would demonstrate that Sorel, Lussier, or anyone else connected to ATC made an express factual misrepresentation to plaintiff that tracking software had not been installed on the work computer. In fact, ATC did the exact opposite when it put plaintiff on notice of that fact at the unemployment hearing because plaintiff was present when Lussier clearly testified that tracking software had indeed been installed on plaintiff’s work computer. The fact that Sorel and Lussier may not have disclosed the details of the functions, capabilities, and configurations of the software to plaintiff does not amount to a concealment of plaintiff’s claims, and certainly there was no express representation to that effect. See Hyde, 139 A.3d at 466. Accordingly, plaintiff cannot benefit from the tolling provisions of § 9-1-20.', '- 12 -', 'C', 'Continuing Violation Doctrine', 'The plaintiff cites to various federal court cases to support his assertion that the continuing violation doctrine should have been applied to toll the statute of limitations for his claim under the Rhode Island Wiretap Act. 8 Specifically, plaintiff alleges that, although ATC intercepted plaintiff’s communications only one time in 2011, ATC continued to unlawfully use those recorded communications in 2012, 2013, and 2014, when it was defending itself in plaintiff’s federal court action. The plaintiff therefore argues that the statute of limitations should have been tolled until the last time that ATC made use of plaintiff’s recorded communications, which, according to plaintiff, was in May 2018.', '“Under the continuing tort doctrine, where a tort involves a continuing or repeated injury, the limitations period does not begin to run until the date of the last injury or the date the tortious acts cease.” 54 C.J.S. Continuing Torts § 223 at 258 (2010). A review of our caselaw reveals that we have only applied the continuing tort doctrine only once, in the context of claims for 8', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-5.1-13 provides a civil remedy under the Rhode Island Wiretap Act, and articulates the following:', '“Any person whose wire, electronic, or oral communication is', 'intercepted, disclosed, or used in violation of this chapter shall', 'have a civil cause of action against any person who intercepts,', 'discloses, or uses the communications, and shall be entitled to', 'recover from that person:', '“(1) Actual damages, but not less than liquidated damages,', 'computed at the rate of one hundred dollars ($100) per day for', 'each day of violation, or one thousand dollars ($1,000),', 'whichever is higher;', '“(2) Punitive damages; and', '“(3) Reasonable attorneys’ fees and other litigation', 'disbursements reasonably incurred.” Section 12-5.1-13(a).', '- 13 - conversion and unjust enrichment.

The accrual of such actions, therefore, was not fixed in time as of the date the illegal bypass was installed.”). Moreover, in line with caselaw from the First Circuit Court of Appeals, we have declined to apply the continuing violation doctrine to an age discrimination case when the underlying act was “a discrete act” and held that any alleged claims of discrimination after that act did not toll the running of the statute of limitations, but were merely continuing consequences of that single act. 9 Croce v. State, Office of Adjutant General, 881 A.2d 75, 79 (R.I. 2005); see also Quality Cleaning Products R.C., Inc. v. SCA Tissue North America, LLC, 794 F.3d 200, 206 (1st Cir. 2015) (“Courts have largely, if not exclusively, held that application of the continuing violation doctrine is cabined to certain civil rights or tort actions.”). 9', 'In a case in which we affirmed a trial justice’s ruling that the plaintiff’s action was time barred, we noted that the “facts plead, if proven, may constitute a continuing trespass by the town that would not be barred by the statute of limitations.” West v.

Although the case at bar is not an employment discrimination case, Croce provides a helpful analysis to the narrow circumstances before us. In that case, the plaintiff, a seventy-two- year-old fiscal clerk, brought an age discrimination claim against her former employer. Croce, 881 A.2d at 76, 77. The defendant had notified the plaintiff that she was going to be laid off from her job, and, in order to avoid being laid off, the plaintiff exercised her contractual right to “bump” into a lower paying position. Id. at 76-77. She contended that, when she “bumped” into the lower paying position, she was performing the same duties that she had performed in her previous position but at a lower rate of pay. Id. at 77. She also alleged that she was required to climb stairs to her fourth floor office in a building that lacked an elevator, that she was transferred to another office that required a thirty-mile roundtrip daily commute and, although her younger colleagues received pay increases and computer training, she received neither. Id. The trial justice determined that the case was time barred under the applicable statute of limitations. Id. The plaintiff appealed, alleging that the continuing violation doctrine tolled the statute of limitations because there was “a pattern of continuing discriminatory acts and that at least one of those discriminatory acts occurred within [the] statute of limitations period.” Id. at 78. We held, however, that the continuing violation doctrine did not apply to the plaintiff’s case because the alleged underlying discriminatory act—the initial notification that the plaintiff was going to be laid off from her job—had occurred more than three years before the plaintiff filed her complaint and that any other instances of alleged discrimination occurring afterward were merely continuing consequences of that single act. Id. at 79. We held that the initial incident constituted a “discrete act” and that the statute of limitations period began to run at that time. Id.', '- 15 - We also concluded that the layoff was a “one-time administrative act” and “was not the product of a discriminatory policy or practice.” Id. at 80.', 'Paralleling our reasoning in Croce, in this case the “discrete act” that triggered plaintiff’s claim under the Rhode Island Wiretap Act took place when ATC installed tracking software on his work computer in June 2011. See Croce, 881 A.2d at 79. After that one incident, ATC did not track or store plaintiff’s information again. We are of the opinion, then, that ATC’s decision to produce the information it found on the work computer to establish its defense during the federal court litigation and the case before us was a consequence of installing the tracking software on the work computer. See id.; see also Asociación de Suscripción Conjunta del Seguro de Responsabilidad Obligatorio v. Juarbe-Jiménez, 659 F.3d 42, 51 (1st Cir. 2011) (“Even under [the continuing violation] doctrine, the ‘ongoing injuries’ or harmful ‘effects’ of a single unlawful act do not extend the limitations period.”) (quoting Jenson v. Frank, 912 F.2d 517, 523 (1st Cir. 1990)); Carpenter v. Texaco, Inc., 646 N.E.2d 398, 399 (Mass. 1995) (“[A] continuing trespass or nuisance must be based on recurring tortious or unlawful conduct and is not established by the continuation of harm caused by previous but terminated tortious or unlawful conduct.”). Therefore, we hold that the continuing violation doctrine does not apply to plaintiff’s Rhode Island Wiretap Act claim against ATC. 10 10', 'The plaintiff also argues that the hearing justice erred by not granting plaintiff time for discovery prior to the motion to dismiss being converted into a motion for summary judgment. However, after reviewing the record, plaintiff neither moved for a continuance nor submitted an affidavit “stating why he * * * cannot present facts in opposition to the motion” in accordance with Rule 56(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Berard v. HCP, Inc., 64 A.3d 1215, 1220 (R.I. 2013). Indeed, it was he who asked that the motion to dismiss be converted to a motion for summary judgment.

7,"JHRW, LLC : v. : Seaport Studios, Inc. et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. A long-simmering dispute over parking spaces in the Watch Hill section of Westerly is the genesis of this appeal. The defendants, Seaport Studios, Inc. (Seaport) and an officer of Seaport, Randall Saunders (Saunders) (collectively, defendants), appeal from a Superior Court order granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, JHRW, LLC (JHRW or plaintiff), as to count I of its amended complaint. On appeal, the defendants argue that the hearing justice erred in not referring the dispute to arbitration and in finding that the defendants were precluded from asserting Seaport’s right to park on JHRW’s property. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'Background', 'In 1985, Russell Waldo (Waldo) and James Hennessey (Hennessey), the principals of JHRW, conveyed title to two small buildings in Westerly to Seaport. Contemporaneously, Waldo and Hennessey entered into an agreement with Seaport to lease the land under those buildings for ninety-nine years (the lease agreement).', 'The lease agreement contained three provisions', '-1- particularly relevant to this appeal. First, the lease agreement required the lessors (Waldo and Hennessey) to provide one parking space to Seaport at a location and at an annual rental price to be determined by the lessors. Second, the lease agreement provided that: “In the event said premises are submitted to the Rhode Island Condominium Act at any time in the future, Lessor[s] shall furnish a condominium unit deed for the demised premises to [Seaport].” Third, the lease agreement stated that: “[t]he demised premises are subject to building, building line, and zoning restrictions as are or may be imposed by governmental authorities * * *.” Waldo and Hennessey also owned the land surrounding Seaport’s leased property.', 'In the mid-2000s, Waldo and Hennessey sought to develop the part of their land defined as “Parcel B,” which included the land leased to Seaport. Initially, Waldo and Hennessey tried to include Seaport in their plans to remodel the buildings on their property and Seaport’s buildings on the leased land. Seaport, however, declined to participate.', 'In 2008, a development company holding title to the property declared Parcel B a master condominium named “The Napatree Point Master Condominium.”1 The Napatree Point Master Condominium was divided into three units: Unit A, which, at that time, included an existing building adjacent to the leased land; Unit B, which included the leased land and Seaport’s two buildings; and Unit C, an open lot with no existing structures, located behind Units A and B. Significantly, one section of the “Amended and Restated Declaration of Condominium of The Napatree Point Master Condominium” (the Declaration) provided that: 1', 'In 1990, Hennessey conveyed his interest in the property—which included the leased land—to JHRW Partnership, which was formed by Waldo and Hennessey as principals. By 2008, JHRW Partnership and Waldo conveyed their interest in the property to a development company, 118 Bay Street Corporation, for the purpose of developing and selling the property as condominiums. JHRW Partnership took ownership of the land that became Units A, B, and C of the Napatree Point Master Condominium in 2012, and JHRW Partnership conveyed that interest to JHRW in the same year.', '-2-', '“Any dispute under this Declaration shall be submitted to binding', 'arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association', 'and the decision of the arbitrator shall be final and conclusive as to', 'all matters, including imposition of cost and expenses against either', 'party. The venue of such action shall be in Westerly, Rhode Island,', 'or at a point closest to Westerly, Rhode Island and the decision shall', 'not be subject to judicial review.”', 'Unit C was subsequently developed into a parking lot. An early site plan indicated an allocation of nine parking spaces in Unit C to the two existing buildings owned by Seaport on the leased land. However, this specific allocation of nine parking spaces for Seaport’s buildings was not included in the plan eventually approved by the town. In 2014, Unit C was declared a parking condominium, with each parking space defined as a sub-condominium unit. According to Waldo, since 2014, at least twenty-three of the parking spaces in Unit C have sold for “up to $33,000 per unit.” As of the date of the amended complaint in the instant action, JHRW remained the title owner of thirteen parking units in Unit C. Seaport has not been conveyed any parking units in Unit C.', 'B', 'The First Superior Court Case', 'In 2009, Seaport filed a complaint in Superior Court (No. WC-2009-871) against JHRW,', 'the development company, and Waldo and Hennessey, individually,2 alleging, inter alia, that', 'JHRW breached the lease agreement by: (1) failing to comply with Westerly zoning ordinances in', 'refusing to transfer nine parking spaces on its property to Seaport; (2) “denying [Seaport] peaceful', 'enjoyment of the leased premise[s]”; and (3) refusing to furnish a condominium deed after', 'declaring Parcel B a condominium.3 JHRW filed an answer and counterclaim to Seaport’s', 'complaint and also filed a third-party complaint against Randall Saunders, Jean Saunders, and one', '2', 'For the sake of clarity and consistency, we will refer to the defendants in the first case collectively', 'as “JHRW.”', '3', 'Seaport later amended its complaint to include a claim for fraudulent transfer of title.', '-3- other third-party defendant.4 JHRW alleged, in part, that Jean and Randall Saunders “refuse[d] to park their vehicles within the space designated by Waldo and Hennessey[,]” as set forth in the lease agreement, and also refused to pay the annual parking fee for several years.5', 'In 2014, a justice of the Superior Court heard arguments on a motion for summary judgment filed by JHRW as to all of Seaport’s claims, and, in a written decision filed on May 28, 2014, the hearing justice granted JHRW’s motion, in part. Specifically, the hearing justice determined that JHRW was entitled to summary judgment as to Seaport’s claims relating to transfer of the condominium deed and compliance with Westerly zoning ordinances.6 The hearing justice denied summary judgment for JHRW as to Seaport’s claim that an implied easement granted it entitlement to nine parking spaces in Unit C.7 An order reflecting the hearing justice’s decision entered on June 3, 2014.', 'Following the hearing justice’s decision on JHRW’s motion for summary judgment, the following claims remained active in the case: (1) Seaport’s claim to nine parking spaces by an implied easement; (2) JHRW’s counterclaim for damages due to Seaport’s failure to pay parking fees; and (3) JHRW’s counterclaim for injunctive relief barring Seaport and the Saunders from parking on JHRW property. Seaport amended and supplemented its complaint a second time in July 2014 to add the Town of Westerly (Westerly) as a defendant, alleging that Westerly had failed to comply with town zoning ordinances by approving a site plan for Unit C “without an official zoning review[.]” Seaport’s amended and supplemental complaint also reiterated its allegations 4', 'The claim against the other third-party defendant was settled and is not relevant to the case at bar. 5', 'Jean and Randall Saunders are both officers of Seaport. 6', 'The hearing justice determined that the claim relating to the transfer of the condominium deed was moot because JHRW provided Seaport with a condominium deed in 2013, during the pendency of this action. 7', 'The hearing justice’s decision also addressed other claims that are not relevant to this appeal.', '-4- that, in breach of the lease, JHRW had refused to furnish a condominium deed and had not complied with Westerly zoning ordinances in failing to identify Seaport’s nine commercial parking spaces.

Specifically, the stipulation read, in pertinent part, that “[t]here are no remaining claims by plaintiffs, defendants and counterclaim defendants Randall & Jean Saunders and this case is closed.” Final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure entered on May 27, 2016.8', 'C', 'The Current Dispute', 'Just weeks after entry of final judgment in the first action, Waldo and Hennessey noticed that an officer and an employee of Seaport each had parked in the Unit C parking lot. The plaintiff filed the instant action against Seaport on June 15, 2016, alleging trespass, slander of title, unjust enrichment, and contempt. In count I of its complaint, plaintiff sought injunctive relief for Seaport’s alleged trespass that would bar Seaport and its “officers, agents, customers, and employees, from parking anywhere on land within the Unit C condominium.” The plaintiff later amended its complaint to add a claim against Randall Saunders, individually, for slander of title. 8', 'After final judgment entered, Seaport and the Saunderses filed a motion to vacate the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, which was denied by a justice of the Superior Court.

The plaintiff argued that it was entitled to permanent injunctive relief as a matter of law because: (1) Seaport was precluded from asserting any rights—by way of claims or defenses—to the parking spaces, based on res judicata and collateral estoppel, as those claims were litigated in the first action; (2) plaintiff would be irreparably harmed without injunctive relief; (3) the Superior Court did not need to balance the equities in a continuing trespass case and, further, “nothing exist[ed] on Seaport’s side of the scales to measure against the irreparable harm to JHRW”; and (4) the public interest was not implicated in this action. Relatedly, plaintiff also argued that res judicata and collateral estoppel barred defendants from asserting their counterclaim in the current action.', 'The defendants filed their own motion for summary judgment the following day, arguing that, by bringing the instant dispute, plaintiff expanded its development rights to Unit C under the Declaration, an action that was subject to unanimity requirements established by G.L. 1956 § 34- 36.1-2.17(d), with which plaintiff had not complied. The defendants further argued that they were entitled to arbitration of the dispute pursuant to the terms of the Declaration.', '-6-', 'The plaintiff objected to defendants’ motion for summary judgment, contending that bringing an action against defendants for the common law claims of trespass or misuse of an easement did not constitute an exercise of development rights or special declarant rights under the Declaration. The plaintiff also argued that the instant dispute was not arbitrable because it did not arise under the Declaration, and that Seaport had already waived its right to arbitration and elected its judicial remedy by litigating its claim to parking rights in No. WC-2009-871.', 'Following a hearing on the cross-motions for summary judgment, the hearing justice issued a decision from the bench granting plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment and denying defendants’ motion for summary judgment. The hearing justice concluded that “res judicata applies to bar the defendant’s counterclaim in this matter that seeks a declaration that the plaintiff failed to comply with the zoning ordinance, and that by reason of that, they have some implied easement over the Unit C parking spaces.” The hearing justice further determined that collateral estoppel would also apply in this matter because “whether the lease with the defendant required the plaintiff to provide parking spaces, and whether the town could be compelled to enforce the zoning ordinance against the plaintiff” had already been litigated in the prior action. Finally, the hearing justice found that plaintiff had “demonstrated the necessary elements of entitlement for a permanent injunction * * *.”', 'As to defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment, the hearing justice determined that the current dispute did not arise under the terms of the Declaration because “there’s no attempt by the plaintiff, in this case, to enforce any of the actions described in the definitions of development rights and special declarant rights.” For that reason, the hearing justice determined, defendants were not entitled to arbitration.

The defendants aver that, even if a party has chosen to waive arbitration in an earlier action, that right has not been waived in a separate, subsequent action. Conversely, plaintiff responds that defendants have waived their arbitration argument for several reasons: (1) defendants did not—and could not—appeal the hearing justice’s denial of defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment, which was based, in part, on an entitlement to arbitration under the terms of the Declaration; (2) defendants did not specifically plead arbitration as an affirmative defense; and (3) defendants waived arbitration when failing to assert their rights to arbitration during the first action.

Finally, the hearing justice concluded that “if there was ever a case of waiver, this is especially applicable here where we had litigation on what the Court sees is the same issues in the earlier case which was disposed of by a dismissal with prejudice, or by final judgment I should say.”', '“[A]rbitration is a desirable method of dispute resolution that has long been favored by the courts.” Newman v.

The defendants never sought leave to amend their answer to include arbitration as a defense, nor did they specifically move for a stay of the proceedings pending arbitration pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-3- 3.12 Accordingly, we are of the opinion that defendants have waived their right to arbitration of count I of plaintiff’s amended complaint. 12', 'General Laws 1956 § 10-3-3 reads:', '“If any suit or proceeding be brought upon any issue referable to', 'arbitration under an agreement in writing for arbitration, the court in', 'which the suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue', 'involved in the suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under', 'such an agreement, shall, on application of one of the parties, stay', 'the trial of the action until the arbitration has been had in accordance', 'with the terms of the agreement * * *.” (Emphasis added.)', '- 12 -', 'B', 'Preclusion', 'Before we consider issues of preclusion, we note that defendants’ challenge to the hearing justice’s decision relates only to the merits of count I of plaintiff’s amended complaint and does not address the hearing justice’s findings as to the other factors required to obtain injunctive relief.

The plaintiff counters that defendants were required to supplement the pleadings in the first action after Seaport acquired rights as a condominium owner.

The fact that defendants now assert those rights as a condominium owner and not as a leaseholder, as in the first action, does not exempt them from the doctrine of res judicata. Seaport acknowledged in the first action that JHRW had conveyed to Seaport a condominium deed to its leased land in July 2013. Seaport had ample opportunity to allege its claims as a condominium owner following acceptance of that deed. Trial was not set to begin until May 2016, and, ultimately, final judgment was entered in that same month. Moreover, Seaport did, in fact, amend and supplement its complaint in 2014, nearly one year after its acceptance of the condominium deed. However, Seaport’s 2014 “Amended and Supplemental Complaint” lacked any facts detailing its acceptance of the condominium deed or', '- 15 - status as a unit owner. Rather, in that 2014 complaint, Seaport reiterated its allegations regarding JHRW’s refusal to furnish Seaport a condominium deed and its request for a declaration that it was entitled to parking spots based on its status as a leaseholder—a status Seaport no longer held in 2014. Consequently, we conclude that Seaport’s alleged right to parking which it may have gained as a condominium deed holder is a claim or defense that “could have been raised” in the first action, and, thus, Seaport is precluded from relitigating that issue in the current action.15 See Goodrow, 184 A.3d at 1127 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Federated Department Stores, Inc., 452 U.S. at 398).', 'Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the hearing justice did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff as to count I of its amended complaint.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff as to count I of the plaintiff’s amended complaint and permanently enjoining the defendants from parking in the Unit C parking spaces owned by the plaintiff.

8,In re Violet G. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The respondent, Jennifer L. (respondent), appeals from a decree entered in the Family Court that terminated her parental rights with respect to her daughter, Violet G., who was born on December 24, 2013. This case came before the Supreme Court on March 28, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After reviewing the parties’ memoranda and considering their oral arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 5, 2016, the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) filed a petition1 in the Family Court seeking to involuntarily terminate the parental rights of respondent. A neglect petition seeking commitment of Violet to the care, custody, and control of DCYF also was pending. In the termination petition, DCYF alleged that Violet had been placed in DCYF’s custody or care for at least twelve months; that respondent was “offered or received services to 1', 'The petition also named Violet’s father; however, he subsequently agreed to a direct consent adoption of Violet to her foster mother on January 27, 2017.', '-1- correct the situation which led to the child being placed”; and that there was “not a substantial probability that the child [would] be able to return safely to [respondent’s] care within a reasonable period of time considering the child’s age and the need for a permanent home.” See G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(3). After the respondent declined to voluntarily relinquish her parental rights and consent to Violet’s adoption, the case proceeded to trial, which was held before a Family Court justice over eight trial days between February 14 and July 25, 2017. For reasons that are not clear in the record, the neglect petition was consolidated with the termination petition by agreement of the parties. In light of respondent’s chronic mental illness and her love for her child, we recount the trial testimony in detail.', 'John Parsons, Ph.D. (Dr. Parsons), an expert in the field of clinical psychology, testified that respondent was referred to him by DCYF for a psychological evaluation because respondent’s “mental health and capacity to care for her daughter” was in question. The DCYF provided Dr. Parsons with records outlining its concerns for Violet’s care and custody, along with several of respondent’s medical records. These records disclosed that respondent had a “significant amount of mental health history” and had been hospitalized for: (1) psychiatric reasons between fifteen and twenty times; (2) multiple suicide attempts; (3) a question of substance abuse; and (4) multiple episodes of domestic violence involving Violet’s father, both as victim and perpetrator.', 'Doctor Parsons testified that he completed an evaluation of respondent after four separate meetings between August 3, 2015, and November 13, 2015, and also conducted one parent-child evaluation session with respondent and Violet present. He testified that, on one occasion, respondent came into her appointment “with a bathing suit top on and shorts[,]” was “somewhat disheveled[,]” and “appeared to be in a manic state.” He described her history as: “Just a very,', '-2- very sad case of someone, you know, that it wasn’t her fault. She just basically has chronic mental health issues that interfered with all aspects of her life.” Throughout respondent’s evaluation, Dr. Parsons testified, her “mood was unstable” and her speech was “pressured and loud[,]” even though she tried, unsuccessfully, to speak in a more “moderated fashion[.]”', 'During the parent-child evaluation meeting, Violet was reluctant to separate from her foster parents, who stayed with her for the entire session. Violet would not make eye contact with respondent and whimpered throughout the session. Although respondent made attempts at conversation with her daughter, Dr. Parsons testified, Violet refused to speak with respondent; Dr. Parsons noted that there was “limited evidence of a positive bond.” Thereafter, respondent “became overwhelmed and was crying, and she tried to hug Violet, who pushed her away at the end of the session.”', 'Doctor Parsons diagnosed respondent with “bipolar disorder with psychotic features[,]” but no cognitive impairment.', 'With respect to the goal of reunification, Dr. Parsons recommended that respondent have “active involvement with mental health, substance abuse treatment with random supervised toxicology screens,” and that respondent “be given six months to resolve or make improvement as far as the areas that we talked about, and if not, the Court should terminate her rights.”', 'Joshua Cottle (Cottle), a child protective investigator with DCYF, testified that he became involved in Violet’s case on April 29, 2015, after a telephone call received by the child abuse hotline reporting that respondent had taken too much of a prescribed medication. According to Cottle, he went to respondent’s mother’s home, where he encountered respondent, her parents, and Violet, who presented “no outward signs of child maltreatment.” The respondent told Cottle that she had taken two sleeping pills because Violet’s father had been arrested for', '-3- domestic violence. On May 1, 2015, DCYF learned that Violet’s father was back in the home and that he had been arrested for violating a no-contact order—Violet was not present during her father’s subsequent arrest.', 'Cottle also testified that, in a prior domestic-violence incident between the couple, respondent engaged in an act of domestic violence against Violet’s father.', 'Carl Desjarlais (Desjarlais), a caseworker with DCYF, testified that he was first assigned to Violet’s case in July 2015. In total, Desjarlais prepared four case plans for respondent; he testified that reunification with Violet was the primary goal for each case plan. During their first meeting, respondent discussed her mental-health status and informed Desjarlais that she had a history of hospitalizations. The respondent disclosed that she had a medical marijuana card for headaches; however, Desjarlais testified that she was advised not to use marijuana by counselors at Community Care Alliance, a mental-health facility respondent was attending before Desjarlais’ assignment to Violet’s case. He also testified that respondent told him that she had attempted suicide on more than one occasion.', 'Initially, while Violet was in foster care, Desjarlais testified, respondent’s supervised visits with Violet were held weekly at the Woonsocket DCYF office. However, the visits were “difficult” and Violet, who was “very apprehensive to visit[,]” took at least twenty minutes to warm up to respondent each time. In November 2015, respondent was referred to Northern Rhode Island Visitation (NRIV) for visitation. Unfortunately, respondent’s visits with Violet through NRIV lasted for only “two to three weeks” because respondent “didn’t think the visitation program had her best interest in mind,” and she accused NRIV of conspiring with DCYF to remove Violet. Based upon NRIV’s discharge recommendation, respondent’s visits were changed from weekly to biweekly, and Desjarlais supervised those visits.', '-4-', 'In February 2016, respondent was referred to the Families Together visitation program at the Providence Children’s Museum, which offers support in regard to parenting and visitation. Desjarlais informed respondent that, as the goal of reunification became more viable, and if the visits progressed successfully, visits would become less restrictive, more frequent, and for a longer duration. After eighteen consecutive weekly visits, respondent was discharged from the program; the discharge report concluded that respondent struggled with visitation, and recommended a permanency plan other than reunification with Violet and that the visits again be reduced to biweekly.', 'Desjarlais also spoke about respondent’s issues with domestic violence, which were reported to him in the fall of 2015, including an incident where respondent punched her mother in the nose, another time when respondent cut the cords to her mother’s electrical appliances, and another time when respondent bit her mother on the wrist and breasts and would not allow her mother to leave the room. As a result, respondent was referred to Blackstone Valley Advocacy Center, where she attended “twelve or sixteen” group counseling sessions for domestic violence.', 'The four case plans prepared by Desjarlais were introduced into evidence.', 'He summarized the goals of each plan, which included mental-health counseling, medication compliance, arriving on time for visitation with a snack or game, and following the recommendation of the providers, as well as completing probation requirements, including domestic-violence counseling. He testified that, although respondent had been consistent with her visits and was currently compliant with services, he did not recommend reunification with Violet. He testified that he based his recommendation on respondent’s “history of mental health concerns,* * * her inconsistency of maintaining proper medications,” her “sometimes aggressive', '-5- and assaultive behavior when she is off medication[,]” and his concern that, when she sleeps all day, she would not be able to supervise Violet.', 'Amanda Grandchamp (Grandchamp), a family clinician in the Families Together program at the Providence Children’s Museum, testified that respondent attended thirteen out of fifteen scheduled visits between June 9, 2016, and October 5, 2016. She described respondent as having inconsistent moods, including depression and anxiety. Grandchamp testified that, at one meeting, respondent became “volatile and was verbally aggressive,” she “stood up and was shouting at points, upset at things that had been discussed during the meetings[,]” and accused the social worker of wanting to adopt Violet. Grandchamp testified that she recommended that visitation needed to be fully supervised and monitored, and should be biweekly because of her “concerns about the relationship with Violet and Violet’s apprehensiveness and [respondent’s] mental health and lack of improvement with behavior changes.” Grandchamp recommended that an alternate permanency plan be developed.', 'The Family Court justice reserved decision on the termination of parental rights petition pending an opportunity for Dr. Parsons to review the documents submitted into evidence and for the parties to recall him for further testimony. However, she found by clear and convincing evidence that respondent had neglected Violet, and directed that visitation be reduced to biweekly supervised sessions. Subsequently, Dr. Parsons again testified and stated that he had seen respondent for re-evaluation on three occasions—two sessions with respondent and the third session with respondent and Violet. During the third session, Dr. Parsons testified, Violet “was tearful; would not make eye contact with anyone[,]” and was in such visible distress that he stopped the session after approximately twenty-five minutes. The respondent also exhibited hostility toward Violet’s foster mother and Dr. Parsons, and was crying and screaming in the', '-6- waiting room. His expert opinion was clear and definite: reunification between respondent and Violet was a significant risk. He added that, although respondent appeared to be taking her prescribed medication and had not had any recent hospitalizations, she had not engaged in mental-health therapy in months and had not disclosed that information. He noted that “there is no doubt that [respondent] truly loves this little girl, but my sense is with her own limited insight into her mental illness, that she doesn’t have the protective capacity[.]” Doctor Parsons stated that, in his opinion, there were no other services that DCYF could offer to respondent to aid in reunification.', 'The respondent testified last and provided the court with a selection of photos, which pictured Violet with respondent, respondent’s mother, and Violet’s father. The respondent testified to her observation of one photo in particular as, “[Violet] has a smile on her face. She is very happy to be with me.” Among other things, respondent stated that “Mr. Desjarlais was cold, calculated and just as cold and calculated as his cohort, * * * Dr. Parsons, as well as Amanda Grandchamp, who I found emotionally banal and just non-engaging.” The respondent testified that she was of the opinion that she had “participated in everything on the service plan required of [her].”', 'On August 30, 2017, the Family Court justice issued a comprehensive written decision, spanning fifty-two pages, concluding that termination of respondent’s parental rights was in the best interest of Violet. The trial justice conducted an in-depth review of all the testimony, as well as relevant portions of the trial exhibits, and made seventy-three separate findings of fact. She found, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent was unfit because she was unable to complete the objectives of her case plans, which DCYF had carefully tailored in an effort to address the specific issues in this case. The Family Court justice then went on to find, by clear', '-7- and convincing evidence, that “DCYF developed four case plans and made reasonable efforts to assist [respondent] with parenting and reunification with Violet to no avail due to [respondent’s] noncompliance with DCYF and service providers which renders her unfit to parent Violet now or in the foreseeable future.” Despite the efforts of DCYF and numerous service providers, the court found, “visitation with [respondent] and Violet has been very traumatic for Violet, there is no maternal bond between Violet and [respondent] despite two years of efforts[.]” The Family Court justice concluded that “there is not a substantial probability that [Violet] will be able to return safely to [respondent’s] care within a reasonable period of time considering [Violet’s] age * * * and [her] need for a permanent home.” Accordingly, the Family Court justice held that termination of respondent’s parental rights was in the best interest of the child.', 'A decree terminating respondent’s parental rights to Violet entered on September 6, 2017, and a timely notice of appeal was filed on September 18, 2017.', 'Standard of Review', '“On appeal, ‘this Court reviews termination of parental rights rulings by examining the record to establish whether the Family Court justice’s findings are supported by legal and competent evidence.’” In re Amiah P., 54 A.3d 446, 451 (R.I. 2012) (brackets omitted) (quoting In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d 1168, 1174 (R.I. 2008)). “These findings are entitled to great weight, and this Court will not disturb them unless they are clearly wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” Id. (quoting In re Victoria L., 950 A.2d at 1174). Such findings must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. See id.', '“Natural parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and management of their children.” Id. (quoting In re Destiny D., 922 A.2d 168, 172 (R.I. 2007)). “Before terminating a parent’s rights to his or her child, the [Family Court] justice must find that', '-8- the parent is unfit.” Id. “In these cases, the right to due process requires that the state support its allegations by clear and convincing evidence.” Id. “However, once the [Family Court] justice determines parental unfitness, ‘the best interests of the child outweigh all other considerations.’” Id. (quoting In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273, 1279 (R.I. 2011)).', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, respondent assigns error to the Family Court justice’s finding of unfitness; her conclusion that DCYF made reasonable efforts to provide services to address the circumstances that led to Violet’s placement in the first instance; and her determination that the termination of respondent’s parental rights was in the best interest of Violet. After carefully reviewing the Family Court record and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that legally competent evidence exists to support the findings of the Family Court justice.', 'Parental Fitness', 'A parent is deemed unfit when the parent has “exhibited behavior or conduct that is seriously detrimental to the child, for a duration as to render it improbable for the parent to care for the child for an extended period of time[.]” See § 15-7-7(a)(2)(vii). A finding of parental unfitness under § 15-7-7(a)(2) made by a trial justice is “entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless [it is] clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence.” In re Jennifer R., 667 A.2d 535, 536 (R.I. 1995).', 'In finding respondent unfit, the Family Court justice’s determination rested on respondent’s stark failure to follow through with the treatment services provided to her and her inability to reach stability in terms of her mental health, behavior that led to Violet’s placement in the care and custody of DCYF for over two years. Specifically, the Family Court justice found, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent failed to address her parenting and', '-9- substance-abuse issues, as well as her very real need for mental-health treatment and medication management. The court found that reunification would be high risk and not in Violet’s best interests because respondent’s lack of cooperation with DCYF services and failure to comply with DCYF case plans rendered her unfit to parent Violet. Accordingly, despite respondent’s contention that the record is devoid of sufficient evidence of parental unfitness, our review of the record convinces us that legally competent evidence exists to support the Family Court justice’s findings as to parental unfitness.', 'Reasonable Efforts', 'In order for the Family Court to terminate a respondent’s parental rights in accordance with § 15-7-7(a)(2)(vii), it is incumbent upon DCYF to establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that it made “reasonable efforts” to “encourage and strengthen the parental relationship[.]” Section 15-7-7(b)(1). In addition, § 15-7-7(a)(3) mandates that DCYF establish by clear and convincing evidence that it offered “services that amount to a reasonable effort to correct the situation that led to the [child’s] removal” from the parent’s care. In re Lauren B., 78 A.3d 752, 760 (R.I. 2013). Under no circumstance have we enlarged these requirements to a point where DCYF need demonstrate that it took “extraordinary efforts[.]” Id. (quoting In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d 875, 882 (R.I. 2009)). Rather, the law requires that DCYF employ “reasonable efforts,” and the reasonableness of such efforts “must be determined from the ‘particular facts and circumstances of each case.’” In re Joseph S., 788 A.2d 475, 478 (R.I. 2002) (quoting In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d 200, 203 (R.I. 1989)).', 'After reviewing the record, we are of the opinion that the Family Court justice correctly concluded that DCYF complied with its statutory obligation to make reasonable efforts to reunify respondent with Violet. Indeed, she found that DCYF “made extraordinary efforts” to', '- 10 - strengthen and encourage the parental relationship between respondent and Violet for more than two years, including four case plans, numerous suitable arrangements for visitation, and referrals to various family services to assist with parenting, substance abuse, domestic violence, mental- health counseling, and management of medication. See In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d at 882. The respondent was unwilling to or simply incapable of complying with these reasonable efforts; she refused to acknowledge a serious mental-health issue that impacts her ability to care for Violet. The Family Court justice concluded that, “[a]lthough she may attend parenting classes and counseling, [respondent] is unable or unwilling to follow the guidance, advice and counseling given to her about parenting Violet, and therefore not able to ensure the child’s safety and wellbeing.” Accordingly, we perceive no basis for disturbing the finding of the trial justice that DCYF made reasonable efforts at reunification, and we hold that, on this record, there was clear and convincing evidence of the same.', 'The Best Interests of the Child', 'Once DCYF has demonstrated parental unfitness and has shown that it made reasonable efforts at reunification, the analysis then shifts to the overarching issue of the best interests of the child, a determination that outweighs all others. In re Kristina L., 520 A.2d 574, 580 (R.I. 1987). In the case at bar, the Family Court justice concluded that “[Violet] has been in DCYF care continuously since her removal in July of 2015, and that it is in her best interest that she be adopted by her foster family due to [respondent’s] inability to care for her now or in the foreseeable future.”', 'The Family Court justice made several findings in support of her conclusion. She noted that “Violet becomes very upset during visits with her mother [and, although] the mother clearly loves Violet, it is evident that [respondent’s] mental health issues and ‘erratic behavior,’ which this court has observed on numerous occasions throughout the trial,', '- 11 - is upsetting to Violet.” In addition, the trial justice detailed respondent’s behavior in front of Violet and others: “[Respondent] gets anxious and cannot control her emotions”; “respondent can escalate and becomes angry”; and “Dr. Parsons observed [respondent] shouting at Violet and questioning her about the visits.” The Family Court justice concluded that “Violet is only 3 years old and her mother appears to be very scary to her.”', 'Although we remain mindful of the “significance of severing the bond between parent and child,” we are satisfied that the evidence presented in this case supported the termination of the respondent’s parental rights. In re Alexis L., 972 A.2d 159, 170 (R.I. 2009) (“[T]his Court is ever cognizant of the significance of severing the bond between parent and child[; however,] it is in the best interests of children to have a safe and nurturing environment in which to live, learn and grow.”). Accordingly, after careful review of the record, we are satisfied that the Family Court justice’s findings are not clearly wrong and that she did not overlook or misconceive material evidence. We therefore refuse to disturb the Family Court justice’s conclusion that termination of respondent’s parental rights was in the best interest of Violet.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the decree of the Family Court terminating the respondent’s parental rights with respect to her daughter, Violet.

9,State : v. : Joel Najera. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on May 8, 2019, on appeal by the defendant, Joel Najera (defendant), from a judgment of conviction entered in the Providence County Superior Court following a jury trial. Before this Court, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence.1 The parties were directed to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 23, 2016, defendant was charged by way of criminal information with one count of assault with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a machete, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (count 1), and one count of malicious injury to property, to wit, a car window and basement 1', 'Before the Superior Court justice, defendant’s motion for a new trial was based on two grounds: (1) newly discovered evidence, and (2) the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. On appeal, defendant challenges only the part of the decision in which the trial justice found that the verdict was not against the weight of the evidence.', '-1- window, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-44-1 (count 2). A five-day jury trial commenced on October 30, 2017, in Providence County Superior Court. Several witnesses, including defendant, presented conflicting versions of events in this case, which occurred during the early hours of Christmas Day 2015. We proceed to summarize the pertinent testimony of the witnesses in the case.', 'The complaining witness, Luis Portillo (Portillo), testified that, on December 25, 2015, he was listening to music and having drinks with a group of friends in the basement apartment of a building located at 164 Regent Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island. Portillo testified that defendant knocked on the basement door and asked the group to turn down the music because “he had children upstairs”; defendant also indicated that if the volume was not lowered, “he was going to call the police.” Portillo testified that defendant looked “bothered” when he was speaking to the group and that “[h]is eyes, they were angry, and he talked really upset.” After the group turned the music off, defendant then asked Portillo to move his car because it was parked in defendant’s designated parking space; the two walked to the parking lot together.', 'As Portillo was getting into his car, he noticed in the driver’s side mirror that defendant was approaching him with a “bladed weapon” in his hand; Portillo subsequently described the bladed weapon as a machete. The defendant swung the machete at Portillo, who ducked and tried to back away. The defendant swung the machete a second time, slicing the left side of Portillo’s face from his left eye to his left nostril. As Portillo retreated to the basement of the apartment building, Rafael Sanchez, Sr. (Sanchez), another tenant of 164 Regent Avenue, walked into the parking lot, approached defendant, and told him to “calm down.”', 'While Portillo was cleaning his wound in the basement apartment, his friend, Steven Figueroa, called 911 and told the dispatcher that there was a “guy with a machete.” The dispatcher notified the Providence Police Department that a “male with the machete hit another', '-2- man in the face with the machete.”2 As they waited inside the house for the police officers to arrive, Portillo testified, he heard defendant breaking his car windows and the basement windows and heard defendant yell, “Come out. Come out because I’m going to kill you.” Once the police arrived and Portillo came outside, he noticed that his rear car window and his right rear passenger window had been shattered. An officer asked Portillo who had assaulted him, and Portillo told the officer that it was defendant. The police detained defendant, and Portillo was subsequently taken to the hospital.', 'At trial, Sanchez also testified for the prosecution. He recalled that, when his girlfriend dropped him off at 164 Regent Avenue on December 25, 2015, Portillo’s car was parked in defendant’s designated parking space. When Sanchez went to tell the group in the basement that they needed to move Portillo’s car, he “realized that [Portillo] was already going to move the car.” He returned to the parking lot and witnessed defendant take a machete from the trunk of his vehicle and hit Portillo in the face; Sanchez yelled, “Don’t do it,” to no avail. Sanchez proceeded to grab Portillo, brought him inside the house “so that he wouldn’t have more trouble,” and detained the group of friends in the basement so “they couldn’t go out because that was just going to make more problems[.]” Sanchez testified that he also heard defendant smash the car windows and the basement windows and heckle the group in the basement. Sanchez also went outside and spoke to the officers when they arrived.3 Sanchez testified that, during their investigation, the officers looked around the parking lot and inside defendant’s vehicle, but they did not find the machete. 2', 'The 911 tape was played for the jury. 3', 'Because Sanchez does not speak English, the statement that he made to the police was translated by his son’s friend.', '-3-', 'Maria Chevez (Chevez), Sanchez’s girlfriend, next testified that, at approximately 12 a.m. on December 25, 2015, she dropped Sanchez off at 164 Regent Avenue and proceeded to drop another friend at his home about five minutes away. When she returned to 164 Regent Avenue, she parked her car at the entrance of the driveway because her parking space was blocked by defendant’s vehicle. Chevez testified that, as she got out of her car, she approached defendant, who had a machete in his hand and appeared “nervous.” When she asked him what happened, defendant said, “Neighbor, I didn’t want to do it. I didn’t want to do it, Neighbor.” Chevez testified that she did not say anything else to defendant, but that, as she ran up the driveway, she noticed that the windows of a car were broken and that defendant’s sister was exiting the apartment building and appeared to be “scared.” As Chevez entered the building, she began to hear sirens and watched defendant throw the machete in the trunk of his vehicle. Chevez then saw Sanchez coming out of the basement while “trying to keep the kids who were inside from going outside.” She testified that when she spotted a bloodied Portillo with Sanchez, she went into the apartment building for a wet towel to help clean him. When Chevez went back outside, the police had arrived and defendant was inside a police cruiser. She also testified that she observed the officers searching the outside area for the machete, including defendant’s vehicle.', 'Patrolman Kyle Richards (Officer Richards) of the Providence Police Department was on duty on December 25, 2015, when he responded to a call at 164 Regent Avenue. Officer Richards testified that when he arrived he encountered two males and a female in the driveway, including Portillo. While Officer Richards and another Providence police officer were speaking with Portillo, defendant came from behind the apartment building “yelling in Spanish” and “kind of frantic.” After Portillo told the officers what occurred, Officer Richards immediately placed defendant in custody; Officer Richards testified that defendant was not bleeding, nor did he', '-4- appear to have any injuries. After defendant was placed in the police cruiser, the officers searched the area surrounding the apartment building for the machete, but it was not located.', 'After the state rested its case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the trial justice denied. The defense presented Stacy Rosario (Rosario), who also resided at 164 Regent Avenue on December 25, 2015. Rosario’s account of what happened markedly differed from that of the state’s witnesses. She testified that defendant woke her by knocking on her door, at approximately 1:30 a.m., to ask if her car was parked in his parking space, to which she responded in the negative and told him that it was probably a person from downstairs because they usually “take my parking” space. When defendant walked downstairs, Rosario testified, she heard people arguing about defendant’s parking space.', 'She then went to a window that overlooked the parking lot and observed defendant and “three or four boys” arguing with him. She testified that one of the boys got closer and closer to defendant and eventually pushed him. In response, defendant punched the boy in the face and the boy fell to the ground. The boy, whose face was bleeding, stood up with the aid of his friends and went back to the basement.', 'According to Rosario, she then went downstairs because, as someone who works in the medical field, “that’s something that you do naturally[.]” As she made her way outside to the parking lot, she encountered defendant’s sister; however, she did not see Sanchez, who, she testified, was not outside when the boy was punched and did not accompany the boy to the basement. She did, however, observe defendant break the windows of a car with his bare hands. Rosario testified that she attempted to calm defendant. At this point, according to Rosario, Sanchez appeared and she told him what happened. When asked whether she saw a machete in defendant’s possession, she responded, “No, I didn’t.” She also confirmed that the officers looked in the backyard at 164 Regent Avenue and opened the door to defendant’s vehicle, but did not locate a weapon.', '-5-', 'The defendant also called his sister, Jelen Najera, to testify.4 According to her testimony, it was between 2 and 3 a.m. when defendant arrived home and there was a car in his parking space. She recalled that he first went upstairs to see if it was a second-floor tenant’s car, then he went to the basement to see if the car belonged to anyone down there. Although she could hear arguing, Jelen testified, she could not discern what was being said. She then observed defendant come upstairs from the basement and walk out to the parking lot, followed by three men.', 'Jelen testified that, once everyone arrived in the parking lot, one of the men pushed defendant “in the throat.” Jelen testified that, in response, defendant “slapped” the man, who fell to the ground, “[a]nd that’s where he got cut.” The other men helped the injured man inside the house; Jelen noticed that the man who fell was bleeding from his face. She also noticed that two female neighbors from upstairs were standing in the parking lot as the police officers arrived. Next, Jelen testified that defendant “was furious and broke the car windows * * * [w]ith a fist.” She testified that she never saw defendant with a machete in his hands, but that she observed that his hands were “bleeding all over” after he broke the car windows. Jelen recalled that the officers took defendant into custody but failed to take any statements from Jelen or her female neighbors.', 'The defendant testified last and repeated much of Rosario and Jelen’s testimony. According to defendant, at approximately 2 a.m. on December 25, 2015, he arrived at 164 Regent Avenue and discovered that an unknown car was parked in his parking space. The defendant testified that he first went to the second floor of the apartment building and knocked on his neighbor’s door to ask about the vehicle. His neighbor told him that he should go ask the tenants who lived on the first floor or those who lived in the basement. The defendant testified that he went to the basement because he heard some music; and, when he knocked on the 4', 'For clarity, we refer to Jelen by her first name; we intend no disrespect by doing so.', '-6- basement door, defendant testified, he first asked the group in the basement to lower the music because he was going to rest; he testified that the group of people “were bothered” by his request and began arguing with him. The defendant testified that he told the group that “if they didn’t calm down that I was going to call the police[,]” and then asked that the car be moved.', 'The defendant testified that he went out to the parking lot to wait; after a couple of minutes, three men came out and continued to argue with him. The defendant testified that one of the men pushed him and, in response, he hit the man with his fist; the man “fell hard” to the pavement. The defendant testified that his sister told him to “calm down[,]” and the two other men picked up their friend, whose face was bleeding, and took him back to the basement. While the group retreated to the basement, defendant stayed outside because he was “very angry” and yelled at the group to “come outside.” When they did not exit the building, defendant testified, he punched two car windows so hard that the windows broke. While defendant was breaking the car windows, he testified, his sister and his two female neighbors were also outside standing behind him in the parking lot.', 'According to defendant, when the police arrived, one officer went inside the building, while the other officer remained outside with him. A few minutes later, the first police officer exited the apartment building with a group of people from the basement, who pointed to defendant as the person causing the problem. The defendant testified that the police officers: “grabbed me by my hands, they put my hands back, and they arrested me.” Contrary to Officer Richards’ testimony, however, defendant testified that his “right hand was bleeding a lot.” He also testified that the officers took the key to his vehicle and searched it “[f]or about five minutes.” When asked by his counsel whether he attacked anyone with a machete that evening, defendant replied in the negative and stated that he did not own a machete.', '-7-', 'The jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts, and on November 29, 2017, defendant’s motion for a new trial was heard and denied. Thereafter, defendant was sentenced to three years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with one year to serve and two years suspended, with probation, on count one; and one year suspended, with probation, on count two. The defendant timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'When this Court reviews a motion for a new trial, we accord “great weight to a trial justice’s ruling” when that justice “articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” State v.

The defendant also contends that the trial justice erred by relying on his own opinion about the nature of the injury defendant inflicted on Portillo and concluded that it was consistent with a blade from a sharp instrument. The defendant argues that this observation was beyond the knowledge of a layperson and not supported by medical evidence.

Specifically, in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice independently assessed the credibility of each witness. Beginning with Portillo, the trial justice noted that he found him “to be a credible witness. * * * I believe that he truly related how this happened, how this assault occurred, and I found his testimony as to how the assault occurred and the Defendant’s use of a machete to be credible.” In addition, the trial justice found Sanchez and Chevez to be credible witnesses, stating: “Both corroborate Mr. Portillo’s version of events, and I believe their testimony * * * [i]n all essential respects was reasonably consistent.”', '-9-', 'Alternatively, turning to defendant’s credibility as a witness, the trial justice found defendant and his witnesses to lack credibility.

He also concluded that defendant was the aggressor, especially given defendant’s admission that he broke the windows of Portillo’s car; accordingly, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'After a careful review of the trial testimony and of the decision denying the motion for a new trial, we are satisfied that the trial justice “articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion[.]” Grantley, 149 A.3d at 131 (quoting State v.

He specifically noted the shortcomings and inconsistencies of certain witnesses, but he ultimately concluded, based on his own credibility determinations, that the weight of the evidence supported guilty verdicts as to both counts. The trial justice passed upon the credibility of Portillo, Sanchez, and Chevez, and found those witnesses to be quite credible; at the same time, he found defendant and his witnesses to be lacking in credibility— findings to which this Court accords great deference. See State v. Giard, 155 A.3d 1193, 1200 (R.I. 2017) (“It is noteworthy that we ‘accord deference to the credibility determinations of the hearing justice,’ because ‘we do not have the same vantage point as him or her, and we are unable to assess the witness’ demeanor, tone of voice, and body language.’”) (brackets and internal citation omitted) (quoting first State v.

The defendants, the Town of Johnston, the Johnston School Department, the Johnston School Committee, and various municipal officials (collectively the town), appeal from the entry of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiffs, the Rhode Island American Federation of Teachers/Retired Local 8307 and several retirees of the Johnston School Department (collectively the association),1 in this dispute about the cost of annual premiums for post-retirement life insurance benefits. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and proceed to decide this appeal. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The Rhode Island American Federation of Teachers/Retired Local 8037 is an association of retired Rhode Island public school teachers representing the interests of retired teachers, which in this case includes retired teachers from the Johnston School Department. The individual plaintiffs in this case are former teachers who retired from the Johnston School Department on or after January 1, 2011, and are members of the association.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The material facts in this case are not in dispute. This appeal concerns the annual cost of a life insurance policy made available to retired teachers in Johnston, Rhode Island, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 16-16-42. According to a collective-bargaining agreement governing Johnston’s active schoolteachers’ terms of employment, the town provided life insurance in the amount of $45,000. The town paid the insurance premium for actively employed teachers; however, when a teacher retired, the insurance policy would remain in effect on the condition that the retired teacher assumed responsibility for paying the premium.', 'For many years, the annual cost of life insurance for a retired teacher was the annual cost in effect at the time of the teacher’s retirement.2 In late 2010, the town changed its insurance carrier to Minnesota Life Insurance Company (Minnesota Life) and selected a policy that reduced the premium rate for active teachers and increased the rate for retired teachers.3 As a result, teachers who retired on or after January 1, 2011, were required to pay a higher premium. In August 2013, the town entered into a subsequent policy agreement with Minnesota Life that significantly increased the annual rate for retired teachers.4', 'In response, the association filed this action in Superior Court, seeking a declaratory judgment that, in accordance with § 16-16-42, the town is statutorily “required to provide the life insurance policy at an annual cost that was in effect on the last day of [a teacher’s] 2', 'Until July 2010, the cost of the life insurance policy for both active and retired teachers was 45 cents per $1,000. 3', 'Under the new policy, for the period of January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2013, the active teachers’ rate was reduced to 10.4 cents per $1,000, and the retired teachers’ rate was increased to $1.05 per $1,000. 4', 'Effective September 1, 2013, through August 31, 2016, the active teachers’ rate was 13 cents per $1,000, and the retired teachers’ rate was increased to $1.90 per $1,000.', '-2- employment[.]”5 The association subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing that § 16- 16-42 prohibits the town from assessing increased life insurance rates for teachers upon retirement because the plain language of the statute requires the town to provide life insurance to retired teachers at the same annual cost it paid before the teacher retired. The town filed an objection, along with a cross-motion for summary judgment, countering that § 16-16-42 is clear and unambiguous; and, pursuant to the statute’s plain and ordinary meaning, the town argued, it is required to furnish the retiree with “the option of retaining the life insurance policy at ‘an amount equal to the annual cost of the policy for the individual at the time of the individual’s retirement.’” The town further asserted that, by “provid[ing] the retirees with the option of continuing the insurance coverage at the rate in effect at the retirees’ retirements,” it has complied with the requirements set forth in § 16-16-42.', 'The Superior Court justice heard arguments on both motions and issued a written decision in which she determined that § 16-16-42 is clear and unambiguous; she held that, “pursuant to the clear statutory mandates, the [t]own is required to provide retirees the option of maintaining the life insurance policy that was in effect at the time of their retirement at the same annual cost each retiree paid before his or her retirement.” The trial justice explicated that “[a]s there is no other annual cost, the only plausible meaning is that the Legislature intended the retiree to be substituted as the payor on the already established plan at the rate paid by the [t]own.”', 'Accordingly, the hearing justice granted the association’s motion for summary 5', 'In its first amended complaint, the association asked for a declaratory judgment (count I) that, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 16-16-42, the town is required to provide the life insurance policy at an annual cost that was in effect on the last day of a teacher’s employment. The association also asserted a breach-of-contract claim against the town (count II), requesting damages for the difference between the cost of the insurance at the time of retirement and the increased cost of the insurance under the Minnesota Life agreement. The parties subsequently agreed to limit the scope of their motions for summary judgment to count I.', '-3- judgment and declared that the town was “required to provide life insurance to each retiree at the same annual cost that was in effect on the last day of his or her employment.” The town timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court “reviews a ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo.”', 'Epic Enterprises LLC v.

We are thereby confronted with a question of pure statutory interpretation—that being § 16-16-42.', 'The disputed statute on appeal, § 16-16-42, entitled “Life insurance benefits,” provides:', '“Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, any', 'member who, at the time of retirement from service, has in effect', 'life insurance provided for as a benefit of his or her employment', 'shall, after retirement, be entitled to keep the policy of life', 'insurance in effect by paying to the city or town an amount equal', 'to the annual cost of the policy for the individual at the time of the', '-4-', 'individual’s retirement. The policy of insurance shall remain in', 'effect for so long as the member continues to make annual', 'payments.”', 'Before this Court, both parties assert that § 16-16-42 is clear and unambiguous; however, each party posits a different interpretation. The town asserts that a plain and ordinary reading of the phrases “at the time of retirement from service” and “at the time of the individual’s retirement” makes clear that the Legislature intended to provide retirees “with the opportunity to continue their life insurance policy at the time period after they have permanently” separated from service. The town also points out that the statute does not read “on their last day of active employment” and, therefore, according to its plain meaning, the cost of life insurance for retired teachers must be that which is “in effect at the beginning of the retiree’s retirement[,]” i.e., the rate set for retirees, not the premium before the teacher retires.', 'Alternatively, the association asserts that § 16-16-42 unambiguously requires the town to provide retirees with the option of maintaining the insurance policy that was in effect at their retirement at the same annual cost that each retiree paid before retirement. According to the association, the phrase “at the time of retirement” refers to the day the teacher separates from employment; whereas the phrase “after retirement” refers to when the teacher has retired. The association contends that a teacher is entitled to the same policy at the same annual cost as when he or she was employed, and not a different retirement rate.', '“It is well settled that when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.”', 'Alessi v. Bowen Court Condominium, 44 A.3d 736, 740 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Waterman v. Caprio, 983 A.2d 841, 844 (R.I. 2009)). Moreover, “[i]n matters of statutory interpretation our ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Webster v. Perrotta, 774 A.2d 68, 75 (R.I. 2001). “The Legislature is presumed to', '-5- have intended each word or provision of a statute to express a significant meaning, and the Court will give effect to every word, clause, or sentence, whenever possible.” State v.

Bryant, 670 A.2d 776, 779 (R.I. 1996)).', 'After employing this well-established statutory analysis, we are satisfied that the statute carries no ambiguity, and therefore we construe the language of this statute in accordance with its plain and ordinary meaning. We remain mindful that this Court presumes that every word of a statute has significance; and, thus, whenever possible, we will give effect to each word and phrase contained therein. After a review of the language of § 16-16-42, we are satisfied that Johnston’s teachers are entitled to retain the insurance coverage in effect at the time of retirement by paying the same annual cost that the retiree paid before retirement, as an active employee. There is no separate retiree rate anticipated by this enactment.', 'By incorporating the phrases “at the time of retirement” and “after retirement,” the Legislature clearly assigned independent significance to each phrase. We are of the opinion that “at the time of retirement” signifies the day of or the day before a teacher retires from active employment. Accordingly, we are satisfied that a proper interpretation of the statute provides that, any teacher “who, at the time of retirement from service [or last day of active employment], has in effect life insurance provided for as a benefit of his or her employment shall, after retirement, be entitled to keep the policy of life insurance in effect by paying to the city or town an amount equal to the annual cost of the policy for the individual at the time of the individual’s retirement [or last day of active employment].” Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court justice.', '-6-', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court granting the association’s motion for summary judgment.

The petitioners, Robin Brindle, Kathleen Brown, Sandra Carter, Marcie LaPorte, and Kelvin Ramirez (a/k/a Kevin Ramirez) (collectively petitioners), filed petitions for writ of certiorari to this Court pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. 1956 § 42-35-16, seeking review of a Superior Court judgment affirming a decision of the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training (the DLT) that denied the petitioners’ wage and hour claims against Delta Airlines, Inc. (Delta). Before this Court, the petitioners argue that the Superior Court erred in affirming the DLT’s finding that G.L. 1956 § 25-3-3 is preempted by federal law, specifically, 49 U.S.C § 41713(b)(1) of the Airline Deregulation Act (ADA). For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Between September 6, 2011, and September 13, 2011, petitioners, who were customer service agents for Delta at its facility at the T.F. Green Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island, filed five separate individual “nonpayment of wages” complaints with DLT. Each complaint alleged', '-1- that Delta violated the provisions of § 25-3-3 by failing to pay petitioners time-and-a-half for hours worked on Sundays and holidays. Delta filed a response with DLT on November 16, 2011, arguing that the complaints should be dismissed because § 25-3-3, which mandates the payment of time-and-a-half for work performed on Sundays and holidays, is preempted by the ADA. Section 25-3-3(a) provides, in part, that:', '“Work performed by employees on Sundays and holidays must be', 'paid for at least one and one-half (1 1/2) times the normal rate of', 'pay for the work performed; provided: (1) that it is not grounds for', 'discharge or other penalty upon any employee for refusing to work', 'upon any Sunday or holiday enumerated in this chapter[.]”', 'The petitioners’ complaints and Delta’s letter were addressed at a hearing before a DLT hearing officer on May 8, 2012. At the hearing, the hearing officer did not take testimony or receive other evidence. Instead, the hearing officer indicated that she was “inclined to agree with” Delta that § 25-3-3 is preempted by the ADA; but she allowed petitioners to raise any arguments that their wage complaints were not preempted. The petitioners elected not to raise any argument before the hearing officer on the issue of preemption. In a written decision,1 the hearing officer concluded that the DLT was “preempted from enforcing wage laws for airline employees” because requiring Delta to pay petitioners time-and-a-half for hours worked on Sundays and holidays relates to Delta’s prices, routes, or services, which, in turn, triggers preemption in accordance with the ADA. The hearing officer declared that DLT has no authority to adjudicate the claims, and therefore dismissed all five complaints. The petitioners timely appealed to the Superior Court, in accordance with § 42-35-15.2 1', 'Because petitioners filed separate individual complaints with the DLT, the DLT issued five separate decisions, indistinguishable in substance. 2', 'The petitioners originally filed separate appeals with the Superior Court on June 15, 2012; however, because each case presented identical legal issues, petitioners’ appeals were consolidated by the Superior Court on October 5, 2012.', '-2-', 'On appeal before the Superior Court, petitioners argued that the hearing officer’s decision to dismiss the complaints was affected by an error of law because the ADA does not preempt § 25-3-3.', 'The Superior Court subsequently concluded that the hearing officer erred in dismissing petitioners’ complaints because she failed to hear, review, or weigh evidence demonstrating that petitioners’ wage complaints had a sufficient connection to Delta’s prices, routes, or services to warrant preemption. In accordance with § 42-35-15, the Superior Court remanded the case to the DLT for a further hearing and a finding of fact on the issue of the effect of employee wages on Delta’s prices, routes, and services.', 'The remand hearing was conducted by the DLT on May 4, 2015, before the same hearing officer. At that hearing, Kelly Fredericks, President and CEO of the Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC), testified to his experience in the aviation and transportation industry, which spanned more than thirty years. Mr. Fredericks explained that a critical component of his job at RIAC was to attract and maintain air-carrier service at T.F. Green Airport, which services eight airline carriers and approximately 10,000 travelers per day. He testified that cost and demand, including labor costs, are factors that air carriers take into consideration when deciding whether to do business in Rhode Island. Mr. Fredericks agreed that higher labor costs in Rhode Island would make RIAC “less competitive in the market for air services” and therefore that a statute that requires Sunday and holiday premium pay could have a significant negative impact on air carriers conducting business in Rhode Island; could alter flights into and out of the airport; or could affect the number of employees scheduled for Sundays or holidays.', 'Sandra LaPlante, the station manager for Delta at T.F. Green Airport, testified next that she had worked for Delta for twenty years and that her duties include oversight of Delta’s day-to- day operations, including managing and scheduling a team of twenty-five customer service', '-3- agents and ensuring that Delta’s T.F. Green location is sufficiently staffed for operations. Ms. LaPlante testified that service on Sundays and holidays is important to Delta, as its T.F. Green Airport location operates seven days per week. She next explained that, if Delta were forced to pay Sunday premium time to its Rhode Island workers, it could affect the customer service that is provided at T.F. Green Airport and cause Delta to modify the services that it provides on those particular days because it could lead to a reduction of staff.', 'After considering the testimony and weighing the credibility of the witnesses, the hearing officer, for the second time, concluded that petitioners’ wage claims were preempted by the ADA, and she dismissed the complaints. In a written decision, the hearing officer found that Ms. LaPlante’s testimony was persuasive because of her twenty years with Delta, in various positions, including station manager charged with overseeing customer service. In reaching her conclusion, the hearing officer pointed to Ms. LaPlante’s testimony that an increase in employees’ wages would affect Delta’s services. The hearing officer also found that, although not specific to Delta, the testimony of Mr. Fredericks about the factors that an air carrier considers when determining whether to locate or remain at a particular airport applied to air carriers such as Delta and was supported by the testimony of Ms. LaPlante. Therefore, because the testimony demonstrated “that increased pay on Sundays and holidays could impact staffing which would impact the level of service[,]” the hearing officer found that § 25-3-3’s time-and-a- half requirement is preempted from application at T.F. Green Airport by the ADA.', 'The petitioners appealed the second decision to the Superior Court and argued that the hearing officer committed an error of law in finding that § 25-3-3 was preempted because the potential for an increase in labor costs posed by compliance with § 25-3-3 is, petitioners opined, insufficient to trigger preemption. The petitioners also argued that the decision of the hearing', '-4- officer is flawed because Delta failed to prove that increased labor costs would have a significant impact on prices, routes, or services. In turn, it was Delta’s contention that § 25-3-3 is a “blue law” designed to regulate work and wages on Sundays and holidays. Delta argued that, if made applicable to airlines, § 25-3-3 would dictate how airline carriers can employ employees, which is sufficient to trigger preemption.3 Delta also claimed that the decision of the hearing officer was supported by substantial evidence in the record to demonstrate that requiring Delta to comply with § 25-3-3 would significantly impact its prices, routes, and services.', 'In a written decision, the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the hearing officer. The Superior Court justice found that, as a matter of law, § 25-3-3 is preempted by the ADA because the statute attempts to regulate the work force on Sundays and holidays, which “affects the competitive market force of airlines.” The Superior Court justice explained that requiring air carriers in Rhode Island to comply with § 25-3-3’s premium pay provision would have a direct impact on the prices, routes, and services of Delta because it would influence their decision- making process regarding discretionary services, customer interaction, and staffing. In addition, the Superior Court justice concluded that the decision of the hearing officer was not clearly erroneous, but it was supported by adequate and legally competent evidence. Specifically, the Superior Court justice explained that the hearing officer accepted Mr. Fredericks and Ms. LaPlante’s testimony concerning the effect that § 25-3-3 would have on Delta’s prices, routes, and services as credible, and she favorably noted their demeanor and forthright answers. The Superior Court thus concluded that the decision of the hearing officer was “neither affected by error of law nor clearly erroneous.” 3', 'Although not raised by the parties, we note that G.L. 1956 § 25-3-3 allows an employee to refuse “to work upon any Sunday or holiday[.]”', '-5-', 'Standard of Review', 'On certiorari, this Court does not weigh the evidence; instead, “we limit the scope of our review to the record as a whole to determine whether any legally competent evidence exists therein to support the trial court’s decision or whether the trial court committed error of law in reaching its decision.” Rhode Island Temps, Inc. v.

We perceive no error.', '-6-', 'The ADA was enacted in 1978 to promote “efficiency, innovation, and low prices” in the air transportation industry through “maximum reliance on competitive market forces and on actual and potential competition[.]” 49 U.S.C. §§ 40101(a)(6), 12(A); Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg, 572 U.S. 273, 280 (2014). By enacting the ADA, Congress largely deregulated domestic air transportation. See American Airlines, Inc. v. Wolens, 513 U.S. 219, 222 (1995). “To ensure that the States would not undo federal deregulation with regulation of their own,” Congress included a preemption clause as part of the ADA. Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. 374, 378 (1992). Under the preemption clause, the party claiming that preemption applies must establish that “a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of at least [two] States * * * enact[ed] or [is] enforc[ing] a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of an air carrier[.]” See 49 U.S.C. § 41713(b)(1). A law “relates to” a price, route, or service of an air carrier if it has “a connection with, or reference to” an air carrier’s prices, routes, or services. Morales, 504 U.S. at 384. Thus, where a state law has “the forbidden significant effect” on the prices, routes, or services of an air carrier, the ADA preempts that law. See id. at 388; see also United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Flores-Galarza, 318 F.3d 323, 335 (1st Cir. 2003).', 'It is clear that federal preemption of state law is a matter of federal constitutional law. The Supremacy Clause, in Article VI of the United States Constitution, directs that federal law “shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby * * *.” U.S. Const. Art. VI, cl. 2. Under the Supremacy Clause, if Congress so intends, state laws may be preempted by federal law and will be considered to be “without effect.” Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504, 516 (1992) (quoting Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 746 (1981)).', 'The intention to preempt state law may arise explicitly from the language', '-7- employed in the statute or implicitly from the statute’s structure and purpose. Morales, 504 U.S. at 383. In the case at bar, Delta relies upon the express language of the ADA in asserting that petitioners’ state law claims are preempted.', 'The United States Supreme Court has offered important guidance as to how the ADA’s preemption clause is to be interpreted. Notably, the Supreme Court has recognized that the term “related to” in the phrase “related to a price, route, or service” expresses “a broad pre-emptive purpose.” See Ginsberg, 572 U.S. at 281 (noting that the phrase “other provision having the force and effect of law” is much more broadly worded than other legislation that expressly applies only to a law or regulation; therefore, ADA preemption includes suits at common law); see also Wolens, 513 U.S. at 225; Morales, 504 U.S. at 383, 384. For example, in Morales, the United States Supreme Court held that the ADA expressly preempted the application of state deceptive business practice statutes to airline fare advertisements because such regulation related to the content and format of air carrier fare advertising and had a “significant impact upon the airlines’ ability to market their product, and hence a significant impact upon the fares they charge.” Morales, 504 U.S. at 390. The Court explained that the ADA’s broad preemption clause meant state laws and regulations “having a connection with or reference to airline ‘rates, routes, or services,’ are pre-empted” by the ADA. Id. at 384. Thus, even an indirect effect by a state law of general applicability is sufficient to meet the “related to” language in the preemption clause. Id. at 386-87. On the other hand, the Supreme Court has recognized that, in some cases in which the preemption bar is raised, the challenged enactment may have “‘too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a manner’ to have pre-emptive effect.” Id. at 390 (quoting Shaw v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 100 n.21 (1983)).', '-8-', 'Next, in Wolens, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the breadth of the ADA’s preemption clause; in that case, the plaintiffs were participants in American Airlines’ frequent-flyer program who claimed to be injured by modifications to the program and brought suit claiming breach of contract and violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act. Wolens, 513 U.S. at 224-25. The Supreme Court held that claims under the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act were preempted by the ADA, but that the breach-of-contract claims were not. Id. at 226. The Supreme Court explained that the frequent-flyer program in question related to the air carrier’s rates because the airline gave mileage credits for free tickets, upgrades, and services, and because the program provided access to flights and service class upgrades regardless of capacity controls and blackout dates. Id. In contrast, the breach-of-contract claims were not preempted because they did not allege a violation of a state-imposed obligation, but rather alleged a violation of a self-imposed (contractual) obligation. Id. at 229. The Supreme Court stressed that the purpose of the ADA was to promote market efficiency and that the ability to enforce private contracts through a breach-of-contract action was fundamental to a stable and efficient market. Id. at 230.', 'Most recently, in Ginsberg, the Supreme Court held that an airline customer’s claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing was preempted by the ADA. Ginsberg, 572 U.S. at 288. The airline had terminated the customer’s membership in the airline’s frequent flyer program based on alleged abuse of the program. Id. at 277. The customer sued, alleging, among other things, that the termination of his membership violated the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Id. at 278. The Supreme Court explained that even state common-law rules such as the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing are preempted by the broad sweep of the ADA such that an exemption for common-law claims would be contrary to the ADA’s central purpose. Id. at 281-82. The Supreme Court went on to explain that what', '-9- was important was the effect of the challenged provision on prices, routes, or services, because state common-law rules can undermine the purpose of the ADA as much as a statute or regulation can. Id. at 282, 283. The Supreme Court further explained that the claim in question was clearly related to “rates, routes, or services” because the plaintiff sought reinstatement in the airline’s frequent-flyer program so that he could accrue mileage credits that could be redeemed for tickets and upgrades. Id. at 284-85.', 'Accordingly, federal preemption under the ADA extends to claims related to state consumer-protection statutes, frequent-flyer programs, common-law implied covenants, and advertising guidelines, because of a connection to the core “services” that an airline provides. With these principles in mind, we turn to the merits of whether petitioners’ claims are preempted by the ADA.', 'As a preliminary matter, the fact that § 25-3-3 may impose costs on airlines and therefore adversely affect fares is inconsequential. As the First Circuit noted, were preemption to apply to a state law solely in that circumstance, preemption “would effectively exempt airlines from state taxes, state lawsuits of many kinds, and perhaps most other state regulation of any consequence.” DiFiore v. American Airlines, Inc., 646 F.3d 81, 89 (1st Cir. 2011). Because “countless state laws have some relation to the operations of airlines and thus some potential effect on the prices charged or services provided[,]” we recognize that there is a limit to the ADA’s preemptive scope. Id. at 86 (emphasis in original). Nevertheless, on certiorari, petitioners argue that Delta failed to satisfy its burden of proof of demonstrating that compliance with § 25-3-3 would have a “significant impact” on its prices, routes, and services because, petitioners contend, the record is devoid of any facts upon which one could reasonably conclude that an increase in labor costs alone would have any impact on rates, routes, and services, “much less a significant impact.”', '- 10 - Contrary to petitioners’ contention, however, Delta has demonstrated that compliance with § 25- 3-3 goes far beyond a mere increase in labor costs.', 'The First Circuit has emphasized that evidence of “a statute’s ‘potential’ impact on carriers’ prices, routes, and services can be sufficient if it is significant, rather than tenuous, remote, or peripheral.” Massachusetts Delivery Association v. Coakley, 769 F.3d 11, 21 (1st Cir. 2014); see Dilts v. Penske Logistics, LLC, 769 F.3d 637, 647 (9th Cir. 2014) (stating that even a statute’s potential impact on carrier’s prices, routes, and services can be sufficient). Empirical evidence in this regard is not necessary, and courts may “look to the logical effect that a particular scheme has on the delivery of services or the setting of rates.” Coakley, 769 F.3d at 21 (brackets omitted) (quoting New Hampshire Motor Transport Association v. Rowe, 448 F.3d 66, 82 n.14 (1st Cir. 2006)). Such “logical effect can be sufficient even if indirect.” Id.', 'The petitioners take issue with the fact that Delta’s evidence at the remand hearing was limited to two witnesses who failed to provide “a single fact upon which it could base a prediction of such baleful effects.” Specifically, petitioners assert that Delta failed to satisfy its burden of demonstrating how compliance with § 25-3-3 would affect labor costs and how compliance with § 25-3-3 would be so onerous as to drive airlines away from Rhode Island, because Delta’s witnesses were not experts, their opinions were speculative, and their conclusions were unsupported by facts or quantifiable evidence. However, we are hard-pressed to agree because, as elucidated above, conclusive evidence of the potential impact is not required to trigger preemption. The First Circuit in Coakley did not announce a categorical rule that an airline always needs to provide analytical data on the effect of a petitioner’s claim on its prices or services in order to demonstrate preemption under the ADA. Rather, in deciding the preemption question, the First Circuit explicitly “allowed courts to ‘look to the logical effect that a particular', '- 11 - scheme has on the delivery of services or the setting of rates.’” Coakley, 769 F.3d at 21 (brackets omitted) (quoting Rowe, 448 F.3d at 82 n.14).', 'During the remand hearing before the hearing officer, Delta offered the sworn testimony of Ms. LaPlante, the station manager for Delta at T.F. Green Airport, and Mr. Fredericks, President and CEO of RIAC. They testified that forcing Delta, and other airlines, to comply with the requirements of § 25-3-3 could impact the services that Delta and other airlines provide on Sundays and holidays.4 Mr. Fredericks testified that, in his experience, forcing compliance with § 25-3-3’s time-and-a-half pay would have a direct impact on an airline’s decision-making process concerning discretionary services, customer interaction, and staffing. He testified that Sundays and holidays are some of the most important days to RIAC and stated that increased labor costs “could lead to reduction in service from a flight frequency opportunity[.]”', 'In addition, Ms. LaPlante testified that one of her main duties is to ensure that Delta provides superior customer service, and that forcing Delta to pay premium pay to its Rhode Island employees could impact or modify staffing and services; this, according to Ms. LaPlante, would likely cause airlines like Delta to reduce staff on Sundays and holidays and would make Delta less competitive in the Rhode Island market. With this testimony in hand, the conclusion that requiring airlines such as Delta to provide one-and-one-half-times the normal rate of pay for work on Sundays and holidays does in fact “relate to” the services provided by Delta. Thus, the “logical effect” of § 25-3-3 on Delta’s delivery of services is sufficient to bring it within the preemptive scope of the ADA. 4', 'As relevant here, “service” includes “steps that occur before * * * the airplane is actually taxiing or in flight.” DiFiore v.

12,"La Gondola, Inc. : v. : City of Providence, by and through its : Treasurer James J. Lombardi, et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The plaintiff, La Gondola, Inc. (La Gondola), appeals from a September 14, 2016 judgment entered after a bench trial in Providence County Superior Court, which judgment was in favor of the defendants, the City of Providence (the City), the Rhode Island Zoological Society (the Zoo), P.G.S., Inc., and various municipal officials. 1 The case concerns the awarding of a concessions contract for concessions at Carousel Village in Roger Williams Park, which is located in the City of Providence. On appeal, La Gondola contends that the trial justice erred in: (1) “concluding that the [bidding] process was free of corruption, bad faith, and/or an abuse of discretion;” (2) holding that a certain amendment to the contract at issue, which dealt with the operation of a trackless train, was not enforceable; and (3) denying La Gondola’s “contractual interference claim.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) 1', 'The municipal officials named as defendants are: Robert F. McMahon, in his capacity as Superintendent of the City of Providence Department of Parks & Recreation; Wendy Nilsson, in her capacity as Superintendent of the City of Providence Department of Parks & Recreation; Mayor Jorge O. Elorza, in his capacity as Chairman of the City of Providence Board of Contract and Supply; and Alan Sepe, in his capacity as Director of Operations for the City of Providence.', '-1-', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Roger Williams Park is a spacious and inviting public space owned by the City of Providence.', 'Situated on four hundred and thirty-five acres, it contains numerous public attractions such as the Roger Williams Park Zoo, Carousel Village, and the Dalrymple Boathouse (the Boathouse).2 This case involves a dispute over the concessions contract for Carousel Village, which contract the City ultimately awarded to the Zoo, rather than to La Gondola. We begin by addressing what La Gondola alleged in its March 1, 2016 third amended complaint (the complaint), and we will then proceed to relate the testimony presented at trial.', 'In its complaint, La Gondola stated that it operated concessions at the Boathouse in Roger Williams Park pursuant to a concessions contract, the initial term of which will expire on May 16, 2021. The complaint further stated that La Gondola also operated concessions at Carousel Village pursuant to a concessions contract with the City, the initial term of which ended on April 30, 2015, “with an additional five year term that was to expire on April 30, 2020 if the rent was mutually agreed upon by the City and LaGondola prior to April 30, 2015.”', 'At some point during the pendency of the latter contract, La Gondola purchased a trackless train, which would serve as an attraction at Carousel Village. The complaint alleged that, on January 30, 2014, after the train was purchased, La Gondola and the City entered into an “Amendment to the Carousel Village Lease” (the Train Amendment), which stated that La Gondola would “remain exclusive provider of all train rides within Roger Williams Park and Zoo 2', 'See Roger Williams Park, http://www.providenceri.gov/providence-parks/roger-williams- park/ (last visited on June 14, 2019).', '-2- under this or any other current contract with the City of Providence within Roger Williams Park and Zoo.”', 'The complaint went on to relate that, at the time period at issue, a contract which existed between the Zoo and the City for the operation of the Zoo was set to expire on June 30, 2015. It was further stated in the complaint that Robert McMahon, the Superintendent of the City of Providence Department of Parks & Recreation, who recommended that the City award the Carousel Village concessions contract to the Zoo, was also an ex-officio member of the Zoo’s Board of Trustees, which Board was involved in negotiating a new contract between the City and the Zoo.3 (La Gondola gives great weight to that uncontested fact in its argument before this Court.) The complaint proceeded to state that the City informed the Zoo that it was going to reduce its annual payments to the Zoo by $300,000 beginning in fiscal year 2015. It then alleged that the Zoo agreed to the reduction “so long as the City provided the [Zoo] with other sources of revenue” and that the parties discussed the Zoo operating the concessions at Carousel Village and the Boathouse. The complaint pointed to specific communications from Doctor Jeremy Goodman, the Executive Director of the Zoo, to Mr. McMahon and Alan Sepe, the Director of Operations for the City, indicating that the City had “verbally committed” to granting the Zoo the Carousel Village concessions contract. See Part III.A.2, infra.', 'In relating the factual background of this case, the complaint went on to state that, in November of 2014, Mr. McMahon met with Cynthia and Allen Days (Cynthia Days being the President of La Gondola and Allen Days being both her husband and also a person affiliated with the corporation) to discuss the possible five-year extension of the concessions contract for 3', 'We note that the City provided this Court with a copy of the “Lease and Operating Agreement Between the City of Providence and the Rhode Island Zoological Society” dated July 13, 2005, which agreement provides that “[t]he Superintendent shall serve as an ex-officio member of the [Zoo’s] Board of Trustees.”', '-3- Carousel Village and the need for capital improvements to Carousel Village. The Days wanted a contractual extension for a period greater than five years if they were to agree to pay for the needed capital improvements. The complaint stated that Mr. McMahon told the Days that such an extension would have to be the subject of a request for proposal. Accordingly, the complaint indicated that, on December 15, 2014, the Board of Contract and Supply approved a “Request For Proposals For Operation Of Carousel Village At Roger Williams Park” (the RFP).', 'The RFP provided for a ten-year contract with a minimum rent bid of $95,000. It also included required capital improvements totaling $156,000; those improvements included a restroom renovation to, among other things, convert the conventional toilet system into a waterless Clivus Multrum System, which is a composting toilet system. Two addenda were ultimately added to the RFP. The first addendum made certain changes to the scope of needed capital improvements, the cost of which then totaled $241,000. The second addendum made the contract be one of twenty, rather than ten, years in duration; and it extended the time period for completion of the capital improvements from two years to three and a half years.', 'Importantly, the RFP also stated that “[t]he Parks Department reserves the right to accept or reject any or all proposals received as a result of this request, or to cancel in part or in its entirety this proposal if it is in the Parks Department best interest to do so.” Section 6.7 of the RFP further provided that “[t]he City reserves the right to accept other than the highest value proposals, to reject any or all proposals, and to waive any of the requirements of the bid selection procedures explained in this document.”', 'According to the complaint, P.G.S., Inc. submitted a proposal for $292,435, which was an amount less than the required minimum bid (viz., the minimum rent of $95,000 plus capital improvements of $241,000). La Gondola submitted a bid of $525,569, which committed it to', '-4- performing all of the required capital improvements. The Zoo submitted a bid of $591,000, which bid met the $241,000 required for capital improvements that were listed in the RFP but did not include the capital improvement relative to the installation of the Clivus Multrum System.4 For that reason, La Gondola alleges that the Zoo’s bid was unresponsive to the RFP. The complaint proceeded to state that Mr. McMahon recommended that the City accept the Zoo’s bid and that the Board of Contract and Supply so voted. Ultimately, on August 21, 2015, the City and the Zoo entered into a concessions contract for Carousel Village, which will expire in 2035.', 'The complaint contained six counts. We relate in detail only those counts with which we are concerned in this appeal. Count One requested a declaratory judgment to the effect that: (1) the Zoo’s bid was not responsive to the RFP; (2) the Zoo’s bid materially deviated from the specifications of the RFP; (3) the City engaged in favoritism in selecting the Zoo’s bid; (4) the City colluded with the Zoo in selecting the Zoo’s bid; (5) the City predetermined that it was going to select the Zoo’s bid; (6) “the City acted corruptly or in bad faith, or so unreasonably or arbitrarily as to be guilty of a palpable abuse of discretion;” (7) the concessions contract between the City and the Zoo was void; (8) La Gondola’s bid was responsive; (9) La Gondola’s bid “should be selected as the successful bid for the RFP;” (10) the Zoo should be ordered to vacate 4', 'The Zoo’s bid specifically stated as follows:', '“[The Zoo] does not believe the installation of a composting toilet', 'is necessary for the operation of the carousel concessions as there', 'are four bathroom stalls in the ladies room and two stalls and two', 'urinals in the men’s room. The [Zoo] commits to all other capital', 'investment required in the RFP and commits to the entire', 'allowance of $241,000 over the first 3.5 years. In lieu of the', 'composting toilet, a capital investment will be made to repair', 'gutters, provide additional picnic tables, new signage, parking lot', 'striping and other amenities to improve the area.”', '-5- Carousel Village; and (11) La Gondola should be awarded the operation of the concessions at Carousel Village. Count Two sought a writ of mandamus “directing the City to award the RFP to LaGondola and * * * to enter into a contract with LaGondola for the Carousel Village” concessions. Count Three sought a declaratory judgment with respect to the fact that the contract eventually entered into between the Zoo and the City for the Carousel Village concessions provided the Zoo the exclusive right to operate rides and concessions at Carousel Village, allegedly in contravention of the Train Amendment (see supra). Specifically, La Gondola requested a declaration that: (1) the Train Amendment was valid and enforceable; (2) the concessions contract between the Zoo and the City was void and unenforceable “to the extent that it conflicts with LaGondola’s rights under [the Train Amendment] and the Boathouse [concessions contract];” (3) the concessions contract between the City and the Zoo exceeded the geographical limitations set forth in the RFP; (4) La Gondola can operate its train within two hundred feet of Carousel Village; and (5) the Zoo may not operate a trackless train in Roger Williams Park and Zoo. Count Six alleged intentional interference with prospective contractual relations.5', 'A trial ensued on all counts in the complaint over eight days in March and April of 2016. We relate below the salient details of what transpired at the trial. 5', 'The remaining counts sought a declaratory judgment with respect to the concessions at the Boathouse and alleged breach of contract and breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. The Zoo also filed a counterclaim against La Gondola and a cross-claim against the City, “Mayor Jorge O. Elorza[,] in his capacity as Chairmain [sic] of the Board of Contract and Supply, Wendy Nillson[,] in her capacity as Superintendent of Parks, and James J. Lombardi in his capacity as Treasurer[.]” None of the remaining counts of the complaint, the counterclaim, or the cross-claim were raised in this appeal; and, as such, we focus only on those counts which are at issue on appeal.', '-6-', 'A', 'The Testimony of Robert McMahon', 'Robert McMahon testified that he had been the Deputy Superintendent of the City of Providence Parks & Recreation Department from 1986 to 2008 and then Superintendent from 2008 until his retirement in 2015. He stated in the course of his testimony that the Parks & Recreation Department oversees Roger Williams Park and that, as Superintendent, his direct superior was Alan Sepe, the Director of Operations for the City. He testified that, in his capacity as Superintendent, he served as an “ex officio member” of the Zoo’s Board of Trustees and that, while he was not a voting member, he might “sometimes weigh in on zoo renovations [and] proposed projects that were being considered.”', 'It was Mr. McMahon’s testimony that, on occasion, when awarding a contract, bidders “still might get the bid” even “if they didn’t completely match every specification or requirement;” he added that that would be “[b]ecause some of the RFPs were discretionary in nature and involved discretion in terms of awarding the bid.” He stated that, if a bidder “met substantially all the requirements of the RFP but did not meet one of them, there would be discretion involved in awarding that bid.”', 'It was further Mr. McMahon’s testimony with respect to the trackless train that La Gondola had performed “some renovations” to a nearby tunnel for use with respect to the train rides. He added that he had read and signed the Train Amendment.', 'It was further his testimony that the City’s $300,000 reduction in funding to the Zoo was “not a negotiation[.]” He further stated that, after that reduction became known, Dr. Goodman stated that “they would need to look at all other concessions operating in the park to see whether they could take them over and offset the loss” and that Dr. Goodman was interested in Carousel', '-7- Village and the Boathouse. Mr. McMahon stated in his testimony that he told Dr. Goodman that those two concessions were already under contract; his testimony reflects the fact that he told Dr. Goodman multiple times that the Carousel Village concessions were under contract. He added that, despite having been advised of that fact, Dr. Goodman proposed including the Carousel Village concessions in the Zoo’s new contract with the City.', 'In the course of testifying with respect to an October 23, 2014 email which he had received from Dr. Goodman, Mr. McMahon stated that the Zoo accepted the loss in revenue from the City “[b]ecause they felt that the city was going to continue to work with them to provide them additional revenue opportunities.” He further stated that, in response to an October 8, 2014 email, he told Dr. Goodman that there was a “loophole” in the concessions contract with La Gondola with respect to Carousel Village; he testified that he “realized that the [2020] end date of the [La Gondola] contract with [respect to] Carousel Village was just an option, if it * * * was to go beyond 2015.” He added that that option “had to be exercised by both parties.”', 'It was Mr. McMahon’s subsequent testimony that he met with the Days in early November of 2014 and told them that the Carousel Village concessions contract would “probably be going out to bid again with an RFP that incorporated capital improvements into the work of the RFP.” He added that the Days were “disappointed” but that they did not offer “any other kind of proposal.” Mr. McMahon stated that he did not simply recommend an extension of La Gondola’s contract for the Carousel Village concessions beyond the five-year option, which longer extension the complaint alleged La Gondola had requested; he added that he did not make such a recommendation because he “felt the capital improvements and the rent were going to far exceed what [La Gondola was] going to be offering.” With respect to the five-year extension option on La Gondola’s Carousel Village concessions contract, Mr. McMahon testified that, in', '-8- October of 2014, he asked the Days for their rent proposal and did not receive a formal response until March of 2015.', 'It was Mr. McMahon’s subsequent testimony that he prepared the RFP. He also stated that it was his understanding that Section 6.7 of the RFP allowed the City to waive particular requirements relative to the bid selection process. With respect to the Zoo’s resulting bid, Mr. McMahon testified that the omission of the composting toilet “was a relatively minor item compared to all of the other items in the bid.” It was his testimony that the Zoo’s bid, “in totality,” exceeded La Gondola’s bid.', 'On cross-examination, Mr. McMahon testified that no one from the City administration told him to issue the RFP and that he decided to do so on his own, in consultation with Karen Gomez, the Department of Parks & Recreation’s “fiscal person.”', 'He stated that, in recommending that the Zoo be awarded the contract, he took into account the fact that the Zoo “submitted a superior bid with respect to dollars,” while, in contrast to the Zoo’s bid, “the Days didn’t propose [to] start paying rent until year 11.” He further stated that the Zoo’s bid offered “the best financial deal” for the City.', 'B', 'The Testimony of Dr. Jeremy Goodman', 'Doctor Goodman testified that it was in December of 2013 or January of 2014 when he first became aware of a “problem” with the City’s funding of the Zoo “as far as the city’s desire to alter the agreement to try to decrease payments.” He further stated that, at a meeting attended by several of the Zoo’s board members, Mr. McMahon, and Mr. Sepe in March or April of 2014, he expressed a desire “to take over revenue generating opportunities in the park;” he added that Carousel Village, the park’s concessions, boating, and a ropes course were all mentioned. He', '-9- stated that the “only discussion at that moment was to explore those concessions and their availability,” although he acknowledged later in his testimony that there was a discussion about incorporating the Carousel Village concessions into the new lease agreement between the Zoo and the City. He added that he believed that Mr. Sepe asked Mr. McMahon to look into whether or not there was an “out clause” in the contract between the City and La Gondola with respect to the Carousel Village concessions.', 'La Gondola also points to the following testimony by Dr. Goodman with respect to the Zoo’s response to the decrease in City funding: “[W]e also stated that we would need potential revenue generating opportunities in the park and desired to have a new agreement put into place, you know, in exchange for taking a $300,000 cut from what the city owed us.”', 'Doctor Goodman further testified that, from his perspective, he was engaged in negotiations to press for the Carousel Village concessions being incorporated into the Zoo’s new lease, stating that the concessions “were something that we had desired to have, so we kept on insisting.” He also stated that Mr. McMahon told him in the Summer of 2014 that the Carousel Village concessions contract would have to go out to bid.', 'Importantly, Dr. Goodman testified on cross-examination that no one from the City, including Mayor Elorza, Mr. Sepe, or Mr. McMahon, had promised the Zoo the Carousel Village concessions contract prior to the final award of the bid. He added that he “had a certain lack of trust with [Mr.] McMahon,” because he was afraid that Mr. McMahon “was doing everything in his power to try to keep the Carousel Village with the current vendor * * *.”', '- 10 -', 'C', 'The Testimony of Alan Sepe', 'Alan Sepe testified that, typically, if a bid did not meet the specifications of the RFP, “you’d look at the next bidder * * *.”', 'However, he further stated that he considered the “financial aspect” of the Zoo’s bid to be “whole” despite the fact that it did not include the Clivus Multrum System, since the bid did include the same amount of money for capital improvements as was requested in the RFP—“they just had a different opinion as far as where the money should go.” He further testified on cross-examination that the City’s funding to the Zoo was reduced before the Carousel Village concessions even went out to bid. It was also his testimony on cross-examination that, to his knowledge, no one from the City guaranteed any concessions to the Zoo.', 'D', 'The Testimony of Allen Days', 'Allen Days testified that La Gondola began operating a trackless train at Carousel Village in early April of 2013.

The Decision of the Trial Justice', 'The trial justice in the instant case issued a comprehensive written decision detailing sixty-six findings of fact.6 He then found “by a preponderance of the evidence that the City’s declared intent to reduce payments to [the Zoo] caused [the Zoo] to urge the City to assist it in finding ways to increase [the Zoo’s] revenues.” He further stated that “[d]iscussions between the Zoo’s director (Dr. Goodman) and Mr. McMahon led to the Parks Department furnishing to the Zoo director copies of the existing concession contracts” and that, “[i]n its discussions and communications with the Park superintendent, the Zoo pressed for the handing over to it of the Carousel Village Concession; indeed, even asking that it be included as part of the Zoo contract [with the City].” The trial justice also specifically addressed the fact that “Dr. Goodman in 6', 'We note that the trial justice found as a fact that La Gondola’s bid “included a dollar for dollar rent abatement against the completed capital improvements.” He further found that “Mr. McMahon ignored La Gondola’s request for abatement and thereby treated the bid as responsive, and represented the entire $525,569.00 to the Board of Contract and Supply.” There appears to be disagreement among the parties before this Court as to the existence of a rent abatement proposal in La Gondola’s bid. In deciding this case on appeal, we will ignore, as Mr. McMahon did, any potential rent abatement in La Gondola’s bid (without making any determination as to whether or not the bid provides for rent abatement), due to the fact that the existence or non- existence of rent abatement in the bid would not alter our conclusion in this case. We are unable to perceive any error on the part of the trial justice even when we treat La Gondola’s bid as totaling $525,569.', '- 13 - communications to the City even referred to alleged verbal commitments from City officials to hand over the Carousel Village Concession to the Zoo,” but the trial justice found that there was “no evidence of either an affirmation or denial by City officials of any such commitment in written communications between the City and the Zoo.”', 'The trial justice subsequently held as follows:', '“Based upon the Court’s findings of fact, this Court cannot', 'conclude that in any of the actions contested by Plaintiff has it', 'identified corruption or bad faith as Plaintiff has defined those', 'terms or as those terms generally are construed. There was neither', 'a suggestion of corruption nor a scintilla of evidence suggesting', 'corruption or bad faith in any testimony or exhibit admitted during', 'the trial.”', 'The trial justice then proceeded to address whether or not there was an abuse of discretion by the City or city officials. He stated that the record indicated that Mr. McMahon “had attempted to divert the Zoo’s interest in the Carousel concession by reminding it that Plaintiff was a small, family business,” and he noted that La Gondola had “obtained amendments to the RFP which it believed was to its benefit.” He further pointed out that the absence of the Clivus Multrum System in the Zoo’s bid “did not result in a cost saving to the Zoo * * *.” As such, he found as follows:', '“Our jurisprudence certainly affords public officials', 'involved in procurement (and by analogy) in the awarding of', 'concessions a certain amount of discretion and does not tie their', 'hands in legalistic knots. The RFP here announced to all the', 'reservation of certain rights with respect to the bidding procedures', 'and process.

La Gondola’s Contentions on Appeal', 'La Gondola contends on appeal that, “where the city official who prepared the RFP, evaluated the responsive bids, and made the selection on the award was at all pertinent times a member of the board of the successful bidder (which had submitted a non-conforming bid), and where the successful bidder and the City had colluded on the outcome of the bid process, the trial justice erred in concluding that the process was free of corruption, bad faith, and/or an abuse of discretion.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) La Gondola asserts that there was some sort of “quid pro quo” between the Zoo and the City and that the award of the concessions contract to the Zoo was a “done deal.” In La Gondola’s opinion, the City “excused the serious deficiency in [the Zoo’s] Carousel bid” and the trial justice “erred in failing to give proper weight to the substantial defect in the [Zoo’s] bid * * *.” La Gondola further avers that the trial justice “simply ignored all evidence demonstrating that [the Zoo] had induced the City to break its relationship with La Gondola, that the Carousel Village contract was quid pro quo for the City’s ability to reduce its payments to [the Zoo], [and] that McMahon, Sepe, and Goodman worked together to rig the process to deliver the Carousel to [the Zoo] * * *.”', 'La Gondola further points to numerous exhibits at trial to support its assertions.

It included the following statement: “City will allow the [Zoo] to assume operations of the carousel park, park’s food concessions and paddleboats * * *.”', 'On August 22, 2014, Dr. Goodman again emailed Mr. McMahon, stating that “[t]he [Zoo’s] assuming the carousel and food operations beginning on January 1, 2015 is critical to the agreement as revenue from this operation is needed to decrease the City’s payment in 2015 by $300,000. This was the verbal commitment made by each party when we first met.”', 'In an October 8, 2014 email from Dr. Goodman to Mr. McMahon, Dr. Goodman reiterated that the Zoo made a “verbal commitment” to accept the decrease in the City’s funding to the Zoo if the City would “commit to providing the [Zoo] with additional revenue streams in the park as part of a long term agreement.” Doctor Goodman further stated as follows:', '“Adding the carousel to the zoo’s operation is critical to', 'establishing an aerial obstacle course in that area of the park.

La Gondola further alleges that, with respect to the five-year extension of its Carousel Village concessions contract with the City, the City “declined to enter into the good faith price negotiations that the agreement contemplated.”', '3. Discussion', 'In this Court’s opinion in Kayak Centre, we held that G.L. 1956 § 45-55-5, which details the procedure for competitive sealed bidding with respect to municipal contracts and which states that “[t]he contract shall be awarded * * * to the responsive and responsible bidder whose bid is either the lowest bid price, or lowest evaluated or responsive bid price,” was not applicable to concessions contracts.

However, our precedent in this area makes clear that in this case La Gondola needed to do much more than engage in such lint-picking; it was required to prove that the award of the Carousel Village concessions contract to the Zoo was the result of corruption, bad faith, or a palpable abuse of discretion. See Gilbane, 107 R.I. at 300, 267 A.2d at 399. Given the high level of deference which we give to a trial justice’s factual findings and which our jurisprudence instructs should be given to municipal officials and boards in awarding contracts, we are simply unable to reach the conclusion that the trial justice erred in his determination that there was no corruption, bad faith, or abuse of discretion in the bidding process at issue. See State v. Diaz, 159 A.3d 1053, 1062 (R.I. 2017) (stating that “a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts', '- 19 - and to judge the credibility of the witnesses”) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also National Labor Relations Board v.

We further acknowledge that Mr. McMahon was an “ex-officio” member of the Zoo’s board during the entire period at issue. However, we cannot conclude that these facts alone indicate that the trial justice abused his discretion in his findings of fact or erred in applying the law to those facts. Indeed, the email communications reflect only that Dr. Goodman believed that there had been some sort of verbal commitment with respect to revenue sources in Roger Williams Park, not that any City official had in actuality given the Zoo any guarantees with respect to the Carousel Village concessions contract.7 Mr. McMahon testified that he told Dr. Goodman on multiple occasions that the Carousel Village concessions were under contract, and Dr. Goodman testified that he continued to propose including the Carousel Village concessions in the new contract 7', 'We note that Dr. Goodman testified on cross-examination that his understanding of the verbal “commitment” made by the City to the Zoo was to “explore the opportunities to provide [the Zoo] with other sources of revenue * * *.” In addition, Mr. Sepe stated on cross- examination that the “verbal commitment” as to the funding reduction between the Zoo and the City, referenced in an email from Dr. Goodman to Mr. McMahon, involved the City helping the Zoo find sources of additional revenue, but he added that it was not possible for the City to “just give” the contract for the Carousel Village concessions to the Zoo.', '- 20 - between the Zoo and the City because it was something the Zoo “desired to have, so we kept on insisting.” Dr. Goodman further testified, as did Mr. Sepe, that no one from the City promised the Zoo the Carousel Village concessions contract prior to its eventual award. We simply have no basis to assign any error to the trial justice’s conclusions in this case when there is clearly ample testimony on which he could have relied to come to the conclusion that there was no corruption, bad faith, or abuse of discretion in this case.', 'What is more, the evidence at trial showed that the Zoo’s bid was financially the superior bid by $65,431; and Mr. McMahon testified that that was the reason he recommended awarding the contract to the Zoo. La Gondola makes much of the fact that the Zoo’s bid did not contain the composting toilet system. However, the Zoo’s bid still contained the entire $241,000 allotted for capital improvements. Additionally, Mr. McMahon testified that the toilet “was a relatively minor item,” and Mr. Sepe testified that the financial aspect of the Zoo’s bid was “whole” despite the fact that it did not include the composting toilet system. We also note that the RFP itself contained specific and significant language reserving to the City the right to “accept other than the highest value proposals * * * and to waive any of the requirements of the bid selection procedures” and stating that “[t]he Parks Department reserves the right to accept or reject any or all proposals received as a result of this request, or to cancel in part or in its entirety this proposal if it is in the Parks Department best interest to do so.”', 'Mr. McMahon testified to his understanding that the RFP so stated, and the trial justice also noted that fact in his decision. Mr. McMahon also added in his testimony at trial that, generally, bidders could still “get the bid” even “if they didn’t completely match every specification or requirement” due to the fact that “some of the RFPs were discretionary in nature[.]”', '- 21 -', 'It is also of import that the evidence adduced at trial reflects the fact that the five-year contract extension option between La Gondola and the City would go into effect only if both parties could agree on the rent amount. Mr. McMahon testified that he nonetheless asked the Days for a rent proposal, but they opted not to provide one for approximately five months. Additionally, the trial justice expressly relied on the fact that there was no assurance that such an agreement would ever have been reached; and we likewise take due note of that consideration.', 'We have stated our “belief that courts can and will recognize corruption, bad faith, or a manifest abuse of discretion when it appears from the evidence presented in a case.” Gilbane, 107 R.I. at 302, 267 A.2d at 400. The trial justice in this case did not recognize any such corruption, bad faith, or abuse of discretion. It is clear to this Court that the seasoned trial justice had sufficient evidence on which to rely in making both his findings of fact and credibility determinations and in arriving at his legal conclusions. We can find no abuse of discretion or an error of law on the part of the trial justice.', 'The law should not place public officials and boards in a “legalistic straitjacket” when awarding contracts. Id.; see also HK & S Construction Holding Corp., 111 A.3d at 412. Doing so would not be in line with our jurisprudence, especially the presumption of correctness that we apply in this area. See Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, 865 A.2d at 1081. As we have previously stated, our review in this case is governed by the principle that it is our role to accord a very high level of deference—both the deference we owe the trial justice’s factual findings and the presumption of correctness that we owe to the public officials involved in this contractual award—which level of deference we do not believe La Gondola has overcome in this case. See id.', '- 22 -', 'Accordingly, after careful consideration of all the evidence adduced at trial and the contentions of the parties on appeal, it is our judgment that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion with respect to any of his factual findings and did not err in his conclusion that there was no corruption, bad faith, or palpable abuse of discretion in this case.', 'B', 'The Trackless Train Amendment', 'The evidence adduced at trial reflects the fact that La Gondola operated a trackless train at Carousel Village prior to the RFP and the bidding process at issue in this case. However, in the Zoo’s bid, it proposed to “operate a miniature trackless train” in Carousel Village. La Gondola maintained that it possessed the exclusive right to operate a trackless train within Roger Williams Park pursuant to the Train Amendment.8 Nevertheless, the trial justice ruled that the Train Amendment was not binding on the City and was “without force or effect.”', 'La Gondola contends on appeal that its “exclusive right to operate the trackless train should not have ended when [Mr.] McMahon gave the Carousel Village to [the Zoo].” It avers that Mr. McMahon had the authority to enter into the Train Amendment and that the amendment did not lack consideration. It also deals with the fact that La Gondola did not sign the Train Amendment by contending that the fact that La Gondola initiated the amendment and supplied the language thereof constituted sufficient execution; La Gondola argues that “[t]he missing signature line was a mere oversight by both executing parties, La Gondola has always been willing to sign.” 8', 'The language of the Train Amendment stated that La Gondola would “remain exclusive provider of all train rides within Roger Williams Park and Zoo under this or any other current contract with the City of Providence within Roger Williams Park and Zoo.”', '- 23 -', 'In our judgment, the Train Amendment was invalid due to the fact that a representative of La Gondola did not sign it.

After reviewing the contract language at issue, we are in agreement with the trial justice.', 'We note initially that whether or not a contract is clear and unambiguous is a question of law.

It is apparent to this Court from the just-quoted language of the Carousel Village concessions contract between La Gondola and the City that, for an amendment to be valid, it must be executed by both parties. Thus, the interpretation of this contract hinges on the meaning of the term “execute.”', 'In our opinion, the language of the Carousel Village concessions contract between the City and La Gondola, including the meaning of the term “execute,” is utterly clear and unambiguous. As such, we need not construe that unambiguous language but simply “consider the dictates of the plain language in the contract.” Papudesu v.

However, it is clear to this Court that that simply does not constitute an actual execution of the amendment as required by the language of the contract between the City and La Gondola. What La Gondola terms “a mere oversight” is in fact an omission that is dispositive of the whole “trackless train” issue. The Train Amendment contains only the signature of Mr. McMahon. As such, the City certainly executed the amendment. But the contract between the parties clearly and unambiguously requires that the written instrument have been “executed by both Parties.” Without a signature of an authorized person acting on behalf of La Gondola, the Train Amendment was executed by only one party.

It should further be borne in mind that the Train Amendment has now been held to be invalid. Thus, there was no contract beyond April 30, 2015 for the Zoo to have interfered with. And, in our opinion, any prospective contractual relations or ongoing business relationship between the City and La Gondola with respect to Carousel Village after that date was too speculative and uncertain to be considered an expectancy. See Fogarty, 163 A.3d at 540.', 'We readily acknowledge that there was a potential five-year extension to the Carousel Village concessions contract between La Gondola and the City with rent payments “mutually agreed upon by both parties prior to April 30, 2015.” As the above-quoted language of the contract makes clear, any expectancy of a prospective contractual relationship between La Gondola and the City with respect to Carousel Village beyond April 30, 2015 required a mutual agreement on the rent to be paid. Despite that fact, La Gondola failed to make a rent proposal to the City for approximately five months after it was requested and did so only after the bids had been opened. Instead, La Gondola wanted the City to consider entering into a longer-term extension in exchange for La Gondola performing some capital improvements to Carousel Village. As the trial justice noted, in the end it is not at all certain that the City and La Gondola would ever have agreed upon an appropriate rent for a five-year extension.', 'What is more, it is clear to this Court that there was ample evidence adduced at trial to support a conclusion that, although the Zoo may have acted intentionally, it did not behave improperly. See Avilla, 935 A.2d at 98. Certainly the Zoo was aggressive in pursuing its goals with respect to its new contract with the City. (We note that Mr. McMahon and the City did not assent to the Zoo’s requests.) However, the Zoo certainly did not act with any legal malice or employ any illegal means under the facts of this case; the City had the right to put the contract', '- 28 - out to bid and to select the highest bidder to be awarded the contract. See id. at 99 (expressing approval for the requirement that, in an intentional interference with prospective contractual relations case, “a searching analysis only of motive is in most instances [not] enough to send these cases to the jury[;] [t]here must still * * * be something ‘illegal’ about the means employed”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Mesolella, 508 A.2d at 669-70; see also Roy v. Woonsocket Institution for Savings, 525 A.2d 915, 919 (R.I. 1987) (finding, in an intentional interference with prospective contractual relations case, no evidence indicating “legal malice”). As such, we are unable to perceive a basis for concluding that the Zoo intended to do harm to La Gondola without justification. See Mesolella, 508 A.2d at 669-70.', 'Thus, without evidence of the existence of improper interference on the part of the Zoo, La Gondola’s claim for intentional interference with prospective contractual relations could not succeed. Accordingly, it is our considered opinion that the trial justice did not err in entering judgment in favor of the Zoo on La Gondola’s claim of intentional interference with prospective contractual relations.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'In conclusion, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion or commit a clear error of law when he concluded that there was no corruption, bad faith, or a palpable abuse of discretion in this case. He further did not err in finding the Train Amendment to be not binding.

We remand the record to that tribunal.', '- 29 -', 'Justice Goldberg, dissenting. In its papers in this case, La Gondola, Inc. correctly sets forth the controlling criteria that must be established to successfully challenge a municipality’s bid-procurement process as that of corruption, bad faith, or conduct so arbitrary and unreasonable as to amount to a palpable abuse of discretion. La Gondola then posits:', '“Can that test ever be met?', '“If not here, then maybe not ever.” In the face of the record proof before the Court, I am compelled to agree; I therefore dissent.', 'The evidence in this case overwhelmingly established that the City of Providence and the Zoological Society embarked upon a concerted effort to take the Carousel Village concession from La Gondola in order for the City to avoid paying $300,000 to the Zoological Society. This is a quid pro quo. The Zoo promised the City that the only way the City could be relieved from paying the $300,000 it was contractually obliged to pay was to transfer the concession contracts in the Park to the Zoo. The City’s motive to set aside the La Gondola contract and the conflicts and lack of good faith by the Park Superintendent infected the entire bid process and resulted in bad-faith conduct that is so unreasonable and arbitrary as to amount to a palpable abuse of discretion. Although the law recognizes that public officials are permitted to exercise discretion in awarding bid contracts, that does not, in my opinion, overcome these wrongs; nor should this Court excuse them.', 'The evidence presented at trial, including numerous damning emails, clearly established that the plan to deliver the Carousel Village concession to the Zoo was conceived a full year before the original contract term with La Gondola was due to expire. The City would be relieved from paying $300,000 that it was contractually obliged to pay to the Zoo if, and only if, the City could deliver the concession contracts to the Zoo.', '- 30 -', 'The Zoological Society’s newly appointed director, Dr. Jeremy Goodman, who, from his prior employment, was versed in the potential revenue the Carousel Village could generate, testified that he wanted to erect an aerial rope course in the park in order to increase the Zoo’s revenues; access to the Carousel Village was a crucial component of his plan to construct it. Goodman admitted that he was interested in taking over the concessions operated by La Gondola, including the Carousel Village, the trackless train, and the rental boats. Goodman testified that the Zoo “was interested in all the revenue generating opportunities in the park[.]” Goodman succeeded.', 'At the end of the two-and-one-half-year term that La Gondola had assumed from the prior concessionaire, and without the benefit of the five-year extension that was granted by the City, La Gondola was forced to vacate. The evidence also established that, during its brief tenure, La Gondola, at its own expense, made significant labor investments and capital expenditures in reliance on its contract with the City.', 'At a meeting in 2014, Goodman testified, the Zoo and the Parks Department began discussions about the City getting out of its contract with La Gondola. The superintendent, Robert McMahon, was directed by Alan Sepe, the director of operations for the City, to look into getting out of the La Gondola contracts in favor of the Zoo. Despite the fact that La Gondola had a five-year extension and the exclusive right to operate the train in the park, La Gondola lost its concession contract and the right to operate the train anywhere in the park. By awarding the contract to the Zoo, the City avoided paying the $300,000 that it owed the Zoo. This was the quid pro quo.', 'The events of this case, as set forth in the email communications between the defendants, shock the conscience of this justice.', '- 31 -', 'La Gondola assumed the Carousel Village concession contract in November 2012; its tenure was brief. Goodman arrived on the scene in July 2013. Because of his unrelenting efforts on behalf of the Zoo, La Gondola lost its contract, despite an option to renew the contract for an additional five years. This option expressly provided that “[a]nnual rent for May 1, 2015 thru April 30, 2020 will be mutually agreed upon by both parties prior to April 30, 2015.” (Emphasis added.) At the very least, the parties were contractually bound to attempt to reach an agreed- upon rent. Parties to a contract owe a duty of good faith and fair dealing. Because of the City’s agreement with the Zoo, that did not occur. The trial justice misconceived this evidence.', 'Allen and Cynthia Days, the principals of La Gondola, testified to the significant investment of time, labor, and material in Carousel Village which, it was undisputed, had been long-neglected by the City and the previous concessionaire. The entire carousel building was cleaned from top to bottom, including powerwashing the floors, installing carpeting in the former gift shop, and replacing the lightbulbs on the carousel itself with LED lights,11 which would save the City $43,000 a year in electricity costs. They also cleaned the carousel from the top of the canopy, including polishing the poles, to the floor. The restrooms required extensive cleaning and maintenance. The Days installed an air-conditioning system in the carousel building for humidity control. La Gondola also purchased a trackless train for $58,000, as anticipated by the City in the original contract. Because the trackless train addition was included in the original contract between the parties, no additional rent was required. La Gondola then undertook the renovation of an existing tunnel to enhance the train ride experience. La Gondola cleared about fifty truckloads of refuse from the abandoned train tunnel, and powerwashed the space, at a cost of approximately $20,000. 11', 'La Gondola received a $6,000 rent abatement from the City for the cost of the bulbs, but not labor.', '- 32 -', 'While the Zoo’s plan to deprive La Gondola of its concession contracts was proceeding, there was no discussion about La Gondola’s annual rent increase that was scheduled to commence on May 1, 2015. Allen Days testified that, in January 2014, he and Cynthia met with McMahon at the carousel building and made a presentation about what they wanted to do to improve the operation and the repairs that needed to be done. He provided McMahon with a list of what he considered to be necessary. Allen Days testified that he knew “that the city didn’t have any funds to make the repairs,” and he offered to fund the repairs from their own resources if the City would be willing to extend the lease another five years. He testified that McMahon was receptive because it was a way for the City to have the repairs accomplished. However, the Days also knew that they had a five-year option in place as a fallback if the request was not granted. McMahon, knowing this would require approval from the Board of Contract and Supply, did nothing. Ten months elapsed. In November 2014, the parties sat down to discuss the rent increase. This meeting was a sham. La Gondola’s fate had already been sealed; the Zoo had an agreement to take over the Carousel Village contract before the Days were even notified that the option would not be honored.', 'At that November 2014 meeting between the Days and McMahon, the Days were informed that there would be an RFP for the Carousel Village, notwithstanding the renewal option in the contract. There was no negotiation for an agreed-upon rent, as required by La Gondola’s contract. Allen Days testified that McMahon assured him that “he honestly didn’t think anyone would be interested in bidding on the carousel.” This statement is belied by the evidence in this case consisting of the email correspondence between the municipal defendants and the Zoological Society. McMahon’s role in this case, standing alone, is grounds to set the bid procedure aside.', '- 33 -', 'The record establishes that McMahon was an ex-officio member of the Board of Trustees of the Zoological Society. The fact that he was not a voting member of the Board is of no moment in this case. After McMahon prepared the RFP, he attended a Board meeting during which the RFP was discussed. The Zoo expressed its concerns about the length of the contract in light of the capital improvements.', 'Two days after the Board meeting, McMahon issued Addendum 2 to the RFP and promptly sent an email to Goodman before the Addendum was published. That email reads as follows:', '“AFTER LISTENING TO YOUR PRESENTATION', 'WEDNESDAY NIGHT ON THE CAROUSEL BID YOU ARE', 'PREPARING, I HAVE ISSUED AN ADDENDUM TO', 'BASICALLY EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN OF THE', 'REQUIRED CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS * * * PURCHASING', 'WILL NOTIFY YOU TODAY ABOUT THIS TODAY, BUT I', 'AM SENDING IT TO YOU DIRECTLY NOW SINCE TIME IS', 'OF THE ESSENCE.', '“IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS TODAY OR OVER', 'THE WEEKEND, PLEASE CALL ME ON MY CELL * * *', '[PHONE NUMBER].”', 'In the face of this evidence, I am hard-pressed to see how the trial justice could conclude that there was no bad faith or corruption “in any testimony or exhibit admitted during the trial.” If securing a $300,000 quid pro quo with an RFP issued by a member of the Board of Trustees, who then recommends that the contract be awarded to the Zoo, is not bad faith and a palpable abuse of discretion, then what is?', 'Additionally, the very chronology of events, as set forth in the email evidence, establishes that the decision to award the concession contract to the Zoo was made before the Days were even asked to submit a proposal for the renewal option, and shows that the Parks Department violated its duty of good faith and fair dealing. As early as April 2014, more than a year before', '- 34 - the original contract term was due to expire, Goodman asked McMahon for copies of La Gondola’s current contracts for the carousel and all food, the frozen-lemonade truck and paddleboats because “[w]e’d like to review them and put the wording for any requirements in the proposed new contract.” McMahon complied.', 'On May 27, 2014, just short of a year before the contract expired and six months before the Days were informed that its option was not going to be honored, Goodman emailed McMahon and outlined the savings the City could realize by “allowing the zoo to assume operations of the carousel park, park’s food concessions and paddleboats.” He included a proposed schedule of reduced payments to the Zoo in exchange for the City giving the Zoo the “Carousel, park food and paddleboats.” Significantly, the City began implementing this reduced payment schedule before the RFP was issued. As will be discussed, this is part performance by the City.', 'On August 22, 2014, Goodman again corresponded with McMahon to confirm the terms of an oral agreement, which had been reached in July, that the Zoo would take over the carousel and food operations and the City would decrease its payments by $300,000. Goodman wrote: “This was the verbal commitment made by each party when we first met.” However, on August 26, 2014, McMahon advised Goodman about the option to extend La Gondola’s contract with the City.', 'On October 8, 2014, Goodman notified McMahon that the Carousel Village concession contract was crucial to the Zoo’s plan to erect an aerial obstacle course and that, without the concession “that was verbally committed to by the City, the Society will not be able to honor its verbal commitment to modify the existing written contract.” (Emphasis added.) Two days later, at 9:23 a.m., McMahon responded and assured Goodman that the City was “committed to', '- 35 - providing the Zoo with the opportunity to gain additional revenue in the park” and, because the option required the parties “to agree on new terms * * * we do have a loop hole [sic] to go out to bid on a new Carousel operator for a new lease starting in May 2015.” That same day, October 10, 2014, at 11:01 a.m., the Days received the following email from Karen Gomez of the Parks Department:', '“Bob [McMahon] and I were just discussing all the park leases. I', 'have attached a copy of the last [award which] has a 5 year option', 'that can be exercised with new mutually agreed to terms. * * *', 'Please let us know what you are considering and if applicable,', 'what type of lease income you are will[ing to] offer the parks', 'department for the next five years if you plan to ask to exercise the', '5-yr option.”', 'To be sure, the same morning that McMahon notified Goodman about the loophole and reaffirmed the City’s commitment to deliver the zoo concession in an email on which Gomez was copied, Gomez sent an email to the Days. There were six months left on their contract. The Days had made a proposal to McMahon in January 2014. A meeting was scheduled between McMahon and the Days. They were informed that the five-year option would not be honored and that there would be an RFP. Allen Days testified that they were concerned because “we had five years already in place. But [McMahon] had told us that he honestly didn’t think anyone would be interested in bidding on the carousel.”', 'The trial justice misconceived this evidence and characterized Gomez’s October 10, 2014 email to La Gondola as “the City’s request seeking an early agreement with respect to the request for a ‘rental’ proposal for the ensuing five year extension.” However, this email was sent to the Days the same morning that McMahon advised Goodman that he found a loophole in the La Gondola contract. The email to the Days was a sham and clear evidence of bad faith. The trial justice overlooked this evidence. When the parties met in November, there was no effort to', '- 36 - reach an agreement on rent; indeed, it was not discussed. The Days were informed that there would be an RFP. Also, the trial justice overlooked the evidence that McMahon and the Days had an extensive meeting at the carousel building in January 2014 to discuss capital improvements and a potential contract extension.', 'Searching for a loophole to avoid a contractual commitment to La Gondola, and then assuring Goodman of the City’s commitment to the Zoo for the concessions at the park, is not good faith and fair dealing. Then, an email to the Days the same morning asking them what they were willing to offer for an option the City had no intention to honor is not the good faith and fair dealing that our law requires of the parties to a contract. “Virtually every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing between the parties.”', 'Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc. v. Antonelli, 790 A.2d 1113, 1115 (R.I. 2002) (brackets omitted) (quoting Centerville Builders, Inc. v. Wynne, 683 A.2d 1340, 1342 (R.I. 1996)). Because this implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing is designed to ensure “that contractual objectives may be achieved,” neither party to the agreement “shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract.” McNulty v. Chip, 116 A.3d 173, 185 (R.I. 2015) (internal citations omitted).', 'At trial, Goodman and the City denied that there was an agreement between the Zoo and the City. Yet, the evidence proved that the City undertook part performance of this agreement when, in October 2014, it made reduced payments to the Zoo that exactly matched the contract modification that was discussed by the parties. Tellingly, in an email dated October 23, 2014, after the reduced payment, Goodman warned the City that, unless it delivered on its verbal commitment to provide the Zoo with the Carousel Village concession, the Zoo did not waive its right to the full amount owed under the contract. Goodman didn’t stop there. In a second email', '- 37 - that same day, he informed McMahon that he had just spoken with Alan Sepe “and everything is good[.]” Thus, after Goodman spoke with Sepe, “everything [was] good[.]” At this point, the Days had not yet been notified that the City would not honor the option in its contract. But the Zoo accepted the reduced payment and the City delivered the concession.', 'The trial justice misconceived this evidence and was clearly wrong. He found that “there is no evidence of either an affirmation or denial by City officials of any such commitment in written communications between the City and the Zoo.” However, a writing is not necessary. The circumstantial proof of this commitment is clear, and the trial justice failed to address it. An inference can be drawn from the conduct of the parties and their communications in this case. Furthermore, as La Gondola raised before this Court, under Rule 801 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, the City’s silence in the face of Goodman’s repeated declarations about verbal commitments made by the parties, including his statement that after speaking with Alan Sepe, “everything is good[,]” constitutes an adoptive admission by defendants.', 'This adoptive admission, coupled with the fact that the City undertook part performance of the agreement by utilizing the payment schedule proposed by Goodman in May 2014, is highly relevant—indeed conclusive—evidence of an agreement and a quid pro quo.', 'There was testimony at trial devoted to the unavoidable fact that the Zoo’s bid was nonresponsive. The capital improvement relative to the installation of the Clivus Multrum System waterless toilet system was not included in the Zoo’s bid. Rather than comply with this bid requirement, the Zoo declared that the installation of this system was not necessary for the operation of the concessions, because there were existing restrooms in the building. However, McMahon testified that there were problems with those restrooms because they were serviced by a pump station rather than a gravity-fed system. This was why he included the composting toilet', '- 38 - in the RFP. Allen Days testified that the City was forced to rent portable toilets every year because the restrooms did not function; La Gondola submitted a responsive bid. McMahon, a member of the Zoo’s Board of Trustees, decided to overlook the Zoo’s failure to conform to the bid requirements. Had McMahon rejected the bid as nonresponsive, the City would not have been able to deliver on its half of the quid pro quo.', 'The trial justice and a majority of the members of this Court have overlooked and misconceived the undisputed facts produced at trial and have avoided applying those facts to the law of public bidding contracts as developed by the Court. Indeed, the majority characterized the overwhelming evidence produced by La Gondola as “lint-picking.” The majority concludes that there was “ample testimony on which [the trial justice] could have relied to come to the conclusion that there was no corruption, bad faith, or abuse of discretion in this case.” Yet, the majority fails to point to any such evidence. Rather, the majority, like the trial justice, is myopically focused on the bids that were submitted and wholly overlooks the collusive behavior that began during the original term of La Gondola’s contract, well before the RFP was issued. This conduct so infected the process as to constitute a palpable abuse of discretion as a matter of law. The majority opinion repeatedly recites its obligation to accord deference to the trial justice’s factual findings. However, our responsibility does not end there. It is our duty to determine whether the trial justice has overlooked or misconceived the evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.', 'This Court’s oft expressed, but rarely applied, principle—namely, that a bid procedure which is tainted with bad faith and a palpable abuse of discretion will be set aside—should have meaning. The fact that public officials are vested with discretion in bid procurements does not mean that what occurred before the bids were received is irrelevant or immune from scrutiny,', '- 39 - particularly when the municipality has an undisclosed monetary stake in awarding the bid to a favored bidder.', 'It is my opinion that the conduct of the defendants and the clandestine agreement between the City and the Zoo before the bids were opened, including the fact that McMahon sat on the Zoo’s Board, attended a board meeting in which the RFP was discussed, issued an addendum to accommodate the Zoo, and then accepted the Zoo’s nonresponsive bid in the face of a responsive bid by La Gondola, was so egregious that the bid procedure should be declared invalid.', 'Additionally, it is my opinion that the Zoo intentionally and tortiously interfered with La Gondola’s contractual relations. The trial justice made no findings of fact respecting this claim whatsoever; he simply awarded judgment for the Zoo. This is reversible error. The majority ignores this error and proceeds to make its own findings of fact and concludes that there was no evidence of improper interference on the part of the Zoo. Why would this Court engage in its own fact-finding in the context of a jury-waived trial?', 'A prima facie case of tortious interference with contractual relations is established by a showing of “(1) the existence of a contract; (2) the alleged wrongdoer’s knowledge of the contract; (3) his or her intentional interference; and (4) damages resulting therefrom.” Belliveau Building Corporation v.

These factors were established at trial. There was no dispute that La Gondola and the City of Providence had a contract for the Carousel Village concession. Nor can it be disputed that the Zoo knew about La Gondola’s contract with the City, as evidenced by the emails introduced at trial and the numerous communications between the Zoo and McMahon about getting the La Gondola contract for the Carousel Village. Goodman asked for and received', '- 40 - copies of all of La Gondola’s contracts with the City in order to prepare for the Zoo’s new contract. McMahon obliged. The Zoo’s efforts to wrest this concession from La Gondola continued right up to the point that McMahon found a loophole in La Gondola’s contract in order to deprive La Gondola of the benefit of the five-year renewal option.', 'The evidence that Goodman knowingly and intentionally interfered with La Gondola’s contractual rights in this case and muscled the City and McMahon (who abruptly departed a month later) into abandoning the City’s obligation of good faith and fair dealing is manifest. The trial justice found that “[i]n its discussions and communications with the Park superintendent, the Zoo pressed for the handing over to it of the Carousel Village Concession[.]”', 'The Zoo succeeded. Finally, damages also were proved at trial. I am hard-pressed to envision any stronger proof of tortious interference.', 'In conclusion, Allen and Cynthia Days are hard-working owners of a small business with five children. They assumed a contract to operate the Carousel Village in Roger Williams Park. The contract specifically recited that it was the City’s desire “to obtain management services to operate Carousel Village for the remainder of the original term ending April 30, 2015 plus an additional 5 year term granted by the Board that will end April 30, 2020[.]” The parties agreed that “Annual Rent for May 1, 2015 thru April 30, 2020 will be mutually agreed upon by both parties prior to April 30, 2015.” After a significant investment of capital and labor, the Days were deprived of the benefit of their bargain in a most unfortunate way.

This appeal stems from Judith’s motion seeking an order requiring Maurice to submit to limited genetic testing pursuant to Rule 35 of the Family Court Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure. On appeal, the plaintiff argues that, by ordering him to submit to genetic testing, the hearing justice violated his right to privacy and to due process, and also committed an abuse of discretion by relying on factual findings that, according to plaintiff, overlooked and misconceived material evidence and otherwise were clearly wrong.

He was represented by counsel at the hearing on defendant’s Rule 35 motion and appeared pro se on appeal.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'In this appeal, we are presented with an acrimonious post-divorce battle in the Family Court concerning the welfare of the parties’ children.2 In March 2017, plaintiff’s former wife filed a Rule 353 motion seeking an order from the Family Court compelling plaintiff to submit to genetic testing for the benefit of the parties’ minor children.4 In March 2016, plaintiff was diagnosed with a genetic heart condition known as Brugada Syndrome, a genetic disorder, that poses significant risks including ventricular arrhythmias that can result in sudden death. It is undisputed that Brugada Syndrome is a hereditary disorder.', 'The motion was heard by a Family Court justice on July 14 and 21, 2017. Medical geneticist Mari Mori, M.D. testified about the preferred reasons for genetic testing for Brugada Syndrome. She explained the precautions that someone at risk for Brugada Syndrome must take, which include avoidance of environmental stimuli leading to irregular heartbeat, such as fever, high temperature locales, and certain medication. Additionally, Dr. Mori explained that genetic testing of plaintiff to determine whether his children are at risk for Brugada Syndrome is the 2', 'For nearly a decade, commencing in November 2009, the courts have presided over the parties’ contentious divorce proceedings. 3', 'Rule 35 of the Family Court Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure provides, in pertinent part:', '“(a) Order for Examination.

Alternatively, Dr. Mori also explained that, if genetic testing of plaintiff is not undertaken, then a sodium blocker EKG can be used to diagnose the children; however, there is a high risk that this could produce a false-negative because an EKG change could develop over time.', 'The defendant was the next witness. When questioned why she wanted plaintiff to undergo genetic testing, defendant explained:', '“I am trying to get as much information as possible for the treating', 'physicians of our children so that they can either be ruled out for', 'Brugada Syndrome or get the medical care that would be necessary', 'and appropriate.

She also explained that, since plaintiff was diagnosed with Brugada Syndrome, the children have become increasingly aware of their mortality and have expressed concerns about participating in sports and other activities.', 'The plaintiff also testified and, when asked why he refused to undergo this testing, he offered the following:', '“I have had many instances where things I have revealed to Judy', 'have been used against me so I really don’t want her involved in', 'my medical condition. * * * I don’t want to trouble the kids.

In reaching this determination, the hearing justice balanced plaintiff’s right to privacy against the best interest of the minor children, and found that the risk posed by Brugada Syndrome—namely, sudden death—to be “pretty serious.” The hearing justice relied on a written statement by Kristen Lombardi, M.D., included with her affidavit, that “[g]enetic testing is preferable (in my opinion) for a first-degree relative prior to conducting [a sodium blocker EKG], as genetic testing is much less invasive.”', 'The hearing justice also found that a test that requires the patient to lie still for six hours is invasive. Relying on the opinions of the three medical professionals, including the deposition testimony of plaintiff’s treating physician, Ramin Davoudi, M.D., the hearing justice concluded that it was the opinion of the professionals that “the genetic testing would be less invasive and given the right result could enable these children to have no future testing whatsoever.” Thus, the Family Court justice determined that “it is in the best interest of the children that the test as requested by the [d]efendant be ordered[.]” There were limitations specifically imposed to protect against unauthorized use of the test results.', 'The hearing justice ordered plaintiff to undergo the test “for the isolated purpose of providing a sample sufficient to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of Brugada Syndrome in the', '-4- parties’ minor children.” Moreover, defendant was restrained and enjoined from using the results for any other purpose.

On the witness stand, plaintiff declared: “I also am not an advocate of giving up my genetic material for testing against my wishes. I don’t think that should be done unless I voluntarily want to do it and I do not.” This, however, is not an argument of constitutional dimension, given that it does not address privacy or the Due Process Clause.

Specifically, plaintiff asserts that the hearing justice wrongfully relied on what plaintiff contends was a false affidavit of Dr. Lombardi that was introduced into evidence. The plaintiff further argues that the hearing justice failed to discuss or explain the opinion of plaintiff’s physician, Dr. Davoudi, and, because, according to plaintiff, the hearing justice was “swayed by the [c]ourt’s personal friendship with a neighbor, Dr. Lombardi,” otherwise overlooked or misconceived Dr. Davoudi’s evidence.', 'Turning first to plaintiff’s challenge regarding the weight the hearing justice accorded to Dr. Lombardi’s affidavit, we deem this contention without merit. The record before us clearly establishes that the hearing justice disclosed that Dr. Lombardi was a neighbor and an acquaintance of his family. This fact was spread upon the record in this case. Thus, we are confronted with an unambiguous waiver by a litigant—who is a member of the bar—as well as his trial counsel. At the outset, the hearing justice explicitly addressed Dr. Lombardi’s status with plaintiff and his counsel, stating: “I have said before that Dr. Lombardi is a neighbor and a personal friend of my family. You are aware of that. I know you are trying to seek to introduce her affidavit as well. Does that provide an issue for your client[?]” The plaintiff’s counsel responded: “It was provided to us, Your Honor. We have no objection. * * * We are aware of Dr. Lombardi being your neighbor.” Furthermore, upon being informed that defense counsel filed the medical records and accompanying affidavit of Dr. Lombardi pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-19-27, plaintiff’s counsel was questioned as to whether he objected to the affidavit being used as an exhibit, to which counsel responded: “No.”', '-7-', 'Having failed to raise any objection to the introduction of Dr. Lombardi’s affidavit, plaintiff cannot now challenge its contents or the weight the hearing justice accorded her opinion. Because plaintiff represented in open court that he had no objection to this evidence, he has waived the right to contest it on appeal.', 'Finally, after careful review of the operative order in this case, we are satisfied that the hearing justice made sufficient findings of fact and did not overlook or misconceive any evidence. We are of the opinion that the hearing justice carefully balanced the interests of the father in protecting his privacy with that of the children. His conclusion that genetic testing was in the best interest of the children is supported by the evidence. Further, the order under review is both balanced and reasonable. We see no reason to disturb the findings of the hearing justice.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court.

It is undisputed that Catherine then drew upon the proceeds account by having two checks issued in her name in the amount of $50,000 each. The parties further agree that, in October of 2012, those checks were deposited into two bank accounts at BankNewport, into each of which was deposited $50,000. The first account indicates that its owners are “Catherine I. Ryan or Lizbeth Larkin.” The second account indicates that its owners are “Catherine I. Ryan or Lisa A.

(Catherine’s will had named Lizbeth as executrix.) When Lizbeth filed the universal inventory with the Probate Court, she did not make reference therein to the two BankNewport accounts.3 Michaela and Mark then proceeded to file an objection to the inventory, contending that the two BankNewport accounts should have been included.', 'On July 25, 2013, the probate judge ordered Lizbeth to amend the inventory by including therein the two BankNewport accounts. Lizbeth did not appeal that order to the Superior Court, and she amended the inventory. Several months later, on February 5, 2014, the probate judge issued another order, which provided that the two accounts were part of what he termed as the “general inventory” of the estate. He then determined that the proceeds from those accounts should be distributed under paragraph six of Catherine’s will, pursuant to which they would be distributed “in equal shares” among the four siblings. Lizbeth timely appealed the latter order to the Superior Court.', 'On March 19, 2014, Michaela and Mark filed what was titled a “renewed motion” in the Probate Court seeking to remove Lizbeth as executrix. On June 17, 2014, the probate judge issued an order denying that motion. Michaela and Mark then timely appealed that order to the Superior Court.', 'The two appeals from the Probate Court were consolidated, and a trial was held in the Superior Court on November 30, 2015.

It was Lizbeth’s testimony that, at Washington Trust, Catherine asked that two $50,000 bank checks be made out to her from her account at that bank with the balance to remain in a Washington Trust account in her name.', 'Lizbeth testified that, upon leaving Washington Trust, Catherine stated that the funds left in the Washington Trust account after the withdrawal of the two $50,000 checks “would be her probate.” Lizbeth said that her mother then asked to be taken to an office of BankNewport and to have Lisa meet them there.', 'Lizbeth further testified that Lisa did meet them at BankNewport and that Catherine told a bank representative that she wanted to open one account for Lisa and another account for Lizbeth. Into each of those two accounts Catherine deposited one of the $50,000 Washington Trust checks. It was Lizbeth’s further testimony that Catherine told her that “the probate was set up * * * and whatever was left [was] to be divided by four * * *.”', 'Lisa also testified at trial. She stated that, at the time of the opening of the BankNewport accounts, Catherine told her that she wanted one of the accounts to belong to Lizbeth and one to Lisa.', 'There were several joint exhibits admitted into evidence at trial, including: Catherine’s will; the deposition testimony of Lisa Sellar, a “retail banking administrator” in the employ of BankNewport; the deposition testimony of Paul Ragosta, the attorney who had advised Catherine concerning her will and drafted the will at issue; and a letter from Lizbeth to Michaela relative to Catherine’s estate. Pertinent portions of those exhibits will be discussed hereinafter.', 'Several months later, on August 31, 2016, the trial justice issued a bench decision.

Delfino, 710 A.2d 154 (R.I. 1998), the trial justice quoted the basic rules set forth in that case relative to the survivorship issue in the context of joint accounts including the following important proviso: “[I]f a joint bank account does not provide for survivorship rights, that absence will be conclusive evidence of an intent not to transfer any right of ownership to the survivor, absent evidence of mistake or fraud.” Robinson, 710 A.2d at 161 (emphasis added). 5', 'We describe in fuller detail in Part IV.A.3, infra, the factual findings and the credibility determinations that constitute the basis for the trial justice’s conclusion that the absence of a designation as to the right of survivorship vel non was “the product of a mistake by the bank * * *.”', '-5-', 'Subsequently, on October 18, 2016, the Superior Court justice issued an order in the consolidated appeals. That order provided that the two accounts should be distributed to Lizbeth and Lisa and that there was no basis to remove Lizbeth as executrix; final judgments to that effect were entered for Lizbeth in the two cases on November 9, 2016.6 Michaela and Mark appealed those final judgments to this Court.', 'II', 'Standards of Review', 'It is well established that a probate appeal to the Superior Court “is de novo in nature * * *.” Lett v.

The Alleged Lack of Jurisdiction', 'Michaela and Mark argue at the outset that, because Lizbeth did not appeal the July 25, 2013 Probate Court order directing her to amend the universal inventory so as to include the two BankNewport accounts, “the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction” to consider the question of whether those accounts included a right of survivorship. However, after careful deliberation, we find that argument to be unavailing. We find ourselves to be wholly in agreement with the trial justice’s specific determination that the question of whether the accounts were joint with right of survivorship “was not finally adjudicated until February 5th, 2014” and that, therefore, that issue was properly before the Superior Court in view of the fact that Lizbeth did timely appeal the February 5, 2014 order.7 (Emphasis added.) 7', 'The trenchant analysis by the trial justice relative to this threshold issue deserves to be quoted in extenso:', '“It also appears from the order of February 5th, 2014 that', 'the issue may have only been partially resolved by the Probate', 'Court but that it was a two-part analysis. It was an analysis of', 'whether to put it in the inventory, and then once it was in the', 'inventory how it was to be addressed pursuant to the will. And if', 'there were an appeal to have been taken prior to that, then it would', 'have been a piece-meal process which would have either bounced', 'back to the Probate Court or not bounced back to the Probate', 'Court.', '-8-', 'The first order (issued on July 25, 2013) made no definitive ruling as to the nature of the accounts; it was in actuality no more than a pragmatic and ministerial determination by the probate judge to the effect that it would be best to gather all potential estate assets under one roof until such time as he had occasion to grapple with the challenging legal issue of distribution. The order regarding the BankNewport accounts simply gathered Catherine’s assets together so that an orderly administration could take place—as eventually happened; it was in the nature of “housekeeping” and was not amenable to review by a justice of the Superior Court. It was only the second order (issued on February 5, 2014) that substantively addressed the distribution controversy. The probate judge in the second order stated that the matter was “presented for resolution,” and he ordered that the proceeds of the accounts “be disbursed in keeping with Paragraph Sixth of the will,” with which ruling Lizbeth took issue by appealing to the Superior Court.', 'It is our view that an appeal to the Superior Court at the time of the issuance of the first order was certainly not required. Actually, an appeal at that time would have had absolutely no meaningful effect because the vitally important legal issue concerning the distribution of Catherine’s assets under the will had not yet been decided. In other words, at that point in time', '“So under the circumstances of this case, the Court does', 'find that to the extent that there was a ruling made by the Probate', 'Court in July of 2013 to place the accounts in the inventory, it was', 'not finally adjudicated until February 5th, 2014, where the Court', 'at that time made, again, specific reference in its order to the', 'Robinson vs. DelFino [sic] case and made a determination that it', 'did make.” (Emphasis added.)', '-9- (July 25, 2013), an appeal would have been a vain act8 because it would have failed to present a sufficiently developed issue for the Superior Court to review.', 'For these reasons, we are unpersuaded by the jurisdictional argument presented by Michaela and Mark.', '2. The Hearsay Issue', 'Michaela and Mark have also argued that the trial justice erred in “allow[ing] the introduction of voluminous hearsay testimony.” The testimony with which they take issue and which was objected to at trial is Lizbeth’s recounting of conversations with her mother shortly before the latter’s death. The contested statements by Catherine were purportedly made at the time of the opening of the bank accounts, and we have adequately summarized those statements in the Facts and Travel section of this opinion. The statements attributed to Catherine were objected to on hearsay grounds, but the trial justice overruled those objections without articulating his reason for so ruling.9', 'We need not resolve in this case that particular evidentiary issue because it is our view that, even if the statements purportedly made by Catherine were erroneously admitted into evidence, such an evidentiary error in the context of the bench trial under review would constitute harmless error and would not be a basis for reversal.

Sugarbaker, 891 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir. 2018).', 'Completely apart from the statements purportedly made by Catherine that are challenged as being inadmissible hearsay, there was other, rock solid evidence in the record to support the trial justice’s finding of mistake—namely, the crucial, unrebutted deposition testimony of Lisa Sellar,11 the Retail Banking Administrator from BankNewport who testified as to its being the policy of BankNewport to open joint accounts “only” if they are of the right-of-survivorship variety. What is more, the testimony of Ms. Sellar was buttressed by the deposition testimony of Attorney Paul Ragosta, who testified as to the legal advice that he had provided to Catherine regarding “the distinction between probate assets and nonprobate assets.”', 'For these reasons, we perceive no basis for reversing the trial justice on evidentiary grounds, even conceding arguendo that he erred with respect to the hearsay issue. 11', 'It should be noted that, unlike what might be contended as to the motivation of Lizbeth and Lisa, there is absolutely no basis in the record for concluding that Ms. Sellar was anything more than a completely disinterested and qualified witness—a bank administrator testifying as to her bank’s consistent policy. To employ a graphic but cogent metaphor, Ms. Sellar had no dog in the fight.', '- 11 -', '3. The Trial Justice’s Finding of Mistake', 'Michaela and Mark next argue that the trial justice erred with respect to the issue of “mistake.” (It will be recalled that the trial justice found that the fact that the boxes on the BankNewport joint account cards that indicate whether or not a joint account is with right of survivorship were left blank was “the product of a mistake by the bank,” and that, therefore, the exception for “mistake” that was expressly established by this Court in Robinson v. Delfino, 710 A.2d 154 (R.I. 1998), was applicable. See Robinson, 710 A.2d at 161; see also footnote 4, supra.)', 'It is important to bear in mind that, in Robinson, this Court set forth the following principle that is applicable to the analysis of joint accounts that on their face are not explicit as to right of survivorship: “[I]f a joint bank account does not provide for survivorship rights, that absence will be conclusive evidence of an intent not to transfer any right of ownership to the survivor, absent evidence of mistake or fraud.” Robinson, 710 A.2d at 161 (emphasis added). Even though the evident goal of the Court in Robinson was to create a presumption as to there being no survivorship rights unless the joint account so indicates, the Court in that case expressly allowed for that presumption being rebutted by “evidence of mistake.” Id.', 'Having explicitly noted the exception in Robinson for “mistake,” the trial justice first observed that “clearly, the bank accounts don’t have any of the boxes [as to survivorship vel non] checked.” Given the applicability of the Robinson exception for mistake, the trial justice was free to look to extrinsic evidence in order to determine whether Catherine intended that the two joint accounts at BankNewport be considered to be joint accounts with right of survivorship. He then proceeded to consider the deposition testimony of Lisa Sellar, an employee of BankNewport whose title was Retail Bank Administrator.', 'In that deposition, Ms. Sellar testified that', '- 12 - BankNewport “open[s] joint accounts with rights of survivorship only.” 12 The trial justice also considered the deposition of Paul Ragosta, the attorney who had assisted Catherine in connection with the will at issue. He noted that Attorney Ragosta “testified that [Catherine] was aware of the distinction that paragraph 3 [of her will] would essentially be assets that were not part of the probate estate and that paragraph 6 would be assets that were part of the probate estate.” 13 The trial justice then made the explicit finding that “the two accounts, although on their face do not contain a designation of a right of survivorship, they were accounts that were created with the right of survivorship.”', 'The issue of mistake is factual in nature. See McEntee v. Davis, 861 A.2d 459, 464 (R.I. 2004) (stating that the Court could not “conclude that the trial justice committed reversible error in making a factual determination of unilateral mistake”). Accordingly, we see no basis in the record for overturning the trial justice’s finding of mistake since, as was summarized in the immediately preceding paragraph, there was more than sufficient competent evidence to support that finding. See In re Estate of Ross, 131 A.3d at 166.', '4. The Distribution of the Accounts Under Paragraph Three of the Will', 'Michaela and Mark next argue that the bank accounts should be distributed pursuant to paragraph six of Catherine’s will—not pursuant to paragraph three, as the trial justice ruled. Paragraph three of Catherine’s will states, in pertinent part:', '“In the event that at the time of my death I am joint owner,', 'co-owner or owner of any * * * bank account * * * which is 12', 'Ms. Sellar was cross-examined as to BankNewport’s policy with respect to joint accounts, and her testimony remained the same. 13', 'While there was also testimony by Lizbeth and Lisa concerning statements purportedly made by Catherine about the survivorship issue, we deliberately abstain from factoring those statements into our analysis of the sufficiency of the factual basis for the trial justice’s finding of mistake.

Hayden, 925 A.2d 947, 950 (R.I. 2007); see also Lazarus, 10 A.3d at 462. By the plain and ordinary meaning of the above-quoted paragraph three of the will, the trial justice correctly held that the joint accounts with right of survivorship at issue (i.e., the two previously described BankNewport accounts) should be distributed pursuant to paragraph three to “the surviving joint owner[s]”—viz., Lizbeth and Lisa.', 'Because the accounts at issue were joint accounts with right of survivorship, the trial justice properly determined that they should be distributed to Lizbeth and Lisa through paragraph three of their mother’s will and not through paragraph six, which deals with “the rest, residue and remainder” of Catherine’s estate.14 14', 'The trial justice also stated that the two accounts “are not estate assets” and that they might also fall under the umbrella of accounts distributed under paragraph three by nature of “appear[ing] to be payable to either co-owner or a named beneficiary on my death.” Because this Court has determined that the trial justice properly decided that the accounts should be distributed under paragraph three as joint accounts with right of survivorship, we need not address these statements by the trial justice.

The Trial Justice’s Consideration of Extrinsic Evidence to Interpret the Will', 'Michaela and Mark also argue that what they contend was the trial justice’s consideration of extrinsic evidence to interpret Catherine’s will was “improper and erroneous” because, they allege, the language of the will was unambiguous.', 'It is a well-established “principle that parol or extrinsic evidence cannot be used to vary the unambiguous terms of a will.” Greater Providence Chapter, R.I. Association of Retarded Citizens v. John E. Fogarty Foundation for the Mentally Retarded, 488 A.2d 1228, 1229 (R.I. 1985). However, contrary to the assertions of Michaela and Mark, it is our definite opinion that that principle was not violated in this case. The trial justice specifically stated that he did “not find that there’s any reason to look at parole evidence for review of the third paragraph.” When, in the course of deciding this difficult case, the trial justice did look to extrinsic evidence (e.g., the testimony of Ms. Sellar and of Attorney Ragosta), he did so while addressing the survivorship issue with respect to “the bank accounts”—not while interpreting the will.', 'The parties agree that the will is unambiguous, and it is clear that the trial justice treated it as such. As previously indicated, the trial justice properly considered extrinsic evidence to determine the nature of the bank accounts at issue, and he then ruled that those accounts (which he had held were joint accounts with right of survivorship) were to be distributed, pursuant to the plain and unambiguous language of paragraph three, to Lizbeth and Lisa respectively.', 'B', 'The Removal Controversy', 'Michaela and Mark also contend that the trial justice erred when he affirmed the Probate Court’s denial of their motion seeking to remove Lizbeth as the executrix of their mother’s cardinal principle of judicial restraint” is that “if it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more * * *.”).', '- 15 - estate. They aver that she should have been removed because she has an “obvious, continuing and intractable conflict of interest” and that she has failed to meet her fiduciary duty as executrix, in view of her purported “refusal to marshal, assemble and collect the assets of the Estate” and “claim[ing] them as her own.” They additionally argue that a letter from Lizbeth to Michaela concerning a particular mink coat was part of “overwhelming and incontrovertible evidence” of a level of hostility that rendered her unsuitable as executrix.', 'This Court gives deference to a lower court’s decision on removing executors. See Andrews v. Carr, 2 R.I. 117, 118 (1852) (“This [C]ourt is careful in reversing the decrees of the Court of Probate in removing or appointing administrators, because from its position that court can better judge who is the suitable person for the office.”). We have further expressly held that “the mere fact that one has a claim against an estate is not a disqualification for the office [of executor] * * *.” Murray v. Angell, 16 R.I. 692, 693, 19 A. 246, 246 (1890).', 'The trial justice reviewed the evidence and arguments presented by Michaela and Mark relative to Lizbeth’s alleged unsuitability (viz., her actions regarding the two bank accounts and the letter to Michaela about a certain mink coat). He held that Lizbeth “appears to have been acting in accordance with what she understood her mother’s wishes to be, and, more particular, what she understood to be the impact of” the BankNewport accounts. He additionally stated that the letter about the mink coat did not support “any basis for removing Ms. Larkin.”', 'After a careful review of the record, we perceive no basis for holding that the trial justice erred in determining that the evidence presented was not sufficient to require Lizbeth’s removal as executrix. Therefore, we affirm his decision with respect to the removal controversy.', '- 16 -', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm both judgments of the Superior Court. We remand the record to that tribunal.', 'Justice Goldberg, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur in that part of the majority opinion that holds that the issue regarding the status of the BankNewport accounts was not finally adjudicated until February 5, 2014, and, therefore, the appeal was properly before the Superior Court. I also concur with the majority’s holding that the trial justice did not err in affirming the Probate Court’s denial of the motion to remove Lizbeth Larkin as executrix. However, I part company with the conclusions reached by the majority concerning the two BankNewport accounts. It is my opinion that the trial justice committed reversible error in reaching the conclusion that the accounts were joint accounts with the right of survivorship, and that he strayed far afield from this Court’s venerable opinion in Robinson v. Delfino, 710 A.2d 154 (R.I. 1998). It is also my opinion that any suggestion of mistake in the opening of joint bank accounts that do not contain a right-of-survivorship designation should not serve as an open invitation for the presentation of hearsay testimony in order to perform a postmortem cerebral autopsy, the very type “of foray into the mind of a deceased person” that Robinson was intended to eliminate. McManus v. McManus, 18 A.3d 550, 553-54 (R.I. 2011). Finally, because we have held steadfast to Robinson’s landmark holding that, when confronted with a joint bank account that “does not provide for survivorship rights, that absence will be conclusive evidence of an intent not to transfer any right of ownership to the survivor” in the absence of mistake, the party alleging mistake bears a high burden of proof; a mistake must be established by clear and', '- 17 - convincing evidence. Robinson, 710 A.2d at 161. Consequently, I dissent. This case should be remanded for a new trial.', 'Hearsay', 'It is my opinion that the Superior Court abused its discretion, thereby committing reversible error, in allowing hearsay testimony and then relying on that hearsay to determine Catherine’s intent at the time the BankNewport accounts were opened.', 'Over continuous appropriate hearsay objections from Michaela and Mark’s attorney, the trial justice admitted a significant amount of hearsay testimony from Lizbeth and Lisa regarding Catherine’s intent when opening the BankNewport accounts. The Superior Court justice then anchored his ultimate decision to this inadmissible evidence. This not only violated our rules of evidence, but its unfettered admission into evidence lands us right back in the pre-Robinson era.', 'Specifically, the trial justice relied on hearsay testimony to determine two issues in this case—first, that there was a “mistake” on the part of the bank in not requiring Catherine to designate the type of account, and, then, to find that it was Catherine’s intent to create two joint accounts with the right of survivorship. The Superior Court justice found that “[t]he testimony of Ms. Larkin and Ms. Ryan, that is completely un-rebutted, clearly establishes for the Court that it was Ms. Ryan’s intent on October 16, 2012 to create two accounts for the benefit of her two daughters.”', 'The trial justice’s decision in this case rested upon Lizbeth’s testimony that “[Catherine] told [Lizbeth] that she wanted to open two accounts, that one was for Lisa Ryan and one was for Lizbeth Larkin; and [Catherine] told Ms. Larkin that, quote, ‘I want you and Lisa to have the money.’”', 'The trial justice also found that when Catherine received her “death sentence,” Lizbeth accompanied her to Washington Trust, where she withdrew funds in two checks; she allegedly told “Ms. Larkin that the assets that were remaining at Washington Trust', '- 18 - were her probate[.]” The Superior Court justice also based his decision upon the impermissible hearsay testimony of Lisa when he noted that “Lisa Ryan testified to the same effect, that her mother told her that she wanted her to have the money.”', 'As hearsay, the testimony of Lizbeth and Lisa―who stood to benefit from this evidence―was not competent to support the Superior Court’s decision to reform those accounts. Critically, this evidence was self-serving and inadmissible to show Catherine’s state of mind and intent at the time the joint deposits were opened.', 'Moreover, the majority’s fallback position that “there was other, rock solid evidence in the record to support the trial justice’s finding of mistake” is misplaced. First, the majority fails to point to that evidence. Second, it is not the function of this Court to redact the testimony of Lizbeth and Lisa to patch together a result. Third, such an exercise ignores the fact that the trial justice based his decision on their impermissible hearsay statements and a new trial should be ordered in this case.', 'Joint Accounts with the Right of Survivorship', 'This Court’s 1998 opinion in Robinson was a sweeping decision intended to settle, once and for all, the thorny question of joint accounts with and without the right of survivorship. The Court promulgated a bright-line groundbreaking rule:', '“[T]he opening of a joint bank account wherein survivorship rights', 'are specifically provided for is conclusive evidence of the intention', 'to transfer to the survivor an immediate in praeseti joint beneficial', 'possessory ownership right in the balance of the account remaining', 'after the death of the depositor, absent evidence of fraud, undue', 'influence, duress, or lack of mental capacity. Likewise, if a joint', 'bank account does not provide for survivorship rights, that absence', 'will be conclusive evidence of an intent not to transfer any right of', 'ownership to the survivor, absent evidence of mistake or fraud.”', 'Robinson, 710 A.2d at 161 (emphasis added).', '- 19 - In adopting this approach, all of the Court’s analytical emphasis was placed on the account agreement itself, and not the subjective intent of the deceased joint owner of the account. Essentially, the account agreement is considered an integrated contract, and evidence of the owner’s subjective intent is not permitted. The goal of the Court in deciding Robinson was to avoid a requirement that “lawyers, trial judges, juries, and appellate judges perform post mortem cerebral autopsies * * * to determine and second-guess what the subjective intent of the deceased joint owner of the account was at the time the account was created.” Id. at 160. It should not lightly be set aside. The exceptions recognized by this Court, fraud and mistake, should be construed narrowly, particularly mistake, given its broad potential for abuse in a he said/she said scenario.', 'Significantly, in McManus, this Court recognized the importance of Robinson when we noted that, “[b]y abandoning the formerly unpredictable and inconsistent approach [to right-of- survivorship battles], we sought to avoid situations whereby ‘lawyers, trial judges, juries, and appellate judges perform post mortem cerebral autopsies and examinations in order to determine and second-guess what the subjective intent of the deceased joint owner of the account was at the time the account was created.’” McManus, 18 A.3d at 553 (quoting Robinson, 710 A.2d at 160). We also cautioned against “[a]n inquiry into whether the signature card and [bank disclosure documents] may be interpreted together to create a survivorship right, an inquiry the petitioner urges upon us, would be exactly the type of foray into the mind of a deceased person that our holdings in Robinson and Gaspar[ v. Cordeiro, 843 A.2d 479 (R.I. 2004),] sought to foreclose.” Id. at 553-54. In this case, the sisters engaged in just such an inquiry.', 'First, Lizbeth and Lisa attempted to prove a mistake on the part of the bank when Catherine opened the joint accounts by pointing to the fact that there was no designation of the', '- 20 - type of account the owner intended. Having demonstrated that none of the four choices available to Catherine was selected, they then sought to prove that Catherine intended that the joint accounts created an immediate beneficial ownership in the accounts in Lizbeth and Lisa, with the right of survivorship. It is this second inquiry with which I quarrel. Not only did it rest on rank, inadmissible hearsay evidence that was relied upon by the trial justice, there was a bloody, postmortem cerebral autopsy in an effort to establish the subjective intent of the now-deceased Catherine. This unseemly foray into the mind of the decedent resurrected past estrangements and finger-pointing concerning which sibling(s) received assets from the parent prior to her death; all supplied by the very witnesses who stood to gain the most.', 'To be sure, we are not confronted with a scrivener’s error or other clerical mistake in this case—errors which, I suggest, fall within the limited class of errors that Robinson anticipated. Although it is clear that the accounts were opened without providing for survivorship rights and the multiple choices set forth in the box on the form entitled “Ownership of Account—Consumer Purpose” were left blank, it should be noted that there were four choices in that box: “Individual”; “Joint - with Survivorship”; “Joint - No Survivorship”; and “Trust - Separate Agreement.” There is no evidence that the bank and Catherine engaged in any discussion about survivorship rights. The trial justice filled in the blanks, and, despite the fact that an account without a survivorship designation is conclusive evidence of the owner’s intent not to transfer any right of ownership, absent a mistake, there was no ruling on the burden of proof to overcome this conclusive evidence in order to establish mistake. Nowhere in the majority opinion is this addressed.', 'Nonetheless, in the first case to come before the Court in which a party, alleging mistake, seeks to overcome the conclusive presumption that an account owner did not intend to transfer', '- 21 - ownership rights to the survivor in an account that fails to provide for survivorship rights, a finding of unilateral mistake on the part of the bank (as opposed to a verifiable mutual material mistake by the account owner and the bank) does not resolve the dispute because it leads us back to the pre-Robinson days.', 'Robinson v. Delfino', 'Lastly, I disagree with the majority’s conclusion that there was more-than-sufficient competent evidence to support the trial justice’s finding that “the fact that the boxes on the BankNewport joint account cards that indicate whether or not a joint account is with right of survivorship were left blank was ‘the product of a mistake by the bank,’ and that, therefore, the exception for ‘mistake’ that was expressly established by this Court in Robinson * * * was applicable.” The majority acknowledges that “the evident goal of the Court in Robinson was to create a presumption as to there being no survivorship rights unless the joint account so indicates”; the majority goes on to hold that, once the trial justice noted the bank’s unilateral mistake—the only mistake before him—the trial justice was then “free to look to extrinsic evidence in order to determine whether Catherine intended that the two joint accounts at BankNewport be considered to be joint accounts with right of survivorship.” (Emphasis in original.) This amounts to the reformation of a bank account based on a unilateral mistake with no requirement of proof by clear and convincing evidence. In my opinion, this is a marked departure from Robinson, McManus, and Gaspar, and reopens the cerebral autopsy suite for estate fights. Although the trial justice may have been free to look to (admissible) extrinsic evidence in order to determine whether a mistake was made, an open foray into the ailing Catherine’s intent was erroneous, and nothing in Robinson supports this conclusion. This was not an inquiry into whether there was a mistake by the bank, it was “the introduction of all', '- 22 - manner of extrinsic evidence [in order] to analyze the depositor’s subjective intent,” which Robinson expressly disallowed. See Robinson, 710 A.2d at 160.', 'Furthermore, the only evidence of mistake in this case is that the bank failed to adhere to a policy of checking off an appropriate box on the signature card. As noted, there was no testimony that Catherine asked the bank about the right of survivorship in the accounts, before this gigantic leap back to the pre-Robinson frontier. I simply am not convinced that the bank’s failure to follow a purported policy of checking boxes on the signature cards opens the door to extrinsic evidence of the account owner’s subjective intent in order to overcome the conclusive presumption set forth in Robinson. If the door does open, it should require proof by clear and convincing evidence.', 'See McEntee v. Davis, 861 A.2d 459, 465 (R.I. 2004); Hopkins v. Equitable Life Assurance Society of United States, 107 R.I. 679, 685, 270 A.2d 915, 918 (1970).', 'The judgment in this case should be vacated and the case remanded for a new trial.

Adless Desamours (applicant) appeals from the denial of his application for postconviction relief in Providence County Superior Court.1 This case came before the Supreme Court on March 28, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On September 15, 1999, at approximately 5 p.m., applicant was arrested by Providence police officers in Roger Williams Park in Providence, Rhode Island. The applicant was charged by way of criminal information with one count of possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 21-28-4.01(C)(1)(a), and one count of obstructing a police officer, in 1', 'In 2015, G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-9 was amended to require that an aggrieved party file a petition for writ of certiorari to review the denial of an application for postconviction relief. See P.L. 2015, ch. 91, § 1; P.L. 2015, ch. 92, § 1.

The facts leading up to applicant’s arrest and subsequent plea of nolo contendere are in dispute.', 'According to the criminal information and the accompanying documents, on September 15, 1999, Officer Shawn Kennedy (Officer Kennedy) of the Providence Police Department was on patrol in Roger Williams Park and observed applicant, who was seated at a picnic table, drinking a bottle of malt liquor. As Officer Kennedy approached applicant to inform him that he was not allowed to drink alcohol in the park, he observed “in plain view” a $20 bill on the picnic table next to applicant. The $20 bill had a “white powder substance” on it, which appeared to be cocaine. When asked his name, applicant falsely identified himself as “Dale Montellio” and stated that his date of birth was April 12, 1974. The applicant was taken into custody “without incident for public drinking and possession of suspected cocaine[.]” Officer Kennedy also seized the bottle of malt liquor and the $20 bill, which later tested positive for cocaine. Once at the police station, it was discovered that applicant’s real name was Adless Desamours and that his date of birth was January 20, 1978.', 'On November 30, 1999, applicant entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charge for possession of cocaine and was sentenced to two years’ probation. The count for obstruction was dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The plea colloquy at the November 30, 1999 hearing, which is at issue in this appeal, went as follows:', '“THE COURT:', '* * * As to Count One, possession of', 'cocaine, do you understand what you’re', 'doing by pleading nolo to this charge?

I’m also satisfied', 'with the factual basis; therefore, the plea', 'may enter.”', 'On January 10, 2012, more than twelve years after his plea, applicant filed an application for postconviction relief. The applicant claimed that his plea of nolo contendere was entered in violation of Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure because the Superior Court justice did not properly ascertain whether applicant understood the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea, and because the Superior Court justice did not sufficiently satisfy himself that there was a factual basis for the plea. The applicant, a native and citizen of Haiti, additionally claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel because he “was not advised by anyone” of the immigration consequences of his plea.', 'In support of his application, applicant filed his own affidavit, in which he recited a different factual predicate than that which was set forth in the police report. According to applicant, on September 15, 1999, he was at Roger Williams Park with an acquaintance. The applicant was holding a can of beer as he and his acquaintance were approached by the Roger Williams Park Police. After a brief conversation, the officers permitted applicant’s companion', '-3- to leave the area; however, because applicant was holding the can of beer, he was detained.2 During this time, one of the officers spotted a rolled-up bill on the ground, which proved to contain a small amount of cocaine. The applicant was later charged with possession of cocaine. Despite pleading nolo contendere, applicant’s affidavit declared: “I maintained my innocence with respect to the cocaine, as it belonged to my companion, not myself. Because I was told that I could receive a jail sentence if convicted at trial, and the [s]tate was offering probation, I decided to plea nolo to the charge.”', 'The state opposed the application for postconviction relief and argued that applicant failed to sustain his burden of demonstrating that the Superior Court justice failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 11 or that his legal counsel provided ineffective assistance. The state’s objection also emphasized that the plea document signed by applicant advised him that his plea “may result in deportation proceedings[.]” Finally, the state raised the defense of laches, arguing that applicant did not file his application for postconviction relief within a reasonable time after his plea.', 'On March 7, 2012, the postconviction-relief application was heard before a different Superior Court justice (the postconviction hearing justice).3 Christine O’Connell (O’Connell), an assistant public defender and applicant’s legal counsel at the time of his plea, testified and explained that, because she has represented thousands of clients during her twenty-five-year career with the Public Defender’s office, she had no independent recollection of applicant or the plea in question. Nevertheless, O’Connell testified that she would never have instructed a client 2', 'Although the criminal information states that applicant was drinking a bottle of malt liquor, in his affidavit applicant avers that he was drinking a can of beer; this factual dispute has no bearing on this Court’s analysis but points to the difficulties that a trial could present. 3', 'The applicant was not present at the hearing.', '-4- to sign a plea form without discussing its contents with the client, and that she would not have affixed her signature to the plea form if she had not done so. In addition, O’Connell testified that the only time she would have advised a client who maintained his innocence with respect to a particular charge to enter a plea was in the context of an Alford plea.4', 'Following O’Connell’s testimony, the court heard oral argument. Counsel for applicant argued that the Superior Court justice failed to “enunciate” the rights applicant was waiving in pleading nolo contendere, as the plea colloquy is devoid of any evidence that those rights were discussed with and understood by applicant.5 Counsel also argued that the affirmative defense of laches did not apply. The state responded that the plea colloquy was sufficient because there was evidence in the record to support a finding that applicant’s plea was voluntary at the time it was entered and that he was aware of the nature of the charges at that time. The state concluded by arguing that the defense of laches applied because the state would be prejudiced due to the fact that its “best evidence,” the seized cocaine, had been destroyed.', 'On April 3, 2012, the postconviction hearing justice rendered a bench decision denying the application. In doing so, the postconviction hearing justice described the plea colloquy as “bare-boned,” but nevertheless concluded that the court reasonably could have found that 4', '“The so-called Alford plea is a procedure approved by the Supreme Court of the United States under which a person charged with a criminal offense may plead guilty even though he maintains his innocence as long as the state presents a factual basis for such plea through evidence other than the defendant’s own admission.” State v. Fontaine, 559 A.2d 622, 624 (R.I. 1989); see North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970). 5', 'In addition, applicant argued that there was a violation of Padilla v.

United States, 568 U.S. 342, 344 (2013). Therefore, Padilla does not apply in this case, because final judgment entered on January 4, 2000, and there was no appeal taken from that judgment.', '-5- applicant was aware of the nature of his plea and that applicant fully understood his rights and knowingly relinquished those rights. The postconviction hearing justice further concluded that there was a factual basis for the offense of possession of cocaine and that applicant agreed with the recitation of facts at the plea hearing that he had possessed the cocaine in question. The postconviction hearing justice denied applicant’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and declined to address the issue of laches. The applicant appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'Postconviction relief is a remedy provided by statute—G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1—and is “available to a convicted defendant who contends that his [or her] original conviction or sentence violated rights afforded to him [or her] under the state or federal constitution.” Hazard v.

When passing on a decision to grant or deny postconviction relief, “this Court will refrain from disturbing a trial justice’s factual findings absent a showing that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” Hazard, 968 A.2d at 891 (quoting Azvedo v.

Nevertheless, “even when the de novo standard is applied to issues of constitutional dimension, we still accord a hearing justice’s findings of historical fact, and', '-6- inferences drawn from those facts, great deference in conducting our review.” Rice, 38 A.3d at 16 (brackets omitted).', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, applicant argues that the trial justice deviated from the mandate set forth in Rule 11 by (1) failing to ensure that applicant entered his plea of nolo contendere knowingly and voluntarily, and (2) failing to establish a factual basis for his plea. This argument lacks merit.', 'Before accepting a plea in a criminal case, a trial justice is obliged to conduct a thorough review of the plea agreement with the defendant, as set forth in Rule 11, which provides, in pertinent part:', '“The court * * * shall not accept [a plea of guilty] or a plea of nolo', 'contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and', 'determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of', 'the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea. * * *', 'The court shall not enter a judgment upon a plea of guilty or nolo', 'contendere unless it is satisfied that there is a factual basis for the', 'plea.”', 'Therefore, under Rule 11, there are two prerequisites that must be satisfied at the plea colloquy before a plea of nolo contendere can be accepted: (1) a determination “that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea”; and (2) a finding “that there is a factual basis for the plea.”', 'As for the first prerequisite, a hearing justice “should engage in as extensive an interchange as necessary so that the record as a whole and the circumstances in their totality will disclose to a court reviewing a guilty or nolo plea that the defendant understood the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.” State v. Frazar, 822 A.2d 931, 935 (R.I. 2003) (quoting State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1267 (R.I. 1980)). The applicant argues that the Superior Court justice did not properly ensure that applicant’s plea was knowing and voluntary because he did not enunciate the rights applicant was waiving in making his plea. We disagree. Although', '-7- the plea colloquy between applicant and the Superior Court justice can indeed be characterized as “bare-boned,” there was no Rule 11 violation. The transcript of the plea hearing reveals that the Superior Court justice advised applicant of the rights he was waiving by entering a plea of nolo contendere, and that applicant confirmed his relinquishment of those rights. In addition, the Superior Court justice asked applicant if he signed the plea form voluntarily and if he understood the contents contained in the plea form, which included the following language:', '“I UNDERSTAND THAT IF I AM A RESIDENT ALIEN, A', 'SENTENCE IMPOSED AS A RESULT OF MY PLEA MAY', 'RESULT IN DEPORTATION PROCEEDINGS OVER', 'WHICH THIS COURT HAS NO CONTROL.” The applicant answered both questions in the affirmative. Moreover, applicant was represented by an experienced and well-respected criminal defense attorney, who testified that she routinely reviews plea forms with her clients and would have done so in this case. We have every confidence that O’Connell discussed the contents of the plea form with applicant; there is no reason to doubt her.', 'As for the second prerequisite, the factual basis of the plea, applicant contends that the recitation of the facts was inadequate because the state did not indicate that applicant had the knowledge and intent to possess the cocaine. However, contrary to applicant’s assertion, the state recited facts that, although conclusory, supported the charge against applicant, and applicant acknowledged that those facts were true. Possession of cocaine in violation of § 21-28- 4.01(c)(1)6 constitutes a general-intent crime in which “[i]t shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to possess a controlled substance * * *.” See Sharbuno v. Moran, 429 A.2d 1294, 1296 (R.I. 1981) (“[T]he Legislature recognized the need for including a general- intent element in the definition of the offense [of possession of a controlled substance]. This is 6', 'The statute that applicant was charged under in 1999, G.L. 1956 § 21-28-4.01(C)(1)(a), is now found at § 21-28-4.01(c)(1).', '-8- evident in the use of the ‘knowingly or intentionally’ language in § 21-28-4.01(C).”). “General- intent crimes require only the ‘intention to make the bodily movement which constitutes the act which the crime requires[.]’” State v. Sivo, 925 A.2d 901, 914 (R.I. 2007) (quoting 1 LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law § 5.2(e) at 355 (2d ed. 2003)). The applicant unequivocally agreed with the state’s recitation of facts it would prove if the matter proceeded to trial. Specifically, applicant agreed that he “did possess cocaine in violation of Rhode Island General Laws” on September 15, 1999.', 'Our careful review of the transcript of the plea hearing convinces us that the requirements of Rule 11 were satisfied in this case. It is our opinion that the trial justice’s colloquy with applicant established that the plea was voluntary and that it was made with knowledge and understanding of the charge against him. See Rodrigues v. State, 985 A.2d 311, 314 (R.I. 2009). Accordingly, we affirm the postconviction hearing justice’s finding that the Superior Court justice fully satisfied Rule 11’s requirement of determining that applicant understood the nature of the charge and that applicant made a voluntary and intelligent plea.', 'Finally, although the postconviction hearing justice did not address the state’s affirmative defense of laches, applicant argues on appeal that laches is not applicable in this case. We disagree. “[L]aches is an equitable defense that precludes a lawsuit by a plaintiff who has negligently sat on his or her rights to the detriment of a defendant.” School Committee of Cranston v. Bergin-Andrews, 984 A.2d 629, 644 (R.I. 2009) (quoting O’Reilly v. Town of Glocester, 621 A.2d 697, 703 (R.I. 1993)). To establish a laches defense, the state has the burden of proving “by a preponderance of the evidence that the applicant [was] unreasonably delayed in seeking relief and that the state is prejudiced by the delay.” Raso v. Wall, 884 A.2d 391, 395 (R.I. 2005).', '-9-', 'Twelve years passed from the time applicant entered his plea in November 1999 to the filing of his petition for postconviction relief in January 2012. Although it is well settled that “time lapse alone does not constitute laches[,]” Rodriques v. Santos, 466 A.2d 306, 311 (R.I. 1983), applicant has not offered a credible explanation for the twelve-year delay. He knew from the moment that he signed the plea form that his plea could result in deportation consequences.', 'There is sufficient evidence in the record to support a finding by the postconviction hearing justice by a preponderance of the evidence that the state was prejudiced by the delay. The delay here is particularly worrisome because applicant’s affidavit raises new factual disputes. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that applicant’s petition for postconviction relief could also have been denied based on the doctrine of laches.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The parties were directed to appear and show cause why this case should not be summarily decided. After reviewing the memoranda of the parties and the arguments by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. We proceed to decide this case without further briefing and argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts and travel of this case, taken from the pleadings and memoranda of the parties, are not in dispute. In February 2015, the union and the school committee began negotiations for', '-1- a successor agreement to the collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) that was due to expire on August 31, 2015. Mediation subsequently ensued, and a tentative agreement for a six-month contract, from September 1, 2015, to February 28, 2016, was reached on August 11, 2015. The tentative agreement provided that the terms of the existing contract would remain in place for an additional six months, “unless a successor agreement is earlier agreed to by the parties and ratified by the Middletown Council.” (Emphasis added.)', 'The parties also agreed that the tentative agreement would “not be binding on the parties unless and until it is ratified by the Middletown Town Council.” (Emphasis added.) On September 21, 2015, the town council declined to ratify the tentative agreement. The union filed suit.', 'On November 2, 2015, the union filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. An amended complaint was subsequently filed on November 13, 2015. The genesis of this case relates to a November 2012 amendment to the Middletown Town Charter (the amendment) that provides that all collective-bargaining agreements affecting any department of town government, including the school department, “shall have no force or effect until and unless they are first ratified by a majority vote of the town council.”', 'The union sought a declaration that, under the so-called “Michaelson Act,” the 2012 amendment “does not give the Town any authority to approve or reject a six-month contract reached between the Union and the School Committee[.]”1 The union also alleged that the rejection of the six-month agreement by the town council was arbitrary and capricious. 1', 'The Michaelson Act, chapter 9.3 of title 28 of the General Laws, which is entitled “Certified School Teachers’ Arbitration,” provides that unions representing teachers are statutorily entitled to bargain collectively with school committees, which in turn are required to negotiate with the unions. North Providence School Committee v. North Providence Federation of Teachers, Local 920, American Federation of Teachers, 945 A.2d 339, 346 (R.I. 2008).', '-2-', 'The union also requested a declaration that the amendment does not vest the town council with any authority, express or implied, over the contracts reached between the union and the school committee, and further that, if the amendment applied to the school committee, then “[a]ll of the obligations previously held by the School Committee must be assigned to the Town Council[,]” effectively nullifying the Michaelson Act.', 'The union also sought a somewhat doomsday-like judicial declaration that, if “the Michaelson Act [does] not apply to either the Union or to the Town[,]” then “there are no applicable statutory dispute resolution procedures to resolve contract disputes between the Town and the Union[,]” including the prohibition against teacher strikes.', 'Additionally, the union sought a declaration that, when the General Assembly ratified the amendment in 2012, “the General Assembly did not expand the scope of the Town Council’s authority as it relates to certified teachers as purported by the Town Council.” The union also sought injunctive relief “in conjunction with the declaratory judgment.”', 'The defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that this Court “has twice upheld and enforced a nearly identical ratification requirement that existed as a local ordinance in the City of Providence, even without legislative ratification”; and, citing to Providence Teachers Union v. Providence School Board, 689 A.2d 384, 386 (R.I. 1996), and Providence City Council v. Cianci, 650 A.2d 499, 501 (R.I. 1994), defendants argued that “this well-settled precedent, and the clear and unambiguous language of the Town’s legislatively ratified Charter,” are dispositive of the issues in this case.', 'While defendants’ motion for summary judgment was pending, the parties agreed to a new three-year CBA, effective from September 1, 2015, to August 31, 2018. On April 18, 2016, the town council voted to ratify the agreement. Thus, the issue of mootness came to the forefront', '-3- of this case. Although defendants maintained that they were entitled to summary judgment on the merits, in a supplemental memorandum in support of summary judgment, defendants also argued that the newly reached 2015-2018 three-year CBA rendered this dispute moot.', 'The union argued that the case was “not moot because it is capable of repetition yet evading review, which is a very well known exception to the doctrine of mootness.”', 'According to the union, the issue was important because “when the School Committee comes to the table, and when they know that what they are doing must be ratified by the Town Council, then it alters the sc[o]pe of the very negotiations[,]” because if the union knows “that ultimately we have to bring the deal back to the Town Council, it alters everything; and if we know that we don’t have to, it alters everything.” When asked if the requests for declaratory relief before the court pertained to the six-month CBA or the three-year CBA, the union responded that both contracts were before the court. The union argued that, although some of the declaratory relief it was seeking related only to the rejected six-month tentative agreement, “the overall legal question which is, does the School Committee have the authority to enter into its own contracts[,]” related to either a CBA “or any other contract.”', 'After reviewing the undisputed facts of the case, the trial justice quoted Boyer v. Bedrosian, 57 A.3d 259 (R.I. 2012), for the proposition that a case becomes moot “if there is no continuing stake in the controversy, or if the court’s judgment would fail to have any practical effect on the controversy.” Boyer, 57 A.3d at 272. The trial justice concluded that, although at the time the amended complaint was filed the town council had rejected the six-month agreement that was reached by the parties, a new three-year CBA had been negotiated and ratified by the town council since then. Thus, he concluded that, “while a justiciable controversy existed at the time the complaint was filed, the ratification of the new [CBA] appears to have deprived the', '-4- Union of any continuing stake in this controversy.” In granting summary judgment in favor of defendants, the trial justice declined to reach the merits of defendants’ legal arguments.', 'The trial justice also rejected the narrow exception to the mootness doctrine that is available when the issue is one of extreme public importance yet is capable of evading review. The trial justice did not address whether the issues raised in the union’s complaint are of extreme public importance. He concluded, however, that, while repetition of the same issue was possible, the union had not adequately demonstrated “why the issue is one that would evade review[.]” The trial justice stated that, in the event the issue arose again, the union could file another declaratory-judgment action.', 'Accordingly, he granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment, based on mootness.', 'The union filed a timely notice of appeal on September 2, 2016. While this appeal was pending in this Court, the parties negotiated another CBA. Significantly, there was no effort by the parties to expedite this case in this Court. At oral argument, it was disclosed that, since the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendants, the parties have entered into yet another three-year CBA, effective September 2018 through August 2021. The town council ratified the contract in the same manner as the 2015-2018 CBA.', 'Before this Court, the union assigns error to the decision of the trial justice declaring that this controversy is moot. The union argues that the issue before the court was not made moot because the parties entered into a new three-year CBA. The union posits that because “[n]either the Union, nor the Town, have conceded their positions on the application of the Charter provision * * * the dispute remains live.” It is the union’s contention that “the dispute is centered on the interpretation of an existing Charter provision.”', 'According to the union, declaratory relief “would have a practical effect on an existing controversy in that a judgment in', '-5- favor of the Union would mean that any agreements negotiated between the School Committee and the Union do not need to be ratified by the Town.”', 'The union also argues that, even if this Court were to deem the controversy moot, “the dispute will certainly continue so long as the parties’ collective bargaining relationship exists[,]” and therefore is both capable of repetition and, the union submits, of great public interest, and should be addressed under the exception to the mootness doctrine.', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court employs a de novo standard of review when confronted with a grant of summary judgment. Sacco v. Cranston School Department, 53 A.3d 147, 149-50 (R.I. 2012). If our view of the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party reveals that there are “‘no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,’ we will affirm [the summary] judgment.” Moore v.

All three criteria must be met in order for this narrow exception to be available to the union.', '“Issues of extreme public importance usually implicate important constitutional rights, matters concerning a person’s livelihood, or matters concerning citizen voting rights.” Boyer, 57 A.3d at 281 (quoting Campbell v.

IX, § 913 (amended Nov. 5, 2002; amended Nov. 6,', '2012).', 'It is apparent that, since this case was filed, the parties have successfully negotiated two collective-bargaining agreements. The issue that brought the union to the Superior Court—the town council’s 2015 rejection of the six-month contract extension—has not arisen again. The first agreement, which was effective until August 31, 2018, was negotiated and approved by the town council and was in place before the trial justice was called upon to consider defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Therefore, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in granting summary judgment on the basis of mootness; there simply was no justiciable controversy before him. Our opinion is further buttressed by the fact that yet another CBA was reached by the parties and approved by the town council. We are hard-pressed to conclude that the union, having reached two successor agreements since this case was filed, has a continuing stake in the outcome of this controversy. “This Court will not review a case in which the parties no longer have an articulable stake in the outcome.” H.V.

The union offered no argument relative to the extreme public importance of this issue.', 'Turning to the question of whether this case is capable of repetition yet will evade review, we note at the outset that this issue has arisen during the successful ratification of the two CBAs that were entered into by the parties. The current CBA does not expire until 2021. The union asserts that “while the dispute here arose in the context of collective bargaining[,] it has nothing to do with any provision of the CBA that has since expired or been replaced[,]” but instead “the dispute is centered on the interpretation of an existing Charter provision.” According to the union, the doctrine of mootness simply does not apply when a newly negotiated “CBA does not resolve the dispute[.]” We respectfully suggest that this is not the law. The union voluntarily entered into contract negotiations and reached another CBA that was approved by the town council. The union did not request that the case be expedited before it undertook negotiations for the latest CBA that runs until 2021.', 'This interregnum simply is not so inherently short that this case would perpetually evade review should the issue reoccur.

The DEM reasoned that the consent agreement constituted an administrative penalty that disqualified the fisherman from participating in the pilot program, and a Superior Court justice agreed.

Due to the nature of the parties’ dealings, and in light of state law governing labor relations with teachers, the union and the school committee have the obligation to negotiate a new CBA at least every three years, if not more often, and, each time the parties negotiate, the town could attempt to reject the terms of a new CBA. See G.L. 1956 § 28-9.3-4 (setting forth the obligation of the school committee and union representative to bargain and explaining that the “obligation includes the duty to cause any agreement resulting from negotiations or bargaining to be reduced to a written contract; provided, that no contract shall exceed the term of three (3) years”). As opposed to AAD, where this Court theorized that DEM may create another program in the future that could similarly affect other fishermen (and therefore the issue of DEM’s denial of applications based on prior violations was capable of evading review), here, the occurrence of the negotiations every three years, at the longest, is guaranteed. See AAD, 60 A.3d at 925.', 'The town suggests that our decision in Local 1033 established that a three-year period is not short enough to be considered capable of evading review. After revisiting our opinion in Local 1033, and the decisions cited therein, I conclude that the facts of those cases are distinguishable from those in this matter, and I stress that the three-year timeframe is not the critical factor here.', 'In Local 1033, the union had filed suit against the city after the city laid off all its crossing guards, arguing that the layoffs violated the CBA. Local 1033, 960 A.2d at 530. An arbitrator determined that the city violated the CBA, but the Superior Court vacated that decision and determined that the no-restructuring clause in the CBA was void. Id. at 530, 534. On appeal,', '- 13 - we explained that “we are presented with a question concerning a long-since-expired term in the parties’ collective-bargaining agreement.” Id. at 535. Accordingly, we held that an opinion from this Court would not affect the parties “because the no-restructuring clause terminated by its own conditions” prior to this Court deciding the case. Id.', 'Similarly, in Sullivan v. Chafee, 703 A.2d 748 (R.I. 1997), members of the city council sought a declaratory judgment to determine the operative municipal budget and tax rate for the 1997 fiscal year. Sullivan, 703 A.2d at 749. But, by the time the matter reached this Court, we held that “the issue of which budget and which tax rate should be deemed operative for the 1997 fiscal year is now a moot question because the 1997 fiscal year has concluded and plaintiffs are no longer seeking a ruling that would invalidate that particular budget and tax rate.” Id. at 753.', 'Finally, in Town of Scituate v. Scituate Teachers’ Association, 110 R.I. 679, 296 A.2d 466 (1972), the town sought a declaratory judgment as to whether it was bound to a CBA between the teachers’ association and the school committee and was thereby required to pay the teachers a salary that had been negotiated. Town of Scituate, 110 R.I. at 680, 296 A.2d at 467. After the trial justice heard the case, but before the matter reached this Court, the CBA expired, and the town had appropriated the necessary funds to pay the teachers the agreed-upon salary. Id. at 683, 296 A.2d at 468-69. We held that the matter was moot because the CBA had long since expired by the time this Court heard the case in which the school committee sought a judicial declaration regarding whether a term in the CBA was binding despite town budget constraints. Id. at 684, 296 A.2d at 469.', 'Contrary to those cases, here, the union did not file for a declaratory judgment seeking a determination regarding a specific term of a CBA or regarding a charter provision applicable only to a discrete CBA. Instead, the union seeks a judicial declaration concerning the effect of', '- 14 - the charter provision—a question that will affect all future CBAs that the union and the school committee negotiate. Again, the three-year timeframe is not the determinative factor here. While we did state in Local 1033 that “[t]he three-year term of a collective-bargaining agreement, however, is not of such an ‘inherently brief duration’ that it would ‘almost invariably be too short to enable full litigation on the merits[,]’” I emphasize that my conclusion here does not rely on the time period of the parties’ CBAs. See Local 1033, 960 A.2d at 536 (quoting Driver v. Town of Richmond ex rel. Krugman, 570 F. Supp. 2d 269, 274 (D.R.I. 2008)). Instead, I believe that the crux of the matter is the fact that the parties will constantly renegotiate successor CBAs, and the fact that the town could assert a veto authority pursuant to the charter in each instance.', 'In reaching this conclusion, I considered several scenarios to determine if this issue is capable of evading review.', 'In the first scenario, I imagined that the union could file for declaratory judgment at the start of the next negotiation, to obtain resolution of the question of the town’s authority under the charter. However, that scenario would require that the union wait for the judicial process to interpret the town’s authority; and, in the meantime, the union would be forced to halt all negotiations and refuse any further offers or attempts to reach an agreement. As discussed above, such an approach would collide with the union’s duty to negotiate on behalf of its members; this scenario would thwart that duty. Moreover, as the facts of this case exhibit, when the parties cannot initially reach an agreement, they typically pursue mediation and continue negotiating until an agreement is reached. Thus, to suggest that the union refile a claim for declaratory judgment the next time the parties return to negotiate would equate to this Court forcing the union to decide between either obtaining an answer as to the town’s authority under the charter or fulfilling its mandated duty to negotiate.', '- 15 -', 'Similarly, to suggest that the union should seek declaratory judgment if and when the town rejects a proposed CBA in the future would also effectively force the union to forgo its duty to negotiate on behalf of its members. While I acknowledge that it very well could be the case that the town continues to approve CBAs negotiated and ratified by the union and the school committee, the question of the town’s authority has a continuing effect on the negotiations because the town’s interest as a nonpresent third party with veto power will inevitably be a consideration in the negotiation process between the union and the school committee.', 'In either scenario, the union would be required to wait a length of time that could amount to years for a case to be litigated to its completion in order to preserve its declaratory-judgment claim. The union, in the meantime, would be forced to decline to further negotiate. Thus, without forcing the union to decide between seeking a judicial declaration as to the town’s authority under the charter and fulfilling its duty to negotiate on behalf of its members, I cannot fathom a situation in which the union could obtain declaratory judgment to resolve the question of whether the town has the authority to accept or reject a CBA negotiated by the union and the school committee. This Court’s determination that the union’s claim is moot and that the exception does not apply creates a “catch-22” scenario for the union and will, as a matter of practicality, deprive the union of its ability to seek a declaratory judgment.1', 'Therefore, because the charter is effective indefinitely and will come into play each and every time the parties return to the negotiating table, and because the union could receive an answer only in the event it neglects its obligation to negotiate with the school committee in the future, thus affecting the livelihood of the union members, the controversy is capable of 1', '“The term ‘catch-22’ derives from a Joseph Heller novel by the same name. Although somewhat difficult to define precisely, it generally refers to a paradoxical rule which creates an illogical or senseless situation in which one is faced with two equally undesirable alternatives.” City of Pawtucket v. Pimental, 960 A.2d 981, 988 n.6 (R.I. 2008).', '- 16 - repetition yet evading review, and the mootness exception should apply.

17,Karl Olsen : v. : Anna L. DeMayo. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The plaintiff, Karl Olsen, appeals from a February 6, 2018 judgment in favor of the defendant, Anna L. DeMayo, in Newport County Superior Court. The Superior Court justice granted Mrs. DeMayo’s motion for summary judgment on the ground that Mr. Olsen was not legally entitled to recover rent monies which he had paid to her over the extended period of time during which he was renting a waterfront condominium from her—even though Mrs. DeMayo had not complied with a statute that requires a landlord who is not a resident of this state to designate an in-state agent for service of process. On appeal, Mr. Olsen raises the following issues: (1) whether he had a right “to recover damages in the amount of the abated rent paid to [Mrs.] DeMayo while she was in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-22.3;” (2) whether he had a right to recover those asserted damages “under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-1-2;” and (3) whether he had a right to recover those asserted damages under the equitable theory of unjust enrichment.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '1', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case arises out of a landlord-tenant relationship that lasted for nearly ten years without incident. From November of 2005 until some time in 2015, Mr. Olsen rented a waterfront condominium in Newport from Mrs. DeMayo. (The parties do not agree on when exactly the tenancy was terminated, but that detail is immaterial.) After the termination of the tenancy, a dispute arose between the parties regarding the return of the security deposit. For the entire period of the tenancy, Mrs. DeMayo was a resident of the State of Connecticut.', 'On July 7, 2017, nearly two years after the termination of the tenancy, Mr. Olsen filed a complaint in the Second Division District Court, alleging that, for the entire period of his tenancy, Mrs. DeMayo had been in violation of G.L. 1956 § 34-18-22.3, which statute requires landlords who reside outside of Rhode Island to “designate and continuously maintain an agent upon whom service may be made * * *.”1 Mr. Olsen argued in District Court that Mrs. DeMayo never properly filed such a designation with the Secretary of State and the City of Newport as required by the just-cited statute and that, for that reason, he was entitled to recover from her the entire amount of rent which he had paid over the years during which he had rented the condominium, as well as prejudgment interest. He argued that he was entitled to recover the rent monies on the basis of the following language in § 34-18-22.3: “If a landlord fails to comply with the requirements of this section, rent for the dwelling unit abates until designation of an agent is made * * *.” Mr. Olsen also argued in District Court that he should be allowed to recover the rent monies on the basis of 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-18-22.3 has subsequently been amended by the General Assembly in a manner that has no bearing on the instant case. See § 34-18-22.3, as amended by P.L. 2018, ch. 265, § 1; P.L. 2018, ch. 213, § 1.', '2 § 9-1-2, which provides for “civil liability for crimes and offenses.” Finally, Mr. Olsen argued that Mrs. DeMayo was liable to him pursuant to the equitable theory of unjust enrichment.', 'Mrs. DeMayo contended in response that § 34-18-22.3 does not allow for the retroactive recovery of rent already paid by a tenant prior to the termination of his or her tenancy; that § 9-1- 2 was not a basis for recovery by the tenant because non-compliance with § 34-18-22.3 does not constitute criminal conduct triggering the applicability of § 9-1-2; and that the equitable theory of unjust enrichment did not apply in this case because Mr. Olsen had suffered no harm.', 'The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment; and, on November 22, 2017, a judge of the District Court granted Mrs. DeMayo’s motion and denied Mr. Olsen’s motion. Mr. Olsen timely appealed to Superior Court. In the Superior Court, the parties again filed cross- motions for summary judgment, and a hearing was held on January 2, 2018 with respect to same. The arguments of the parties in the Superior Court were virtually identical to those which they had made in the District Court. The Superior Court reached the same conclusion as the District Court and granted summary judgment in favor of Mrs. DeMayo, while dismissing all three of Mr. Olsen’s claims. Final judgment entered on February 6, 2018, from which Mr. Olsen timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'The Superior Court reviews an appeal from the District Court under the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act in a de novo manner.

Charlesgate Nursing Center, L.P., 115 A.3d 998, 1002 (R.I. 2015).', '3 In conducting that review, we “view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and if we conclude that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we will affirm the judgment.” Sullo v. Greenberg, 68 A.3d 404, 406-07 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).

If “a statute is clear and unambiguous we are bound to ascribe the plain and ordinary meaning of the words of the statute and our inquiry is at an end.” Id.

Factor, 41 A.3d 994, 1002 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '4', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Recovery Under § 34-18-22.3', 'Mr. Olsen argues that § 34-18-22.3 is plain and unambiguous and that it provides him with “an express private right of action” to recover the entire amount of rent he paid to Mrs. DeMayo during the period of his tenancy (an amount approaching three hundred thousand dollars) “together with prejudgment interest thereon and costs.” Section 34-18-22.3 stated in pertinent part:', '“A landlord who is not a resident of this state shall designate and', 'continuously maintain an agent upon whom service may be made of', 'any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be', 'served * * *. If a landlord fails to comply with the requirements of', 'this section, rent for the dwelling unit abates until designation of an', 'agent is made and the landlord shall be subject to a fine of up to five', 'hundred ($500) dollars per violation, payable to the municipality.” Mr. Olsen asserts that, because throughout the entire period of his tenancy, Mrs. DeMayo was not in compliance with this statute, he had “no obligation to pay the rent” and that Mrs. DeMayo had “no right to collect the rent.” He further argues that, because in his view he was under no obligation to pay rent, the plain and obvious meaning of the statute requires that he be refunded the entire amount which he actually paid to Mrs. DeMayo over the years of his tenancy—all pursuant to a civil action that he did not commence until some two years after he had ceased being a tenant of Mrs. DeMayo.', 'This argument is unavailing. We agree with the hearing justice, who found that § 34-18- 22.3 “does not provide a cause of action which allows the tenant to retroactively recover past rents solely based upon the landlord’s failure to [designate an agent.]” (Emphasis added.) The hearing justice made this determination after acknowledging that there was “some ambiguity in the', '5 statute,” with which observation we also agree. The term “abate” is ambiguous in this context because it “is susceptible of more than one meaning * * *.” See Town of Warren, 159 A.3d at 1039; Drs. Pass and Bertherman, Inc. v. Neighborhood Health Plan of Rhode Island, 31 A.3d 1263, 1269 (R.I. 2011). Accordingly, we shall now proceed to interpret that ambiguous statutory language by “employ[ing] our well-established maxims of statutory construction * * *.” Town of Warren, 159 A.3d at 1039.', 'Black’s Law Dictionary provides the following two definitions of “abatement” that have arguable pertinence to the instant case:', '“1. The act of eliminating or nullifying * * *.', '“* * *', '“3. The act of lessening or moderating; diminution in amount or', 'degree * * *.” Black’s Law Dictionary 3 (10th ed. 2014). Bearing in mind these definitions, as well as the fact that the statute itself provides no definition of the term “abates,” an argument could theoretically be constructed to the effect that the requirement of paying rent is eliminated or nullified with respect to the entire period of time that a landlord has been in non-compliance with the statute. (See definition #1, supra.) The alternative argument would be that the requirement about paying rent can be lessened or moderated prospectively when a particular event justifies that far less draconian form of abatement. (See definition #3, supra.)', 'Given the existence of those two theoretically conceivable interpretations of the term “abate” in § 34-18-22.3, it becomes our role “to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Powers v. Warwick Public Schools, 204 A.3d 1078, 1085 (R.I. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '6', 'The General Assembly was quite specific as to the purposes of the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act of which the statute at issue is a part. Section 34-18-2 of the General Laws provides in pertinent part:', '“(b) Underlying purposes and policies of this chapter are to:', '“(1) Simplify, clarify, modernize and revise the law', 'governing the rental of dwelling units and the rights and obligations', 'of landlords and tenants;', '“(2) Encourage landlords and tenants to maintain and', 'improve the quality and availability of housing;', '“(3) Make more uniform the law relating to residential', 'landlord and tenant relations in those respects in which this chapter', 'follows the ‘Uniform Residential Landlord–Tenant Act.’” In giving effect to that stated legislative purpose, we “must consider the entire statute as a whole; individual sections must be considered in the context of the entire statutory scheme, not as if each section were independent of all other sections.” State v. Briggs, 58 A.3d 164, 168 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 71 (R.I. 2011). No other section of the Residential Landlord and Tenant Act so drastically allows a tenant to reach back (or, to use the term currently in vogue, “claw back”) ad infinitum simply because the landlord has failed to comply with a ministerial duty. Nothing in the overall statutory scheme lends any support for the proposition that the General Assembly intended so draconian a result.', 'Turning next to the above-described ambiguity of the term “abates” in § 34-18-22.3, we are mindful of the principle that, when we construe “an ambiguous statute, we must look to the entire statutory scheme to deduce the legislative intent; our interpretive gaze should not be restricted to a mere isolated provision, * * * and under no circumstances will [we] construe a statute to reach an absurd result.” Mancini v. City of Providence, 155 A.3d 159, 163 (R.I. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). Allowing for Mr. Olsen to claw back monies that he paid as', '7 rent to Mrs. DeMayo for many years (which monies were paid so that he and his family could live at a property owned by Mrs. DeMayo) would, in our considered judgment, violate the venerable canon of statutory construction that militates against reaching an absurd result. To allow Mr. Olsen to recover the full amount of rent that he paid to Mrs. DeMayo over many years when he has failed to even allege that he was harmed in any way by her alleged non-compliance during his tenancy with a statutory mandate would be the product of an absurd and entirely inequitable interpretation of the statute. If we were to adopt Mr. Olsen’s interpretation of this statute, the result would be that Mr. Olsen and his family were able to occupy Mrs. DeMayo’s waterfront condominium for nearly a decade completely rent-free; we unequivocally decline to do so.', 'Moreover, at no time has Mr. Olsen contended that he was stymied in some attempt to serve Mrs. DeMayo with “any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served * * *.” Section 34-18-22.3. Actually, Mr. Olsen has not alleged that he was harmed in any way by Mrs. DeMayo’s alleged failure to have filed the designation called for in the statute.2 Mr. Olsen has “fail[ed] to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to [his] case”—that essential element being that he suffered harm as a result of Mrs. DeMayo’s alleged violation of § 34-18-22.3. Beauregard, 66 A.3d at 493 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Laplante v. Rhode Island Hospital, 110 A.3d 261, 264 (R.I. 2015); Lavoie v. North East Knitting, Inc., 918 A.2d 225, 228 (R.I. 2007). 2', 'Mr. Olsen did provide an affidavit to the Superior Court at the time that the cross-motions for summary judgment were filed, but that affidavit failed to state that he had suffered any damages. Instead, Mr. Olsen’s affidavit simply stated: “During my tenancy, I did not know that [Mrs. DeMayo] was in violation of R.I. Gen. Laws § 34-18-22.3, and I did not know that my rent was abated as a result of her violation.” (Emphasis added.)', '8', 'For all of these reasons, it is our opinion, after a careful de novo review of the record, that the hearing justice properly granted Mrs. DeMayo’s motion for summary judgment as to § 34-18- 22.3 and properly denied Mr. Olsen’s cross-motion.', 'B', 'Recovery Under § 9-1-2', 'Mr. Olsen also argues that § 9-1-2 allows him to recover based on the theory that Mrs. DeMayo violated § 34-18-22.3. Section 9-1-2, which affords “civil liability for crimes and offenses,” provides in pertinent part:', '“Whenever any person shall suffer any injury to his or her person,', 'reputation, or estate by reason of the commission of any crime or', 'offense, he or she may recover his or her damages for the injury in', 'a civil action against the offender, and it shall not be any defense to', 'such action that no criminal complaint for the crime or offense has', 'been made * * *.”', 'After considering the record and the arguments of the parties, the hearing justice concluded that there was no indication that “there [were] sufficient indicia of criminality in order to apply [§] 9-1-2.”', 'Even assuming arguendo that an alleged violation of a statute that requires a landlord to designate an agent sufficiently constitutes an “offense” under § 9-1-2 (a proposition about which we are dubious), it is our opinion that this count in the complaint was properly dismissed at the summary judgment stage—because another completely sufficient ground exists for the grant of summary judgment.3 Under § 9-1-2, a person “may recover his or her damages” for the alleged offense. As discussed supra, Mr. Olsen did not allege that he had suffered any damages as a result 3', 'It should go without saying that we are “free to affirm on grounds other than those relied on by the trial justice.” Shepard v. Harleysville Worcester Insurance Co., Inc., 944 A.2d 167, 170 (R.I. 2008).', '9 of Mrs. DeMayo’s purported violation of § 34-18-22.3. See Mutual Development Corp. v. Ward Fisher & Co., LLP, 47 A.3d 319, 323 (R.I. 2012). Because he did not incur any damages as a result of Mrs. DeMayo’s alleged offense, there was no basis for recovery under § 9-1-2; and, therefore, we uphold the grant of summary judgment as to this count.', 'C', 'Recovery Under the Theory of Unjust Enrichment', 'Mr. Olsen also argues that the trial justice erred when he determined that “the elements of unjust enrichment are not satisfied based on the facts of this case.”', 'In an action to recover for unjust enrichment, a plaintiff must prove:', '“(1) that he or she conferred a benefit upon the party from whom', 'relief is sought; (2) that the recipient appreciated the benefit; and', '(3) that the recipient accepted the benefit under such circumstances', 'that it would be inequitable for [the recipient] to retain the benefit', 'without paying the value thereof.” Dellagrotta v.

McMahon, 116 A.3d 204, 213 (R.I. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'We find ourselves in agreement with the hearing justice’s determination that Mr. Olsen was not entitled to recover under the theory of unjust enrichment. The third element of a cause of action for unjust enrichment as articulated in Dellagrotta is that it would have been “inequitable” for Mrs. DeMayo to have retained the benefit at issue. See Dellagrotta, 873 A.2d at 113. However, we perceive no error whatsoever in the trial justice’s conclusion that Mrs. DeMayo’s retention of “the benefit” (i.e., the rent money from Mr. Olsen) was not inequitable because Mr. Olsen received real value for it in the form of the right to occupy the waterfront condominium at issue for an', '10 extended period of time. It is completely clear to us that, even viewing the facts in the light most favorable to Mr. Olsen, Mrs. DeMayo was entitled to summary judgment because Mr. Olsen did not show the existence of an essential element under the theory of unjust enrichment.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

During a hearing on May 15, 2014, the hearing justice set a status conference for September 2014, and instructed the parties to be ready for trial on or after October 1, 2014.', 'The defendant still had not retained an attorney by the status conference on September 15, 2014.', 'The defendant indicated that he had faced some unforeseen financial issues in the intervening months. The defendant also reiterated his discomfort with the retainer system that would require him to pay an attorney upfront.3 The hearing justice declined to continue the case further and reiterated that it would be tried on or after October 1, 2014. 2', 'The defendant also originally asked for four months to hire an attorney following Connors’ withdrawal, but the hearing justice denied his request, stating: “No, you can’t. Your case is already scheduled for disposition. It’s been conferenced by Mr. Connors and the prosecutor already. It’s ready to go.” 3', 'The hearing justice engaged in the following colloquy with defendant at the September 15, 2014 hearing:', '“THE COURT:', '[This case has] been continued for', 'some time.

At that time, defendant had not retained counsel and further stated that he could no longer afford to hire an attorney. The second hearing justice continued the case for one week to give defendant time to make an appointment with the Public Defender’s office to determine if he would be eligible for its services. In the week that followed, defendant met with a representative from the Public Defender’s office, but, again, he was deemed ineligible for services. The defendant appeared before the second hearing justice for determination of attorney three more times, and he was granted three more continuances on February 11, February 13, and February 20, until the second hearing justice scheduled a March 11, 2015 trial calendar call with a trial date certain on April 1, 2015.4', 'On April 1, 2015, a private attorney stood with defendant after discussing possible representation, and the second hearing justice, again, continued the matter, this time so the attorney and defendant could meet to determine whether the attorney would be retained. The defendant did not retain that attorney, however, and instead appeared before the first hearing justice again on May 4, 2015, without representation. The case was once again scheduled for trial.', '“THE COURT:', 'And how many times have I asked', 'you that?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'When the attorney comes and sits', 'down at the table with me, I’ll get an', 'attorney.

The defendant told the trial justice that he remained unrepresented and was “not going to go forward without counsel.” The trial justice replied that the trial would be “going forward because those are my decisions.” The trial justice proceeded to provide a summary of the travel of the case, particularly noting defendant’s pro se appearances before the two hearing justices. Following her summary of the travel of the case, the trial justice stated:', '“The [c]ourt rules that this case will go forward today as scheduled.', 'The Defendant’s right to select counsel and engage the services of', 'counsel is certainly an important right, but it is not absolute, and this', 'case must go forward.

And of course the Public Defender', 'has indicated at least on two occasions he’s not eligible.”', 'During jury selection, but outside of the presence of the jurors, defendant reiterated his concern about proceeding to trial without counsel. He stated: “I don’t want to go forward with the case. You’re forcing me to go forward with the case. That’s the way I feel inside my heart. I don’t feel like I can represent myself. You are forcing me to do something I don’t want to do.” The trial justice proceeded with selection of the jury, and, after the jurors were duly sworn, the state gave its opening statement. The trial justice offered defendant the opportunity to give an opening statement, but defendant instead responded: “I take the Fifth. * * * I don’t want to go forward', '-5- because I don’t have an attorney. You guys are forcing me.” The trial justice struck defendant’s comments from the record, informed the jury that “[t]he [c]ourt has determined that this case will go forward with this gentleman being given the opportunity to represent himself[,]” and instructed the state to call its first witness.', 'The state presented three witnesses: former Pawtucket police officer Michael Lajoie, Pawtucket police officer John Donley, and Pawtucket police officer Mark Ramos.', 'Officer Lajoie testified to an encounter with defendant on May 28, 2012, which resulted in a physical altercation between the two during which Officer Lajoie suffered significant injuries. At some point, Officer Lajoie noticed that his “right foot was turned around 180 degrees the wrong direction.” By that time, other officers had arrived for backup, and those officers took defendant into custody while Officer Lajoie was transported to the hospital.', 'Following Officer Lajoie’s testimony, the trial justice asked defendant if he had any questions for the witness, to which defendant replied: “No, because I want to talk to the jurors.”', 'Officer Donley testified next. According to Officer Donley, he and Officer Ramos responded to a call for backup to a store parking lot, and as the two arrived, he observed Officer Lajoie and defendant yelling at each other in a “heated verbal argument.” Officer Donley testified that he then “observed [defendant] push Officer Lajoie to the ground.” When the officers caught up to defendant and Officer Lajoie, they attempted to take defendant into custody, but he resisted. Officer Donley testified that he used pepper spray and an “open hand slap to the side of his face * * * [a]s a distraction technique” to “successfully handcuff [defendant] without further incident.”', 'Officer Donley testified that he observed Officer Lajoie’s foot to be “dangling abnormally[,]” and called a rescue. He also stated that he and Officer Ramos transported defendant to the Pawtucket police station and that defendant was spitting excessively while in the vehicle.', '-6- Officer Donley testified that defendant did not follow commands once at the police station, so they needed to “take him back down to the ground and re-handcuff him” prior to placing him in a cell.', 'Following that testimony, defendant attempted to cross-examine Officer Donley. However, defendant had difficulty forming questions for the witness and instead began testifying.5 After several unsuccessful attempts at cross-examination, defendant expressed his confusion about the process to the trial justice, and then stated:', '“I don’t want to go forward because I’m not a lawyer or anything.', 'You just handed me the form this morning, and now I went home', 'and that was it.

He gave a similar account to Officer Donley’s testimony.', 'The defendant also attempted to cross-examine Officer Ramos, but was again unsuccessful. The defendant told the trial justice, in the presence of the jury, that he felt unqualified to represent himself, and that the trial justice “forced [him] to go forward.” After the state rested, the trial justice gave defendant the opportunity to testify in narrative form, but defendant declined. The defendant also refused to give a closing statement, saying, “at this point, I don’t know what is going on.” After the prosecutor gave a closing statement, the trial justice charged the jury with instructions and excused them for the day.', 'The following morning, Attorney Thomas DeSimone (DeSimone) entered his appearance for defendant on the record, stating that defendant had retained him around nine o’clock the previous night. DeSimone asked that the “case go back to the beginning so that [defendant] can actually have a lawyer represent him.” The trial justice denied that request.', 'The jury found defendant guilty as to all pending charges: assault of a police officer (count 1), resisting arrest (count 3), and disorderly conduct (count 4).6 6', 'The state dismissed the charge for simple assault (count 2) prior to jury deliberations.', '-8-', 'C', 'Posttrial', 'On May 28, 2015, defendant, who remained represented by counsel, filed a motion for a new trial. The defendant averred that he had been denied his constitutional rights at trial because he did not have representation. After hearing argument, the trial justice rendered a decision from the bench denying defendant’s motion. The trial justice concluded that, prior to beginning trial, she had “found that the Defendant willfully and intentionally entered into a strategy to manipulate the system and delay trial indefinitely. And in doing so, he knew he ran the risk of a trial without a lawyer. His strategy was knowing and voluntary and intelligent * * *.”7 Additionally, the trial justice noted that, “[t]he fact that Defendant hired Mr. DeSimone so expeditiously on the night of May 18th demonstrates further, speaks volumes, as to the extent to which Defendant misled the [c]ourt about his inability to engage counsel.” The trial justice further determined that the jury followed the instructions she had given, and that, if she had been sitting without a jury, she would have come to the same conclusion based on the evidence presented at trial.', 'The defendant was sentenced on count 1 to three years’ imprisonment, with fifteen months to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation. As to count 3, defendant was sentenced to one year suspended, with probation, to run consecutively to the sentence for count 1. As to count 7', 'At the hearing on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice agreed that she had not specifically used the words “knowing, intelligent, and voluntary” waiver of counsel on record prior to trial. However, the trial justice emphasized that she denied defendant’s request for a continuance prior to trial after she had determined that defendant’s failure to engage counsel “constituted an intelligent, intentional strategy on the part of the Defendant and an effort to manipulate the system by * * * stalling * * * trial[.]” Moreover, defendant concedes that “[w]hile [the trial justice] did not make this specific finding before the trial began, her ruling made clear that she considered [defendant’s] actions to be tantamount to a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of the right to counsel.”', '-9- 4, defendant was sentenced to six months suspended, with probation, to run concurrently to the count 3 sentence.

Specifically, defendant contends that the trial justice erred by (1) failing to independently determine that defendant was not indigent prior to trial and (2) “fail[ing] to recognize that [defendant’s] decision to dismiss his first trial lawyer was not made with the requisite knowledge that he would be required to proceed to trial pro se if he did not hire substitute counsel * * *[.]” 8', 'The defendant filed his appeal prior to entry of the judgment of conviction. However, it is well settled that a premature notice of appeal will be considered “timely so long as a final judgment is entered thereafter.” State v. Austin, 114 A.3d 87, 94 n.9 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Mercurio, 89 A.3d 813, 817 n.2 (R.I. 2014)).', '- 10 -', '“The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution afford an accused the right to the assistance of counsel in all criminal prosecutions.” Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390. “Whether defense counsel is retained or appointed, this right ensures that the trial is fair.” Id. (quoting State v. Laurence, 848 A.2d 238, 252 (R.I. 2004)). It is also true that a criminal defendant “has the right to proceed pro se at trial representing himself or herself, provided that his or her waiver of counsel is valid.” Id. A defendant must voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive his or her right to counsel for the waiver to be valid. Id.', '“When confronted with a defendant’s purported waiver of counsel, this Court employs a two-prong analysis to determine the validity of that waiver.” Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390. Thus, “we must first determine whether the waiver was ‘voluntary,’ and then we must determine whether the waiver was ‘knowing and intelligent.’” Id. (quoting Laurence, 848 A.2d at 253). In assessing whether there has been a valid waiver of counsel, “we examine the totality of the circumstances.” Laurence, 848 A.2d at 253. We have stated that the following factors, as first outlined in State v. Chabot, 682 A.2d 1377 (R.I. 1996), are relevant to this consideration:', '“(1) the background, the experience, and the conduct of the', 'defendant at the hearing, including his age, his education, and his', 'physical and mental health; (2) the extent to which the defendant has', 'had prior contact with lawyers before the hearing; (3) the', 'defendant’s knowledge of the nature of the proceeding and the', 'sentence that may potentially be [imposed]; (4) the question of', 'whether standby counsel has been appointed and the extent to which', 'he or she has aided the defendant before or at the hearing; (5) the', 'question of whether the waiver of counsel was the result of', 'mistreatment or coercion; and (6) the question of whether the', 'defendant is trying to manipulate the events of the hearing.” Chabot,', '682 A.2d at 1380. However, we also note that this Court has made clear that “consideration of the six Chabot factors [i]s mandatory only in cases in which the mental competency of the defendant is questioned; in all', '- 11 - other cases, the factors are relevant but need not be addressed factor by factor.” State v. Bluitt, 850 A.2d 83, 87 (R.I. 2004).', 'A', 'Voluntary', 'First, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in finding a voluntary waiver of counsel without first independently inquiring into defendant’s indigency status. Specifically, defendant argues that a trial justice is required to “determine whether a defendant is constitutionally entitled to court-appointed counsel, regardless of his or her statutory eligibility for Public Defender representation.” Conversely, the state responds that the Public Defender’s office, alone, is vested with the authority to make indigency determinations under the eligibility statute, G.L. 1956 § 12- 15-9. Furthermore, the state argues that, even if the trial justice was required to inquire about defendant’s eligibility for representation, defendant has not demonstrated that he could not afford an attorney, and in fact, had continuously represented that he was financially able to hire his own representation during pretrial proceedings.', 'In support of his position, defendant cites to cases from other jurisdictions which have held that a defendant is entitled to a separate judicial determination of indigency when the public defender has determined that the defendant is not eligible for services. For example, in People v. Steinbeck, 186 P.3d 54 (Colo. App. 2007), a defendant, whose private counsel withdrew after part of the proceedings, was found to be ineligible for services by the state public defender’s office. Steinbeck, 186 P.3d at 57, 58. The Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that the defendant had been denied his statutory right to judicial review of the indigency determination, and further, his constitutional right to court-appointed counsel. Id. at 59, 60. In so deciding, the court in Steinbeck noted that the mandate for judicial review of indigency determinations was “grounded in a long', '- 12 - history of inherent judicial power to appoint counsel for a defendant without the means to afford counsel in order to ensure a fair trial for the defendant.” Id. at 57. In State v. Dean, 471 N.W.2d 310 (Wis. Ct. App. 1991), the Wisconsin Court of Appeals stated that Wisconsin’s eligibility statute permitted judicial review of an indigency determination, but further commented that “[t]here are situations, as here, where a defendant does not meet certain indigency criteria, but nevertheless is unable to afford counsel.” Dean, 471 N.W.2d at 313, 314. The court in Dean further concluded that a trial justice “is required to go beyond the public defender’s determination that a defendant does not meet the legislative criteria and determine whether the ‘necessities of the case’ and the demands of ‘public justice and sound policy’ require appointing counsel.” Id. at 314.', 'The defendant also relies on Ingram v. Justice Court for Lake Valley Judicial District of El Dorado County, 447 P.2d 650 (Cal. 1968), to support his position that the constitution requires this independent inquiry. In Ingram, the Supreme Court of California was tasked with determining the opposite situation to the case at bar—whether a court may review a public defender’s determination that a defendant was indigent and eligible for services. Ingram, 447 P.2d at 651. The court ultimately held that judicial review of this determination was inappropriate. Id. at 655. Nevertheless, in dicta, the court discussed a scenario similar to the case at bar, and commented that a defendant would be “entitled to judicial review of a determination of nonindigence not because of any language in [California’s eligibility statute] but because of the fundamental constitutional guarantee of counsel to all persons accused of crime.” Id. at 654.', 'However, all three of the cases defendant cites for support are distinguishable from the case before us. Ingram, as we have stated, involved the opposite set of facts to the case before us. See Ingram, 447 P.2d at 651. Furthermore, in Steinbeck, the Colorado Court of Appeals held that “a defendant bears the initial burden of raising his claim of indigency to the court[,]” and that the', '- 13 - defendant in that case had “provided the trial court on more than one occasion with facts indicating that he could not afford to retain counsel.” Steinbeck, 186 P.3d at 56, 59. Similarly, in Dean, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals stated that “[a] defendant who seeks appointed counsel must present evidence to the trial court of his or her assets, income, liabilities and attempts to retain counsel.” Dean, 471 N.W.2d at 315. In that case, the defendant had claimed indigency on multiple occasions, the state had stipulated to the defendant’s indigent status at a postconviction-relief hearing, and one of the judges presiding over the defendant’s proceedings had “specifically stated that [the defendant] could not afford an attorney.” Id. at 312, 315. Conversely, here, defendant continuously maintained before the Superior Court hearing justices that he had funds to hire an attorney. Even after defendant claimed that he was indigent but was deemed ineligible by the Public Defender, defendant again represented to the hearing justices that he would be able to raise funds to hire an attorney.', 'Additionally, the defendants in Steinbeck and Dean were entitled to a statutory right of review of a public defender’s indigency determination under the laws of Colorado and Wisconsin, respectively. Steinbeck, 186 P.3d at 56; Dean, 471 N.W.2d at 313. In Rhode Island, the statute defining eligibility requirements for indigent representation does not expressly mandate or permit a trial justice to review the Public Defender’s determination of ineligibility. See G.L. 1956 § 12- 15-9.9 9', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-15-9 reads, in pertinent part:', '“If the public defender, after examination and investigation of the', 'financial statement, is satisfied that the person submitting it is an', 'indigent defendant, the public defender or one of his or her assistants', 'shall defend the person; provided, that if the public defender is', 'satisfied that the person is not an indigent defendant, he or she shall', 'notify the court which referred the person to the public defender’s', '- 14 -', 'Moreover, this Court has held that a defendant may demonstrate a voluntary waiver of the constitutional right to counsel by his or her actions. See Laurence, 848 A.2d at 254. For example, in Laurence, we determined that a defendant who repeatedly rejected the services of court- appointed counsel had voluntarily waived his right to an attorney, even though that defendant “asserted many times at trial that it was not his desire to represent himself and that he felt coerced into doing so[.]” Id. at 254, 255; see also State v. Thornton, 800 A.2d 1016, 1026 (R.I. 2002) (“[The defendant’s] repeated refusal to accept the services of competent court-appointed defense counsel demonstrates clearly the voluntary waiver of his right to counsel, and that he was not in any way unconstitutionally ‘forced’ to proceed pro se.”).', 'Here, we are of the opinion that, despite defendant’s claims that he was forced to proceed to trial without counsel, defendant’s continuous failure to obtain representation demonstrates a voluntary waiver of counsel. As set forth above, defendant repeatedly represented to two justices of the Superior Court that he was able to afford counsel, but that he was not comfortable with the retainer payment system after his experience with his prior attorneys. Moreover, defendant was generously granted more than ten continuances over the course of fourteen months, yet he still failed to procure representation, notwithstanding his many assurances to the court that he would hire an attorney. As this Court concluded in Laurence, to allow defendant to continue this pattern “would be to prevent any trial whatever until the accused person himself should be pleased to', 'office of the determination that the person is not an indigent', 'defendant.” Furthermore, § 12-15-8 defines an “indigent defendant” as', '“a person who after payment of necessary expenses for food, shelter', 'and medical care, does not have sufficient income or assets to enable', 'him or her to retain counsel nor is there any one to whom he or she', 'is entitled to look for support who has that income or assets.”', '- 15 - permit it.” Laurence, 848 A.2d at 255 (quoting Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 349 (1970)). Thus, as we have held, it is clear that “[t]he defendant’s actions, rather than his words, demonstrate that he waived his right to counsel.” Id. at 254.', 'Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in determining that defendant voluntarily waived his right to counsel prior to trial.', 'B', 'Knowing and Intelligent', 'The defendant also argues that he did not knowingly or intelligently waive his right to counsel. The defendant contends that the trial justice did not consider defendant’s lack of understanding that, upon assenting to the motion to withdraw, he would be required to proceed to trial pro se if he did not secure other representation. The defendant asserts that the trial justice looked only to defendant’s actions following the withdrawal and that, therefore, the trial justice’s finding “was based on an incomplete assessment of the circumstances[.]” The state counters that, upon withdrawal of defendant’s retained attorney and over the course of the many subsequent pretrial hearings, “defendant was warned that his two options were to hire a replacement attorney or to represent himself.” Consequently, the state contends, defendant’s waiver of counsel, “by virtue of his refusal to hire counsel for over a year despite repeated opportunities and warnings, was voluntary, knowing and intelligent.”', 'This Court has held that “[a] valid waiver is effective only if a ‘defendant knows what he or she is doing and his or her choice is made with eyes open.’” Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390 (brackets omitted) (quoting Chabot, 682 A.2d at 1380). “A criminal defendant, therefore, should be ‘made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.’” Id. (quoting Chabot, 682 A.2d at 1380). However, this Court has also stated that, while “a detailed colloquy between a trial justice', '- 16 - and a defendant on the record assists the trial justice in ascertaining the knowing and intelligent nature of a defendant’s waiver[,] * * * ‘such an inquiry is not constitutionally required.’” Id. (quoting State v. Spencer, 783 A.2d 413, 416 (R.I. 2001)).', 'The defendant contends that the first hearing justice’s colloquy with defendant prior to granting the motion to withdraw was “clearly insufficient” to enable the hearing justice to be certain that defendant “fully understood the potential consequences of his actions.” A review of the record shows that, at the hearing during which the motion to withdraw was granted, the first hearing justice informed defendant of the seriousness of his situation prior to granting the motion. The hearing justice stated: “Mr. Souto, this is a critical situation as you are facing a felony charge, facing a trial, facing an offer. * * * What you really need right now is an attorney.” The hearing justice further informed defendant that he had a right to represent himself during the legal process. It is also true that the hearing justice did not expressly tell defendant that he would be required to proceed pro se if he did not secure representation prior to trial.', 'However, even if we assume that, at the time of Connors’ withdrawal, defendant did not understand that he might be required to proceed to trial pro se if he did not hire an attorney, this fact does not demonstrate a constitutionally inadequate waiver of counsel. The relevant inquiry here is whether the trial justice erred in finding that defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel prior to trial. As we have stated, in the fourteen months following Connors’ withdrawal from defendant’s representation on March 13, 2014, and prior to the May 18, 2015 trial, defendant appeared before two justices of the Superior Court at least a dozen times. At each hearing, the hearing justices emphasized the critical need for defendant to retain an attorney as soon as possible. The hearing justices also made it clear to defendant that the case needed to move to trial, and on several occasions, set trial dates. Importantly, defendant was expressly warned at', '- 17 - several of those hearings that he would represent himself at trial if he did not obtain an attorney, and his responses suggested that he understood this possibility.10 10', 'For example, on May 1, 2014, more than a year before trial, defendant was warned at a pretrial conference that he would be representing himself at trial. The following colloquy took place at that hearing:', '“THE COURT:', 'I’d love to hear the side of your story.', 'For you to say it here is to put you at', 'risk because they’re going to use what', 'you say against you at trial, and you', 'have a right not to incriminate', 'yourself.

On the first morning of trial, the trial justice carefully reviewed the travel of the case, noted a defendant’s critical right to be able to choose his or her counsel, and When the matter was set for trial before the second hearing justice, defendant made a representation that he could not afford a lawyer at that time. The hearing justice expressly informed defendant of the consequences of failure to obtain representation:', '“THE COURT:', 'Mr. Souto, you’ve had more than', 'enough time.

The defendant argues that his background and experience rendered him incompetent to present his own defense, that he was not afforded standby counsel, and that he did not have any prior “useful experience with the criminal justice system.”', 'First, this Court has been clear that a trial justice is not required to consider all of the Chabot factors absent an issue with defendant’s mental competency. See Laurence, 848 A.2d at 254. There is no suggestion here that mental competency was at issue. Furthermore, we have held that “a trial justice ‘need not make any assessment of the extent of the defendant’s technical legal knowledge in determining the defendant’s knowing exercise of the right to defend himself.’” Cruz, 109 A.3d at 390 (quoting State v. Briggs, 787 A.2d 479, 485 (R.I. 2001)). It is true that defendant did not have standby counsel at the proceedings, and, for the sake of this discussion, we also assume that defendant is relatively unfamiliar with the judicial system. However, given the hearing justices’ clear warnings to defendant at the numerous pretrial hearings about the dangers of proceeding pro se, in addition to the trial justice’s finding that defendant manipulated the proceedings by intentionally delaying his quest to engage an attorney, we cannot say that the trial justice erred in finding that defendant knowingly and intentionally waived his right to counsel.', 'Thus, after careful consideration of the totality of the circumstances, it is our opinion that the defendant voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his right to counsel.', '- 20 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.

19,In re Estate of Amet Chelo. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The appellant, Amet Chelo (appellant), appeals from a Superior Court judgment dismissing his probate appeal after finding that, because the appellant was under guardianship, he lacked the capacity to retain legal counsel and file an appeal to the Superior Court in his own name. Before this Court, the appellant claims that the Superior Court erred in dismissing his probate appeal because, according to the appellant, he was only under a limited guardianship and, thus, was entitled to pursue the probate appeal on his own. This case came before the Supreme Court on May 8, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The appellant is a ninety-three-year-old resident of Cumberland, Rhode Island, and the father to four children: two sons—Glenn Chelo and Craig Chelo (collectively, appellees), and two daughters—Kimberly Whalen and Debra Grenier.', 'After several unfortunate disputes amongst the four siblings concerning their father’s care and difficulty in visiting him, appellees', '-1- filed a “Petition for Limited Guardianship or Guardianship” with the Town of Cumberland Probate Court on November 18, 2015.', 'In accordance with G.L. 1956 § 33-15-4(a)(2), a decision-making assessment tool (DMAT) completed by Brian Ott, M.D. also was filed with the petition. The DMAT concluded that appellant’s decision-making abilities in the areas of finance, health care, relationships, and residency were “limited by moderate dementia.” The petition was also supported by a report drafted by appellant’s guardian ad litem, which recommended the appointment of a guardian with respect to matters of finance, health care, and residency, and recommended a limited guardian with respect to matters of relationship “to ensure that his family, his significant other * * * and anyone else that he chooses has access to him, and can visit him in his home without interference from any family member.”', 'The appellees’ petition was heard on December 15, 2015, in the Probate Court. After discussing the need for a guardian and the scope of the guardianship, the parties accepted the appointment of Bruce D. Sawyer as guardian for appellant, “with the direction that [Sawyer] consult with [appellant] on all major decisions.” An order entered that same day stipulating:', '“(1) That Bruce Sawyer is appointed as Limited Guardian of both', 'the person and estate of Amet Chelo.', '“(2) That in his capacity as Guardian, Mr. Sawyer is instructed to', 'consult with Mr. Chelo before making any major decisions.” Although the order set forth that Sawyer was appointed as “limited guardian,” the certificate of appointment, also issued that same day, stipulated that Sawyer was “qualified as guardian of both the person and estate of Amet Chelo and [is] vested with all the power and authority prescribed by law to said office[,]” with no reference to any limitations of authority. Three days later, on December 18, 2015, a second order was entered that provided that Sawyer “is hereby appointed Guardian of the person and estate of Amet Chelo” and detailing the days and conditions under which appellees could visit their father.', '-2-', 'In the ensuing months, the siblings failed to abide by the visitation schedule set forth in the December 18, 2015 order, which prompted Sawyer to file a miscellaneous petition with the Probate Court stating:', '“Amet Chelo has not had visitations with his sons for some time.', 'Although Amet seems to enjoy living with his daughter * * * and', 'is receiving good care, I would like authority to evaluate whether it', 'would be more feasible and appropriate for Amet to be living in an', 'assisted living facility.” As a result of Sawyer’s petition, the Probate Court judge directed him to consider whether appellant should be placed in an assisted-living facility; however, in the interim, an order entered permitting appellant to stay at his Cumberland home under the arrangements previously approved by the Probate Court. On March 23, 2017, a hearing before the Probate Court judge was scheduled to review appellees’ visitation with appellant. At the close of the hearing, the Probate Court judge found that it would be in appellant’s best interests to be placed in an assisted-living facility and entered an order stating “That the Ward’s Guardian, Bruce D. Sawyer, shall, as soon as practicable, arrange for the temporary placement of the Ward, Amet Chelo, at an appropriate assisted living facility[.]”', 'The appellant, adamant that he wanted to stay in his home, contacted Sawyer and asked him to contact an attorney so that he could appeal the March 23, 2017 order.', 'Sawyer subsequently scheduled a meeting with an attorney for April 6, 2017. At that meeting, appellant asked the attorney about the attorney’s background and later in the meeting confirmed with Sawyer that he wanted to hire the attorney; Sawyer wrote a $6,000 check to retain the attorney on appellant’s behalf. Now, represented by counsel, on April 12, 2017, appellant filed a petition with the Superior Court appealing the March 23, 2017 order of the Probate Court. Subsequently, appellees moved to dismiss the probate appeal, arguing that appellant lacked the capacity to file the appeal on his own behalf because the December 18, 2015 order, which appointed Sawyer as', '-3- appellant’s permanent guardian without limitation, superseded the December 15, 2015 order, which on its face appointed Sawyer as limited guardian.', 'On March 9, 2018, after considering the parties’ written and oral arguments, the Superior Court justice determined that the December 15, 2015 order was superseded and replaced by the December 18, 2015 order that appointed Sawyer as full guardian of the person and estate of appellant without any of the limitations that were included in the December 15, 2015 order. Accordingly, the Superior Court granted the motion to dismiss and declared that “Bruce D. Sawyer had been appointed as full guardian over the estate and person of Amet Chelo, without limitation, pursuant to an order entered by the Cumberland Probate Court on December 18, 2015, and that the Ward, Amet Chelo, lacked the capacity to file this appeal.” Final judgment entered on March 23, 2018, and appellant timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews questions of statutory interpretation de novo. Webster v. Perrotta, 774 A.2d 68, 75 (R.I. 2001). Our goal in interpreting a statute is to discern the meaning intended by the Legislature, especially where the words used in the statute are not defined. D’Amico v. Johnston Partners, 866 A.2d 1222, 1224 (R.I. 2005). When a statute is “clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1226 (R.I. 1996). In performing this function, this Court looks to the statutory scheme as a whole and examines the statute in context. In re Brown, 903 A.2d 147, 149-50 (R.I. 2006).', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, appellant claims that the Superior Court erred in granting appellees’ motion to dismiss and in finding that appellant was under a full guardianship and, thus, lacked the capacity', '-4- to retain independent counsel to pursue the probate appeal on his own behalf because, according to appellant, the December 18, 2015 order did not supplant or supersede the December 15, 2015 order.1 As such, appellant contends that he is under a limited guardianship and retains the right to pursue this action on his own behalf. We disagree.', 'Pursuant to § 33-15-4, entitled “Limited guardianship,” “[t]he certificate of appointment issued to the limited guardian shall clearly state that it is a limited guardianship. The court order shall clearly indicate the scope of the powers and duties of the limited guardian.” Section 33-15- 4(a)(1) (emphasis added).', '“We have held that the use of the word ‘shall’ contemplates something mandatory or the ‘imposition of a duty.’” Castelli v. Carcieri, 961 A.2d 277, 284 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Conrad v. State of Rhode Island – Medical Center – General Hospital, 592 A.2d 858, 860 (R.I. 1991)). Here, the fact that the certificate of appointment did not comply with § 33-15-4(a)(1) in that it did not “clearly state” that Sawyer was appointed as “limited guardian” is dispositive. The certificate of appointment qualifies Sawyer as the “Guardian of both the person and estate of Amet Chelo” and vests Sawyer with “all the power and authority prescribed by law to said office[,]” with no limiting language. Furthermore, the December 15, 1', 'In addition, appellant argues that his due-process rights were violated when the Probate Court judge ordered him to be removed from his home and placed in an assisted-living facility; however, this argument was neither contained in appellant’s reasons of appeal nor was it raised before the trial justice in the Superior Court hearings below. The purpose of requiring a party to file the reasons of appeal is, first, to provide notice to the opposing party of what is at issue, and, second, to restrict the appellant during his or her appeal to the issues listed within the reasons for appeal. See Cannon v. McEnanley, 21 R.I. 60, 62, 41 A. 1016, 1017 (1898) (stating that “[t]he purpose of the reasons of appeal is to notify the adverse party of the grounds of appeal, that such party may be apprised of what he is to meet at the trial”); see also G.L. 1956 § 33-23-1(a)(2) (stating that probate appellant “shall be restricted” to his or her reasons of appeal). Because this argument was not contained in appellant’s reasons of appeal, nor was it addressed by the Superior Court justice, it is clear to us that appellant’s due-process argument was not properly preserved, and it will not now be addressed. See In re Estate of Ross, 131 A.3d 158, 170 (R.I. 2016).', '-5- 2015 order filed in conjunction with the certificate of appointment was defective in that it did not “clearly indicate the scope of the powers and duties of the limited guardian.” Section 33-15- 4(a)(1).', 'Instead, the December 15, 2015 order merely instructed Sawyer “to consult with [appellant] before making any major decisions.”', 'Next, appellant’s argument that the December 18, 2015 order simply “supplement[ed]” the December 15, 2015 order is without merit. The December 18, 2015 order superseded the December 15, 2015 order and is the controlling document, together with the certificate of appointment, which designates Sawyer as full guardian of the person and estate of appellant without any of the limitations that were included in the December 15, 2015 order. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that Sawyer’s powers as a guardian are not limited in any way and that appellant is under a full guardianship.2', 'Finally, contrary to appellant’s claim that he has the right to pursue a legal action in his own name while under a guardianship, this Court has held that, “when a guardian has been duly appointed, an action at law in behalf of the ward should be brought in the name of the ward by his guardian.” Champlin v. Probate Court of Exeter, 37 R.I. 349, 349, 92 A. 982, 982 (1915); see also Taylor v. Superior Court, 30 R.I. 200, 203, 74 A. 482, 483 (1909) (holding that a “suit must be brought by the guardian in the name of the ward”). Therefore, we affirm the Superior Court’s dismissal of appellant’s probate appeal on the ground that appellant lacked the capacity to bring and maintain an action in his own name, because he is under a full guardianship.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. The papers may be remanded to the Superior Court. 2', 'We note that appellant did not appeal the December 15, 2015 order, the December 18, 2015 order, or the certificate of appointment.', '-6- STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'In re Estate of Amet Chelo.', 'No. 2018-183-Appeal.

20,Gerald Richard : v. : Steven Robinson. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Steven Robinson, appeals from an order of the Superior Court that denied his motion to confirm an arbitration award in his favor. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on February 28, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided.', 'After hearing the arguments of the parties and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case originated as a legal malpractice action in which the plaintiff, Gerald Richard, alleged that defendant, plaintiff’s former attorney, had failed to properly record a property settlement agreement that had been executed by plaintiff and his ex-wife during the course of their divorce proceeding.', 'The malpractice action proceeded to court-annexed arbitration, and an arbitration award', '-1- was issued in favor of defendant on February 7, 2018. On February 15, 2018, plaintiff filed a timely rejection of the arbitration award, employing the Superior Court’s electronic filing system. However, that filing was rejected that same day by the Superior Court Arbitration Office because plaintiff had used an incorrect filing code when he submitted his rejection of the award. The plaintiff maintains that, after he learned that his filing had not been accepted, his attorney left a voicemail message with the Superior Court clerk’s office either the next day, February 16, or on February 19, the Monday following his receipt of the deficiency notice. According to plaintiff, on March 8, 2018, the day before the thirty day statutory period for rejecting an arbitration award was to expire, the parties participated in a pretrial conference with the trial justice. At that time, plaintiff represented that he had filed a rejection of the arbitration award, but he did not mention that his filing had not been accepted by the Arbitration Office.', 'On March 12, three days after the statutory period expired, defendant received an automatic notice via electronic mail that plaintiff had failed to reject the arbitration award. The defendant then quickly filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award in Superior Court.', 'When he received notice of defendant’s motion to confirm, plaintiff again contacted the Superior Court clerk’s office in an effort to determine the correct code to be used when filing a rejection of an arbitration award through the electronic filing system.', 'The plaintiff then attempted a corrected filing. That filing was also rejected, however, because the statutory filing period had expired.', 'On March 16, plaintiff filed a motion styled “O[b]jection to Defendant’s Acceptance of Arbitration Award and/or Plaintiff’s’ [sic] Motion to Accept His Rejection of the Arbitrator’s Award Out of Time Pursuant to Superior Court Rule 6(b).” After a hearing on April 6, 2018, a justice of the Superior Court denied defendant’s motion to confirm the arbitration award, but he', '-2- did not explicitly rule on plaintiff’s Rule 6(b) motion. The defendant filed this timely appeal, arguing that plaintiff’s lax and ineffective efforts to correct the deficient rejection of the arbitration award after the statutory period for making such a filing had expired did not rise to the level of excusable neglect. Therefore, he argues, plaintiff’s corrected filing should not have been considered timely and, as a result, defendant’s motion to confirm should have been granted.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'Rule 5(a) of the Superior Court Rules Governing Arbitration of Civil Actions provides that “[a]ny party * * * who is dissatisfied with an arbitrator’s award may have a trial as of right upon filing a written rejection of the award * * * within thirty (30) days after the arbitrator’s award has been filed[.]” If the dissatisfied party fails to file a written rejection of the award within the thirty day statutory period, the prevailing party “may apply to the court for an order confirming the award, and thereupon the court must grant the order confirming the award unless the award is vacated, modified or corrected[.]” General Laws 1956 § 10-3-11. It is worth highlighting that a motion to confirm an arbitration award in court-annexed arbitration may be brought only if a motion to reject the award has not been filed within the thirty day statutory period.', 'We must determine, therefore, whether defendant’s motion to confirm the arbitrator’s award became ripe as a result of plaintiff’s failure to correct his initially deficient motion to reject the award within the statutory period. Before we reach this question, however, we must determine the correct standard by which to consider plaintiff’s corrected rejection of the arbitrator’s award. Moreover, because of the novelty of the issue, we also take the opportunity to address the circumstances under which the appropriate office of the Superior Court may reject a', '-3- filing submitted through the electronic filing system.', 'A', 'The Initial Rejection', 'Although the issue was not raised by the litigants, we take the liberty to address the instances when an electronically submitted filing may be rejected either by the Superior Court clerk’s office or the Superior Court Arbitration Office. We note, however, that, because neither party has challenged the procedures employed by the Superior Court Arbitration Office in this case, we do not base our decision in this case on that issue. See State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 (R.I. 2011) (“It is well-settled that this Court will not review issues that were not presented to the trial court ‘in such a posture as to alert the trial justice to the question being raised.’”) (quoting Pollard v. Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429, 433 (R.I. 2005)).', 'The Superior Court implemented mandatory electronic filing in November 2014. See Super. R. Civ. P. 86. In connection with that implementation, this Court adopted Article X of the Supreme Court Rules, Governing Electronic Filing (the Electronic Filing Rules).', 'Shortly thereafter, the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and the Superior Court Rules Governing Arbitration of Civil Actions (the Arbitration Rules) were amended to address the proper procedure for litigants to follow when submitting filings using that system.', 'The amended rules specify the process for the appropriate office of the Superior Court to review those filings for compliance with the electronic filing procedures. Rule 1(b)(4) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 1(f)(3) of the Arbitration Rules, and Rule 5(c) of the Electronic Filing Rules all provide, with some inconsequential variation in language, 1 that 1', 'Bracketed language in this quotation appears in the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and the Arbitration Rules, but not in the Electronic Filing Rules. The remaining language is identical across all three rules.', '-4- “Upon acceptance, the submitted document[(s)] shall be entered into the docket of the case and the docket shall reflect the date and time of filing as set forth in [Art. X,] Rule 5(b) [of the Rhode Island Supreme Court Rules Governing Electronic Filing].” 2', 'An electronically submitted document may be rejected, however, only for the grounds specifically enumerated in the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and the Arbitration Rules, depending on the nature of the case. If a document is rejected, Rule 5(c) of the Electronic Filing Rules provides that “a rejection notice shall be sent to the filing party and the document shall not be docketed.” 3', 'Of particular note in this case, the grounds for rejecting a filing in general civil cases are far more extensive than the grounds for rejecting a filing in arbitration cases. Pursuant to Rule 1(b)(4) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, there are seventeen grounds for rejecting an electronically submitted document in general civil cases:', '“(A) Pleadings filed without a conventional signature where', 'required;', '“(B) Pleadings filed without the required documents as set forth in', 'the Superior Court’s Electronic Filing System Guidelines;', '“(C) Pleadings not filed in accordance with Rule 1(b)(3);', '“(D) Discovery requests and responses not filed in accordance with 2', 'Article X, Rule 5(b) of the Electronic Filing Rules provides:', '“A document will be deemed to have been filed and/or served on', 'the date and time when it is submitted to the [electronic filing', 'system], regardless of whether the court is open for business at the', 'time of submission.

Rule 1(b)(4) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure refers to Rule 5(c) of the Electronic Filing Rules as governing rejected filings.', '-5-', 'Rule 5(d);', '“(E) Documents, including any required documents, attachments,', 'or exhibits, scanned in the wrong orientation, e.g., upside down or', 'backwards;', '“(F) Documents scanned and filed that are unreadable or illegible;', '“(G) Documents filed in a fillable portable document format', '(PDF);', '“(H) Fees not paid on requested executions and citations;', '“(I) The document filed does not match the selected filing code', 'type;', '“(J) The document is filed into the wrong case;', '“(K) The document contains the wrong or incomplete case caption;', '“(L) The document is filed with no case identification;', '“(M) The document was improperly scanned or uploaded;', '“(N) The party name, party address, or document name exceeds the', 'number of allotted characters in the EFS;', '“(O) The filer added a party or participant that is not configured in', 'the CMS [Case Management System] or does not match the', 'information in the case;', '“(P) A payment processing error occurred; and/or', '“(Q) A technical submission error occurred.” In contrast, the grounds for rejecting an electronically submitted document in arbitration cases are more circumscribed. Rule 1(f)(3) of the Arbitration Rules provides, in pertinent part:', '“In accordance with Art. X, Rule 5(c), grounds for the rejection of', 'a document submitted to the [electronic filing system] for', 'arbitration cases in the Superior Court are limited in scope as', 'follows:', '“(A) Documents filed without a signature where required; and', '-6-', '“(B) Documents not filed in accordance with Rule 1(f)(2).”', 'In this case, as part of the process of submitting a document using the electronic filing system, plaintiff was required to select a “filing code” to identify the type of filing he was submitting. The code he selected determined, among other things, the fee that plaintiff would be required to pay for the filing. Unfortunately, plaintiff selected an incorrect code for the filing of his rejection of the arbitration award. Had this not been an arbitration case, Rule 1(b)(4)(I) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure would have provided the Superior Court clerk’s office with grounds for rejecting plaintiff’s filing. However, the case before us does indeed concern court-annexed arbitration, and it is therefore properly governed by Rule 1(f)(3) of the Arbitration Rules. That rule allows an electronic filing in an arbitration case to be rejected only if the document lacks a required signature or if the document was not filed in the proper format as required by Rule 1(f)(2) of the Arbitration Rules. 4 Accordingly, the use of an improper code when submitting an electronic filing in an arbitration case is not a sufficient ground for rejecting a filing. Thus, plaintiff’s rejection of the arbitration award should not have been declined by the Superior Court Arbitration Office. That said, as we noted above, plaintiff did not challenge the review procedures employed by the Arbitration Office in this case, and we cannot, therefore, fault the hearing justice for failing to rule on an issue that was not brought to his attention.', 'B', 'The Applicable Standard for Corrected Electronic Filings', 'Because plaintiff did not challenge the review procedures for his rejected filing, we turn 4', 'Although Rule 1(f)(3) of the Arbitration Rules provides that “Documents not filed in accordance with Rule 1(f)(2)” may be rejected, and Rule 1(f)(2) refers litigants to the Superior Court’s Electronic Filing System Guidelines for “specific requirements,” we do not believe the guidelines provide independent grounds for rejecting an electronically submitted filing. The guidelines are meant instead to be a roadmap for litigants to follow when navigating the complex and potentially confusing roadways of the Superior Court’s electronic filing system.', '-7- to the issues that have been raised in defendant’s appeal—whether the hearing justice erred when he allowed plaintiff to correct his rejected filing after the period for rejecting an arbitration award had expired. The parties have articulated the issue before us as one of excusable neglect— namely, whether plaintiff should have been permitted to reject an arbitrator’s award out of time pursuant to Rule 6(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure because his failure to timely correct his initially deficient filing was occasioned by excusable neglect. However, it is our opinion that Rule 6(b) is inapplicable to the procedural posture before us, and it was not the basis for the hearing justice’s ruling below.', 'Under the provisions of Rule 6(b), a justice of the Superior Court has discretion to grant a party’s motion to file out of time “where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect[.]”5 See Boranian v. Richer, 983 A.2d 834, 837-38 (R.I. 2009). However, unlike the typical case governed by Rule 6(b), in which a party fails to act at all during the applicable period, plaintiff in this case did attempt to file a timely rejection within the thirty day statutory period. 6 As discussed supra, however, that filing was disallowed by the Superior Court Arbitration Office— incorrectly, in our opinion—because plaintiff did not enter the proper code when submitting his 5', '“Excusable neglect” has been defined by this Court as:', '“A failure to take the proper steps at the proper time, not in', 'consequence of the party’s own carelessness, inattention, or willful', 'disregard of the process of the court, but in consequence of some', 'unexpected or unavoidable hindrance or accident, or reliance on', 'the care and vigilance of his counsel or on promises made by the', 'adverse party.” Pleasant Management, LLC v. Carrasco, 960 A.2d', '216, 224-25 (R.I. 2008) (brackets omitted) (quoting Jacksonbay', 'Builders, Inc. v. Azarmi, 869 A.2d 580, 584 (R.I. 2005)). 6', 'It is beyond debate that “a motion to reject an arbitrator’s award out of time is governed by Rule 6(b)” of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Boranian v. Richer, 983 A.2d 834, 837 (R.I. 2009). However, we are not concerned with the rejection of an arbitrator’s award out of time because plaintiff did in fact file within the statutory period. It was only his attempt to correct that timely, albeit initially deficient, filing that fell outside the statutory period.', '-8- filing through the Superior Court’s electronic filing system.', 'Rule 5(c) of the Electronic Filing Rules provides, in pertinent part:', '“If a document is filed which does not conform to the rules of the', 'court in which it is filed, a rejection notice shall be sent to the', 'filing party and the document shall not be docketed. * * * A', 'rejected filing shall be promptly corrected and resubmitted and', 'shall be deemed to have been submitted and filed on the initial', 'filing date for purposes of any statutory or rule-based deadline.”', '(Emphasis added.) Unlike Rule 6(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, which gives a court discretion to allow a party to comply out of time when nothing has been filed during the statutory period, if the failure to timely file was a result of excusable neglect, Rule 5(c) of the Electronic Filing Rules directs that a corrected filing relates back to the date of an original timely filing if that timely filing was rejected because it did not conform to the Electronic Filing Rules. However, this relaxation of the rule is contingent on the requirement that the corrected filing be made “promptly.” 7 Notably absent from the text of Rule 5(c) is any mandate that the initial deficiency, or any delay in making a correction, be the result of “excusable neglect.” We decline, therefore, to engraft an excusable neglect standard onto the text of Rule 5(c). 8', 'Therefore, when a party, such as plaintiff in this case, timely files a document using the 7', 'The “initial filing date” referred to in Rule 5(c) is determined by Rule 5(b), which provides that “[a] document will be deemed to have been filed and/or served on the date and time when it is submitted to the [electronic filing system.]” However, when a document is rejected, Rule 5(c) provides that “the document shall not be docketed” unless the document is “promptly corrected and resubmitted[.]” Rule 5(c) makes it clear that a corrected filing is “deemed to have been submitted and filed on the initial filing date” only if the correction is made “promptly.” 8', 'We note that the hearing justice did not make a finding with respect to excusable neglect, nor did he explicitly rule on plaintiff’s “O[b]jection to Defendant’s Acceptance of Arbitration Award and/or Plaintiff’s’ [sic] Motion to Accept His Rejection of the Arbitrator’s Award Out of Time Pursuant to Superior Court Rule 6(b).” He confined his ruling to denying defendant’s motion to confirm the award, and ruled only “that the plaintiff’s counsel, within the spirit of Rule 5(c) [of the Electronic Filing Rules], made every attempt to not only make the Court aware of the rejection but to try to correct it[.]”', '-9- electronic filing system, which document does not conform to the rules of the court, and then later corrects the rejected document after the statutory period expires, the proper inquiry is whether that correction was made “promptly.”', 'Although the rule does not provide guidance as to what constitutes a prompt filing, it is our opinion that such a determination may vary with the circumstances of each case, and that that decision should rest within the sound discretion of the trial justice. If the trial justice rules, in his or her discretion, that the correction was in fact made “promptly,” then the corrected filing “shall be deemed to have been submitted and filed on the initial filing date” and thus shall be considered timely. Our review is therefore limited to whether the trial justice acted within the bounds of his discretion when he considered the corrected rejection of the arbitration award to have been timely filed.', 'C', 'Application', 'This Court is aware that the mandated transition to electronic filing has, not surprisingly, resulted in a sea change in the practice of law that has required parties and their attorneys to adapt to an unfamiliar method of filing pleadings and otherwise interacting with the courts of this state. It is this Court’s opinion that, when a litigant makes a good faith attempt to submit a timely filing, some leeway should be allowed for minor errors that cause those good faith attempts to be rejected. Rule 5(c) thus requires only that litigants, upon notice of an infirmity in a good faith timely filing, “promptly” make the necessary corrections.', 'Therefore, in the case before us, we place our focus on whether the correction that was made could fairly be categorized as prompt by the trial justice. The plaintiff submitted his written rejection of the arbitration award via the electronic filing system on February 15, 2018,', '- 10 - and the Superior Court Arbitration Office notified plaintiff of the deficiency in that filing later that very same day. The plaintiff represented to the trial justice that he had telephoned the office of the clerk of the Superior Court and that he had left a message informing the clerk that his filing had been rejected. He argued to the trial justice that he reasonably believed that the clerk would correct the filing, and that he had learned that his filing had not been corrected by the clerk only after he received defendant’s motion to confirm the arbitrator’s award. It was then— some twenty-eight days after plaintiff received notice that his filing had been rejected, and six days after the statutory period for filing a written rejection of an arbitration award had expired— that plaintiff filed a properly coded rejection.', 'When the trial justice met with the parties on April 6, 2018, to consider defendant’s motion to confirm the arbitration award and plaintiff’s objection thereto, it was his duty to decide whether plaintiff’s efforts to correct his filing had been made, in the phraseology of Rule 5(c), “promptly.” The trial justice accepted plaintiff’s representation that he had left a message with the clerk’s office and that he believed, even if incorrectly, that the clerk’s office would correct his deficient filing internally. Moreover, during the hearing in question, the trial justice asked defendant to define “promptly” as that term is used in Rule 5(c), and, although the trial justice did not later use that term explicitly in his ruling, it is our opinion that he implicitly made a finding that plaintiff had acted promptly. 9 At the very least, it is clear that the hearing justice had Rule 5(c) in mind when he ruled that “plaintiff’s counsel, within the spirit of Rule 5(c), made every attempt to not only make the Court aware of the rejection but to try to correct it[.]”', 'As we have stated supra, that decision fell within the sound discretion of the trial justice. 9', 'The defendant offered this definition of “promptly” to the hearing justice: “Within the timeframe set forth in the rules as to when to file a notice of rejection.” We can find no textual basis for this limitation, and the hearing justice was correct not to adopt it.', '- 11 - It is our function in this case to determine, not whether there was excusable neglect, but whether the trial justice properly exercised his discretion when he determined, under all the attendant circumstances, that the corrected filing was prompt. It is our opinion, after giving due deference to the decision of the trial justice, that he ruled squarely within the bounds of his considerable discretion. Thus, we affirm the order of the trial justice. 10', 'We pause to note that we are aware of the difficulties that the change to electronic filing has brought to practitioners. We have no doubt that the trial justice showed some leniency in this case due to the relative newness of the electronic filing system. We certainly do not disagree with him. On the other hand, we note that the electronic filing system has been in place in the Superior Court since November 2014, that all members of the bar must learn to employ the system effectively, and that the days of leniency must soon come to an end. See Super. R. Civ. P. 86.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court. The papers in this case shall be returned to the Superior Court. 10', 'The defendant also argues that, there being no motion before the trial court for a change in venue, it was error for the hearing justice to move the case to Providence County. This argument was not raised before the hearing justice, and was therefore not properly preserved for our review. See Atryzek v. State, 197 A.3d 334, 337 (R.I. 2018) (“Over the course of decades, we have made it abundantly clear that ‘a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.’”) (quoting State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 829 (R.I. 2008)).', '- 12 -', 'Justice Goldberg, with whom Chief Justice Suttell joins, dissenting in part and concurring in the result. Although I concur in the result in this case, I reach that conclusion on different grounds and am of the opinion that the decision of the majority is incorrect. Consequently, I dissent.', 'The Electronic Filing System and the Timeliness of Court Filings', 'When this Court undertook the development and implementation of an electronic filing system for the entire judiciary, the bench and the bar entered a new era with respect to litigation practices in our courts. Some of us―but not everyone―may view this effort as a brave new world. Gone are the days when an attorney can appear at the clerk’s office and hand a document to a clerk in order to avoid a looming time bar in a case. Instead, electronic filing of all documents is mandatory (except for a limited class of individuals). This endeavor necessitated the adoption and promulgation of new electronic filing rules in every court, with a staggered implementation schedule.', 'This was a monumental achievement after significant effort by professional staff in every court. A conversion of this magnitude will give rise to growing pains and a need for some flesh on the bones of this electronic skeleton. The fact that the members of this Court disagree on the meaning of the terms set forth in Article X, Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules Governing Electronic Filing—which we promulgated—is emblematic of the complexity of this task.', 'The Supreme Court Rules Governing Electronic Filing provide that the Electronic Filing System (EFS) is a twenty-four/seven service that accepts filings twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week.', '“A document will be deemed to have been filed and/or served on the date and time when it is submitted to the EFS * * * [and] will be considered to have been timely filed when submitted at any time up to 11:59 p.m. on a filing deadline day.” Art. X, Rule 5(b) of the', '- 13 - Supreme Court Rules. In my opinion, this is an overarching component of this electronic frontier.', 'The bench and the bar must have confidence that this Court’s Rules Governing Electronic Filing have not altered any statutes of limitations or other rule-based deadlines.', 'The majority, in my opinion, has got it wrong, and its interpretation of the Rule strays far afield from our judicial task. For purposes of the statute of limitations, the timeliness of a notice of appeal, a petition for writ of certiorari, and, as in this case, the rejection of an arbitration award, the date the document is filed in the EFS is the controlling date and never changes; exactly as the law stood before we adopted these Rules, when we looked to the date-stamp affixed by the clerk to a paper filing. Whether or not the filing is subsequently rejected for clerical error and not docketed should have no bearing on the timeliness of the filing. In my opinion, a document that is timely filed does not lose its status because a clerk rejects the filing and the document is not docketed. As will be discussed infra, the majority conflates the terms “filing” and “docketed.” These terms are not synonymous. Filing and docketing are separate and distinct events in the EFS.', 'Understandably, the EFS requires that, in order to be docketed, documents must conform to the technical requirements of the EFS, including the mandate that a filing must be in a searchable format that is self-contained (for instance, with no hyperlinks to external websites). There are user guides to assist one in this task. Every filing is subject to a timely review by the court in which it was filed and the court “shall notify the filing party as to whether the filing is accepted or rejected.” Art. X, Rule 5(c) of the Supreme Court Rules. In the happy circumstance that the document is accepted, it will be docketed and “the docket shall reflect the date and time of filing as set forth in Rule 5(b).” Id. However, if the document is filed and does not conform to the filing requirements of the EFS—which may or may not be the responsibility of a paralegal', '- 14 - or staff assistant—“a rejection notice shall be sent to the filing party and the document shall not be docketed.” Id. (emphasis added). The rules do not define the word “docketed,” but it is textually manifest that “docketed” does not mean “filing.” The clerical task of docketing a filing in any court in the unified judiciary does not, nor can it, impact the timeliness of the filing. Otherwise, we would have created rules with floating and indefinite statutes of limitations, which is far in excess of our jurisprudence.', 'The rules 1 that are relevant to this discussion are set forth as follows:', 'Supreme Court Rules – Rules Governing Electronic Filing', 'Article X, Rule 5', '“[Rule 5](b) Time of filing.

There are no contingencies in these rules. The date the document is filed in the EFS—whether it is docketed or not—is the date that the document is deemed to have been filed. For purposes of time computation, the date the filing is docketed is not relevant and cannot impact the statute of limitations.', 'A timely filing does not become untimely. Words have meaning. Docketing does not mean filing in the context of the EFS, but when a rejection notice is sent to the filing party, something must be done in order for a rejected document to conform to the technical requirements of the EFS and be docketed. To be sure, this is an important mandate that must be honored by every user and the filing must be promptly corrected.', 'The rules and guidelines contain a plethora of requirements, several of which (including in this case) relate to collecting the correct fee. It is equally clear that a technical error does not change the filing date. “A document will be deemed to have been filed and/or served on the date and time when it is submitted to the EFS, regardless of whether the court is open for business at the time of submission,” Art. X, Rule 5(b) of the Supreme Court Rules; and regardless of', '- 17 - whether “a rejection notice shall be sent to the filing party and the document shall not be docketed.” Art. X, Rule 5(c) of the Supreme Court Rules. Although it has no bearing on the timeliness of the filing, what occurs after a filing is rejected, including the duties of the court and counsel, are critical to the efficient operation of the EFS.', 'Article X, Rule 5(c), “Clerk Review; Acceptance/Rejection Procedure,” 2 is multifaceted and, as it is entitled, sets forth the circumstances under which a filing is accepted and “docketed,” or rejected and therefore not “docketed.” If the document is rejected, the rejection notice:', '1. “shall identify the basis for the rejection in accordance with the', 'rules of the court”;', '2. “shall be promptly corrected and resubmitted; and”', '3. “shall be deemed to have been submitted and filed on the initial', 'filing date for purposes of any statutory or rule-based deadline.”', 'The term “prompt” means “performed without delay.” The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1450 (3rd ed. 1996). Therefore, a rejected filing should be corrected without delay. Rule 5(c) does not set forth any consequences for the failure to correct a rejected filing—whether negligent or deliberate; whether prompt or not.', 'In the absence of specific sanctions in the Rules Governing Electronic Filing for the failure to “promptly” correct a rejected filing, reference to the rules of procedure governing a party’s failure to comply with a court directive is helpful. Although Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure is not directly applicable to a failure to promptly correct a rejected filing, it may be used by analogy to guide judicial officers in an appropriate case. See 2', 'I note that this Court included two undefined temporal terms in Rule 5(c): “the court shall timely review the electronically filed document” and “[a] rejected filing shall be promptly corrected[.]” (Emphasis added.) This lack of clarity is emblematic of the complexity of our task and the need to preserve the trust and confidence of the bar.', '- 18 - Manning v. Bellafiore, 139 A.3d 505, 516 (R.I. 2016). Sanctions contained in the discovery rules also are relevant. The available sanctions, imposed by a judicial officer, can range from contempt for deliberate misconduct—especially if the delay is intended to mislead the Court in a material matter—to lesser sanctions, such as costs or attorneys’ fees, similar to those available for discovery violations. Certainly, in the face of deliberate misconduct, a trial justice is free to order the dismissal of the claim or defense. Lett v. Providence Journal Company, 798 A.2d 355, 363-64 (R.I. 2002). A judicially-imposed sanction may be implemented in order to provide an appropriate remedy for the act or omission in a particular case and to deter its repetition. Manning, 139 A.3d at 516. However, no judicial officer is vested with any authority to amend legislatively-enacted statutes of limitations.', 'The Case Before the Court', 'Turning to the majority opinion, the majority declares that “a corrected filing relates back to the date of an original timely filing[.]” (Emphasis in original.) This is incorrect. The rule does not contain a relation-back component and this Court did not engraft the relation-back doctrine onto these rules. See Super. R. Civ. P. 15(c) (“Whenever the claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment relates back to the date of the original pleading.”). The majority also declares that this relation-back element “is contingent on the requirement that the corrected filing be made ‘promptly.’” (Emphasis added.) The law surrounding statutes of limitations and other statutory and rule-based deadlines, including the relation-back doctrine, is not contingent, nor is it a moving target or a trap for the unwary. According to the majority, “Rule 5(c) makes it clear that a corrected filing is ‘deemed to have been submitted and filed on the initial filing date’ only if the correction is made ‘promptly.’”', '- 19 - (Emphasis added.) This is alarming. Judicial compliance with statutes of limitations and rule- based time periods is not contingent upon whether a document that was timely filed but rejected by the court is promptly corrected. Otherwise, the enactments of the General Assembly would be subject to judicial amendment.', 'The majority erroneously equates the term “filing date” with that of “docketed.” These terms are not synonymous. Black’s Law Dictionary has defined the phrase, “Filing with [the] court” as the “Delivery of [a] legal document to [the] clerk of court or other proper officer with intent that it be filed with [the] court.” Black’s Law Dictionary 628 (6th ed. 1990) (emphasis added); see also Black’s Law Dictionary 745 (10th ed. 2014) (defining “file” as “to deliver a legal document to the court clerk or record custodian for placement into the official record”). The term “docket” on the other hand, is defined by Black’s Law Dictionary as “[a] formal record in which a judge or court clerk briefly notes all the proceedings and filings in a court case[.]” Black’s Law Dictionary 584-85 (10th ed. 2014). Under these definitions, our own rules, and this Court’s caselaw, it is clear that the term “docketed” does not mean “filed.” A brief survey of our rules and caselaw reveals that this Court has never conflated these terms.', 'The “Public Access Portal” is defined in the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure as:', '“The point of entry for electronic access to case information from', 'the Judiciary’s database whether at the courthouse or remotely.', 'The database is an electronic collection of court records displayed', 'as a register of actions or docket sheet.

In the early hours of July 19, 2014, a gathering of young adults hanging out at 69 River Avenue in Providence came to an abrupt end when gunshots killed one of the guests, Ty-Shon Perry. After a three-week jury trial, the defendant, Justice Andrade, was convicted of first-degree murder by use of a firearm he was not licensed to carry. The defendant was ultimately sentenced to serve two consecutive terms of life in prison, as well as a consecutive ten-year sentence.', 'In this direct appeal, defendant asks us to consider four issues. First, defendant challenges the admission of the statements he gave to the police when he voluntarily turned himself in to their custody a few days after Perry was killed. Second, defendant asserts that his constitutional right to counsel was violated because his trial counsel maintained an actual conflict of interest throughout her representation of him. Third, defendant challenges the admission of testimonial and photographic evidence suggesting his affiliation with known Providence gangs. Fourth, defendant challenges specific portions of the instructions given to the jurors prior to their deliberation as well as the trial justice’s decision not to include two specific instructions defendant had requested.', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'A', 'The Shooting', 'Throughout the afternoon and evening of July 18, 2014, about a dozen young adults were hanging out at and around 69 River Avenue in Providence. In the moments before the gunshots started, Perry was standing next to an open front passenger door of a car parked on Allston Street— one house down from 69 River—talking to one of his cousins, LaShae Cornwell, and her friends, who were all sitting in the car.1 Cornwell testified at trial that, while Perry was talking to her through the open car door, she noticed someone in a white T-shirt peeking out from behind a “good-sized” tree across the street and about two houses down. Despite the late hour and darkness, she stated that she had no trouble seeing that individual because of the light emanating from the street lights. Cornwell testified that she then saw this person step out from behind the tree towards the car she was sitting in and start shooting. Cornwell saw the person’s face, the gun in his hand, and that he was wearing black basketball shorts. Cornwell saw Perry run from the car before she ducked down until she “stopped hearing the shots.” When the shooting was over, she went inside the house at 69 River and saw Perry on the kitchen floor, bleeding. Cornwell identified defendant as the shooter to the police who responded to the scene; she knew defendant because she previously had resided a couple of houses away from him. Although she had not seen him in a couple of years, she was sure defendant was the person who had fired the gun from the area near the tree. 1', 'Although none of the witnesses testified to the precise time of the shooting, one of the witnesses indicated that the shooting occurred after midnight and one of the detectives who responded to the scene testified that he received the call to respond to 69 River Avenue just after 2 a.m.', '-2-', 'Several other young adults who either lived at 69 River Avenue or had been hanging out there that evening and late into the night also testified at trial. Some of these witnesses testified about their affiliation with groups or gangs. None of these witnesses identified the shooter, but some of them heard “Yo, Sheid” from the direction of the shooting immediately before the gunshots started. Rasheid Lebron, one of the young adults outside 69 River at the time of the shooting, testified that his nickname is “Sheid” but he had not heard his name called out in the moments before the shooting started. He did, however, testify that he returned fire at the direction of the shooter. Another witness also saw the initial shooting come from the direction of a tree and saw the shooter run down Allston Street, away from River Avenue, and get into a white car which then sped away.', 'Scott Bun, who lived one block away from 69 River Avenue on the corner of Robin and Allston Streets and had no affiliation to the young adults gathered at 69 River, testified that he had spent July 18 fishing and arrived home between 11:30 p.m. and midnight. Sometime later, he left his house to walk his dog and noticed a white car parked on the corner of Robin and Allston close to the stop sign at the corner. As he was walking down Allston, away from River, he heard gunshots, turned, saw a flash, then watched a black male in a white T-shirt and black basketball shorts run towards the white car, jump into the driver’s side, and drive away fast. Bun stated that the car made a rattling noise, “like there was a big hole in the muffler.”', 'Detectives from the Providence Police Department quickly narrowed in on defendant as the suspected shooter because Cornwell identified him as the shooter and their investigation revealed that he had driven his girlfriend’s white car that evening while she worked a shift at Burger King and that her car had a loud, rattling muffler. On July 19, an arrest warrant was drawn for defendant. The defendant turned himself in to the Providence police station on July 21, 2014,', '-3- after he saw his picture on a news broadcast stating that he was wanted as a suspect in a murder investigation. An attorney he had hired the evening before met him at the station. After speaking privately with the attorney—whom he met for the first time upon arriving at the police station— for five minutes, defendant waived his Miranda rights and agreed to speak with Detective Stephen Sullivan. During his interrogation, defendant provided an alibi that he later admitted was not truthful.', 'On October 17, 2014, a grand jury returned a three-count indictment alleging defendant murdered Perry using a firearm that he was not licensed to carry, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11- 23-1, 11-47-3.2(b)(4), and 11-47-8(a).', 'B', 'Pretrial Motions', 'The defendant filed a motion to suppress the statements he made to the police during the recorded interrogation on the day he turned himself in to the custody of the Providence Police Department. The defendant argued—through new counsel—that these statements were made after an involuntary and unintelligent waiver of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights because the attorney he had retained to represent him at the police station provided ineffective assistance during the interrogation. At the hearing on defendant’s motion, the trial justice heard testimony from defendant, the attorney who had represented him on July 21, 2014 at the police station, and from a criminal defense attorney who testified as an expert about representing criminal defendants. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion to suppress in a bench decision rendered the same day as the hearing.', 'The defendant also filed a motion in limine requesting that the trial justice exclude testimony about gang affiliation and photographs of defendant in which defendant and the other', '-4- young men depicted were allegedly making gang hand signals. The trial justice considered this motion—along with other motions in limine—at a hearing he held over two days immediately preceding the trial. At the end of the hearing, the trial justice denied defendant’s request to categorically exclude all evidence of gang affiliation and activity, but he promised to provide a cautionary instruction to the jury about the context in which it could consider this evidence.', 'C', 'The Trial', 'Over the course of three weeks in January 2017, a jury heard testimony from several individuals who had been present at the gathering on July 19, 2014, several members of law enforcement regarding the investigation that followed the shooting, and several witnesses who served time with defendant at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI). On January 25, 2017, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all three charges in the indictment: first-degree murder, discharging a firearm during the commission of the murder, and carrying a pistol without a license. The judgment of conviction entered on April 11, 2017, sentencing defendant to serve life in prison for the first-degree murder conviction, a consecutive term of life imprisonment for the firearm- discharge-in-the-commission-of-a-crime-of-violence conviction, and a consecutive term of ten years, three to serve and seven suspended, with probation, for carrying a firearm without a license or permit. The defendant timely appealed.', '-5-', 'II', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Motion to Suppress Statements to Police', 'The defendant asserts that the trial justice erred by denying his pretrial motion to suppress the statements he made to the police on July 21, 2014.', '1', 'First Interrogation', 'At the hearing on his motion to suppress, defendant testified that, after he had seen a news broadcast stating that the police were looking for him in connection with a murder investigation, he spoke with an attorney on the evening of July 20, 2014. Over the phone, defendant told the attorney that he had been at a friend’s house at 10 p.m. on July 18 and then picked up his girlfriend at Burger King at 2 a.m. The defendant and the attorney made plans to meet at the police station the next morning. When defendant arrived at the police station the next day, a detective placed handcuffs on defendant and transported him to an interview room, where he spoke with the attorney alone for approximately five minutes. The defendant testified that the attorney told him to tell the police what defendant had told the attorney about his whereabouts on July 18 into the early hours of July 19. According to defendant, it was his understanding from their conversation that he would give a statement to the police and then the attorney would get bail for him two weeks later; the promise of bail was the reason defendant agreed to give the statement.', 'When the attorney testified, he stated that he had spoken with defendant at least twice on the phone before meeting him at the police station on July 21. The attorney testified that he told defendant that he did not have any information from the police about the investigation and could', '-6- not therefore advise him about whether to give a statement to the police, but that defendant had been adamant with his alibi and that he had not been the shooter. The attorney further testified that he also told defendant that the police would be checking out the alibi from start to finish, using phone records, video-surveillance cameras, and a conversation with the friend with whom defendant claimed to have spent the hours in question. The attorney stated that he had not conducted his own investigation into defendant’s alibi.', 'At the end of the suppression hearing, defendant argued that, notwithstanding the waiver of his Miranda rights before the first interrogation began, the ineffective assistance he received from his attorney while at the police station resulted in involuntary statements to the police and a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. According to defendant, the attorney should have taken the time to verify the information defendant had told him about defendant’s whereabouts between 10 p.m. on July 18, 2014 and 2 a.m. on July 19, 2014 and that he should have advised him not to provide any statement to the police. The defendant contended that he was not given accurate advice or counseling by the attorney at the police station.', 'The trial justice denied the motion, concluding that defendant was not entitled to the Sixth Amendment’s right to effective assistance of counsel during a custodial interrogation prior to the filing of official charges against him. He also found that the attorney at the police station had provided all of the advice to defendant he could, but defendant was clearly adamant about telling the police he had been at his friend’s house from 10 p.m. to 2 a.m.', 'We ordinarily engage in a two-step analysis to review a trial justice’s decision on a motion to suppress a statement on the basis that it was not voluntarily given. State v. Bojang, 138 A.3d 171, 178 (R.I. 2016). First, we review the trial justice’s findings that are relevant to the facts around the circumstances and setting in which the statement was made. Id. We accept the findings', '-7- of fact unless we determine that the findings are clearly erroneous. Id. If we accept the findings of fact, then we apply them to a de novo review of the trial justice’s determination of the voluntariness of the statement. Id. Ultimately, we will not overturn a trial justice’s ruling on a motion to suppress until our independent review of the conclusions establishes that the defendant’s constitutional rights were denied. Id.', 'The procedural posture in this case is a little different, however. The trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion to suppress was based primarily on his conclusion of law that defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel had not yet attached because the custodial interrogation occurred before formal charges had been filed against defendant. This issue presents a pure question of law; therefore we review it de novo. See State v. Cahill, 196 A.3d 744, 756 (R.I. 2018).', 'There is no doubt that “the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 686 (1984) (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 n.14 (1970); Page v. State, 995 A.2d 934, 938 n.7 (R.I. 2010) (same). “[A] person’s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated * * *.” Kirby v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 688 (1972). In Rhode Island, “the starting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice [is] a formal charge”; “a formal accusation of a felony offense must be by way of indictment by a grand jury or by information of the Attorney General.” State v. Greenberg, 951 A.2d 481, 495 (R.I. 2008) (brackets omitted) (first quoting Kirby, 406 U.S. at 689, then quoting State v. Jennings, 944 A.2d 171, 174 (R.I. 2008)).2 At that time, “the accused has been informed of a formal 2', 'As the United States Supreme Court explained a few decades ago:', '-8- accusation against him and restrictions are imposed on his liberty.” State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299, 308 (R.I. 2008) (citing Rothgery v. Gillespie County, Texas, 554 U.S. 191, 194 (2008)). The stage of an investigation when a suspect is “arrested and subjected to interrogation * * * is not considered to be a formal adversarial proceeding,” so statements made during the interrogation cannot be “obtained in violation of [the] Sixth Amendment right to counsel.” State v. Baton, 488 A.2d 696, 703 (R.I. 1985). The statements defendant sought to have suppressed were made before his Sixth Amendment right to counsel attached, therefore his argument regarding his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel lacks merit.', 'We also note that defendant predicates his Sixth Amendment argument on Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478 (1964). In Escobedo, the United States Supreme Court found a violation of a Sixth Amendment right to counsel when the police questioned an uncharged suspect without warning him of his right to remain silent. Escobedo, 378 U.S. at 490-91.', 'The rationale undergirding Escobedo in the context of custodial interrogations, however, was largely supplanted by the Fifth Amendment analysis enunciated by the Supreme Court in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966). See Miranda, 384 U.S. at 465-66; see also Kirby, 406 U.S. at 689. Moreover, in Kirby, the Supreme Court drew a distinction with Escobedo, noting that “the Court in retrospect', '“The initiation of judicial criminal proceedings is far from a mere', 'formalism. It is the starting point of our whole system of adversary', 'criminal justice. For it is only then that the government has', 'committed itself to prosecute, and only then that the adverse', 'positions of government and defendant have solidified. It is then', 'that a defendant finds himself faced with the prosecutorial forces of', 'organized society, and immersed in the intricacies of substantive and', 'procedural criminal law. It is this point, therefore, that marks the', 'commencement of the ‘criminal prosecutions’ to which alone the', 'explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable.” Kirby', 'v. Illinois, 406 U.S. 682, 689-90 (1972).', '-9- perceived that the ‘prime purpose’ of Escobedo was not to vindicate the constitutional right to counsel as such, but, like Miranda, ‘to guarantee full effectuation of the privilege against self- incrimination.’” Kirby, 406 U.S. at 689 (deletion omitted) (quoting Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 729 (1966)).', 'As the trial justice in the present case cogently observed: ‘“The sole concern of the Fifth Amendment, on which Miranda was based, is governmental coercion.’ The suspect is entitled to counsel in order to prevent the police from coercing a statement and not to prevent a defendant from speaking voluntarily. In other words, the purpose of counsel is to ensure that there is no overreaching or compulsion by the inquiring officers.” (Quoting Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 170 (1986)). The Supreme Court has also been clear that courts are not expected to be able to “divine a defendant’s motivation for speaking or acting as he did even though there [has been] no claim that governmental conduct coerced his decision.” Connelly, 479 U.S. at 165-66.', 'In the case under review, defendant voluntarily presented himself at the police station, where he met his attorney and spoke with him for five minutes outside the presence of any law enforcement agent. The defendant acknowledged that he had been “Miranda’d” and that he did not have any difficulty understanding what that meant. As the Supreme Court noted in Connelly, one of the underlying purposes of the exclusionary rule is to “substantially deter future violations of the Constitution.” Connelly, 479 U.S. at 166. Here, defendant’s Fifth Amendment rights were not violated and suppression of the statements he made during the first interrogation would not effectuate this purpose of the exclusionary rule. Therefore, the trial justice did not err by denying defendant’s motion to suppress the statements from the first interrogation.', '- 10 -', '2', 'Second Interrogation', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice should have suppressed the statements he made in the second recorded interrogation on July 21, 2014.', 'A few hours after the first interrogation—and after defendant’s attorney had left the police station—Det. Sullivan initiated another conversation with defendant.', 'The statements defendant made during this second interrogation were not explicitly identified as part of the motion to suppress, and defendant did not raise any specific objection to the admission of these statements during Det. Sullivan’s trial testimony. In fact, the trial transcript indicates that defendant’s trial counsel wanted the transcript of the second interrogation to be entered into evidence if the first transcript was entered over her objection.', '“The raise-or-waive rule imposes upon litigants a duty to raise all their claims for relief in the trial court and properly articulate them to a judge for a ruling.” Cahill, 196 A.3d at 753 (quoting State v. Yon, 161 A.3d 1118, 1128 (R.I. 2017)). “It is well settled that the raise-or-waive rule ‘precludes us from considering at the appellate level issues not properly presented before the trial court.’” Id. (quoting Yon, 161 A.3d at 1128). The trial justice was not asked to specifically consider whether defendant’s right to counsel was violated when Det. Sullivan resumed the interrogation after defendant’s attorney had left the police station. The defendant’s argument on appeal that the statements he made in the second interrogation should have been suppressed are therefore waived.3 3', 'If defendant had not waived his arguments regarding the second interrogation, our review of the transcript created from the audio recording of this interrogation reveals that defendant’s only disclosure during this brief interrogation was that he could not read a road map, so was not able to show Det. Sullivan the route he had driven around Providence the night of the shooting.', '- 11 -', 'B', 'Trial Errors', '1', 'Trial Counsel’s Conflict of Interest', 'The defendant argues that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated because his trial counsel had a conflict of interest throughout the trial. The source of the conflict, according to defendant, is that his trial counsel simultaneously represented another defendant4 whose child’s mother—LaShae Cornwell—testified against defendant as the main eyewitness to the shooting. The defendant asserts that his trial counsel deliberately kept this information from him even though everyone involved in the case except defendant knew about her other client and the connection to defendant’s case. The defendant also contends that trial counsel used the connection to frame her cross-examination strategy because the attorney tried to get Cornwell to state during trial that she was willing to testify against defendant in the hopes that the state would be more lenient toward her ex-boyfriend and father of her child at his trial. According to defendant, this was a strategy trial counsel could have developed only by using inside information she obtained from her professional relationship with her other client.', 'The state, for its part, argues that defendant has not articulated a conflict of interest created by trial counsel’s representation of another defendant stemming from a completely unrelated shooting incident. As a result, the state contends, defendant has failed to show an actual conflict of interest, “much less one that adversely affected his attorney’s performance.” 4', 'This other defendant was Michael Stokes, who was convicted for crimes related to shooting several individuals in a bar. See State v. Stokes, 200 A.3d 144 (R.I. 2019). There is no indication that there was any connection between the shooting incident in Stokes and the shooting incident in this case.', '- 12 -', 'Although defendant frames his conflict-of-interest argument as a “violation of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights pursuant to the United States Constitution and [a]rticle I, section[s] 10 and 13 of the Rhode Island Constitution,” his argument clearly implicates only his right to effective assistance of trial counsel. We first note that his claim is properly cognizable in an application for postconviction relief rather than on direct appeal. “This Court repeatedly has held that it will not consider a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel that is raised for the first time on a direct appeal.” State v. Brouillard, 745 A.2d 759, 768 (R.I. 2000). Moreover, defendant’s claim lacks merit.', 'This Court employs a specific framework to determine whether a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel has been infringed when a defendant asserts that his attorney had a conflict of interest during his representation. Simpson v. State, 769 A.2d 1257, 1266 (R.I. 2001). “[The] mere possibility of a conflict of interest is not enough to impugn a criminal conviction under the Sixth Amendment.” Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 946 (R.I. 2011) (deletion omitted) (quoting Simpson, 769 A.2d at 1266-67). When a defendant does not raise the conflict issue during the trial court’s proceedings, we require defendant to demonstrate on appeal that the trial attorney “actively represented conflicting interests and that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected [the] lawyer’s performance.” Simpson, 769 A.2d at 1267 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 692; Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 348 (1980)). “An ‘actual’ conflict of interest is defined as ‘one that requires that an attorney struggle to serve two masters.’” Chapdelaine, 32 A.3d at 946 (quoting Simpson, 769 A.2d at 1267). “To determine whether an actual conflict exists, the Court must look to ‘whether the attorney’s actions were motivated by divided loyalties and whether the attorney’s conduct lacked a sound strategic basis.’” Id. (quoting Simpson, 769 A.2d at 1267).', '- 13 -', 'This issue tends to arise when one attorney represents codefendants in the same trial, not when one attorney is representing two criminal defendants in completely separate prosecutions of unrelated events. See Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 481-82 (1978). The Supreme Court has been clear that joint representation of codefendants is not a per se actual conflict of interest, id. at 482; as set forth above, there must be some indication that the attorney in question “struggle[d] to serve two masters.” Chapdelaine, 32 A.3d at 946 (quoting Simpson, 769 A.2d at 1267).', 'In the case at bar, the only indication during trial that defendant’s trial counsel also represented an individual personally connected to a witness for the state was during eyewitness Cornwell’s testimony. The defendant’s trial counsel asked Cornwell several questions during cross-examination about her child’s father being at the ACI awaiting trial on the charges for which he had been indicted, in an effort to elicit that her motive for testifying at defendant’s trial was to help the state, hoping that the state would be more lenient with the prosecution of her child’s father. While trial counsel likely became aware that the state’s primary eyewitness in this case was personally connected to an individual at the ACI awaiting trial only through the trial counsel’s attorney-client relationship with that individual, the representation of two defendants whose charges were wholly unrelated to each other does not demonstrate that trial counsel had any divided loyalties representing both clients. The defendant has tried valiantly to show that his trial counsel had an actual conflict of interest that was exposed during Cornwell’s testimony, but there is no indication that the trial counsel’s representation was in any way affected by her representation of one of the state’s witness’s child’s father. There was, therefore, no actual conflict of interest and no violation of defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights to effective assistance of counsel in this way. See Chapdelaine, 32 A.3d at 946.', '- 14 -', '2', 'Evidence of Gang Affiliation', 'The defendant’s motion in limine to exclude testimony about alleged gang involvement and photographs of defendant and other young men allegedly displaying gang hand signals asserted that this evidence was not relevant to any issue in the prosecution and would serve only to “inflame the passions and prejudices of the jury.” During the hearing on his motion, defendant argued that the evidence should be precluded because there is no evidence that he was a member of any gang and the photographs—taken years before the shooting—were “enormously prejudicial” with “marginal, if any, relevance to any issue in this case.” The prosecutor countered that there was plenty of evidence that defendant associated with known and admitted gang members and that defendant used recognized gang hand signals in the photographs the state sought to admit into evidence. The trial justice denied the motion to categorically exclude this evidence but stated he would provide a cautionary instruction to the jury that defendant’s affiliation with a gang was not an indication of bad character or a predisposition to commit a crime. On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by allowing prejudicial evidence of gang activity throughout the trial, including admitting as full exhibits four photographs of defendant and his friends making recognizable gang hand signals.', 'We have noted on more than one occasion that “a trial justice’s rulings on motions in limine are preliminary in nature.” State v. Colon, 198 A.3d 1249, 1255 (R.I. 2019). “The inherent purpose of a motion in limine is to prevent the proponent of potentially prejudicial matter from displaying it to the jury in any manner until the trial court has ruled upon its admissibility in the context of the trial itself.” Id. (brackets and deletion omitted) (quoting State v. Buchanan, 81 A.3d 1119, 1126 (R.I. 2014)). “As such, ‘an in limine ruling is not final and a trial justice is vested with broad', '- 15 - discretion to reconsider the ruling as the trial unfolds.’” Id. (quoting Buchanan, 81 A.3d at 1126). “Accordingly, it is incumbent upon counsel to raise ‘timely and appropriate’ evidentiary objections throughout the trial in order to preserve the issues for appeal.” Id. (quoting State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1212 (R.I. 2012)). In addition, “[a]ccording to our well-settled raise or waive rule, issues that were not preserved by a specific objection at trial, sufficiently focused so as to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis for said objection, may not be considered on appeal.” State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1018 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1107 (R.I. 1999)).', 'As defendant asserts in his brief, gang affiliation and activity permeated the entire trial. Both the prosecutors and defendant’s trial counsel asked most of the witnesses several questions about gang affiliation and activity, if any. Moreover, four photographs were admitted into evidence through Detective Matthew McGloin, who—without any objection or renewed motion from defendant to exclude the evidence—testified about his knowledge related to street gangs that are active in Providence. In fact, in a sidebar discussion outside the presence of the jury initiated by the trial justice, defendant’s trial counsel remained silent while the trial justice and the prosecutor discussed the scope of Det. McGloin’s expected upcoming testimony. During Det. McGloin’s testimony, defendant’s trial counsel initiated a sidebar discussion to clarify which photographs the prosecutor sought to enter into evidence, and she stated a general objection to one or two of the four photographs marked for identification. She did not press or provide any foundation for her objection when the trial justice decided to allow all four photographs. Furthermore, defendant’s trial counsel did not object when the prosecutor moved for the four photographs discussed with Det. McGloin to be entered as full exhibits. The blanket objection asserted at sidebar does not suffice for renewing defendant’s objection to the photographs on the', '- 16 - bases articulated during the hearing on the motion in limine.5 The defendant’s arguments regarding the gang-related testimony and photographs are, therefore, waived.6 See Colon, 198 A.3d at 1255.', 'C', 'Jury Instructions', 'The defendant requested two specific jury instructions: one about eyewitness identification and one to assist the jurors with their assessment of the credibility of the cooperating witnesses. The trial justice declined to include either of the two instructions in the final jury instructions but noted defendant’s objection to his decision, thereby preserving the issue for appellate review, if needed. On appeal, defendant mentions these requested jury instructions but fails to provide any accompanying argument or indication as to how or why defendant thinks the trial justice erred by refusing to give these two instructions. As a result, defendant has waived this jury instruction issue for our review by “simply stating [this] issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues * * *.” State v. Patino, 93 A.3d 40, 58 (R.I. 2014) (brackets omitted) (quoting State v. Chase, 9 A.3d 1248, 1256 (R.I. 2010)); see State v.

Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure is crystal clear, however, that “[n]o party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the party’s objection.” The defendant did not raise any of these alleged errors to the trial justice either before or after the trial justice charged the jury with the instructions proposed and discussed at the conclusion of the evidence, even when he was provided an express opportunity to do so.

Humphreys thought FAF was an “exciting company” with “tremendous opportunity,” but, as of 2002, FAF faced an $11.5 million judgment (the BHG judgment) and a $1 million claim for damages (the Drianna claim) (collectively the claims). Manchester testified that, in light of the claims, FAF’s value at that time was “not zero, but * * * nominal.”', 'Cerce introduced Humphreys to his cousin, Arthur Fiorenzano (Fiorenzano), president of FAF, in early 2002. In the spring of 2002, Management and FAF agreed that Management would help FAF resolve the claims.', 'The principals at Management were “excited” about “help[ing] [FAF] become more successful in the future.” In addition to charging a $300 hourly fee, Management would receive a yet-to-be-determined “success fee” pending the results of Management’s work. 1', 'Management Solutions, L.L.C. assigned its right to the warrant at issue to Management Capital, L.L.C.

Cerce passed away in 2013.', '-2 -', 'In the summer of 2002, Management suggested to FAF that it grant a common stock warrant2 (the Warrant) to Management upon its successful settlement of the BHG judgment. The Warrant would essentially serve as Management’s “success fee.” Armand Almeida (Almeida), FAF’s chief financial officer (CFO), initially advised Fiorenzano against issuing a warrant to Management.', 'Despite Almeida’s qualms, FAF ultimately agreed to issue Management a warrant.', 'On July 26, 2002, Humphreys sent an email to Fiorenzano with a one-page summary of the “Warrant Terms” (the Warrant Terms) attached for the parties to discuss at an upcoming meeting. The Warrant Terms outlined the basic provisions of what would eventually become the Warrant. After some negotiation, the Warrant Terms were agreed to by both parties in writing on October 9, 2002.', 'According to the Warrant Terms, Management had the right to acquire 10 percent of FAF’s stock for the exercise price of $710,000, exercisable any time before December 31, 2007. The $710,000 exercise price was based on 10 percent of FAF’s then-current agreed value of $7.1 million. The Warrant Terms stated that the $7.1 million figure “values FAF at a 4 multiple of the average of the EBITDA for 2001 and forecast 2002, less only funded debt of approximately $3.7 million.”3 2', 'A stock warrant is “[a]n instrument granting the holder a long-term (usu. a five- to ten-year) option to buy shares at a fixed price.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1820 (10th ed. 2014). 3', '“EBITDA” is an abbreviation for “earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation” and is defined as “[a] company’s income without deductions for interest expenses, taxes, depreciation expenses, or amortization expenses, used as an indicator of a company’s profitability and ability to service its debt.” Black’s Law Dictionary 621 (10th ed. 2014).', '-3 -', 'Under the Warrant Terms, Management also had the right to put4 the Warrant to redeem either the shares it had purchased from FAF or the Warrant itself; likewise, FAF had the right to call5 the Warrant to force Management to sell whatever shares Management had purchased from FAF or the Warrant itself. Both the put and call rights were exercisable any time after December 31, 2007.', 'In December 2002, Management successfully resolved the claims against FAF. The next month, Management turned its focus to drafting the Warrant. On January 14, 2003, Humphreys sent an email to Almeida (David Syner, FAF’s accountant (Syner), Fiorenzano, and Cerce were also copied), with a draft of the Warrant attached. During the following months, FAF and Management exchanged several communications regarding various terms of the Warrant.', 'Humphreys and Manchester testified that, at that time, Management’s main priority was to ensure that Management would be able to review FAF’s 2007 audited financial statements before Management decided whether to exercise or put the Warrant; this review period was not a concept captured by the initial draft Warrant or Warrant Terms. FAF agreed to Management’s request, and a forty-five-day review period was inserted into the draft.6 The following day, FAF’s attorney, who was also involved in negotiating the Warrant, added language proposing September 30, 2007 as a definite date for the Warrant’s expiration, among other edits. In a later draft, FAF’s attorney, after a conversation with Humphreys, also inserted a provision that created 4', 'A “put” or “put option” is “[a]n option to sell something (esp. securities) at a fixed price even if the market declines; the right to require another to buy.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1268 (10th ed. 2014). 5', 'A “call” or “call option” is “[a]n option to buy something (esp. securities) at a fixed price even if the market rises; the right to require another to sell.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1268 (10th ed. 2014). 6', 'Almeida testified that “normally financial statements, audited financial statements are not ready until sometime in very late March generally into April.

And I just said that simply made sense to me.”', '-4 - a thirty-day window (the Window), allowing Management to put and exercise the Warrant simultaneously, or put the Warrant before Management was required to exercise the purchase of shares.', 'The creation of the Window resulted in two inconsistencies regarding the years in the provided deadlines to exercise and put/call the Warrant. Section 3 of the draft Warrant provided that the deadline to exercise the Warrant was seventy-five days after receipt of the 2007 audited financial statements or October 31, 2007, whichever was the earlier to occur. Similarly, Section 13 provided that the date the put/call rights began to run started forty-five days after receipt of the 2007 audited financial statements or September 30, 2007, whichever was the earlier to occur. A literal reading of Sections 3 and 13 would always result in the respective dates of October 31, 2007 and September 30, 2007 as the earlier date to occur, because the audited financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2007 would never be available until sometime in calendar year 2008. Despite a clear contradiction, these dates remained in the final Warrant.', 'Management and FAF executed the final Warrant on July 7, 2003. Under the terms of the final Warrant, Management had the right to acquire 10 percent of FAF’s stock for the exercise price of $710,000, exercisable any time before either seventy-five days elapsed after Management received FAF’s 2007 audited financial statements or October 31, 2007, whichever was the earlier to occur.

Similar to Section 3, the right to put/call was exercisable any time before either forty-five days elapsed after Management received FAF’s 2007 audited financial statements or September 30, 2007, whichever was the earlier to occur. The final version of Section 13 stated, in relevant part:', '“At any time after 5:00 p.m. on (a) the date which is forty-five (45)', 'days after receipt by [Management], or any subsequent holder', 'hereof, of the audited financial statements of [FAF] for the year', 'ending December 31, 2007; or (b) September 30, 2007, whichever', 'is the earlier to occur, [FAF] shall have a call and [Management]', 'or any subsequent holder hereof shall have a put with respect to the', 'Warrant, or the shares issued pursuant to this Warrant, if', 'applicable. * * * The purchase price for the Warrant, or the shares', 'issued pursuant to the Warrant, if applicable, shall be determined', 'and paid as provided in Section 14 hereof.” Section 14 set out a formula for calculating the purchase price. Section 14 provided, in relevant part:', '“The purchase price for the Warrant, or the shares issued pursuant', 'to this Warrant, if applicable, shall be equal to the percentage', 'ownership of [FAF] represented by the shares, multiplied by the', 'Value of [FAF]. The Value of [FAF] shall be equal to: (a) the', 'average EBITDA of [FAF] for the last 2 fiscal years of [FAF] prior', 'to the exercise of the put or call; (b) multiplied by 5; (c) less only', 'funded debt, all as of the last day of the most recently completed', 'fiscal year of [FAF]. EBITDA shall be calculated using the', 'audited financial statements of [FAF].” Although the final Warrant encapsulated the basic ideas from the Warrant Terms, the final Warrant diverged from the Warrant Terms in a few significant respects. As mentioned above, the final Warrant included language providing Management with time to review FAF’s 2007 audited financial statements, with a final expiration date. It also included the Window which allowed Management to simultaneously “exercise” and “put” the Warrant, netting out the difference. Moreover, Section 14 of the Warrant provided a formula to value FAF, should', '-6 - Management have decided to put or FAF decided to call the Warrant. Unlike the Warrant Terms, this formula did not provide an estimated amount of “funded debt.” 7', 'A few years passed without any action on the Warrant.', 'In late summer 2007, Management started to think about how it might want to proceed under the Warrant. Although FAF and Management had ceased working together sometime in 2005, Management continued to have an “excellent” relationship with FAF, according to Humphreys. Humphreys testified that, in light of this congenial relationship, Management’s principals wanted to meet with Fiorenzano to express that, while Management still intended to exercise its rights under the Warrant, it wanted to “figure out what work[ed] best” for FAF.', 'Humphreys met with Fiorenzano in August 2007 to discuss how Management was to proceed under the Warrant. At that meeting, Fiorenzano informed Humphreys that FAF’s new CFO, Lou Rotella (Rotella), would handle any Warrant-related issues. Manchester subsequently met with Rotella in September 2007. According to Manchester, Rotella had deemed the Warrant “valueless” based on his calculation using the years 2005 and 2006. Manchester testified that he explained to Rotella that the Warrant was intended to be based on 2006 and 2007, but that Rotella “agreed to disagree” with Manchester’s understanding.', 'Humphreys testified that Manchester was “shocked” when he returned from his meeting with Rotella. It was after this conversation that Management realized that the Warrant’s dates were fundamentally inconsistent with each other.', 'Once Management realized the mistakes, Manchester sent a letter to Fiorenzano and FAF on September 28, 2007, asking FAF to amend the errors and asserting that, in Section 3.1, “the 7', 'The original Warrant Terms stated: “The exercise price of the warrant shall be 10% of the current agreed value of FAF of $7.1 million. This values FAF at a 4 multiple of the average of the EBITDA for 2001 and forecast 2002, less only funded debt of approximately $3.7 million.”', '-7 - date of October 31, 2007 should have been October 31, 2008” and, in Section 13, “the [date of] September 30, 2007 should have been September 30, 2008.” The letter stated that if FAF was in agreement as to the errors, Management would prefer the Warrant be amended. The letter continued, however, to inform FAF that “[i]n order to preserve [Management’s] rights under the terms of the Warrant as presently written,” Management believed it “necessary” to exercise its put rights.', 'FAF, through its attorney, promptly replied to Management’s letter on October 1, 2007. In the letter, he noted the discrepancy between the dates, but asserted that the December 31, 2007 date was incorrect—not the September 30, 2007 and October 31, 2007 dates. FAF’s attorney wrote “[m]y file clearly indicates that the parties always intended that the expiration date for the exercise of the Warrant would always be prior to 12/31/[0]7.” He attributed the error to the drafting of the thirty-day Window, which allowed Management to simultaneously put and exercise the Warrant.', 'Additional back-and-forth discussions ensued between Management and FAF, including Management’s rejected proposal that FAF purchase the Warrant for $2 million based on FAF’s value in 2006 and 2007, in exchange for its release of FAF’s obligations. During the fall of 2007, FAF also informed Management that it considered “funded debt” to include its revolving debt and not simply its long-term debt. On December 31, 2007, Manchester sent an email to Rotella and Fiorenzano, which served as a notice to FAF that Management was exercising its rights under the Warrant but would withdraw the notice “provided that a mutually satisfactory valuation with regard to the put” was reached. Manchester had one last meeting with Rotella in early 2008; Rotella maintained FAF’s position, and no agreement regarding the Warrant dates was reached.', '-8 -', 'On March 21, 2008, Management filed a complaint against FAF in Providence County Superior Court. Count I asserted reformation of the Warrant based on mutual mistake; Count II requested declaratory judgment that funded debt is long-term debt; and Count III alleged breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Count IV alleged that Fiorenzano had breached his fiduciary duty by funneling funds from FAF to an offshore account, and requested that FAF’s affiliates be included in FAF’s valuation.8 Count V requested injunctive relief to bar FAF from holding stockholder meetings regarding the Warrant without first providing notice to Management.', 'On June 11, 2014, FAF moved for summary judgment on Counts I, II, and V of Management’s complaint. Following a hearing on FAF’s motion, the trial justice allowed the parties to submit supplemental briefing on whether FAF had repudiated its obligations under the Warrant. The trial justice denied FAF’s motion for summary judgment in a written decision on April 2, 2015. In that decision, the trial justice explained that he would allow Management to pursue a theory of repudiation. The trial justice did not rule on the repudiation matter, however, because he determined that the disputed dates were the threshold issue, and that those dates were necessarily factual.', 'Accordingly, Management filed an amended complaint on May 6, 2015, adding a count for repudiation. A jury-waived trial was held on June 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, and 10, 2015. Manchester, Humphreys, Almeida, and Syner testified for Management; FAF’s attorney testified for FAF.', 'On January 17, 2017 the trial justice issued a written decision, determining that: (1) the Warrant would be reformed to correct the dates based on the parties’ prior mutual understanding; (2) the term “funded debt” meant “long-term debt”; and (3) FAF repudiated its obligations under 8', 'The trial justice granted partial summary judgment on August 12, 2010 dismissing Count IV.', '-9 - the Warrant.', 'Additionally, after finding that Management had proven its damages with reasonable certainty, the trial justice awarded $1,234,055 in damages to Management and applied prejudgment interest as of October 13, 2008.

Further, FAF suggests that the testimony of Almeida, FAF’s former CFO, is unreliable because he was inexperienced with stock warrants and relied too heavily on FAF’s attorney’s expertise. 9 FAF maintains that these underlying errors cannot amount to a finding of mutual mistake. Management responds that the trial justice correctly reformed the Warrant after he concluded that there was clear and convincing evidence of a mutual mistake.', 'As with other written agreements, a stock warrant may be equitably reformed.

Humphreys testified that, during the Warrant negotiations, Management stressed the importance that it be able to review FAF’s audited financial statements prior to making a decision under the Warrant. Contradictorily, FAF’s attorney, testifying on behalf of FAF, stated that the mistakes he had inserted into the drafts were for the years corresponding to the audited financial statements—the statements should have been for the year ending December 31, 2006, not 2007. Notably, FAF’s attorney testified that there was no evidence of this mistake in any drafts or other related written communications. When pressed, he stated that he did not have a conversation with anyone about these dates. In his decision, the trial justice found “that the evidence clearly and convincingly establishes that the parties intended that Management would be able to review the audited financial statements for the year ending December 31, 2007 prior to deciding whether to buy shares or put the Warrant.” He further found that FAF’s evidence “falls short of overcoming Management’s clear and convincing evidence proving otherwise.”', 'After a review of the record, we agree that the evidence clearly and convincingly serves as grounds for reformation.

Thompson, 495 A.2d 678, 682 (R.I. 1985) (quoting 11 Williston, Contracts § 1322 at 130 (3d ed. Jaeger 1968)). Further, “a repudiation can be evidenced by either a statement to that effect or ‘a voluntary affirmative act which renders the obligor unable or apparently unable to perform without [committing] a breach.’” Id. (quoting Restatement (Second) Contracts § 250(b) at 272 (1981)).', 'In Griffin v. Zapata, 570 A.2d 659 (R.I. 1990), we held that the actions and statements of a seller of property, together with the statements of his attorney, amounted to anticipatory repudiation of a purchase and sale agreement. Griffin, 570 A.2d at 662. The seller in Griffin communicated to the buyer that, because he had not yet secured alternate housing, he would not attend the closing. Id. The seller’s attorney also informed the buyer that the closing would not', '- 17 - occur because the seller would not be attending. Id. Neither the seller nor the seller’s attorney attended the closing, nor did they express any indication that the seller would be willing to close at a later date. Id. These actions and statements, this Court held, indicated “clear anticipatory repudiation” that the “seller did not intend to perform his part of the agreement” on the scheduled dates, “or within any reasonable time after[.]” Id.', 'In determining that FAF repudiated its obligations under the Warrant, the trial justice pointed to the October 1, 2007 letter from FAF’s attorney to Management, which reiterated FAF’s position that the Warrant’s value was based on the 2006 financial documents. Coupled with Rotella’s and Fiorenzano’s statements to Management during the fall of 2007, the trial justice found that these “statements and actions” constituted “positive and unconditional” evidence of FAF’s refusal to perform. See Thompson, 495 A.2d at 682 (quoting 11 Williston, Contracts § 1332 at 130). The trial justice found the testimony of Humphreys and Manchester credible that Rotella and Fiorenzano were steadfast in their insistence that the Warrant was valueless.', 'The trial justice further analogized these facts to those in Griffin, finding the combined actions of Rotella and FAF’s attorney similar to those of the seller and seller’s attorney. See Griffin, 570 A.2d at 662. The trial justice reasoned that even if FAF’s October 1, 2007 letter by itself did not amount to a clear repudiation of FAF’s obligations under the Warrant, “when considered together with Rotella and Fiorenzano’s statements, there is clear evidence” of FAF’s refusal to perform.', 'On appeal, FAF points to a number of facts that FAF insists cannot amount to repudiation because Management never properly triggered FAF’s obligations under the Warrant, therefore FAF could not possibly have repudiated. For example, FAF calls attention to Management’s first attempt to put the Warrant on September 28, 2007, which, under either party’s interpretation', '- 18 - of the dates, was too early. 11 FAF argues that “[i]f [Management] truly intended to put the Warrant,” it would have done so under at least one interpretation of the Warrant. Moreover, FAF argues that Management’s December 31, 2007 attempt to exercise was not properly executed because Management’s attempt did not include a tender of $710,000, the Exercise Price, or a surrender of the Warrant. FAF further asserts that its communications during this period did not constitute a positive and unconditional refusal to perform its obligations under the Warrant, rather it was merely communicating its good faith interpretation of the Warrant.', 'Here, after reviewing the record and applying deference to the trial justice’s factual findings, Nationwide Property & Casualty Insurance Co., 59 A.3d at 111, it is our opinion that there is ample evidence to support the trial justice’s conclusion that FAF repudiated its obligations under the Warrant.', 'We are satisfied that FAF’s actions sufficiently meet the “positive and unconditional” standard laid out in Griffin. Griffin, 570 A.2d at 662 (quoting Thompson, 495 A.2d at 682). Rotella’s and Fiorenzano’s statements, together with FAF’s October 1, 2007 letter from its attorney, conveyed to Management that FAF had no intention to perform its obligations under the Warrant. Accordingly, we discern no error in the trial justice’s finding of repudiation.', '2', 'Management Properly Preserved its Post-Repudiation Rights', 'FAF also argues that, even if it had repudiated the Warrant, Management failed to properly preserve its post-repudiation rights because Management’s September 28, 2007 letter and December 31, 2007 email showed that Management elected to treat the Warrant as valid. 11', 'Under FAF’s interpretation of the dates, the September 28, 2007 put was two days before Management’s rights to put vested, which would begin on September 30, 2007. Under Management’s interpretation of the dates, the September 28, 2007 put was two days and a year before Management’s rights to put vested, which would begin on September 30, 2008.', '- 19 - Management, on the other hand, argues that it was not treating the Warrant as valid when it sent those communications and that, by promptly filing suit on March 21, 2008, Management preserved its post-repudiation rights.', 'Generally, once a party has repudiated an agreement, the nonbreaching party may maintain a claim for breach, even though the time for performance has yet to come. 23 Williston, Contracts § 63:33 at 606-09 (4th ed. 2014). To do so, the nonrepudiating party usually has three options: (1) “rescind the contract altogether, and if any performance has already been rendered by the injured party, to recover its value * * * ”; (2) “elect to treat the repudiation as a breach either by bringing suit promptly, or by making some change of position”; or (3) “await the time for performance of the contract and bring suit after that time has arrived.” Id. at § 63:33 at 607- 08. “A wrongful repudiation of a contract by one party before the time for performance entitles the nonrepudiating party to immediately claim damages for a total breach.” Id. at § 63:44 at 656.', 'Under the doctrine of election of remedies, “the pursuit of one remedy will exclude the pursuit of the other[.]” Coderre v. Zoning Board of Review of City of Pawtucket, 105 R.I. 266, 274, 251 A.2d 397, 402 (1969). The doctrine applies “only in those cases in which the party has two or more remedies which are inconsistent with each other.” Id. “The test of inconsistency is whether the two modes of redress are such that the assertion of one remedy of necessity negates or repudiates the other.” Id. “The essence of the doctrine of election of remedies is the conscious choice, with full knowledge of the facts, of one of two or more inconsistent remedies.” Rhode Island Hospital Trust Co. v. The Rhode Island Covering Co. Inc., 95 R.I. 30, 35, 182 A.2d 438, 441 (1962) (quoting Adams v. Camden Safe Deposit & Trust Co., 2 A.2d 361, 394 (N.J. 1938)).', 'The trial justice found that Management appropriately preserved its post-repudiation rights when it “treated [FAF’s] repudiation as a breach” and promptly filed a complaint against', '- 20 - FAF on March 21, 2008. Finding Management’s actions “properly prompt,” the trial justice explained that “[a]t its longest, this time period extends from October 1, 2007 to March 21, 2008, a period that the [c]ourt considers sufficiently close in time to be prompt.” The trial justice did not consider Management’s actions via the September 28, 2007 and December 31, 2007 communications to be an election of remedies because he considered Management’s actions “ineffective” under the reformed Warrant.', 'On appeal, FAF reiterates that, because Management attempted to put the Warrant on September 28, 2007, and attempted to exercise the Warrant on December 31, 2007, Management elected to treat the Warrant as valid, and, because Management elected that remedy, Management cannot now assert repudiation.', 'As stated above, we review questions of law de novo. Bank of America, N.A., 132 A.3d at 692. Upon our review, however, we agree with the trial justice that Management properly preserved its post-repudiation rights by promptly filing suit after it realized FAF was not going to honor the Warrant. See 23 Williston, Contracts § 63:33 at 607. Like the trial justice, we consider Management’s actions, from the discovery of the repudiation sometime in September or October 2007 to the filing of suit in March 2008 sufficiently prompt to preserve its repudiation rights. We do not regard Management’s September 28, 2007 letter and December 31, 2007 email as prohibiting Management from filing suit under the doctrine of election of remedies. See Coderre, 105 R.I. at 274, 251 A.2d at 402. Under the reformed Warrant—which was reformed to reflect the parties’ prior understanding that Management would be able to review FAF’s 2007 audited financial statements before acting under the Warrant—any attempt to act under the Warrant in 2007 was futile because the 2007 audited financial statements were not yet available. Therefore, Management’s September 28, 2007 letter and December 31, 2007 email are not inconsistent with', '- 21 - filing suit on March 21, 2008, see id., because, under the reformed Warrant, an exercise of rights in 2007 was simply not an available remedy, much less a “conscious choice, with full knowledge of the facts[.]”12 Rhode Island Hospital Trust Co., 95 R.I. at 35, 182 A.2d at 441 (quoting Adams, 2 A.2d at 364).', 'FAF further argues that Management’s original complaint filed on March 21, 2008 did not treat FAF’s actions as repudiation because it did not include a count for breach of contract or anticipatory repudiation. The complaint, however, did include a count for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, a count inherently linked with a claim for a breach of contract. This count alone would be sufficient to save Management’s post-repudiation complaint. See 23 Williston, Contracts § 63:22 at 552 (“Violation of the duty of good faith and fair dealing constitutes a breach of contract.”). Perhaps more significantly, however, the trial justice allowed Management to amend its complaint to include a count for anticipatory repudiation under Rule 15 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'Rule 15(a) provides that after a responsive pleading has been served, a party may amend the pleadings “only by leave of court or by written consent of the adverse party; and leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.” Rule 15(b) states: “When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings.” “We have consistently interpreted Rule 15(a) to allow trial justices to grant amendments to the pleadings liberally if justice so requires.” 12', 'FAF invites us to apply Lucente v. International Business Machines Corp., 310 F.3d 243 (2d Cir. 2002), a United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit case which has no precedential value. Moreover, when we compare the facts in this case, they are readily distinguishable. In Lucente, the plaintiff waited almost six years after receiving a cancellation letter regarding his stock options to file for breach, and then, after filing, tried to exercise his remaining stock option. Id. at 248, 250, 251. Here, Management filed suit before the 2007 audited financial statements would have been available—there were no “wait-and-see” antics.', '- 22 - Faerber v.

Pepper, 583 A.2d 77, 78 (R.I. 1990); however, we note that whether the party opposing the amendment would be prejudiced is “central” to a trial justice’s decision to grant an amendment.

Warren Electric Corp., 24 A.3d 514, 531 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Faerber, 568 A.2d at 329).', 'Management’s amended complaint, although filed weeks before trial, was allowed after the trial justice directed both parties to file supplemental memoranda, and after a hearing on the issue.

In his ruling on the amended complaint, the trial justice surmised whether an amendment to add a count for breach and/or repudiation was necessary in light of Management’s encompassing count for breach of good faith and fair dealing, but nonetheless elected to treat Management’s complaint as amended “[i]n order to set aside any doubt on this issue[.]”', 'We see no prejudice as a result of the amendment’s allowance. Any technical argument FAF brings forth regarding Management’s original pleadings is cured by the proper allowance of the amended complaint. We conclude that Management properly preserved its post-repudiation rights.', '- 23 -', 'D', 'Damages', 'FAF argues that the trial justice erred when he determined that Management had calculated damages in the amount of $1,234,055 with reasonable certainty.13 This argument is largely premised on FAF’s argument regarding the definition of “funded debt” because that term is used in Section 14 of the Warrant, which Management used to calculate its damages.', '“It is well settled that a court may award damages for breach of contract to place the injured party in as good a position as if the parties fully performed the contract.” Sophie F. Bronowiski Mulligan Irrevocable Trust v. Bridges, 44 A.3d 116, 120 (R.I. 2012) (brackets omitted) (quoting Riley v.

Palumbo, 163 A.3d 526, 537 (R.I. 2017). 13', 'FAF also argues that an underlying figure in Management’s damages calculation was not properly proven with reasonable certainty because the record does not support a possible calculation of this number. To the extent FAF argues that the underlying figure used was not in evidence, FAF did not object to Manchester’s testimony for lack of foundation nor did it move to strike. We, therefore, consider this argument waived. See State ex. rel. Town of Tiverton v. Pelletier, 174 A.3d 713, 718 (R.I. 2017) (“[A]n issue that has not been raised and articulated previously at [the] trial [court] is not properly preserved for appellate review.”) (quoting In re Shy C., 126 A.3d 433, 435 (R.I. 2015)).', '- 24 -', 'During trial, Manchester walked through an explanation of his damages calculation. Management’s damages are based upon the calculation provided by Section 14 of the Warrant and the underlying figures were provided in an exhibit admitted in full. The damage calculation was also based on a figure of “long-term debt” as the “funded debt” referenced in Section 14. FAF provided no alternative calculations on appeal or at trial.', 'The trial justice found Manchester’s testimony credible, and combined with the calculations included in the exhibit, found that Management had satisfied its burden of proving damages with reasonable certainty. The trial justice’s determination is entitled to great weight, see Fogarty, 163 A.3d at 537, and FAF has not provided us with any reason to disturb it.', 'E', 'Prejudgment Interest', 'FAF also argues that the trial justice erred when he determined that Management was entitled to prejudgment interest beginning on October 13, 2008. FAF argues that this date is a purely hypothetical date that Management could have exercised under the Warrant.', 'The Rhode Island prejudgment interest statute, G.L. 1956 § 9-21-10(a), provides:', '“In any civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a decision', 'made for pecuniary damages, there shall be added by the clerk of', 'the court to the amount of damages interest at the rate of twelve', 'percent (12%) per annum thereon from the date the cause of action', 'accrued, which shall be included in the judgment entered therein.”', 'Prejudgment interest “is not an element of damages but is purely statutory, peremptorily added to the award by the clerk.” Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co. v.

It serves a dual purpose: “to encourage early settlement of claims and to compensate an injured plaintiff for delay in receiving compensation to which he or she may be', '- 25 - entitled.” Id. Prejudgment interest is calculated “from the date the cause of action accrued,” § 9- 21-10(a), which this Court has explained is “the first date an injured party has a right to seek judicial relief.” Barry, 892 A.2d at 924 n.5.', 'At trial, Management argued that statutory interest should be calculated from October 13, 2008. In his testimony, Manchester clarified why that date should be deemed “the date the cause of action accrued[.]” See § 9-21-10(a). He first explained that he chose April 1, 2008 as the time Management was likely to have received the 2007 audited financial statements.', 'Reading Sections 3 and 13 together, Management would have seventy-five days to decide whether to buy shares or put the Warrant. Manchester testified that the last date for Management to decide how to act under the Warrant would have been June 15, 2008. Next, also pursuant to Section 13, there were 120 days to deliver the payment, of which the last possible date would have been October 13, 2008. The trial justice concurred with Manchester’s calculation for purposes of establishing the date of accrual for the award of prejudgment interest.', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err when he determined that October 13, 2008 is the date when prejudgment interest should begin to run. Accordingly, we shall not disturb the award of prejudgment interest.14 14', 'FAF also argues that the trial justice erred when he did not rule on FAF’s counterclaims. The counterclaims FAF asserted include counts for fraud or misrepresentation by statement, negligent misrepresentation by statement, and fraud or misrepresentation based on omission. In his decision, the trial justice did not address FAF’s counterclaims because he found for Management on Management’s three major claims. Specifically, the trial justice noted in a footnote: “Because the [c]ourt finds in Management’s favor on these three issues, there is no need to address [FAF’s] counterclaims.” After our review of the record, we find that the record is entirely devoid of any proof FAF put forward to support its counterclaims.

At approximately 7 a.m. on March 1, 2013, plaintiff parked her car in the parking lot of a Stop & Shop supermarket located in Smithfield, Rhode Island.1 As she was walking from her car to the entrance of the Stop & Shop, plaintiff slipped and fell on what she characterizes as black ice, and suffered injuries to her right hand and wrist. The plaintiff filed suit against Stop & Shop on December 10, 2015, alleging negligence on the part of Stop & Shop for her resulting injuries.2 Stop & Shop answered plaintiff’s complaint and also filed a third-party complaint against Xpress Sweeping to defend, indemnify, and hold Stop & Shop harmless for any claims arising out of Xpress Sweeping’s duty under defendants’ snow services agreement.3', 'Both Stop & Shop and Xpress Sweeping filed motions for summary judgment in accordance with Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Essentially, defendants argued that plaintiff failed to assert sufficient facts necessary to satisfy the elements of her negligence claim because plaintiff testified at her deposition that she did not see, feel, or in any manner observe ice at or near the location of her fall. The defendants therefore argued that plaintiff could only “speculate” that her fall was caused by black ice. The plaintiff objected to defendants’ motions and claimed that her deposition testimony “was based on a sound inference clearly supported by scientific fact.” She thus argued that summary judgment was not proper 1', 'While the complaint alleged that the incident occurred at the Stop & Shop in North Smithfield, it is apparent from the record that plaintiff’s fall occurred at the Smithfield location. 2', 'The plaintiff’s complaint also named “John Doe” as a defendant pursuant to General Laws 1956 § 9-5-20; however, the record does not indicate whether plaintiff ascertained “John Doe’s” identity. 3', 'According to Stop & Shop, Xpress Sweeping was contractually obligated to provide snow services “to maintain pedestrian and vehicle safety” at the Stop & Shop location in Smithfield.', '-2- because this testimony, coupled with meteorologist Steven Cascione’s affidavit and meteorological report, gave rise to a disputed issue of material fact as to whether there was black ice in the parking lot of the Stop & Shop where she fell.

She testified that, at approximately 7 a.m. on March 1, 2013, it was neither raining nor snowing; however, it was a cold day with no sun because it was still early morning. When she got out of her car, she testified, the parking lot was “generally clean and dry[,]” except for a pile of snow that was piled on and around a parking lot median between her car and the entrance to Stop & Shop. She testified that, as she was walking to the entrance, she did not notice any ice on the ground; however, when she fell it “felt like somebody pulled the rug out from under [her] and [she] just went down and landed on [her] wrist[.]” When asked if she observed any ice on the ground where she fell, plaintiff testified that she “did not notice ice or [she] would have avoided it.” She also testified that, although she did not see any ice before or after her fall, she knew there was black ice where she fell because otherwise she “wouldn’t have fallen the way [she] did.”', 'At her deposition, plaintiff also presented two photographs taken approximately three years after the incident that depicted how the area looked to her on the day she fell. The photographs show a pile of snow adjacent to a handicapped parking spot on and around a parking lot median directly across from the entrance to Stop & Shop. The plaintiff testified that, on the day she fell, the snow pile was smaller than what was shown in the two photographs and that she was not sure of the height of the pile on the day she fell, but that it was not “spread out this way. I think it was just a pile.” She further testified: “[T]he reason I took the pictures is I wanted to', '-6- show that this was where the snow was piled every storm. Since 2013, I have seen snow piled there every time there’s a storm. It’s never cleared away.” (Emphasis added.)', 'Under our well-established summary-judgment standard, and viewing the evidence and inferences to be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, we conclude that plaintiff satisfied her burden of “produc[ing] competent evidence that proves the existence of a disputed issue of material fact” such that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the cause of plaintiff’s fall was, in fact, black ice. Wyso v. Full Moon Tide, LLC, 78 A.3d 747, 750 (R.I. 2013) (brackets omitted) (quoting Sullo, 68 A.3d at 407). This is a fact that is capable of proof by direct evidence or proof by inference. The defendants are free to challenge plaintiff’s assertions and argue that there was no black ice present in the area of plaintiff’s fall, and that plaintiff’s version of facts is incorrect. However, at the summary-judgment stage, a trial justice must not weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations. Rather, a trial justice must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and determine if that party has submitted sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact. We hold that plaintiff has done so and that the trial justice erred in granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.', 'The sole issue before the trial justice was whether there were genuine issues of material fact as to the dangerous condition that caused plaintiff’s fall that would preclude summary judgment. In determining whether an issue is genuine for purposes of summary judgment, a trial justice cannot consider the merits, make credibility determinations, evaluate testimony, or weigh the evidence.', 'Instead, the trial justice “must review the pleadings, affidavits, admissions, answers to interrogatories, and other appropriate evidence from a perspective most favorable to the party opposing the motion.” Gliottone v. Ethier, 870 A.2d 1022, 1027 (R.I. 2005) (quoting', '-7- Steinberg v. State, 427 A.2d 338, 340 (R.I. 1981)). However, in the case at bar, the trial justice undertook a factual determination and weighed expert testimony when she stated:', '“[W]hat the [c]ourt is stuck with is this idea that what he looked at,', 'those pictures—and it’s interesting. As counsel points out, not', 'only can I say they’re not similar to the snowbanks that were', 'present on that day, your own client actually stated they’re not; that', 'the ones that were there that day were much smaller. I don’t know', 'how much value, or whether or not that rises to the level, I should', 'say, of the competent evidence that plaintiff needs to produce', 'because I don’t know that it is competent. It’s an opinion based', 'upon something entirely different.” The trial justice also weighed the evidence when she stated:', '“I don’t think this report says what you hoped it would say. If', 'that’s supposed to raise a genuine issue of fact whether there was', 'ice in the area at the time of plaintiff’s fall, and whether the ice, if', 'any, would have been noticeable on the asphalt, I don’t think this', 'gets you there. I think this last part that we’ve referenced, there’s', 'inferences that can be drawn. I think there’s a fine line or a tipping', 'point when we go from inferences to just pure speculation.” At the summary-judgment hearing, it was not the moment for the trial justice to weigh the evidence before her or make credibility assessments—that is a function that should be reserved for the factfinder at trial. See Limoges v. Nalco Company, 157 A.3d 567, 571 (R.I. 2017). Accordingly, we vacate the judgment granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the judgments of the Superior Court. The papers in this case may be remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings.', 'Justice Indeglia, with whom Justice Robinson joins, dissenting. Even in a negligence claim, for a plaintiff to survive a motion for summary judgment he or she must submit competent evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact to be resolved at trial. From my', '-8- review of the record, however, Voccola merely presented speculative evidence on the issue of the existence of black ice in the Stop & Shop parking lot on the day that she fell, making summary judgment in favor of the defendants appropriate in this case. Therefore, I must respectfully dissent.', '“To prevail in a negligence action, the plaintiff must introduce competent evidence to establish not only that the defendant owed a duty of care to the plaintiff and that that duty was breached, but also that the defendant’s negligence was the proximate cause of the plaintiff’s injury.” Kennedy v. Tempest, 594 A.2d 385, 388 (R.I. 1991). Specifically, on the element of causation, “the causal connection between negligence and a plaintiff’s injury must be established by competent evidence and may not be based on conjecture or speculation.” Cooley v. Kelly, 160 A.3d 300, 305 (R.I. 2017) (brackets omitted) (quoting McLaughlin v. Moura, 754 A.2d 95, 98 (R.I. 2000)).', 'Regarding a motion for summary judgment, this Court has stated that “[w]e will affirm a trial court’s decision only if, after reviewing the admissible evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we conclude that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC v. Providence Business Loan Fund, Inc., 200 A.3d 153, 156 (R.I. 2019) (emphasis added) (brackets omitted) (quoting Cancel v. City of Providence, 187 A.3d 347, 350 (R.I. 2018)).', 'In the instant case, my primary concern is the fact that Voccola never properly identified what had caused her to fall. In Russian v. Life-Cap Tire Services, Inc., 608 A.2d 1145 (R.I. 1992), this Court affirmed a hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, holding that the plaintiff failed to assert sufficient facts on which reasonable inferences could be drawn identifying the defendants’ negligence as the proximate cause of the', '-9- plaintiff’s injury. Russian, 608 A.2d at 1147, 1148. There, the plaintiff was injured on the premises of one of the defendants, an automobile tire business, and claimed that he “felt something hit him in the shins” prior to falling. Id. at 1147. However, the plaintiff never identified what had actually hit him in the shins; rather, he testified that the work area was clear of debris and tools in the immediate area where he fell. Id. at 1146. The plaintiff conjectured that it may have been a car jack that caused his fall, but failed to present any evidence from which one could rationally infer any negligence on the part of the defendants. Id. at 1147. In affirming summary judgment in favor of the defendants, this Court reasoned that “the mere happening of an accident does not in and of itself necessarily warrant a reasonable and legitimate inference of negligence.” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Kennedy, 594 A.2d at 388); see Habershaw v. Michaels Stores, Inc., 42 A.3d 1273, 1277 (R.I. 2012) (holding that a mere allegation that retailer’s floor was “shiny” was insufficient to support a negligence claim arising out of customer’s slip and fall because it was not competent evidence).', 'Here, Voccola stated in her deposition that at the time of her fall she did not observe any ice; she did not touch the ground with her hand to feel if there was ice; she did not notice if her clothes were wet; and, when she observed the pavement, she found it to be uniform and all one color. Like the plaintiff in Russian, Voccola could not identify with any specificity what had caused her fall. Russian, 608 A.2d at 1147. While Voccola may conjecture that black ice caused her to fall, her own deposition testimony contradicts her theory. Because the mere fact that Voccola fell “does not in and of itself necessarily warrant a reasonable and legitimate inference of negligence[,]” her deposition testimony was not competent evidence on the existence of black ice. Id. (quoting Kennedy, 594 A.2d at 388).', '- 10 -', 'Because Voccola’s deposition testimony was not enough to carry her past defendants’ motions for summary judgment, the only discovery material that might save her claim was the affidavit of Steven Cascione (the Cascione affidavit). My concern here is that the majority appears to believe that, when the hearing justice found that Cascione failed to lay a proper foundation and excluded the Cascione affidavit as too speculative, she improperly weighed the evidence. I disagree. From my review of the record, it appears that the hearing justice based her decision to disregard the Cascione affidavit on Rule 56(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', '“We are cognizant that in considering a motion for summary judgment, the court does not pass upon the weight and credibility of the evidence, but must consider the affidavits and other pleadings in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.” Weaver v. American Power Conversion Corporation, 863 A.2d 193, 200 (R.I. 2004). “However, we also have held that naked and conclusory assertions in an affidavit are inadequate to establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact and thus do not afford a basis for reversal of a trial justice’s ruling granting a motion for summary judgment.” Id. “The obvious rationale for this rule prevents a party from dodging summary disposition with factual assertions in tailor-made affidavits designed solely to create a mirage of material issues.” Id.', 'It is well settled in this jurisdiction that “[b]efore admitting expert testimony, the trial justice must evaluate whether the testimony that a party seeks to present to the jury is ‘relevant, within the witness’s expertise, and based on an adequate factual foundation.’” Kurczy v.

I don’t know how much value, or whether or', 'not that rises to the level * * * of the competent evidence that', 'plaintiff needs to produce[.]” The hearing justice then went on to discuss the rest of the Cascione affidavit, stating: “I think that is speculation. I don’t think it’s competent evidence.” Furthermore, she found that “even when I take all the inferences in the light most favorable to the plaintiff that would establish— when I say ‘no evidence,’ [I mean] no competent evidence.” I think it is clear from the record that the hearing justice made a Rule 56(e) determination regarding the speculative nature of the Cascione affidavit.', 'The issue before us in the instant case is whether, at the summary-judgment stage, a hearing justice may make an independent determination regarding the speculative nature of an expert’s affidavit.

In Hayes v. Douglas Dynamics, Inc., 8 F.3d 88 (1st Cir. 1993), the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit held that the expert affidavits in that case failed to produce “sufficient support for the conclusion that the injury to [the decedent] was caused by the defendant’s product.” Hayes, 8 F.3d at 92. There, the decedent, while sitting in the back seat of a vehicle stopped at an intersection, was hit from behind by another vehicle fitted with a snowplow unit that consisted of a metal lift channel that protruded outward from the front of the truck. Id. at 89. The plaintiff’s witness, who was an accident reconstruction expert, “used the police report, autopsy report, death certificate, hospital and medical records, depositions, pictures of the accident scene and vehicles, and the study conducted by [an independent company], in order to reconstruct the accident.” Id. at 92. With that information, the expert opined in his affidavit that', '- 13 - the decedent was struck in the head by sheet metal that had been pushed forward by the lift arm of the snowplow, given that the blow to the head was the same size, shape, and rigidity, there had been no other objects of the like near the decedent’s head, and, thus, the defendant’s product had caused the injury. Id. at 93.', 'Nevertheless, the court disregarded the expert’s affidavit, reasoning that his “bald assertion that no other part of the car or truck had that particular shape is difficult to accept, given that [the expert] never had the opportunity to examine the [car] after the accident.” Hayes, 8 F.3d at 93. Furthermore, the court stated that the photographs of the car in which the decedent had been seated were not clear enough to establish the size and shape of each piece of the accident wreckage. Id. Thus, the court found that the expert had failed to provide any factual details to support his theory, and omitted the affidavit for failing to meet the standards of a Rule 56(e) determination. See id. at 92, 93.', 'Here, Cascione provided the temperatures from the night and early morning prior to Voccola’s fall, the size of the snowbank (taken from the photograph), and the low angle of the sun—illustrating the ideal condition for the snowbank to melt, create a pool of water, then freeze. Furthermore, Cascione opined that, given the low angle of the sun, a shadow could have formed over the newly formed ice, making it difficult for Voccola to see any ice as she walked in the Stop & Shop parking lot.', 'The main problem I see with the Cascione affidavit is that it was based on speculative evidence. Cascione founded his opinion on photographs of a snowbank taken three years after Voccola’s fall, and no testimony was provided as to the size or shape of the snowbank on the day of the accident—the pictures merely indicated the same general area where the snowbank was formed. Moreover, he based his opinion in part on Voccola’s deposition; and, in that deposition,', '- 14 - when asked about the size and shape of the snowbank, Voccola merely stated that “[i]t must have been in my line of view but I didn’t really notice it * * *.”', 'Furthermore, Cascione never went to the scene of the accident; as such, he could not determine whether any slopes, elevations, or divots in the pavement could have prevented the alleged black ice from forming in the area where Voccola fell. Finally, Cascione stated that there may have been a shadow, making it difficult to see any ice formation in the Stop & Shop parking lot; however, Voccola directly contradicted that fact in her deposition, when she testified that she did not observe any shadows on the day of her accident.', 'Based on the above factors, the hearing justice determined that the Cascione affidavit was not competent evidence, thus rendering it inadmissible. As such, she did not consider the affidavit when ruling on the defendants’ motion for summary judgment. Because the Superior Court, in the Rule 56 context, views only admissible evidence in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party, there was nothing for the hearing justice to weigh when she granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. See Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC, 200 A.3d at 156. From my review of the record in the instant matter, I cannot say that the hearing justice erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants, as neither Voccola’s deposition testimony, nor the Cascione affidavit, was competent on the issue of the existence of black ice on the day that Voccola fell.', 'For the above-stated reasons, I must respectfully dissent.', '- 15 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET', 'Dolores Voccola v.

24,State : v. : Hasim Munir. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Hasim Munir, appeals from a July 6, 2017 judgment of conviction entered against him in Providence County Superior Court following a jury trial. Mr. Munir was charged by indictment with and subsequently convicted of one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.1 and 11-37- 8.2. On appeal, he raises the following issues: (1) “whether the trial justice committed clear error by refusing to suppress defendant’s statement to the police where evidence that defendant’s confession was knowing, intelligent and voluntary was less than clear and convincing;” and (2) “whether the trial justice committed clear error in admitting defendant’s confession into evidence despite his invocation of his right to remain silent[.]”', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On August 25, 2016, Mr. Munir was charged by indictment with “engag[ing] in sexual penetration, to wit, penile to vaginal penetration, with * * * a person fourteen (14) years of age or under, in violation of §11-37-8.1 and §11-37-8.2 * * *.”', 'In due course, Mr. Munir’s case proceeded to trial. Prior to the start of the trial, defendant moved to suppress “any and all statements” he made to the police officers who interrogated him after taking him into custody on May 7, 2015.1 He contended that those statements were “obtained by the Police in violation of his rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution [and] Article I, Section 6, of the Rhode Island Constitution, and they are therefore barred as admissible evidence under RIGL § 9-19-25.” A suppression hearing was held with respect to defendant’s motion.', 'A', 'The Audio Recording of the Interrogation at Issue', 'Before delving into the testimony at the suppression hearing, we deem it necessary for the sake of clarity to review some of what occurred during the custodial interrogation, especially those portions thereof with which defendant takes issue on appeal.', 'An audio recording of the interrogation was played in its entirety for the trial justice at the suppression hearing and has been listened to in its entirety by this Court.2 It was also played in its entirety for the jury at trial. The parties do not dispute what occurred during that interrogation, but they do disagree as to the effect which what occurred may have had on defendant’s exercise of his free will. 1', 'The record reflects the fact that Mr. Munir filed a motion to suppress pro se and that a second motion to suppress was later filed on Mr. Munir’s behalf by his appointed counsel. 2', 'We note that we also have the benefit of a transcript of the audio recording, which was part of the record presented to us, having been entered as an exhibit for identification at trial.', '-2-', 'The audio recording reveals that the interrogating detectives frequently used vulgarity and sometimes raised their voices to defendant. Moreover, they subjected him from time to time to what fairly can be characterized as a barrage of questions. It should also be noted that, throughout the interrogation, Mr. Munir had his left hand handcuffed against the wall of the interrogation room.', 'During the course of the interrogation, the detectives represented to Mr. Munir that his DNA might be found on portions of the victim’s body, and they actually stated that a DNA sample was at the Department of Health at that moment—despite the fact that it is undisputed that no DNA had been found. At another point in the interrogation, as defendant states in his brief before this Court, “the detectives pretended to be handcuffed to each other to pantomime the defendant in the position of being handcuffed to another defendant and led before a judge where it would become known that he had requested to know the results of the DNA test.” The defendant alleges that that pantomime was also meant to intimidate defendant by suggesting that other prisoners would find out that he was charged with child molestation.', 'Importantly, defendant was asked by one of the detectives: “Do you have anything else you want to say? Did you do it?” The defendant responded: “I don’t -- I have nothing else to say.” Also of note is the fact that, during the course of the interrogation, the police suggested to Mr. Munir that, if he believed that the victim was sixteen, “in the eyes of the Court” that would not be “frowned upon;” and they also told him that, if he “thought she was 16,” “[t]he State of Rhode Island says, yes.”', 'At the start of the interrogation, defendant denied having molested the underage victim. However, at the end of the approximately one and a half hour interrogation, defendant ultimately', '-3- confessed to having sexually molested the victim, although he said that he did not believe that there had been penetration.', 'We now proceed to relate the salient testimony adduced at the suppression hearing.', 'B', 'The Suppression Hearing Testimony', 'Detective Christopher Rotella was the only person to testify at the suppression hearing. It was his testimony that, as a member of the Providence Police Department, he had served as a “sex crimes detective” for approximately eight years. He testified that an arrest warrant for Mr. Munir was effectuated on May 7, 2015. Detective Rotella added that, before talking with Mr. Munir on that date, he enlisted the assistance of Detective Joseph Hanley and they proceeded to the cell block, where Det. Rotella read Mr. Munir his rights and asked if he would like to speak to the detective. It was Det. Rotella’s testimony that Mr. Munir agreed to speak with the detectives, so he escorted Mr. Munir to an “interview room or interrogation.” Detective Rotella testified that he then read Mr. Munir’s rights to him a second time and that Mr. Munir signed the “rights form.”', 'The audio tape of the full interrogation was then played for the trial justice at the suppression hearing.', 'After the audio recording was played, Det. Rotella was asked by the prosecutor why he used vulgar language during the interrogation. He stated that “[i]n this particular case it’s just a matter of getting the person to feel comfortable, getting down to not necessarily their level, but discussing the situation to make them feel the most comfortable.” When asked if he threatened Mr. Munir in any way, Det. Rotella responded in the negative. He added that, except for handcuffing Mr. Munir to bring him to the interview room, neither he nor Det. Hanley “put his hands” on Mr. Munir.', '-4-', 'On cross-examination, Det. Rotella was asked to describe his training in conducting interrogations. It was his testimony that he had been trained in the Reid technique, and he stated that “the Reid format is where you mirror the suspect or you develop a rapport with the suspect.”', 'Detective Rotella further testified on cross-examination that he was aware when he interrogated Mr. Munir that there were no “physical findings” in the case. He added that, “[w]hile I was speaking with him, I could tell the way he was answering me that he probably had more to say.” He further stated:', '“[T]here was a couple times during that interview I would ask him', 'a question, and he would pause because I was almost done and ready', 'to end the interview on a couple of occasions during that interview.', 'However, because of his reaction to my questions or his facial', 'expressions, that’s why I continued.”', 'Detective Rotella further testified on cross-examination that part of the Reid technique consists of “press[ing]” the suspect for an answer when he or she does not remember something. Detective Rotella added that he had used a tactic where he started to discuss the existence of DNA evidence, but he pointed out that he never actually told Mr. Munir that the police had his DNA. However, Det. Rotella also conceded on cross-examination that the interrogation was “a little chaotic * * *.”', 'Lastly, Det. Rotella was asked on cross-examination about the pantomime which he and Det. Hanley performed during the interrogation of defendant—which pantomime portrayed one prisoner being handcuffed to another prisoner and brought before a judge. Regarding that pantomime, Det. Rotella stated that its purpose was not to intimidate defendant. Rather, he stated, it had been done only to “give him an example of what it would look like when he’s standing in front of a judge saying, ‘We’re going to wait for the DNA,’ but he doesn’t want to tell me whether or not we’re going to find it in her vagina.” He added that he performed that pantomime because', '-5- “[w]hen you get arraigned and you’re standing in front of a Judge, as I know for 20 years, the prisoners ordinarily don’t come up one at a time. They come up handcuffed to each other. That’s not something that I created. That’s something that’s part of the process.”', 'We note as well that, when asked by the trial justice whether there had been the capability to videotape the interrogation, Det. Rotella stated that the video recording system was “not operable at that time.”', 'He added that he was not obliged to make a video recording of the interrogation.', 'C', 'The Decision of the Trial Justice on the Motion to Suppress', 'At the close of the suppression hearing, the trial justice issued a bench decision denying defendant’s motion to suppress. The trial justice initially noted that the state was required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that defendant’s statements made during the interrogation were voluntary—which she stated meant that it was “the product of his free and rational choice” and not “extracted * * * by coercion or improper inducement including threats of violence or any undue influence that overcomes the free will of the Defendant.” She added that the court would look to the totality of the circumstances. She then concluded that defendant was intelligent, educated, articulate, and a “mature adult.”', 'In addressing the pantomime that the detectives performed, the trial justice expressed her view that Det. Rotella’s “explanation that he was really doing a re-creation of what it would look like in court because defendants are always brought up chained to another defendant isn’t particularly credible.” She accepted “Defendant’s version that the officer probably wanted to intimidate [him],” and she added that “of course the State has to prove by clear and convincing', '-6- evidence that he didn’t make that demonstration for that purpose.” She stated that, ultimately, she wasn’t “sure.”', 'Turning next to the issue of the use of vulgarity, the trial justice found that “[i]t was not used to make the Defendant comfortable;” but rather “[i]t was used to intimidate him.” She stated that, on the audio recording, the officers were “bullying the Defendant by yelling at him over each other,” and she found that it was “difficult to listen to * * *.” She further addressed Det. Rotella’s testimony about the “facial expressions of the Defendant as giving him reason to make determinations as to credibility,” and she flatly stated that “the Court rejects that.” She added that “[i]t was just too easy for a detective who didn’t make use of video equipment to justify his conduct by saying, Well, you know, I had the opportunity to observe the manner in which he spoke, his facial expressions.”3', 'The trial justice further ruled that there was no “unambiguous clear indication by this Defendant that he wished to stop the interview, that he wished to now assert his right to remain silent.”', 'The trial justice added that she was “totally unimpressed by the police tactics in this case,” although she acknowledged that the police “are permitted to use vulgarity,” “deception,” to “keep probing and probing,” and also to make the defendant “uncomfortable.” She then specifically addressed the point relative to one of the detectives having told defendant during the interrogation that, if defendant thought the victim was sixteen, “‘that’s it. That’s the bottom line. The State of Rhode Island says yes.’” With respect to same, she stated: “Bluffing or lying about evidence, 3', 'We deem it important to note that it is far and away the better practice to videotape the entirety of all custodial interrogations which, like the one at issue in this case, take place in the police station where video equipment should be readily available. We would strongly urge police officers in this state to hearken to our advice in that regard.', '-7- implied threats of punishment, implied promises of leniency are not sufficient to conclude that the confession was the product of overcoming the free will of an intelligent adult.”', 'Lastly, the trial justice noted that the interrogation “wasn’t a six-hour interrogation” and that defendant had not been deprived of sleep, food, or drink beforehand. She added that defendant “appear[ed] calm” and that he “appeared to understand the questions, to hold his own, [and] to challenge [the detectives’] positions.”', 'Although she found the motion to suppress to be “troubling” and “not an easy one,” the trial justice concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, the state had proven “by clear and convincing evidence that the confession was knowing, intelligent and voluntary, not the product of coercion and threats.” She accordingly denied defendant’s motion to suppress his statements to the police during his interrogation.', 'A trial then took place over several days in May of 2017. For the purposes of this opinion, we need not relate the testimony at that trial. The jury ultimately found defendant guilty of the one count against him, and his motion for a new trial was thereafter denied. He was subsequently sentenced to thirty-five years, with twenty-three years to serve and twelve years suspended with probation. He was also required to register as a sex offender.', 'A judgment of conviction entered on July 6, 2017, and defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In reviewing a trial justice’s ruling with respect to a motion to suppress a “statement which a defendant has alleged was made involuntarily,” we employ “a two-step analysis.” State v.

In the first step, this Court reviews the factual findings of the trial justice “relative to the issue of the voluntariness of the confession.” Barros, 24 A.3d at 1179; see also State v. Perez, 882 A.2d 574, 588 (R.I. 2005). In so doing, we “accord deference to the trial justice’s findings of historical fact unless those findings are clearly erroneous.” Barros, 24 A.3d at 1179; see also Taoussi, 973 A.2d at 1146. A finding of fact is considered to be clearly erroneous only “when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the basis of the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.” Barros, 24 A.3d at 1179 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Perez, 882 A.2d at 588.', 'We will proceed with the second step of the analysis “[i]f we conclude that the trial justice’s findings of historical fact were not clearly erroneous * * *.” Barros, 24 A.3d at 1179.

Assessing whether or not a knowing and intelligent waiver took place requires “an analysis of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.” Id. at 734 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In this instant case, the trial justice found Mr. Munir to be an intelligent, educated man; she further found him to be articulate and to be a “mature adult.” She found that he had been advised of his rights and that he had agreed to speak with the detectives, thus waiving his rights. Our review of the record discloses nothing that would support a conclusion that those factual findings were clearly erroneous. See Barros, 24 A.3d at 1179.', 'We turn then to the trial justice’s legal conclusion that Mr. Munir’s statements during his interrogation were knowing and intelligent. See id. Detective Rotella testified that he read Mr. Munir’s rights to him before bringing him to the interrogation room, and the transcript and audio recording reflect the fact that he informed Mr. Munir of his rights a second time in the interrogation room. Mr. Munir answered in the affirmative when asked if he understood his rights. He confirmed to the detectives that he was able to read and write in English. He actually read some of his rights back to the detectives, including the right to remain silent. Mr. Munir then confirmed to the detectives that he had signed the “rights form.” When Det. Rotella asked Mr. Munir if he wanted to talk to the detectives, Mr. Munir agreed.5 It is thus clear to this Court, as it was to the trial justice, that, upon taking into account the totality of the circumstances of defendant’s 5', 'We note that, during the interrogation, Mr. Munir never invoked his right to counsel or his right to remain silent (although he contends otherwise, see Part III.B, infra).', '- 11 - interrogation, he was properly advised of his rights, and he understood those rights as well as the consequences of waiving them. See Musterd, 56 A.3d at 938. As such, in our judgment, the state demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Munir’s statements during his interrogation were knowing and intelligent. See id.', 'Establishing that the trial justice did not err in determining that Mr. Munir’s waiver of his Miranda rights was knowing and intelligent does not end the inquiry. We must now consider whether or not Mr. Munir’s statements to the police were voluntary. We have stated that “[a] statement is voluntary when it is the product of [the defendant’s] free and rational choice.” Musterd, 56 A.3d at 938 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 734. In contrast, a statement is involuntary when it is “extracted from the defendant by coercion or improper inducement, including threats, violence, or any undue influence that overcomes the free will of the defendant * * *.” Musterd, 56 A.3d at 938 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Barros, 24 A.3d at 1180. When reviewing the voluntariness of a confession, we consider “the totality of the circumstances surrounding the challenged statement.” Musterd, 56 A.3d at 938 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Gouin, 182 A.3d 28, 34 (R.I. 2018). We have further stated that, “[a]bsent evidence that [defendant’s] will was overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired because of coercive', 'police', 'conduct[,] * * * his waiver * * * was voluntary under * * * Miranda.” Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 734 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'We look first to the factual findings of the trial justice. See Barros, 24 A.3d at 1179. With respect to the issue of voluntariness, the trial justice found that she was not “sure” if the pantomime performed during the course of the interrogation was intended to intimidate defendant. She added that the use of vulgarity was intended to intimidate defendant and make him uncomfortable. She', '- 12 - noted the yelling and bullying by the detectives; but she also acknowledged that police are permitted to use vulgarity and to use deception with respect to the state of the evidence. She also found that the interrogation was not overly long and that defendant had not been deprived of sleep, or food, or drink before the interrogation. She added that Mr. Munir appeared to be calm and to “understand the questions, to hold his own, [and] to challenge [the detectives’] positions.” Upon listening to the audio recording of the interrogation, reading the transcript of the interrogation, and considering the transcript of the suppression hearing, we do not perceive any basis for holding that any of the trial justice’s findings of fact were clearly erroneous. See id.', 'Moving to the second step in our analysis, we acknowledge that the trial justice was “troubl[ed]” and “unimpressed” by the conduct of the police in this case, and we are certainly not favorably impressed by the tone of the interrogation or some of the tactics employed by the detectives. See id. Nevertheless, we too reach the same conclusion as the trial justice—i.e., that Mr. Munir’s statements were voluntary.', 'There are numerous indications throughout the interrogation of the fact that Mr. Munir was voluntarily speaking with the police. Mr. Munir stated, at one point during the interrogation: “I’m openly talking to you guys * * *.” He was asked thereafter whether he chose to talk to the detectives, and he said: “I chose to talk to you as a statement. Now, it’s getting turned around on me, because I --[.]” Not long after that remark, he added that he was “being open with” the detectives and that he was “talking to” them; he stated that that fact should “mean something.” Mr. Munir also expressly indicated to the detectives during the interrogation that he was “sitting here talking.” Thus, we consider Mr. Munir’s own statements to be strong indicators of the voluntariness of the statements which he made during the interrogation, but we will nonetheless proceed to address some of the other facts pointed to by Mr. Munir on appeal.', '- 13 -', 'Mr. Munir mentions that he was handcuffed to the wall during the interrogation. However, we have held that “handcuffing defendant’s hand to the wall * * * does not negate the voluntariness of a confession.” Barros, 24 A.3d at 1181; see also State v. Hall, 940 A.2d 645, 657 (R.I. 2008); State v. Humphrey, 715 A.2d 1265, 1275 (R.I. 1998). We further note that Det. Rotella implied to Mr. Munir that the police were in possession of a DNA sample from the complaining witness’s body and that they would have it tested to see if it matched Mr. Munir’s DNA, despite the fact that no DNA evidence had been collected. But we have held that “law enforcement officers may inform a suspect, truthfully or otherwise, of the evidence against him.” State v. Marini, 638 A.2d 507, 513 (R.I. 1994). What is more, as the detectives did in this case, “[l]aw enforcement agents are also permitted to tell an accused that his cooperation would be ‘helpful’ to him * * * and that a confession would ‘make it better’ * * *.”', 'Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Additionally, while the trial justice was unsure with respect to the intent behind the pantomime at issue, it is our view that, even recognizing that the issue of intent is fog-shrouded and unresolved, the pantomime did not constitute coercive conduct.6', 'We certainly acknowledge that the interrogation by the detectives contained a significant level of vulgarity, raised voices, and a barrage of questions. It is also evident that it was stated to Mr. Munir during the interrogation that, if he had been under the impression that the victim was sixteen, that would not be “frowned upon” and that the state would say “yes.”7 But we are simply 6', 'It should go without saying that the trial justice, the jury, and this Court would have been better able to evaluate the pantomime issue if the interrogation had been videotaped. 7', 'We pause to note that the extent to which the police can lie with respect to the law in a custodial interrogation is certainly not limitless. See, e.g., People v. Thomas, 8 N.E.3d 308, 313- 14 (N.Y. 2014) (“It is well established that not all deception of a suspect is coercive, but in extreme forms it may be. Whether deception or other psychologically directed stratagems actually eclipse individual will, will of course depend upon the facts of each case, both as they bear upon the means employed and the vulnerability of the declarant.”); see also Miller v. Fenton, 796 F.2d 598, 607', '- 14 - not convinced that those facts, even coupled with the other circumstances that we have described, were sufficient to constitute the overbearing of Mr. Munir’s will. See Jimenez, 33 A.3d at 734. He is an intelligent adult, whom the trial justice characterized as remaining rather calm through the course of the interrogation and as clearly understanding the questions he was being asked. In addition, Mr. Munir did not invoke his right to counsel. He was not subject to any threats or violence. Thus, we are unable to conclude, based on the totality of the circumstances in this case, that Mr. Munir’s statements to the police were coerced or not the product of his own free will. Having carefully reviewed the record, we are able to say with confidence that the state met its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the statements to the police at issue in the case were voluntary.', 'Accordingly, we can perceive no error in the conclusion of the trial justice that Mr. Munir’s statements to the police were knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.', 'B', 'Invocation of the Right to Remain Silent', 'The defendant contends on appeal that he invoked his right to remain silent during his interrogation. He points specifically to the following exchange:', '“DETECTIVE ROTELLA: Do you have anything else you want to', 'say? Did you do it?', '“HASIM MUNIR: I don’t -- I have nothing else to say.”', 'Thus, for the purposes of this issue on appeal, we are concerned with whether or not Mr. Munir invoked his right to remain silent when he stated that he had “nothing else to say.” If a suspect validly invokes his or her right to remain silent, the interrogation should cease and his or (3d Cir. 1986) (“While a lie told to the detainee about an important aspect of the case may affect the voluntariness of the confession, the effect of the lie must be analyzed in the context of all the circumstances of the interrogation.”).', '- 15 - her right to cut off questioning should be “scrupulously honored.” Michigan v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96, 104 (1975) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U.S. 98, 103-04 (2010); Miranda, 384 U.S. at 473-74; State v. Iovino, 524 A.2d 556, 561 (R.I. 1987); see also G.L. 1956 § 9-19-25. In the context of this case, if Mr. Munir in fact invoked his right to remain silent, as he contends he did when he stated that he had “nothing else to say,” anything that he said after that invocation would not have been admissible against him.', 'With respect to this issue, the trial justice found that there was no “unambiguous clear indication by this Defendant that he wished to stop the interview, that he wished to now assert his right to remain silent.” In such a situation, the trial justice’s determination is a mixed question of fact and law with respect to a constitutional question and thus requires us to conduct our review in a de novo manner. State v. Dumas, 750 A.2d 420, 424, 425 (R.I. 2000) (stating that the question of whether a suspect’s words could be “reasonably understood as a request for counsel is a mixed question of law and fact”). Upon thorough consideration of the record before us, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in determining that Mr. Munir did not invoke his right to remain silent in the instant case. Indeed, we would have reached the same conclusion.', 'In Davis v. United States, 512 U.S. 452 (1994), the United States Supreme Court held that a suspect must “unambiguously” invoke his or her right to counsel under Miranda. Davis, 512 U.S. at 459. The Supreme Court held in that case that the police need not cease an interrogation if the invocation of the right to counsel is “ambiguous or equivocal * * *.” Id. The Supreme Court subsequently stated in Berghuis that “there is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the Miranda right to remain silent and the Miranda right to counsel at issue in Davis.” Berghuis, 560 U.S. at 381; see also State v. Sabetta, 680 A.2d 927, 932 (R.I. 1996) (stating that an ambiguous and equivocal statement invoking the right to', '- 16 - counsel did not require the cessation of questioning and applying that same standard to the invocation of the right to remain silent). The Supreme Court in Berghuis further pointed out that, “[i]f an ambiguous act, omission, or statement could require police to end the interrogation, police would be required to make difficult decisions about an accused’s unclear intent and face the consequence of suppression if they guess wrong.” Id. at 382 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court went on to hold that the defendant in that case had not unambiguously invoked his right to remain silent just by saying nothing for a sufficient period of time during the interrogation; the Court noted that the defendant did not say that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk with the police. Id.', 'It is clear to this Court that Mr. Munir likewise did not unambiguously and unequivocally invoke his right to remain silent. The statement “I have nothing else to say,” when considered in the context of the question-and-answer nature of the interrogation at issue—i.e., in response to a question asking if he had anything else to say—does not, in this Court’s considered opinion, rise to the level of an unambiguous invocation of the right to remain silent.', 'We have previously held that a statement by a suspect to the effect that he “needed time to think plus his silence in the face of any questions” did not constitute an invocation of the suspect’s right to remain silent. State v. Peabody, 611 A.2d 826, 836 (R.I. 1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have also held that the statement “I don’t want to talk about it right now” expressed an intention to remain silent only “in regard to the moment” and thus was not an unequivocal invocation of the right to remain silent. Sabetta, 680 A.2d at 932. What is more, we have held that a suspect stating that he had nothing to say at that time was also not tantamount to invoking his right to remain silent. State v. Pacheco, 481 A.2d 1009, 1015-16 (R.I. 1984). In our opinion, Mr. Munir’s statement to the effect that he had “nothing else to say,” in view of the context in', '- 17 - which he uttered it, is in line with the statements in the just-referenced cases. It did not amount to an unambiguous and unequivocal invocation of his right to remain silent.', 'Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s denial of Mr. Munir’s motion to suppress his statements to the police during his interrogation.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. We remand the record to that tribunal.', 'Justice Flaherty, with whom Justice Robinson joins, concurring.', 'I endorse the majority’s eloquent and well-reasoned opinion in this case and the outcome the Court reaches. I nonetheless am constrained to write separately to reiterate my ongoing and persistent misgivings as to the practice of interrogating suspects in police custody without the benefit of a videotape of the interrogation. Confessions are the ultimate inculpatory evidence in a criminal trial, and an admission of guilt from the defendant’s own tongue cannot help but have an enormous impact on a factfinder. Indeed, it is for this very reason that the police work so hard, as they should, to obtain them.', 'However, without a video recording of the interrogation, any discussion of the interrogation at trial inevitably devolves into a “swearing contest.” State v. Kekona, 886 P.2d 740, 746 (Haw. 1994). As I have mentioned in prior dissents and concurrences to previous opinions of this Court: “Invariably, jurors are tasked with determining whose story to believe: the police, who categorically say that the accused was calm, comfortable, and subjected to no inappropriate', '- 18 - physical or emotional pressure, or the defendant, who often complains of emotional browbeating and physical deprivation.” State v.

Bojang, 138 A.3d 171, 181 (R.I. 2016) (Flaherty, J., and Robinson, J., concurring); State v. Bojang, 83 A.3d 526, 545 n.7 (R.I. 2014) (Flaherty, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part).', 'Indeed, such is the case here, where defendant claims that he unequivocally invoked his Fifth Amendment right to silence, but the detective who conducted the interrogation testified that he continued the interrogation “because of [defendant’s] reaction to my questions or his facial expressions[.]” Unfortunately, and, in my opinion, unacceptably, the trial justice and the members of the jury were deprived of the opportunity to evaluate defendant’s facial expressions and body language for themselves because they did not have the benefit of a video recording. Although an audio recording of Mr. Munir’s statement was made and offered into evidence, Detective Rotella testified that he did not videotape the interrogation because the “video recording system was down” in that particular interrogation room on the day in question, and, in any event, there was no policy requiring him to record a video of the interrogation.8', 'I cannot accept this feeble excuse. In this age of smartphones and tablets, police officers need reach no further than their own pockets to find a device capable of video recording an interrogation. In fact, Detective Rotella testified that he used his own device to make the audio recording that is in evidence. Adding video to that recording would have been no more difficult than propping up a smartphone in a corner of the room. I find it bewildering that depositions in 8', 'The record is not altogether clear on the operability of the video system on the relevant date, but there certainly was no impediment to bringing defendant to the police station of a neighboring community so that his statement could be recorded. In any event, it is clear that the detectives had no intention of videotaping defendant’s statement because there was no requirement that they do so.', '- 19 - civil cases are recorded with increasing frequency, but an interrogation with a defendant’s liberty on the line need not be. As I have said before, “[i]n this day and age, a person cannot avoid being videotaped when he enters an office building or retail establishment, or even when he cashes a check. That being the case, it is perplexing to me that he can confess to a capital crime without the benefit of having his statement recorded, even when the necessary equipment is readily available.” Bojang, 83 A.3d at 545 n.7 (Flaherty, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part).', 'As of this writing, twenty-five states and the District of Columbia now require or encourage, in one form or another, custodial interrogations to be recorded.

On appeal, the respondent asserts: (1) that the Family Court magistrate erred in denying the respondent’s request for a hearing pursuant to Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978); that the trial justice erred in (2) determining that the search warrant was supported by probable cause; (3) deciding that the police did not need to obtain a new search warrant after they determined that their original warrant was based on misinformation; and (4) not suppressing the respondent’s oral statements to the police at the residence where the search warrant was executed. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decisions below on issues one through three and conclude that the respondent waived argument regarding the fourth issue.', 'I', 'Technical Background', 'Because cases involving the crime of possession of child pornography often involve technical terminology, and because a basic understanding of these principles is crucial to analyze', '-1- the issues before the Court, we will begin with an overview of the technical background and vocabulary pertinent to this case before delving into the facts.', 'An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a unique string of numbers that all computers or mobile devices that connect to the Internet acquire. Commonwealth v. Martinez, 71 N.E.3d 105, 107 (Mass. 2017) (citing Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, Beginners Guide to Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses 2, 4 (2011)). IP addresses are owned by an Internet service provider (ISP), such as Cox Communications, Inc. (Cox). See id. When a person purchases Internet service from an ISP, the ISP selects from a roster of IP addresses under its control and assigns a unique IP address to the subscriber at a particular physical address. Id. A subscriber’s IP address may change, but the ISP keeps a log of which IP address is assigned to each subscriber at any given moment in time. Id. In the Internet’s early days, the correlation between an IP address and a subscriber to a particular computer was stronger, because a residential Internet subscriber went online using only a home computer connected to a hard-wired Internet connection. Id. Today, though, many subscribers use a wireless Internet router to connect their laptops, cell phones, and other mobile devices to the Internet. See id. These wireless routers allow multiple devices within the router’s range to connect to the Internet at the same time. Id. Consequently, “the correlation between an Internet subscriber’s assigned IP address and any one particular Internet-enabled device may often be weaker than it once was.” Id. at 108. Nevertheless, “the correlation between an IP address and a physical address can still be strong, at least when the ISP has verified its assignment of a particular IP address to a subscriber at a specific physical address at a specific point in time.” Id.', 'Additionally, the matter before the Court also concerns a “peer-to-peer file-sharing network.” When a person uses these types of file-sharing services, it is akin to “leaving one’s', '-2- documents in a box marked ‘free’ on a busy city street.” Clifford Fishman & Anne McKenna, Wiretapping and Eavesdropping § 23:25 at 88 (2016) (internal citations omitted). In order to use a peer-to-peer network, an individual must download software for the program. Peer-to-peer networks use hash values to verify the content of electronic files that are available for copying.1 Hash values—commonly referred to as “electronic fingerprints”—consist of “a string of numbers that, for all practical purposes, uniquely identifies a digital file” and will change any time a file is altered. Martinez, 71 N.E.3d at 108 n.1. Over time, law enforcement and other entities have identified and confirmed that certain hash values contain child pornography.', 'II', 'Facts and Travel', 'We now turn to the facts of the matter before us. On January 2, 2015, Coventry police detective Kevin Harris, a member of the Rhode Island Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force (ICAC),2 informed North Smithfield police detective Stephen Riccitelli, also a member of ICAC, that on December 31, 2014, someone was using a peer-to-peer file-sharing network via the IP address 68.9.210.241, and was suspected of possessing and sharing images of child pornography. Detective Harris advised Det. Riccitelli “that a direct connection was made to the aforementioned IP address and several files of suspected child pornography were downloaded.” Accordingly, Det. Riccitelli viewed one of the files and confirmed it to be consistent with the definition of child pornography contained in § 11-9-1.3.3 1', 'The search warrant affidavit in this case describes a hash value as “an alpha-numeric string * * * that is calculated by applying a mathematical algorithm to the electronic data that is contained in an electronic file.” 2', 'The ICAC is a task force administered by the Rhode Island State Police. 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-9-1.3 defines “child pornography” as:', '-3-', 'With this information, Det. Riccitelli conducted an inquiry with the American Registry of Internet Numbers (ARIN) and determined that Cox was the ISP that owned the IP address. Thus, Det. Riccitelli “sent legal process to Cox Communications in order to obtain subscriber information for the account associated with the IP address” on the date in question; in response, Cox identified a Mr. Barrows of 246 Sackett Street, Unit 2, Providence, Rhode Island (246 Sackett Street) as the subscriber.4', 'Detective Riccitelli requested a “State Control package,” which did not uncover relevant information, and he also performed a “cross-agency check,”5 which revealed that Mr. Barrows was associated with 246 Sackett Street and that he was also associated with another address out of state. Moreover, Det. Riccitelli conducted surveillance in the area of 246 Sackett Street and observed what appeared to be a three-story house, “gray in color with matching gray trim[,]” and the number “246” affixed to the front. In his initial investigation, Det. Riccitelli also performed a search for 246 Sackett Street on Vision Appraisal, which indicated that Whitmarsh Corporation (Whitmarsh)', '“any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video,', 'picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture,', 'whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other', 'means, of sexually explicit conduct where:', '“(i) The production of such visual depiction involves the use of a', 'minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;', '“(ii) Such visual depiction is a digital image, computer image, or', 'computer-generated image of a minor engaging in sexually explicit', 'conduct; or', '“(iii) Such visual depiction has been created, adapted, or modified', 'to display an identifiable minor engaging in sexually explicit', 'conduct.” Section 11-9-1.3(c)(1). 4', 'In the warrant, Mr. Barrows was identified by his first and last name. However, because it is not alleged that Mr. Barrows had any involvement in the criminal activity giving rise to this case, we will simply refer to him as “Mr. Barrows” throughout this opinion in an effort to maintain some anonymity. 5', 'Detective Riccitelli testified that a cross-agency check is something that police officers use to input an individual’s name and date of birth in order to show contacts that the individual has had with other law enforcement agencies in the state.', '-4- owned the property. The appraisal company also listed 246 Sackett Street as a three-family property.', 'Armed with this information, Det. Riccitelli applied for a search warrant for “Computer hardware, computer software, computer-related documentation, records, documents, material, and passwords or other data security devices related to the acquisition, possession and transfer of child pornography.” The search warrant permitted the search of “[t]he person of [Mr.] Barrows * * * and the premises located at 246 Sackett Street, Unit 2[.]” Detective Riccitelli also filed a supporting affidavit with his search warrant application, along with Attachments “A” and “B.”6 In the affidavit, Det. Riccitelli explained the details relating to his investigation, as well as the necessary technical background. On February 10, 2015, the District Court judge found that probable cause existed and signed the search warrant.7', 'The police executed the warrant the next day.8 When the officers arrived at 246 Sackett Street, the front door was unlocked, and they proceeded inside. Once inside the residence, the officers continued up a staircase to the second-floor landing, where, as Det. Riccitelli later testified, there was only one door.9 One of the officers knocked on the second-floor door, and they were 6', 'Detective Riccitelli testified that “Attachment A” contains definitions of terms included in the items to be seized and “Attachment B” explains “volume of evidence” and talks about the technical requirements involved when searching computer systems for evidence of criminal activity. Detective Riccitelli further testified that these attachments were included with the search warrant for purposes of educating the District Court judge. 7', 'We acknowledge that the terms “judge” and “magistrate” are often interspersed in the context of caselaw concerning search warrant applications. We further note that several judges, as well as a magistrate, were involved throughout the travel of this case, and many of them have since acquired new titles. For ease of reference herein, we will refer to them in their capacities at the time of the proceedings in this case. 8', 'There is some discrepancy as to the number of officers that were present the morning of the search; however, the parties appear to agree that there were between six and ten officers present. 9', 'Detective Riccitelli testified that he recalled two doors on the first floor, one marked with the number “1.”', '-5- met by a man who identified himself as Frank Akinmurele. It was around this time that the officers learned that 246 Sackett Street was a Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) group home owned by Whitmarsh, and that Mr. Akinmurele was a Whitmarsh employee. Moreover, the officers inquired about Mr. Barrows and learned that Mr. Barrows was employed by Whitmarsh, but that he no longer worked at the 246 Sackett Street location. The officers also learned that the Internet service for 246 Sackett Street remained in Mr. Barrows’ name for financial reasons, despite his employment at a different location.', 'Thereafter, the officers passed through the second-floor door. A few of the officers then gathered the residents and placed them in the common area while other officers executed the search warrant.10 The second-floor layout consisted of a staff office, two bedrooms, a common area, a kitchenette, and a bathroom. In executing the search, the officers “located the router that was used for the Internet service at that location in the office.” Detective Brian Macera of the Rhode Island State Police entered one of the bedrooms and located two LG cell phones next to the bed, one of which had a “cracked” screen. Detective Macera also located a binder with respondent’s name on it in that bedroom. When Det. Macera attempted to view the contents of the damaged phone, he determined that the cell phone was password-protected and proceeded to the common room where the residents were sitting. Detective Macera asked the occupants whose bedroom it was that he had been in and who owned the cell phones; respondent identified the bedroom and the cell phones as his own. Upon Det. Macera’s request, respondent provided his passcode to the cell phone; Det. Macera performed an “on-site preview” of the contents of the cell phone.11 10', 'Detective Riccitelli testified that this was “protocol for officer safety” and to “make sure there is no one hiding and there are no other officer safety issues.” 11', 'At the suppression hearing and at trial, the witness testimony only spoke to the evidence found on the damaged phone.', '-6-', 'Detective Macera’s “on-site preview” of the cell phone revealed a folder entitled “Pix.” In that folder, Det. Macera located approximately fifty to one hundred images that he believed to be child pornography.12 After the images were discovered on respondent’s phone, respondent was arrested, taken into custody, and transported to the Lincoln Woods State Police barracks (the barracks).13', 'On October 5, 19, and 27, 2015, a waiver hearing was held in Family Court pursuant to the state’s request that the case be transferred to Superior Court. On January 28, 2016, a Family Court justice issued a bench decision denying the state’s motion. Subsequently, respondent filed a motion requesting a Franks hearing and a motion to suppress evidence—the state objected to both motions.', 'A', 'Motion for a Franks Hearing', 'On March 18, 2016, the parties presented arguments concerning respondent’s request for a Franks hearing before a Family Court magistrate.14 The respondent asserted that he was entitled to a Franks hearing because Det. Riccitelli, “at a minimum[,]” provided the signing District Court judge with information in the application for the search warrant “with a reckless disregard to the truth.” The respondent argued that “Cox specifically stated the information being provided was 12', 'A later digital forensic investigation of the cell phone revealed approximately 2,480 images of child pornography. The state had originally filed a second petition against respondent for transferring child pornography, pursuant to § 11-9-1.3; however, prior to trial the state dismissed that petition. 13', 'Laura Hay, the residential director of Whitmarsh at the time, was informed that respondent had been arrested, and she went to the barracks to accompany him. Ms. Hay was present when the police interviewed respondent at the barracks. 14', 'In Franks, the United States Supreme Court announced a procedure to challenge warrants alleged to have been obtained through misleading affidavits. Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978).', '-7- for limited business purposes only and they could not guarantee that it represented information linking the identified customer to the State Police’s investigation.” The respondent acknowledged that Det. Riccitelli ran Mr. Barrows’ name through the law enforcement databases and conducted physical surveillance of 246 Sackett Street and that Det. Riccitelli based the affidavit supporting the warrant on that information.', 'However, respondent maintained that Det. Riccitelli’s investigation and cross-agency check could not confirm that Mr. Barrows resided at 246 Sackett Street and did not reveal any information regarding who lived inside the home.', 'In opposing the motion, the state contended that Det. Riccitelli’s statement that Mr. Barrows resided at 246 Sackett Street “was neither intentionally made to deceive, nor was it made in reckless disregard of the truth and, in addition, it’s immaterial and irrelevant to finding probable cause in this case.” The state further argued that, even if Det. Riccitelli’s statement was cast aside, “there still exists a substantial basis * * * to find the probable cause to search that residence.”', 'At the conclusion of the parties’ arguments, the Family Court magistrate issued a bench decision denying respondent’s motion. First, the Family Court magistrate found that respondent had standing. Next, he noted the significance of Det. Riccitelli seeking and obtaining information from Cox to ascertain subscriber information for the account associated with the IP address. The magistrate acknowledged the discrepancy between Det. Riccitelli’s testimony that he could not confirm that Mr. Barrows resided at 246 Sackett Street versus the affidavit language indicating that a review of law enforcement databases confirmed that Mr. Barrows did reside there. He further highlighted Det. Riccitelli’s testimony explaining that the link established in performing the cross-agency check did not necessarily mean that Mr. Barrows resided there, but rather that he had a connection to the address. Ultimately, the magistrate stated: “I cannot find, based upon the arguments and the documents that have been presented to me, that the word resides being placed', '-8- in the affidavit—and I do believe it would be hyper-technical scrutiny for the [c]ourt to do this— was intentionally and recklessly placed in the affidavit for the sole purpose of obtaining a search warrant.” The magistrate also emphasized that, while not to respondent’s satisfaction, Det. Riccitelli did perform follow-up investigative work when he surveilled 246 Sackett Street and completed a cross-agency check. Lastly, the magistrate found that “even if it was removed from the affidavit * * * there is still sufficient evidence” for a finding of probable cause; he therefore denied respondent’s motion for a Franks hearing.', 'B', 'Motion to Suppress', 'The respondent also filed a motion to suppress the fruits of the search of 246 Sackett Street, asserting that the affidavit supporting the search warrant application was insufficient to establish probable cause. This motion was heard before a Family Court justice who later presided over the trial. The parties presented testimony and arguments on May 2 and 3, 2016. At the suppression hearing, respondent argued that the officers lacked probable cause to obtain a warrant, and contended that, pursuant to Maryland v. Garrison, 480 U.S. 79 (1987), the police were required to obtain a new search warrant when they realized that the warrant was based on misinformation. Specifically, respondent averred that the warrant was invalid based on Mr. Barrows being named, because Mr. Barrows did not reside at 246 Sackett Street. Further, respondent contested the use of “Unit 2,” as there is no such thing as a “Unit 2” at 246 Sackett Street, and because the property was improperly listed in the warrant as a three-family residence. As such, respondent averred that the evidence obtained from the invalid search—namely, the cell phone—should be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.', '-9-', 'The state argued that the crucial fact in this case was that Det. Riccitelli had information about the criminal activity occurring and “that they had a fair probability that it was occurring at a particular place.” The state explained that having the subscriber information and location, as well as the IP address, is sufficient to establish probable cause and has routinely been upheld in federal courts. Moreover, the state, relying on our opinion in State v. Storey, 8 A.3d 454 (R.I. 2010), argued that search warrants are directed at places, not people. The state further contended that the officers acted reasonably in the execution of the warrant.', 'At the suppression hearing, Det. Riccitelli, Det. Macera, and Ms. Hay testified, mostly reciting the facts discussed above. Detective Riccitelli’s testimony is central to this matter. Detective Riccitelli testified that Det. Harris advised Det. Riccitelli that a computer user at IP address 68.9.210.241 was using a peer-to-peer file-sharing network to share files suspected to be child pornography. Detective Riccitelli testified that he viewed one of the aforementioned files and confirmed that the file was consistent with the definition of child pornography. Thereafter, Det. Riccitelli used ARIN to determine that Cox owned the IP address. Accordingly, Det. Riccitelli sent an administrative subpoena to Cox to obtain subscriber information associated with the IP address. On January 26, 2015, Cox responded to the legal process and identified Mr. Barrows, of 246 Sackett Street, Unit 2, Providence, Rhode Island, as the subscriber on the date in question.', 'Armed with that information, Det. Riccitelli conducted a review of various law enforcement databases and confirmed that Mr. Barrows was, at one time, associated with that address. Moreover, Det. Riccitelli conducted surveillance of 246 Sackett Street and observed the structure to be a three-family residence, gray in color with matching gray trim. Detective Riccitelli stated in the affidavit that his training and experience led him to reasonably believe that a device', '- 10 - with Internet connection within 246 Sackett Street was used to facilitate the possession of child pornography.', 'On May 3, 2016, the trial justice issued a decision on respondent’s motion. The court first explained that “it is reasonable to conclude that Unit 2 refers to the second floor of that property at 246 Sackett Street.” The court then addressed the use of Mr. Barrows’ name in the affidavit, and cited Storey for the proposition that search warrants are not directed at persons but instead authorize the search of places and the seizure of things. The court explained that “Mr. Barrows is like the proverbial red herring. It may smell a lot. It may smell the case up a lot, but it really has no bearing on the issue before this [c]ourt.” The court found that the combination of the reasonable inferences drawn from the facts of this case “certainly indicated probable cause to search that property[.]” The trial justice upheld the validity of the search warrant and denied respondent’s motion to suppress.', 'C', 'Bench Trial and Decision', 'Shortly thereafter, the trial was held on May 16 through 18, 2016. At trial, Det. Riccitelli described much of the same information that he testified to at the suppression hearing. A representative from Cox and Det. Macera also testified. On May 19, 2016, the trial justice rendered a bench decision. The trial justice recounted the testimony of Det. Riccitelli and discussed the warrant and the affidavit with attachments, noting the significance of the attachments. The trial justice then highlighted the “extensive cross-examination” that occurred regarding the issue of Mr. Barrows being named on the warrant and the reference to “Unit 2.” Then, the trial justice reviewed the testimony of Det. Macera.', '- 11 -', 'The trial justice stated that he “felt the [c]ourt had an obligation to comment on” the questions that were asked at 246 Sackett Street regarding whose room was on the second floor and whose cell phones the officer had seized. He reiterated the findings of fact that he had announced at the suppression hearing and ultimately concluded that, “based on the totality of the evidence, including the property seized, in accordance with the search warrant, the admissions made by the Respondent, after validly waiving his Miranda Rights, and based upon a clear reading of * * * [§] 11-9-1.3 * * * the Respondent has violated Section 11-9-1.3 of the Rhode Island General Laws, and is found to be delinquent.” The trial justice sentenced respondent to commitment at the Training School until his nineteenth birthday, suspended, with probation.15', 'Additionally, respondent was required to register as a sex offender for ten years following the completion of his sentence, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-37.1-4(a). The respondent timely appealed.', 'The respondent raises four arguments on appeal: (1) the Family Court magistrate erred in denying respondent’s request for a Franks hearing; (2) the search warrant was unsupported by evidence of probable cause; (3) the police improperly executed the warrant, as they were obligated to obtain a new search warrant once they learned that Mr. Barrows did not reside at 246 Sackett Street; and (4) respondent’s statements to Det. Macera at the residence and the images recovered from his cell phone should have been suppressed. 15', 'The respondent’s nineteenth birthday was two days after his sentencing.', '- 12 -', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Franks Hearing', 'In an effort to remain consistent with the travel of the proceedings below, we will first address respondent’s argument that the Family Court magistrate erred in denying his request for a Franks hearing. In Franks, the United States Supreme Court announced a procedure, which we subsequently adopted, to challenge warrants allegedly obtained using misleading affidavits. See Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56; State v. Verrecchia, 880 A.2d 89, 94 (R.I. 2005). The Supreme Court explained that “where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary to the finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant’s request.” Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56; see State v. Tejeda, 171 A.3d 983, 997 (R.I. 2017). Moreover, “to raise a Franks challenge, a defendant must establish standing in the area or items sought to be searched and seized by the challenged warrant.” State v. Patino, 93 A.3d 40, 59 (R.I. 2014).', 'The respondent posits that Det. Riccitelli did not properly verify any of the information about Mr. Barrows and ignored the fact that the cross-agency check provided another address for him in addition to 246 Sackett Street. The respondent argues that the magistrate should have found that the challenged statements in the warrant application recklessly disregarded the truth and that he should have quashed the warrant and the fruits obtained therefrom.', 'In reviewing a request for a Franks hearing, this Court has explained that “[t]here must be allegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth, and those allegations must', '- 13 - be accompanied by an offer of proof.” Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 99 (quoting Franks, 483 U.S. at 171). We review a decision to deny a respondent’s request for a Franks hearing with deference. Tejeda, 171 A.3d at 997. Moreover, we have stated: “If the statements under attack are found to be sufficiently false and are set aside, but ‘there remains sufficient content in the warrant affidavit to support a finding of probable cause, no hearing is required.’” Id. (quoting State v. DeMagistris, 714 A.2d 567, 574 (R.I. 1998)).', 'The Family Court magistrate properly denied respondent’s request for a Franks hearing. Affording deference to the magistrate, our review of the record does not reveal anything within the affidavit that rises to the level of a knowing or intelligent false statement or one made with reckless disregard for the truth. Instead, Det. Riccitelli’s investigation ensued after he received information that someone was sharing child pornography on a peer-to-peer file-sharing network from a device with the IP address 68.9.210.241. Using that information, police were able to make a direct connection between the device using that IP address and downloaded child pornography. Accordingly, Det. Riccitelli learned that Cox was the ISP for that IP address, and the detective sent an administrative subpoena to Cox requesting subscriber information. The statement that Mr. Barrows resided at 246 Sackett Street did not entitle respondent to a Franks hearing. Even if we disregard Mr. Barrows’ name in the warrant affidavit, there was probable cause for the search warrant, as explained in more detail below, when considering the information regarding the IP address, the confirmation from Cox, and Det. Riccitelli’s surveillance of 246 Sackett Street.', 'B', 'Search Warrant Based on Probable Cause', 'On appeal, respondent raises two issues concerning the search warrant: (1) whether the warrant was based on probable cause and (2) whether the police properly executed the warrant.', '- 14 - The respondent first asserts that “[t]he search warrant drafted by the state police here got everything wrong and nothing right—not the name of its target, not the place he resided, not the specific address to be searched.” The respondent contends that “[t]he underlying problem was that the state police drafted the warrant application as if they had independently verified the information supplied by Cox Communications, while knowing full well that they had not done so.” Essentially, respondent challenges the adequacy of Det. Riccitelli’s investigation, and argues that “[a]n IP address alone should not supply the probable cause for a search warrant when blatantly incorrect information about the identity of the alleged offender is connected to it * * *.”', 'When this Court conducts a review of a search warrant that has issued, it accords “great deference to the issuing magistrate’s probable-cause determination, so long as there is a showing of a substantial basis from which to discern probable cause.” Tejeda, 171 A.3d at 996 (quoting Storey, 8 A.3d at 460). The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution dictates that a warrant must “particularly describ[e] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U.S. Const. Amend. IV. Similarly, article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution requires that a warrant “describ[e] as nearly as may be, the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.” R.I. Const. art. 1, § 6. We have stated that “an affidavit offered in support of a search warrant should not be judged as if it had been drafted by one schooled in the niceties of the law nor should it be interpreted in a hypertechnical manner.” Tejeda, 171 A.3d at 996-97 (quoting Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 94). This Court has further explained that “the approach to the probable cause question should be pragmatic and flexible.” Id. at 997 (quoting Verrecchia, 880 A.2d at 94). “[O]ur ultimate inquiry asks whether the magistrate made a ‘practical, common-sense determination’ that ‘there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.’” Storey, 8 A.3d at 461 (emphasis added).', '- 15 -', 'We explained in State v. DeLaurier, 533 A.2d 1167 (R.I. 1987), that “the name in [a] warrant is unnecessary to the warrant’s validity.” DeLaurier, 533 A.2d at 1170; see also Storey, 8 A.3d at 466.', 'Instead, “[t]he application requires the name of the owner ‘if known.’” Id. Importantly, we have made clear that “[s]earch warrants are not directed at persons; they authorize the search of places and the seizure of things, and as a constitutional matter they need not even name the person from whom the things will be seized.” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U.S. 547, 555 (1978)).', 'This Court has not yet addressed the precise issue of whether information that an IP address at a particular physical address is being used to send or receive child pornography creates a reasonable probability that the child pornography will be found within that physical location. However, several federal and state courts have agreed that it does. See, e.g., United States v. Featherly, 846 F.3d 237, 240 (7th Cir. 2017) (holding that “the connection between an IP address and a modem at an Internet subscriber’s residence is sufficient to justify a search”); United States v. Vosburgh, 602 F.3d 512, 526 (3d Cir. 2010) (agreeing with “several Courts of Appeals [that] have held that evidence that the user of a computer employing a particular IP address possessed or transmitted child pornography can support a search warrant for the physical premises linked to that IP address”). In fact, respondent “acknowledges that a number of courts have found that probable cause may be established solely through evidence of an IP address connected to a specific residence rather than the identity of the subscriber.”', 'The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court recently decided a case with facts similar to the matter now before us, concluding that an IP address at a certain location was sufficient to establish probable cause to search that location. See Martinez, 71 N.E.3d at 114. In Martinez, the defendant appealed from his conviction of possession of child pornography, arguing “that the police needed', '- 16 - to do more to link the defendant to the place searched and the items seized before a warrant could validly issue.” Id. at 107. There, the investigating officer discovered that a computer using a specific IP address was using a peer-to-peer sharing network and sharing suspected child pornography. Id. at 108. The officer then conducted an Internet search and determined that Comcast Cable was the ISP for that IP address; the officer issued a subpoena to Comcast to obtain the subscriber information for the IP address. Id. at 108-09. After the officer obtained the defendant’s name (as the subscriber) and the physical address associated with the IP address, the officer referred the investigation to the local police department, and an officer there sought and received a search warrant based on that information. Id. at 109.', 'On appeal, the central question before the court in Martinez was whether the information that the IP address had been assigned at the time in question to an Internet subscriber at a specific physical address was “sufficient to establish probable cause for the search, even though the named subscriber was neither listed as, nor confirmed to be, living in the unit, and even though police had no information before the search linking the defendant to the residence.” Id. at 110. In holding that the warrant was valid, that court concluded “that there was probable cause to search for evidence related to sharing child pornography based on the information police obtained through their [peer-to-peer network] surveillance and the administrative subpoena, independent of whose name was on the Internet account or in the housing development’s records.” Id. at 111-12. Moreover, the court stated that: “The temporal and geographical links between the target IP address and the physical address to be searched provided a substantial basis for concluding that evidence sought (computers and related items) was connected to the suspected crime (possessing or sharing child pornography) and likely would be found at the specified premises (the apartment),', '- 17 - and therefore gave rise to a sufficient nexus between the suspected criminal activity and the residence.” Id. at 111.', 'We are mindful that searches of computers and cell phones lend themselves to situations where the danger of the Fourth Amendment’s privacy concerns may well be at its greatest. Nevertheless, we are satisfied that Det. Riccitelli’s actions here alleviate those concerns. In line with the officers’ investigations in Martinez, Det. Riccitelli did take steps to corroborate and develop the information he received from Det. Harris. While Det. Riccitelli might have been more thorough in his investigation, the law does not require him to do so. Upon being informed that the IP address 68.9.210.241 was suspected of involvement with child pornography, Det. Riccitelli reviewed the images associated with that IP address and confirmed that the images were consistent with the definition of child pornography in the statute, based on his training and experience. Then, Det. Riccitelli determined that Cox was the ISP for the IP address at issue, and he accordingly requested subscriber information from Cox. After learning the physical address associated with the IP address, Det. Riccitelli performed a cross-agency check and confirmed that Mr. Barrows, the named subscriber, had once had an affiliation with the address. The respondent makes much of the fact that Det.

Similarly, here, the warrant application listed the correct IP address and the correct physical address linked to that IP address. The fact that Mr. Barrows was personally named, but not a resident of 246 Sackett Street, does not invalidate the warrant. As in Martinez, we opine that Det. Riccitelli’s investigation established probable cause to search for evidence relating to child pornography at 246 Sackett Street, Unit 2, despite Mr. Barrows being the named person in the search warrant. Accordingly, we affirm the hearing justice’s denial of respondent’s motion to suppress.', 'C', 'Execution of the Search Warrant', 'Additionally, respondent asserts that, even if the warrant was based on probable cause when issued, “it should have become immediately clear to the officers upon entering the Sackett Street group home that they were confronted with a plethora of new information and they needed a new warrant.” The respondent argues that the police were required to seek a new warrant when they entered 246 Sackett Street, proceeded to the second floor to an unmarked door, and when Mr. Akinmurele informed them that: (1) it was a DCYF group home for minor residents, not a multifamily structure and (2) Mr. Barrows—the named target of the warrant—was a Whitmarsh employee but did not reside there. The respondent contends that “because the location the magistrate intended to be searched in the warrant was diametrically different than the place the', '- 19 - officers searched, the evidence seized therein should have been suppressed.” To the contrary, the state argues that the warrant permitted the police to search “Unit 2” and that the police were reasonable in believing that the second floor of the building constituted that unit.', 'This Court’s “review of whether a warrant states with sufficient particularity (or as nearly as may be) the description of the place to be searched * * * requires bifurcation.” Storey, 8 A.3d at 460. We afford great deference through application of the clearly erroneous standard to the “findings of fact made by the trial justice in denying a motion to suppress for want of particularity[.]” Id. Thereafter, this Court conducts a de novo review in “the application of constitutional law regarding particularity to the facts.” Id.', 'The respondent relies heavily on Garrison for the proposition that the officers, upon learning new information about the use of 246 Sackett Street and the fact that Mr. Barrows did not reside there, were required to seek a new warrant. In Garrison, the police obtained a search warrant for the third-floor apartment of a suspect named McWebb. Garrison, 480 U.S. at 80. “When the police applied for the warrant and when they conducted the search pursuant to the warrant, they reasonably believed that there was only one apartment on the premises described in the warrant.” Id. As it turned out, however, there were two apartments, and the police initially entered the wrong one, where the defendant resided. Id. Before the officers realized they were in the wrong apartment, they discovered contraband leading to the defendant’s arrest. Id. The defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence found in his apartment, arguing that the search was invalid pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Id. at 80-81. The Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s decision to deny the suppression motion, reasoning that “[t]he objective facts available to the officers at the time suggested no distinction between McWebb’s apartment and the third-floor premises.” Id. at 88. The Court explained that, if the officers had', '- 20 - become aware of their mistake prior to entering the apartment, they would have been obligated to limit their search. Id. at 86. Further, the Court stated: “Prior to the officers’ discovery of the factual mistake, they perceived McWebb’s apartment and the third-floor premises as one and the same; therefore their execution of the warrant reasonably included the entire third floor.” Id. at 88. In conclusion, the Court noted that “the officers’ conduct was consistent with a reasonable effort to ascertain and identify the place intended to be searched within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.” Id. at 88-89.', 'The facts of this case are distinct from those of Garrison. In Garrison, the officers were in the wrong apartment because there were two apartments on the third floor, instead of one. Here, the fact that 246 Sackett Street was being operated as a group home does nothing to invalidate the fact that the officers reasonably and objectively believed that the only second-floor apartment constituted the “Unit 2” that the warrant authorized them to search.', 'Detective Riccitelli had received credible information that a crime had occurred through the use of the IP address. Detective Riccitelli then went through the phases of his investigation to determine that the IP address was associated with the physical address of 246 Sackett Street, Unit 2, and that the structure was a multifamily unit. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Det. Riccitelli had any information that Unit 2 did not exist. When the police arrived at 246 Sackett Street, they proceeded to the second floor of the structure and knocked on the only door there. Upon passing through the door, the officers were confronted with a layout consistent with an apportioned multifamily structure. The respondent’s bedroom was on the second floor, and the cell phone containing child pornography was seized from that bedroom.', 'Further, as discussed at length herein, Mr. Barrows’ whereabouts is irrelevant to the execution of the warrant as his name was not required for a valid warrant to issue. The', '- 21 - respondent’s suggestion that Mr. Akinmurele’s statements to the police required them to get a new warrant is also misplaced. See United States v. Ayers, 924 F.2d 1468, 1479-80 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that the police had the right to execute the warrant, notwithstanding the defendant’s mother’s statement that the defendant did not reside at the residence, because the police had independently confirmed the address in their investigation). Mr. Akinmurele could have been Mr. Barrows, or could have been the suspect using a device associated with the IP address. Consequently, the police here acted reasonably based on the objective facts known at the time. The warrant described the place to be searched and the items to be seized with sufficient particularity, and the officers were permitted to perform the search on that existing warrant.', 'D', 'Custodial Interrogation at the Home', 'For the first time on appeal, respondent raises a custodial-interrogation argument, asserting that his statements to police at 246 Sackett Street and the evidence obtained from his cell phone as a result of those statements should be suppressed. Specifically, respondent now contends that “even if one were to assume that the state police entered and searched the group home pursuant to a valid search warrant, the statements [respondent] made to the police while detained inside his home * * * should have been suppressed because at the time those statements were made [respondent] was a juvenile in police custody and under interrogation who had not been advised of his rights.” The respondent challenges his statements to police admitting his residence in the searched bedroom, acknowledging his ownership of the cell phone, and providing his PIN number needed to access the phone’s contents.17 17', 'The respondent does not raise any argument on appeal concerning statements made at the barracks after his arrest.', '- 22 -', 'The state maintains that respondent’s arguments regarding custodial interrogation and any statements he gave while the officers searched the home are waived. The state highlights that respondent failed to raise the argument below and, even when encouraged by the trial justice to do so, only disputed the admissibility of his statements at the barracks or referred back to his search warrant arguments.', 'Pursuant to our “raise-or-waive” rule, we will not consider respondent’s arguments pertaining to this issue on appeal.

Romero, 193 A.3d 1167, 1170-71 (R.I. 2018) (explaining that “[i]n accordance with this Court’s longstanding ‘raise-or-waive’ rule, if an issue was not properly asserted, and thereby preserved, in the lower tribunals, this Court will not consider the issue on appeal”) (quoting Miller v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 160 A.3d 975, 980 (R.I. 2017)). We have made clear that, “in order to satisfy the strictures of our ‘raise-or-waive’ rule, an evidentiary objection must be ‘sufficiently focused so as to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis for said objection.’” State v.

Fogarty, 433 A.2d 972, 974 (R.I. 1981).', 'Prior to trial, respondent filed a motion challenging the validity of the search warrant, arguing that his statements at the barracks should be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree. During closing arguments at the suppression hearing on May 3, 2016, the trial justice explained that his understanding was that the suppression hearing “was directed, essentially, towards the search warrant and the execution of the search warrant and not whether or not the statements made by the Respondent were in any way coerced or in violation, say, of his Miranda rights.” At that', '- 23 - time, respondent’s counsel specifically stated: “[T]here hasn’t been an issue raised with respect to whether my client was in custody for Miranda purposes when he gave those answers.”', 'Notably, the trial justice invited the respondent to brief the issue of custodial interrogation and also invited the respondent to file a motion and have another hearing on the issue, notwithstanding the respondent’s failure to make a motion on those grounds. Anytime the topic of custodial interrogation at 246 Sackett Street did arise at trial, the respondent’s arguments consistently referred back to the search-warrant argument, contending that the statements should be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree. At trial, the respondent’s counsel asked Det. Riccitelli: “Prior to being interrogated at the police station, [the respondent] did not make a statement to the police, correct?” Detective Riccitelli responded: “Prior to his interview, no.” After that question, counsel continued with her cross-examination, never probing Det. Riccitelli on the subject of custodial interrogation at 246 Sackett Street. In rendering his decision, the trial justice noted, as he did at the suppression hearing, that the court “did not find that a significant challenge was made by Respondent to the voluntariness of the statement or the voluntary waiver of his rights under Miranda.” The trial justice further stated that “[e]verything that was indicated, in the [c]ourt’s opinion, in the nature of challenge, was to the original search warrant and the basis for that, including the affidavit.” Ultimately, the trial justice made his own ruling on the matter, concluding that the respondent was not in custody at 246 Sackett Street and that the respondent “volunteered answers to both questions[.]” For these reasons, we hold that the respondent waived any argument regarding custodial interrogation at 246 Sackett Street.', '- 24 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court.

26,Estate of Brian Chen et al. : v. : Lingting Ye et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The plaintiffs, Brooke Chen, Wei Chen, Yifan Shuai, and the Estate of Brian Chen, seek review of an order entered in the Superior Court that quashed the oral deposition of M.Y., the minor daughter of the defendants, Lingting Ye and Yan Sun. 1 Before this Court, the plaintiffs argue, inter alia, that the hearing justice erred because, instead of prohibiting the oral deposition outright, he should have allowed it to continue under reasonable restrictions that would limit any potential harm to the minor child, who suffers from generalized anxiety, while still preserving the plaintiffs’ right to relevant discovery. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 18, 2016, in East Greenwich, Rhode Island, seven-year-old Brian Chen tragically drowned in a swimming pool while he was attending a party at defendants’ home. 1', 'We have referred to the defendants’ two minor children by their initials, M.Y. and C.Y., in an effort to protect their privacy.', '-1- Although the parties agree that there were several adult guests present at the time, it is in dispute whether any adult was present outside near the pool area when the young boy drowned. The defendants point to decedent’s father’s deposition testimony that that there were ten to fifteen adults in the backyard and at least one child swimming in the pool when decedent’s father left Brian in the backyard. The defendants further allege that there has been no evidence presented that would indicate that there were any children in the pool at the time when the young boy was found floating in the water. On the other hand, although plaintiffs agree that there were several adult guests present on the premises, they nonetheless contend that none of them were near the pool when the drowning incident occurred. Rather, they allege that defendants’ then ten-year- old daughter, M.Y., and Brian were both in the pool area when the tragedy transpired.', 'In December 2016, plaintiffs filed a wrongful death action in Kent County Superior Court against defendants. 2 In their complaint, plaintiffs alleged that defendants’ negligence caused the death of their son based on theories of attractive nuisance, failure to warn, failure to supervise, failure to secure the pool area, and premises liability. In addition to damages for wrongful death, plaintiffs also sought damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress, loss of consortium on their own behalf, and loss of consortium on their daughter’s behalf.', 'In June 2017, plaintiffs sought to depose M.Y., defendants’ minor daughter.', 'The defendants filed a motion to quash the notice of deposition, arguing that M.Y. had mental health issues that both preceded and were as a result of her friend’s death, and that she was actively in treatment for her mental health issues. To support their motion, defendants attached a letter from M.Y.’s psychotherapist, Aleta Johnson, LICSW, who indicated that M.Y. had been in treatment for generalized anxiety for several years, and that, since decedent’s death, her symptoms had 2', 'The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in May 2017.', '-2- become exacerbated. Ms. Johnson also reported that, following Brian’s death, M.Y. had “begun to also show signs of depression, [her] emotional regulation has been more difficult, and her distress has been more pronounced.” The therapist recommended that M.Y. not be deposed because it would “certainly worsen her mental health, and may have negative and lasting consequences to her condition.” The defendants further claimed that there was no reason to depose M.Y. because there were other guests at the party who were outside at the time of the incident.', 'The plaintiffs objected to defendants’ motion to quash, arguing that M.Y. may well have been the sole eyewitness to the tragedy and that they “should be allowed to seek deposition testimony from what they consider a material witness who possesses information that is reasonably calculated to lead to relevant and discoverable evidence.” The plaintiffs believed that M.Y.’s testimony would be important, noting that Brian’s father had testified at his deposition that M.Y. had shouted “I’m sorry” immediately after the incident.', 'A justice of the Superior Court conducted a hearing on the discovery motion. After hearing arguments from both parties, the hearing justice at first decided that he would not stop the deposition from going forward or quash the subpoena, but “reserve[d] to the defendant[s] the right to stop the deposition from going forward at any time[.]” The defendants then suggested that the deposition be accomplished by means of written questions because, according to defendants, this would be less traumatizing for the child “instead of having the child go to a law office, sit down with a stenographer, with lawyers all around her.”', 'The plaintiffs did not agree. They argued that the answers would not be prepared by the child and the “honesty and that spontaneity that the youth tend to deliver” would be lost through “interrogatories which will be guided by adults and by counsel[.]” The hearing justice observed', '-3- that “written deposition questions are provided for under the rule[,]” but he nonetheless reserved his decision.', 'After the parties filed post-hearing memoranda, the hearing justice issued a written order. The hearing justice first noted that “[a] mental health professional [h]as indicated the deposition would worsen the mental health of the child[,]” and he therefore ordered that the notice of oral deposition be quashed. The court also ordered that a deposition on written questions was “allowed in accord with the rules of civil procedure[,]” and required counsel to “draft age appropriate questions and avoid questions designed to ‘ramp up’ the emotions.” Furthermore, the order stated that “[t]he witness shall not be asked about her counseling or any mental health treatment at this time[,]” and he required defense counsel to submit, every six months from the date of the order until the case resolved, a statement from a mental health professional indicating whether M.Y. was fit to be deposed. The court also reserved the right to review any questions to which objections were raised and to modify the order at any time.', 'The plaintiffs filed a petition for issuance of a writ of certiorari with this Court in August 2017; that petition was granted by this Court in December 2017. 3 In February 2018, plaintiffs filed a motion with this Court for a limited remand to depose C.Y., who is M.Y.’s younger brother; the limited remand was granted. The defendants then objected in Superior Court to C.Y.’s deposition based on another report by Ms. Johnson, eerily consistent with her report 3', 'In the order granting plaintiffs’ petition for issuance of a writ of certiorari, this Court permitted the parties to continue with discovery. In addition, before they filed their petition with this Court, plaintiffs had filed a notice of appeal from the hearing justice’s order granting defendants’ motion to quash. In this Court’s order granting plaintiffs’ petition in the present case, we also granted plaintiffs’ motion to dismiss that appeal as procedurally inappropriate.', '-4- regarding M.Y., that C.Y. should not be deposed because he was also being treated and that his condition might be compromised by a deposition. 4', 'In their briefs to this Court, plaintiffs contend that, in July 2018, they deposed the mother of C.Y. and M.Y. and, according to plaintiffs, she testified that both C.Y. and M.Y. had been in the pool with Brian and some other minor children. The plaintiffs also aver that she also testified that, shortly thereafter, the children left Brian unattended at or in the pool just before he drowned. In that same month, plaintiffs issued a deposition subpoena duces tecum for Ms. Johnson, requiring her to appear and produce all records pertaining to the treatment of several of her patients, including C.Y. and M.Y. Not surprisingly, defendants filed a motion to quash that subpoena as well, and that motion was granted by the Superior Court, without prejudice, subject to our decision on the petition before us at this time.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled that ‘our review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination of the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.’” Sandy Point Farms, Inc. v.

Specifically, the only reference to potential harm that Ms. Johnson reports is “[d]eposing [M.Y.] will certainly worsen her mental health, and may have negative and lasting consequences to her condition.” (Emphasis added.)

27,Jason Puerini et al. : v. : Jeanne LaPierre et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. Federal preemption is the subject of this appeal. It arises out of litigation over the vicarious liability of the owner-lessor of a motor vehicle for the alleged negligence of the driver-lessee in a roadway collision resulting in injuries to the operator of a motorcycle. A hearing justice of the Superior Court resolved the case on summary judgment motions. While several theories of liability were alleged in the complaint, the only issue on appeal before us is whether the hearing justice erred by granting summary judgment in favor of the owner of the car—the corporate entity to which the car lease had been assigned—on the basis that a federal law preempted state statutes authorizing vicarious liability of a car owner for the negligent acts of the driver. To resolve the issue, we must address a question of first impression in this jurisdiction—whether the federal Graves Amendment, 49 U.S.C. § 30106, preempts our state laws allowing a party injured in a motor vehicle accident to recover from the title owner of a vehicle through the owner’s vicarious liability for the negligence of the driver. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In the late afternoon of April 25, 2008, Jason Puerini was operating his motorcycle on Great Road in North Smithfield when an automobile turned out of a parking lot in front of him, resulting in a collision. The automobile was driven by Jeanne LaPierre, the co-lessee of the vehicle in a lease originated by Metro Honda, aka Metro Motors Inc. (Metro Motors), and assigned prior to the collision to Honda Lease Trust (HLT). There is no dispute that Puerini sustained multiple serious injuries from the collision.', 'In 2011, Puerini and his wife, Andrea, individually and on behalf of their minor children, filed a multi-count complaint in Providence County Superior Court. In addition to Jeanne LaPierre, the complaint named as defendants LaPierre’s sister, Priscilla MacPherson, co-lessee of the automobile; Metro Motors, the corporate entity that leased the car to LaPierre and MacPherson; HLT, the corporate entity holding the title to the leased vehicle and the lessor by assignment at the time of the accident; and Amica Mutual Insurance Company,1 as insurer for LaPierre and MacPherson. The complaint alleged that LaPierre’s negligence caused Puerini’s injuries, that the corporate defendants were vicariously liable for LaPierre’s negligence, and that Puerini’s wife and children had suffered loss of consortium. MacPherson filed a cross-claim, seeking indemnification and contribution from codefendants in the event that she was ultimately held liable for plaintiffs’ injuries.', 'In 2013, a hearing justice granted plaintiffs’ motion to amend their complaint. The amended complaint added allegations against defendants asserting that, although it was LaPierre 1', 'The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against Amica Mutual Insurance Company a few months later.', '-2- who sought to lease the new vehicle, the corporate defendants intentionally placed MacPherson as the primary lessee (with LaPierre as the co-lessee) without MacPherson’s and LaPierre’s knowledge because LaPierre had been unable to secure financing based on her negative credit history. The amended complaint reasserted several theories of liability against the corporate defendants, including vicarious liability by statute, pursuant to G.L. 1956 §§ 31-33-6 and 31-33- 7, as well as through common law theories of bailment and assignment. The plaintiffs also alleged several new theories of statutory liability against the corporate defendants based on the new allegations, including violation of the state deceptive trade practices act and fraud pursuant to G.L. 1956 §§ 31-5.1-1 and 6-13.1-1, respectively; violation of the federal deceptive trade practices act, 15 U.S.C. § 45; and civil liability pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-1-2. In addition, plaintiffs alleged common law theories of fraud and negligence, and reasserted the counts for loss of consortium. HLT’s answer asserted—as an affirmative defense—that plaintiffs’ theories of liability were preempted by federal law.', 'Between August 2013 and July 2015, Metro Motors and HLT each filed several motions for summary judgment. A hearing on Metro Motors’ motions was eventually held in July 2015, and a hearing on HLT’s motions was held in September 2015. The hearing justice granted the motions, and plaintiffs filed a premature notice of appeal.2 After this Court ordered that this case 2', 'A coordinated effort between the parties and the hearing justice ensued to ensure that plaintiffs ultimately filed a timely notice of appeal. The parties requested that the hearing justice enter final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, and there was much discussion about—and action on—the parties’ motions, resulting in two hearings, an order granting the Rule 54(b) judgment, then an order vacating the Rule 54(b) judgment, before plaintiffs ultimately filed their notice of appeal. The notice of appeal was then premature because, on the day it was filed, no judgment had been entered in the case. After a prebriefing conference, this Court remanded the case to the Superior Court for entry of final judgment, which was entered in June 2017. All of this travel ultimately leads to plaintiffs’ notice of appeal being valid. See Correia v.

First, they argue that HLT was not entitled to summary judgment because, as asserted in one of HLT’s responses to an interrogatory propounded by plaintiffs, HLT was not in the business of leasing or renting motor vehicles at the time LaPierre signed the lease for the vehicle involved in the accident. This interrogatory response, according to plaintiffs, should have precluded summary judgment. Second, plaintiffs argue that the Motor Vehicle Reparation Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 47 of title 31 (MVRA), is a financial responsibility law and thus is not preempted by the Graves Amendment.', 'For its part, HLT argues that plaintiffs waived their argument that HLT is not entitled to the protections from liability pursuant to the Graves Amendment because the question of whether HLT was a dealer in the business of leasing cars at the time the lease was signed was not argued before the hearing justice. Alternatively, HLT argues that it does in fact fall within the scope of the Graves Amendment’s protections because there is no factual dispute that it is a dealer in the business of leasing motor vehicles.

McKiernan, 108 A.3d 1030, 1037 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Dias v. Cinquegrana, 727 A.2d 198, 199 (R.I. 1999)); see also Oliveira v. Lombardi, 794 A.2d 453, 459 (R.I. 2002). Section 31-33-6 “abrogate[d] the common law rule that shielded an automobile owner ‘from liability for the negligence of a person to whom the owner entrusted the vehicle unless such negligence occurred while the operator was engaged in conducting business 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 31-33-7 is not pertinent to the preemptive effect of the Graves Amendment. But, for the interested reader, it provides that:', '“In all civil proceedings, evidence that at the time of the accident or', 'collision the motor vehicle was registered in the name of the', 'defendant, shall be prima facie evidence that it was being operated', 'with the consent of the defendant, and the absence of consent shall', 'be an affirmative defense to be set up in the answer and proved by', 'the defendant.” Section 31-33-7.', '-9- for the owner.’” Id. at 1039 (quoting Dias, 727 A.2d at 199). We interpreted the effect of this statute to hold “a motor vehicle owner vicariously liable for the acts of another driver who drives with the owner’s consent * * * unless that driver ‘furnished proof of financial responsibility’ before the accident.” Id. at 1036-37 (quoting § 31-33-6).', 'We have also previously held that, “for consenting owners [i.e. lessors] to protect themselves from liability under § 31-33-6, the authorized drivers of the leased vehicles must have provided proof of financial responsibility before the accident occurred.” Oliveira, 794 A.2d at 460. Therefore, to the extent that § 31-33-6 “impos[es] liability on business entities engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles for failure to meet [Rhode Island’s] financial responsibility or liability insurance requirements,” § 30106(b)(2), we are of the opinion that § 31- 33-6 is not preempted because it falls within the § 30106(b)(2) savings clause of the Graves Amendment.', 'When HLT filed its first motion for summary judgment, it argued that the Graves Amendment preempted G.L. 1956 §§ 31-34-1 and 31-34-4. Section 31-34-1(a) prohibits a motor vehicle owner “engaged in the business of renting motor vehicles or trucks without drivers” from “rent[ing] a motor vehicle without a driver otherwise than as a part of a bona fide transaction involving the sale of the motor vehicle * * * unless the owner has previously notified the division of motor vehicles of the intention to so rent the vehicle and has given proof of financial responsibility,” in specified amounts. This statutory section does not address liability and so is not affected by the Graves Amendment. In contrast, § 31-34-4 establishes vicarious liability for the title owner of a motor vehicle when the vehicle operator’s negligence causes damage:', '“Any owner of a for hire motor vehicle or truck who has given proof', 'of financial responsibility under this chapter or who in violation of', 'this chapter has failed to give proof of financial responsibility, shall', 'be jointly and severally liable with any person operating the vehicle', '- 10 -', 'for any damages caused by the negligence of any person operating', 'the vehicle by or with the permission of the owner.” Section 31-34-', '4(a). In our opinion, § 31-34-4 clearly conflicts with the Graves Amendment, § 30106(a), because it imposes liability on “[a]ny owner of a for hire motor vehicle or truck” for the negligence of the vehicle’s operators regardless of whether proof of financial responsibility had been provided. Section 31-34-4 is therefore preempted by the Graves Amendment pursuant to the doctrine of conflict preemption. See Verizon New England Inc., 822 A.2d at 193.', 'The MVRA entered the discussion through plaintiffs’ objection to HLT’s motion for summary judgment. This Court has previously recognized the express intent of the MVRA: “[T]o ensure that ‘innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents may be recompensed for the injury and financial loss inflicted upon them.’” Derderian v. Essex Insurance Co., 44 A.3d 122, 129 n.6 (R.I. 2012) (quoting § 31-47-1(b)). Section 3.1 of the MVRA mandates that applicants for registration or renewal of registration of motor vehicles sign a statement certifying, inter alia, that the motor vehicle will not be operated unless the motor vehicle is covered by “financial security.”6 The General Assembly defined “[p]roof of financial security” as the: 6', 'General Laws 1956 § 31-47-3.1 provides, in relevant part, that:', '“(a) No motor vehicle shall be registered and no registration', 'renewed in this state unless the application for the registration of a', 'motor vehicle shall contain a statement to be signed by the applicant', 'who does all of the following:', '“(1) States that the applicant will not operate, or allow to be', 'operated, the registered motor vehicle or any other motor vehicle', 'unless all those motor vehicles shall be covered by financial', 'security;', '“(2) Contains a brief summary of the purposes and operation of', 'this chapter, the rights and duties of the applicant and the', 'penalties for violation of this chapter;', '“(3) Warns the applicant that this chapter does not prevent the', 'possibility that the applicant may be involved in an accident with', '- 11 -', '“proof of ability to respond in damages for liability arising out of', 'the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle as evidenced', 'by an owner’s policy of liability insurance, a financial security bond,', 'a financial security deposit, or qualification as a self-insurer under', 'this title, or in the case of a nonresident, under self-insurance', 'provisions of the laws of the jurisdiction of that nonresident.”', 'Section 31-47-2(15); see also Mendez v. Brites, 849 A.2d 329, 335', '(R.I. 2004).

Therefore, the MVRA does not conflict with the Graves Amendment and is not preempted by it. See Verizon New England Inc., 822 A.2d at 193.', 'B', 'HLT’s Liability', 'Turning now to the allegations and undisputed facts in the present case, there is no dispute that HLT, as title owner of LaPierre’s vehicle, was the “owner” of the vehicle pursuant to § 31- 33-6. See Oliveira, 794 A.2d at 460 (“[L]essors, as legal titleholders and registered owners of the vehicles in question, were ‘owners’ of the vehicles under § 31-33-6, and therefore subject to its vicarious liability provisions.”). In Oliveira, which was decided before the enactment of the Graves Amendment, we held that the owner and lessor of the motor vehicle involved was subject to liability for the negligence of the driver because the driver had not provided proof of financial responsibility before the accident. Id.', 'In performing our de novo review of HLT’s motion for summary judgment, we must examine the evidence HLT submitted in support of its motion as well as the evidence plaintiffs submitted in objection thereto. HLT provided the Superior Court with the “Closed-End Vehicle Lease Agreement” for the vehicle LaPierre was driving at the time of the collision as well as a certified copy of a “Rhode Island Special Financial Responsibility Insurance Certificate” filed by HLT with the Registry of Motor Vehicles in 2001. The Lease Agreement includes LaPierre’s insurance policy details, which demonstrates that she had furnished proof of financial responsibility before the collision occurred. HLT’s financial-responsibility certificate reflects its insurance policy details in effect in 2001, and plaintiffs have not provided any evidence to suggest', '- 13 - that this certificate was no longer valid at the time of the collision in 2008. It is undisputed, therefore, that HLT was in compliance with the state’s mandatory insurance laws.', 'The only attempt plaintiffs make to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact that should have precluded summary judgment in favor of HLT is to assert—for the first time on appeal—that HLT provided contradictory information during the pleading and discovery phases of the case regarding whether it was in fact a “[d]ealer engaged in the business of leasing motor vehicles” pursuant to § 31-47-2(4) of the MVRA, or a “business entit[y] engaged in the trade or business of renting or leasing motor vehicles” pursuant to § 30106(b)(2) of the Graves Amendment. In HLT’s answer to plaintiffs’ amended complaint, it admitted plaintiffs’ allegation that “at all times relevant hereto [HLT] was in the business of leasing long term vehicles to residents in Rhode Island.” The plaintiffs argue before us, however, that HLT provided a contradictory answer in its response to the following interrogatory: “For the time period 2005-2006 was [HLT] required to adhere to any federal, state or local regulations or laws relative to the financing or leasing of motor vehicles?” HLT responded with an objection that the question was overly broad and with the following statement: “Without waiving said objection, [HLT] was not involved in the financing or leasing [of] motor vehicles from 2005-2006. [HLT] was just the owner of some of the vehicles.”', 'It is well settled that, as here, a party can waive an argument on appeal from the grant of summary judgment by not raising it in the trial court for the hearing justice’s consideration. See Dallman v. Isaacs, 911 A.2d 700, 704 (R.I. 2006). Even if plaintiffs had not waived this argument, however, in our opinion this supposedly contradictory interrogatory response would not have demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether HLT was engaged in the business of leasing vehicles because the interrogatory simply brings out a nuance supported by other record evidence in this case. That is, HLT is the title owner to some leased vehicles but is', '- 14 - “not involved in the financing or leasing” side of the business because a business subsidiary (here, Metro Motors) is directly responsible for the procedures leading up to the signed lease agreement and the assignment thereof to HLT.', 'In our opinion, the record in this case shows that there is no genuine issue of material fact that HLT is engaged in the general business of leasing motor vehicles. Because the record evidence demonstrates the absence of a factual dispute with respect to whether HLT had complied with the mandatory insurance requirement that it furnish proof of financial responsibility as a condition of operating as a lessor of motor vehicles, we are of the opinion that HLT was entitled to summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ claims that it is vicariously liable for their injuries.7', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record of this case shall be returned to that tribunal. 7', 'The plaintiffs also argue, for the first time on appeal, that they should be able to pursue an insurance coverage claim against HLT to the limits of HLT’s insurance coverage. Because there is no indication in the record that the plaintiffs have attempted to file a claim with HLT’s insurance carrier and this argument is presented for the first time in the plaintiffs’ appeal, we do not address it.', '- 15 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'Jason Puerini et al. v.

28,"Bacon Construction Co., Inc. : v. : Arbella Protection Insurance Company, : Inc.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on January 17, 2019, on appeal from a grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Arbella Protection Insurance Company, Inc. (Arbella or defendant).', 'The plaintiff, Bacon Construction Co., Inc. (Bacon or plaintiff), challenges the findings of a Superior Court justice that Arbella is not contractually obligated to provide insurance coverage to Bacon, which is listed as an additional insured on the insurance policy at issue. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The material facts in this case are not in dispute. Bacon, having been hired as the general contractor for a construction project at the University of Rhode Island (the construction project), subcontracted with U.S. Drywall (U.S. Drywall or the insured) for structural work on the project. Pursuant to the subcontract agreement (the subcontract), U.S. Drywall was required to obtain a general liability insurance policy that listed Bacon as an additional insured. U.S. Drywall complied with this requirement by purchasing a commercial general liability insurance policy', '-1- from Arbella (the Arbella policy), which included an endorsement naming Bacon as an additional insured. The Arbella policy itself provided for defense and indemnification costs to U.S. Drywall for its work on the project.', 'On December 12, 2014, an employee of U.S. Drywall, Thiago Almeida (Almeida), while performing work at the construction project site, sustained severe injuries when he slipped on ice and fell down a staircase. On June 25, 2015, Almeida filed a complaint (the Almeida complaint) in Superior Court against Bacon, alleging that Bacon’s negligent acts were the proximate cause of his injuries (the Almeida action). Notably, although the Almeida complaint averred that he was performing work in accordance with the subcontract, it contained no allegations of negligence against his employer, U.S. Drywall.1', 'In response to Almeida’s claims, Bacon initially filed a third-party complaint against U.S. Drywall, asserting that U.S. Drywall was contractually obligated to defend and indemnify Bacon; and, in an amended third-party complaint, Bacon included a claim for breach of contract against U.S. Drywall. However, on June 27, 2017, Bacon made what it characterized as “a strategic legal decision” to dismiss all claims in the suit, with prejudice, including those against U.S. Drywall.2', 'Concomitantly, Bacon sought to recover indemnity and defense costs from U.S. Drywall’s commercial general liability insurer, defendant, Arbella. Bacon alleged that, because the Arbella policy named Bacon as an additional insured, Bacon is entitled to indemnification. 1', 'The record reflects that Almeida collected workers’ compensation benefits from U.S. Drywall’s workers’ compensation insurer. 2', 'The hearing justice noted that Bacon “independently reached a settlement agreement with Mr. Almeida that resulted in the dismissal of Mr. Almeida’s lawsuit. Additionally, Bacon voluntarily dismissed with prejudice all of its third-party claims against U.S. Drywall in the underlying action.”', '-2- Arbella, however, took the position that, “based on the additional insured endorsements, Bacon would be an additional insured only with respect to liability for bodily injury caused by our insured acts or omissions.” The additional insured endorsement that is contained within the Arbella policy forms the foundation of this appeal.', 'On May 13, 2016, Bacon filed the present action seeking a declaratory judgment that Arbella is contractually obligated to indemnify and defend Bacon as an additional insured relative to the Almeida action. Bacon subsequently moved for summary judgment, arguing that, pursuant to the unambiguous provisions of the Arbella policy, Bacon, as an additional insured, is afforded the same coverage as U.S. Drywall. Arbella filed an objection, along with a cross- motion for summary judgment, countering that Arbella had no duty to defend or indemnify Bacon as an additional insured because the allegations against Bacon in the Almeida complaint fell outside the scope of coverage provided by the Arbella policy. Arbella asserted that Bacon is entitled to coverage only for liability caused by U.S. Drywall’s acts or omissions; and, according to Arbella, because the Almeida complaint alleges negligence solely against Bacon, Arbella is not required to provide coverage with respect to the Almeida action.', 'On July 26, 2017, the Superior Court justice heard arguments on both motions and issued a bench decision in which she determined that the Arbella policy is clear and limits additional insured coverage to “that which was due, at least in part, to U.S. Drywall’s negligence.” The hearing justice further explicated that, after “looking at the original complaint that contains only allegations against Bacon only for Bacon’s own negligence[,]” as well as “the insurance policy language, and the fact that there is nothing here to suggest that any of these actions could have been attributed to U.S. Drywall, [she did] not believe the facts as presented would trigger the additional insured coverage clause[.]”', 'Arbella’s cross-motion for summary judgment was', '-3- granted, and Bacon’s motion for summary judgment was denied. Judgment entered in favor of Arbella on September 1, 2017. Bacon timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that “[t]his Court reviews de novo a trial justice’s decision granting summary judgment.” Sola v.

Spino Brothers, Inc., 11 A.3d 645, 649 (R.I. 2011). “Accordingly, we review a trial justice’s interpretation of a contract de novo.” Id.', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, Bacon contends that the Superior Court erred in denying its motion for summary judgment and granting Arbella’s cross-motion for summary judgment because, according to Bacon, it is entitled to additional insured coverage under the Arbella policy. Specifically, Bacon argues that the hearing justice erred by: (1) ruling that Bacon is not afforded additional insured coverage under a plain-language reading of the endorsement; (2) ruling that the endorsement includes a negligence trigger; (3) conflating the U.S. Drywall-Bacon', '-4- subcontract and the Arbella policy analyses;3 and (4) ruling that, based on the allegations contained within the Almeida complaint, Arbella does not have a duty to defend Bacon.', 'Entitlement to Additional Insured Coverage', 'We first address Bacon’s argument that, according to the plain language of the additional insured endorsement, Bacon is entitled to coverage. We disagree with this contention. The policy’s additional insured endorsement reads in pertinent part:', '“Who is An Insured is amended to include as an additional', 'insured any person or organization for whom you are performing', 'operations when you and such person or organization have agreed', 'in writing in a contract or agreement, executed prior to an', '‘occurrence’, that such person or organization be added as an', 'additional insured on your policy. Such person or organization is', 'an additional insured only with respect to liability for ‘bodily', 'injury’; ‘property damage’ or ‘personal and advertising injury’', 'caused, in whole or in part, by:', '“1. Your acts or omissions; or', '“2. The acts or omissions of those acting on your', 'behalf;', 'in the performance of your ongoing operations for the additional', 'insured.” (Emphasis added.) In addition, the Arbella policy clearly provides that the terms “you” and “your,” as used throughout the policy, exclusively refer to the named insured, U.S. Drywall. The additional insured endorsement lists Bacon as an additional insured and not as the named insured.4 3', 'We need not reach this issue because we are satisfied that the indemnification clause contained within the U.S. Drywall-Bacon subcontract—which is an entirely separate agreement and not challenged on appeal—is irrelevant to this analysis. Moreover, the subcontract has no bearing on U.S. Drywall’s obligation, if any, to indemnify and defend Bacon because, as agreed upon by both parties, the subcontract’s indemnity provision is clear and unambiguous and is fault-based. Thus, given Bacon’s voluntary dismissal of all its claims against U.S. Drywall, there can be no requisite finding of fault on the part of U.S. Drywall that would trigger these contractual obligations. 4', 'As the hearing justice determined:', '-5-', '“It is well established that this Court applies the rules for construction of contracts when interpreting an insurance policy and that we shall not depart from the literal language of the policy absent a finding that the policy is ambiguous.” Lynch, 965 A.2d at 425 (brackets omitted) (quoting Mallane v. Holyoke Mutual Insurance Company in Salem, 658 A.2d 18, 20 (R.I. 1995)). In order to determine whether the terms of a policy are ambiguous, “we read a policy in its entirety, giving words their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning.” Peloquin v. Haven Health Center of Greenville, LLC, 61 A.3d 419, 431 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Sjogren v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, 703 A.2d 608, 610 (R.I. 1997)).', 'Based on our review of the Arbella policy, we are satisfied that the clear and unambiguous additional insured endorsement provision contains limiting, fault-based language; thereby restricting Bacon’s entitlement to coverage to those situations where liability is attributable, at least in part, to the negligence of U.S. Drywall, the named insured.', 'Initially, we note that the endorsement contains a significant limitation on the availability of coverage. As expressly provided by the endorsement, “[s]uch person or organization is an additional insured only with respect to liability for ‘bodily injury’ * * * caused, in whole or in part, by: (1) Your [U.S. Drywall’s] acts or omissions; or (2) The acts or omissions of those acting on your [U.S. Drywall’s] behalf[.]” (Emphasis added.)', 'Thus, pursuant to this unambiguous language, whether Bacon is entitled to coverage as an additional insured is restricted to those situations where liability is caused by U.S. Drywall’s acts or omissions.', '“the policy’s initial declaration that the words ‘you’ and ‘your’', 'would only refer to the named insured, the additional insured', 'endorsement, in this [c]ourt’s opinion, used the pronouns ‘you’ and', '‘your’ only in reference to the named insured. * * * In fact, the', 'endorsement specifically referred to the additional insured only', 'using that term, ‘additional insured’ or ‘such person or', 'organization.’”', '-6-', 'Bacon next contends that, contrary to the hearing justice’s determination, the additional insured endorsement does not contain a negligence trigger.', 'Bacon points out that the endorsement does not include the term “negligence” and, therefore argues that, under the “plain, ordinary, and usual” interpretation of the policy, additional insured coverage is triggered irrespective of negligence. Bacon contends that, despite the inclusion of the phrase “caused, in whole or in part,” dictionaries “do not define or imply negligence as a requisite aspect of ‘cause.’” Thus, Bacon asserts that an additional insured need only show that the complainant was injured while acting in the course of employment. Lastly, Bacon asserts that, because the endorsement utilizes broad “in whole or in part” language and Almeida was injured while working for U.S. Drywall, which itself was working on behalf of Bacon, Arbella is obligated to provide coverage. We reject these contentions.', 'We are satisfied that the endorsement is fault-based, and expressly provides that coverage as an additional insured is limited to “liability for ‘bodily injury’ * * * caused, in whole or in part, by” the acts or omissions of U.S. Drywall or its agents. Thus, the endorsement, by including the terms “liability” and “bodily injury caused by” one’s acts or omissions, includes a negligence trigger. The fault-based nature of the endorsement is further evinced by the fact that there must be a showing as to how the named insured’s acts or omissions caused the bodily injury at issue.', 'Were this Court to accept Bacon’s interpretation of the policy, Bacon would be entitled to greater coverage than U.S. Drywall, the named insured, because the Arbella policy explicitly excludes from coverage U.S. Drywall’s liability for “bodily injury” to one of its employees. Thus, it is our conclusion that the endorsement is fault-based, meaning that additional insured protection is limited to that which was due, at least in part, to U.S. Drywall’s acts or omissions.', '-7-', 'Having concluded that the endorsement is fault-based, we are of the opinion that Bacon was entitled to additional insured coverage only upon a showing of fault attributable to U.S. Drywall or its agents. Bacon’s voluntary dismissal of all claims against U.S. Drywall and its settlement with Almeida preclude any finding of U.S. Drywall’s negligence to trigger this contractual obligation. Accordingly, we hold that Bacon is not entitled to coverage from Arbella under its policy with U.S. Drywall for claims alleging Bacon’s exclusive negligence.', 'Duty to Defend', 'Bacon also contends that the Superior Court justice erred in ruling that Arbella did not have a duty to defend Bacon based on her finding that the allegations contained within the Almeida complaint did not fall within the risk covered by the Arbella policy. We disagree.', '“It is well settled in Rhode Island that the ‘pleadings test’ is applied in order to ascertain whether an insurer has a duty to defend an insured.” Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island v. Charlesgate Nursing Center, L.P., 115 A.3d 998, 1003 (R.I. 2015). “That test requires the trial court to look at the allegations contained in the complaint, and ‘if the pleadings recite facts bringing the injury complained of within the coverage of the insurance policy, the insurer must defend irrespective of the insured’s ultimate liability to the plaintiff.’” Progressive Casualty Insurance Company v. Narragansett Auto Sales, 764 A.2d 722, 724 (R.I. 2001) (quoting Peerless Insurance Co. v. Viegas, 667 A.2d 785, 787 (R.I. 1995)). Moreover, “when a complaint contains a statement of facts which bring the case within or potentially within the risk coverage of the policy, the insurer has an unequivocal duty to defend.” Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island, 115 A.3d at 1004 (quoting Employers’ Fire Insurance Company v. Beals, 103 R.I. 623, 632, 240 A.2d 397, 403 (1968)).', '-8-', 'Relying on the “pleadings test,” Bacon contends that Arbella had a duty to defend Bacon because the allegations in the Almeida complaint are “potentially” within the risk covered by the Arbella policy. The Almeida complaint alleges negligence exclusively against Bacon. Yet, Bacon maintains that the factual allegations in the Almeida complaint are “unequivocally associated with U.S. Drywall’s work at the [p]roject for Bacon” because Almeida, its employee, “would not have suffered his alleged injuries at the [p]roject were it not for U.S. Drywall’s work on behalf of Bacon[.]” Bacon further asserts that, based on Almeida’s allegations that he slipped on ice while working at the construction project site, “there is a clear potential jury verdict that apportions some contributory negligence to Mr. Almeida for the incident, which is within the risk covered by the Arbella [p]olicy.”', 'After a review of the language of the insurance policy and the factual allegations contained in the Almeida complaint, the hearing justice determined that the Almeida complaint contains only allegations against Bacon for Bacon’s own negligence. The hearing justice noted that “it could be a different story had that complaint against U.S. Drywall not been dismissed[,]” but, nonetheless, concluded that the facts, as presented, do not trigger the additional insured coverage clause. Accordingly, she granted summary judgment in favor of Arbella. We agree with this reasoning.', 'As discussed, the Arbella policy provides additional insured coverage only with respect to liability for injuries that were caused, at least in part, by U.S. Drywall’s negligence, and there are no allegations in the Almeida complaint that U.S. Drywall’s acts or omissions caused Almeida’s injury. The fact that Bacon voluntarily dismissed, with prejudice, all claims against U.S. Drywall and reached a settlement agreement with Almeida is fatal because these actions extinguished any vicarious-liability claims that Bacon could have raised. As such, we conclude', '-9- that the Almeida complaint is devoid of any allegations that bring the underlying case “within or potentially within the risk coverage of the policy[.]” Beals, 103 R.I. at 632, 240 A.2d at 403. It is our opinion, therefore, that Arbella has no duty to defend Bacon in the Almeida action.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant.

29,Joel Trojan : v. : Denise Trojan. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court.', 'The defendant, Denise Trojan, appeals from a judgment of the Family Court ordering the plaintiff, Joel Trojan, to pay $1,796 per month in child support for their minor child, Tiffany, who was born in July 2001. 1 Denise argues that the trial justice erred when he did not order Joel to pay interim and retroactive child support. Denise also contends that the trial justice erred in determining Joel’s gross income for the purpose of calculating his child support obligation because the trial justice did not include income and distributions from an “S” corporation, of which Joel is the sole shareholder. This case came before this Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed on behalf of the parties, we are of the 1', 'To protect the minor child’s privacy, we have given her a pseudonym. We also note that the parties have an adult child who is not the subject of this appeal. Additionally, for the sake of clarity, we refer to the parties and others by their first names; we intend no disrespect.', '-1- opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'The Underlying Divorce Proceeding', 'The parties married in July 1990. In March 2014, Joel filed for divorce and alleged that there were irreconcilable differences which had led to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage. Denise thereafter filed a counterclaim for divorce, which sought, inter alia, child support for Tiffany. On December 16, 2015—the first day of trial—the parties entered into a consent order in which they agreed to the following: (1) joint custody of Tiffany, with physical placement with Denise; (2) that Joel would be awarded all reasonable rights of parenting time with Tiffany; (3) that the marital estate—after allocating for certain cash withdrawals that Denise previously had made—would be divided equally between the parties; and (4) that neither party would address the conduct or fault of the other in connection with the court’s consideration of equitable distribution and alimony.', 'On that same date, Denise was heard on a motion for temporary allowances, which she had filed just two weeks before, on November 30, 2015. Her counsel argued before the trial justice that, during the course of the divorce action, the parties had shared a joint marital account that Denise had been using to support herself and Tiffany. However, she alleged that the account had become depleted approximately one month before the trial began, and that Joel had stopped depositing money into it. Denise’s counsel then represented to the trial justice that, based on her', '-2- calculations, Joel was earning $1.8 million per year. Consequently, Denise asserted that she would be entitled to $16,000 per month in child support pursuant to the child support guidelines worksheet and this Court’s decision in Tamayo v. Arroyo, 15 A.3d 1031 (R.I. 2011).', 'In response, Joel’s counsel argued that there was “at least a million dollars” in the joint account, and that the parties had agreed to divide that account equally. As a result, according to Joel, Denise received $505,000 from the joint marital account in late November, which was around the same time that she filed her motion for temporary allowances. Additionally, Joel argued that Denise’s calculation of his earnings was incorrect because it reflected certain pass- through income that he received from Century Drywall, Inc. (Century), an S corporation of which he was the sole shareholder. 2 Joel also alleged that, after the joint marital account was equally divided, he offered to pay Denise half his monthly salary to support her and Tiffany. This amount, according to Denise’s counsel, was approximately $7,000 per month. Denise had rejected that offer, and chose to pursue child support in the amount of $16,000 per month because, according to Denise, Joel was receiving distributions—in addition to a salary—from Century.', 'The trial justice asked Denise’s counsel whether Tiffany needed the amount of child support that she was requesting; Denise’s counsel replied: “Well, the child doesn’t need 2', 'As we have previously mentioned, “[a]n ‘S’ corporation is a preexisting, closely held corporation that elects to be taxed under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code.” DiLuglio v. Providence Auto Body, Inc., 755 A.2d 757, 763 n.4 (R.I. 2000). “Generally, once the Internal Revenue Service grants this special tax designation to a corporation, the ‘Subchapter S’ corporation’s income ‘is not taxed at the corporate level but is passed through and taxed to its shareholders, in a similar fashion as a partnership.’” Id. (quoting 18 Am. Jur. 2d Corporations § 40 (1985)). “The primary advantage of a ‘Subchapter S’ corporation is the avoidance of double taxation on both individual shareholder and corporate income.” Id. “Although the ‘Subchapter S’ corporation avoids paying income tax on corporate net income, the individual shareholders are taxed on the income they derive from the corporation, including any salaries and dividends.” Id. “Thus, certain income, deductions, and losses pass through a ‘Subchapter S’ corporation to the individual tax returns of each shareholder.” Id.', '-3- [$]16,000 a month.”', 'The trial justice pointed out that some states have said it becomes “ludicrous” when an amount that high is requested for child support; he said that counsel could “negotiate with [Joel’s counsel] if you’d like, concerning an interim payment; but, if you think this particular judge is going to award on an interim basis $16,000 in child support on a monthly basis, you’re sorely mistaken[.]” The trial justice questioned whether Denise was even in need of child support at that time, considering that, according to Joel’s counsel, she had just received $505,000 from the division of the joint marital account, and she was using those funds to support herself and Tiffany during the pendency of the divorce action.', 'Nevertheless, the trial justice concluded that he was “not going to entertain a motion for temporary allowances in anticipation of the divorce hearing[,]” that he was going to “hear it all at the same time[,]” and that he would be willing to award child support retroactively if necessary. Thereafter, from January 2016 until final judgment entered in December 2016, Joel voluntarily paid Denise $2,444 per month in child support.', 'The divorce case was tried on the merits on various dates between December 2015 and July 2016. Relevant to this opinion, during the trial, Joel testified that Century originally had three shareholders: himself, his brother John Trojan, and his brother-in-law Michael Elliott. From January 2012 to December 2013, however, Joel purchased the interests of both John and Mr. Elliott, and he became the sole shareholder of Century. Joel also testified that he had received distributions from Century to pay off his personal note obligations to John and Mr. Elliott for their interests in the corporation.', 'At the conclusion of the divorce trial, the parties entered into a marital settlement agreement in which they disposed of all of the marital assets and liabilities, “with the exception of child support and medical[.]” The trial justice reviewed and approved the marital settlement', '-4- agreement. On August 19, 2016, a decision pending entry of final judgment was entered, which incorporated, but did not merge, the marital settlement agreement and continued the child support issue. Neither party sought review of that decision.', 'B', 'The Child Support Hearing', 'Thereafter, on September 28, 2016, the parties reconvened for a hearing on the issue of child support. The trial justice heard testimony from Joel, Denise, and Justin Amico, CPA, who was the accountant for Century and who had prepared the parties’ personal income tax returns in the past. Mr. Amico testified that, for the period December 31, 2013, through December 31, 2015, Century retained its excess revenues, thus increasing its stockholder equity. Specifically, Mr. Amico said that Century’s total stockholder equity, as of December 31, 2014, was $7,310,276, and according to an “Equity Rollforward Sheet” that was introduced into evidence at the hearing, by the close of 2015, the stockholder equity had increased to $8,361,919. He also testified that, in 2015, Alliant Insurance Services, Inc., a bonding company, required that Century increase its equity to $10 million. Mr. Amico explained that, if Century failed to meet that requirement, the company “could be denied the ability to get a bond which could jeopardize the employment of the 500 to 700 men that Century Drywall employs.” It was Mr. Amico’s opinion that complying with such a requirement was a legitimate business interest because there was a risk that the company would not be able to secure bonds as it bid on future work if it was undercapitalized. It was therefore imperative, according to Mr. Amico, that Century retain as much of its working capital and equity as possible.', 'Mr. Amico further testified that, with respect to 2015, Century had $2,692,793 in net income. Of that amount, $1,641,150 was distributed to Joel; he used those funds to pay for taxes', '-5- on the corporation’s net income, the note payment obligations to John and to Mr. Elliott, and a premium on his life insurance policy.', 'Mr. Amico testified that the remainder of the corporation’s 2015 net income, which was approximately $1 million, was retained by the corporation to increase its stockholder equity. It was Mr. Amico’s opinion that the distributions that were made to Joel for tax liabilities, as well as the note payments for buying out former shareholders, did not inure to Joel’s personal benefit. Moreover, Mr. Amico opined that he never detected any use of Century’s revenues for any purpose other than the distributions as set forth in the balance sheet.', 'The trial justice then asked Mr. Amico directly what the court should use to determine Joel’s gross income, to which Mr. Amico replied: “His W-2 wages, his interest and dividends from his brokerage accounts, and any other rental income.” After the court further inquired as to whether Century’s distributions should be included in Joel’s gross income, Mr. Amico specified that Century’s profits were never distributed to enhance lifestyles and that, based on his experience with Century, including the distributions in Joel’s gross income for child support purposes “would significantly enhance [Tiffany’s] standard of living beyond what’s been provided to date[.]” Mr. Amico further explained that, if Century began to distribute profits to Joel, thus making them available for his personal use, the bonding company might well reject Century’s future bond requests because Century would be “too big and under-capitalized,” which would force the company to shrink and would jeopardize the jobs of its workers.', 'Joel was next to testify; he said that, just a month prior, he had paid Tiffany’s school tuition bill, which was $21,800.', 'He also testified that, as part of the marital settlement agreement, he had just recently paid Denise the sum of $2 million. Further, before that payment, he had remitted $274,000 to her for her interest in certain real estate, and $251,048, representing', '-6- half of the former couple’s 2015 tax refund. Moreover, Joel testified that, under the terms of the recently signed marital settlement agreement, he was also obligated to make, and fully anticipated making, a payment to Denise for $180,000 on October 1, 2016, as well as another payment of $10,000 on that same date and every month thereafter for a period of 120 months. He confirmed that, in total, Denise had received $2,725,660 in cash from him, in addition to the interest she retained in various bank accounts, brokerage accounts, real estate, and other investments.', 'Joel further testified that, after Denise filed her motion for temporary allowances, he had begun to make voluntary monthly child support payments to Denise in the amount of $2,444 per month. That figure, according to Joel, was based on the 2014 wages that were included in his W-2 form, which was $299,325, as well as $257 per month in taxable interest that he received on the joint marital account. With respect to 2015, Joel stated that his wages were $278,344, or $23,195 per month, plus $246 per month in taxable interest on the joint marital account. To compute Joel’s gross income for child support purposes, the 2015 figures were used by Joel’s counsel to complete a child support guideline worksheet that was introduced into evidence. In finalizing that worksheet, Joel also suggested that a four percent return could be expected on the $2,725,660 that had been transferred to Denise when the marital assets were distributed. 3 Based on that worksheet, Joel maintained that his child support obligation should be $1,765 per month. He also testified that, prior to 2011, there were years where he had taken personal distributions 3', 'In calculating the four percent return, Joel’s counsel introduced into evidence a page from The Wall Street Journal newspaper for interest rates as of September 27, 2016. That page was entered as a full exhibit. On the other hand, Denise testified that, at the time of the hearing, she was receiving less than a one percent return on her share of the marital assets. Those assets were being held in certificates of deposit through two financial advising firms.', '-7- from Century; however, he said that none of the distributions since that time had inured to his personal benefit.', 'When Denise took the witness stand, she provided the court with an extensive list of expenses that she alleged were needed to maintain Tiffany’s lifestyle.', 'Included in those expenses were the following: $700 to $800 per month to spend at the mall and for other activities with her friends; $575 every four to six weeks for hair extension maintenance; over $200 per month for hair products; $275 per month on manicures, pedicures, and acrylic nails; $150 to $200 every two weeks on cosmetics; $150 to $200 per month on foot reflexology and massages; between $10,000 to $11,000 per year for vacations, including the cost of bringing one of Tiffany’s friends along; $425 per month on clothing and shoes; and $150 per month for functions attended by Tiffany.', 'On December 14, 2016, the trial justice rendered a bench decision. He first made note of the payments that Denise had received, as well as the payments that remained due to her as a result of the marital settlement agreement. The trial justice then found that Joel’s gross salary for 2015 was $278,344, and that he was the 100 percent shareholder of Century. Furthermore, he made a finding that Century’s 2015 net income of $1,051,643 was retained by the corporation as working capital for a legitimate business reason, and that the retained earnings were not used to shield or manipulate Joel’s income in an effort to reduce or avoid his child support obligation. In arriving at his conclusion, the trial justice relied upon the testimony that Mr. Amico had given at the child support hearing. He found that testimony to be “uncontradicted” and “very informative and quite credible[.]”', 'He also found that Century’s total distributions to Joel in 2015 did not inure to Joel’s benefit and that they should not be included in Joel’s gross income calculation for child support', '-8- purposes.', 'Specifically, the court held that the 2015 distribution to Joel in the amount of $1,235,846, which had been used to satisfy Century’s tax obligations, was reported on Joel’s income tax return because of the corporation’s classification under Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code, and that Joel actually had received no portion of that distribution, nor had the distribution inured to his personal benefit in any way. The trial justice also found that a separate 2015 distribution to Joel that had been used to make payments on the promissory notes to the two former shareholders did not inure to Joel’s benefit. Similarly, the trial justice held that Joel had not received any portion of another 2015 distribution to him that had been used to pay his life insurance premium. Finally, the trial justice determined that no profits from Century had been dispensed to enhance Joel’s lifestyle since the year 2011.', 'With respect to Denise’s original request for an order on interim child support, the trial justice summarized the proceedings as follows:', '“[T]here was some confusion at the time this case initiated relative', 'to a request for temporary orders, as there had not been one earlier,', 'in that the parties had apparently accomplished that by some type', 'of payment of moneys through an account that they both had', 'control over; but, in any event, the Defendant, in fact, filed a', 'motion for temporary allowances, wherein child support was', 'requested on November 30 of 2015. Plaintiff, in fact, filed an', 'objection thereto, and a hearing was held on both the motion and', 'objection back in December, almost exactly to the date, December', '16th, 2015.

Moreover, the court found that the “number of expenses introduced by [Denise] relative to the minor child” were “not only incredulous, but outrageous in some fashion, concerning hair extensions, acrylic nails, foot reflexology, the clothing amount per month, and a number of other expenses.” 4 The trial justice also found that a majority of Joel’s assets were not liquid, as opposed to Denise’s assets, which Joel was paying to her in cash.', 'The trial justice then found that, based on Joel’s 2015 tax returns, Joel’s income consisted of the following: “$23,195 per month in wages and $246 per month in taxable interest from various moneys that were in a joint Schwab account, for a total of $23,441” per month.', 'He calculated Denise’s gross income to be $6,750 per month, which was based on a three percent rate of return on Denise’s share of the marital estate. 5', 'Final judgment was entered on December 19, 2016, and an order summarizing the factual findings of the trial justice’s decision was entered on December 28, 2016. On that same day, Denise timely appealed the December 19, 2016 judgment. 6', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'At the outset, we will address an argument raised by Denise in her Rule 12(A) Statement regarding the applicable standard of review. She argues that the trial justice’s “misinterpretation 4', 'Denise argues that the trial justice, in his bench decision, failed to address numerous expenses that her child incurs. However, by referencing “a number of other expenses” and referring to her expenses broadly in the order, it is clear that the trial justice considered all of Tiffany’s expenses. 5', 'The court also found that a $62,371 taxable refund was reported on the parties’ 2015 tax return and $19,752 in a taxable portion of the parties’ health insurance were not included in either party’s gross income calculation for child support purposes. Moreover, in calculating Denise’s monthly gross income, the trial justice did not include $246 per month that Denise receives in taxable interest from the joint Schwab account. However, whether these amounts should have been included as gross income are not before us in this appeal. 6', 'We note that Tiffany will be turning eighteen years old in July 2019.', '- 10 - and disregard of the formula set forth in the R.I. Child Support Guidelines is a question of law subject to de novo review by this Court.” We disagree. It is axiomatic that “[q]uestions of law in an appeal from the Family Court * * * are reviewed de novo.” Vieira v. Hussein-Vieira, 150 A.3d 611, 615-16 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Palin v. Palin, 41 A.3d 248, 253 (R.I. 2012)). However, in Vieira, the plaintiff claimed, inter alia, that the trial justice erred in calculating his child support obligation by not considering the child support guidelines because an appropriate worksheet was not filed during the course of the divorce proceedings. Id. at 618. We reviewed the trial justice’s determination—his failure to consider the child support guidelines—under an abuse of discretion standard. Id. The same holds true here with respect to all the arguments made by Denise in this appeal.', '“General Laws 1956 § 15-5-16.2(a) provides that the Family Court shall order either or both parents owing a duty of support to a child to pay an amount based upon a formula and guidelines adopted by an administrative order of the Family Court.” Vieira, 150 A.3d at 618 (brackets omitted) (quoting Waters v. Magee, 877 A.2d 658, 665 (R.I. 2005); see § 15-5-16.2(a). “Moreover, ‘we consistently have held that § 15-5-16.2, in conjunction with the support guidelines, requires the trial justice to review the worksheet to determine the base level of child support that the noncustodial parent is required to pay.’” Id.

Mattera, 669 A.2d 538, 542 (R.I. 1996)).', '- 11 -', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Denise argues that the trial justice’s decision ran afoul of § 15-5-16.2(a) because he failed to properly calculate and order temporary child support while the divorce proceeding was pending on December 16, 2015, the first day of the trial, and on July 26, 2016, the day the marital settlement agreement had been entered. Moreover, Denise argues that the trial justice erroneously calculated Joel’s child support obligation by excluding Century’s 2015 S corporation income and distributions from Joel’s gross income.', 'A', 'Interim and Retroactive Child Support', 'Denise first argues that the trial justice did not adhere to § 15-5-16.2 because he did not formally award child support until December 2016—one year after she first requested interim support. Specifically, she argues that, on the first day of trial, December 16, 2015, her motion for temporary allowances was set down for hearing. She contends that the trial justice erred when he prematurely and peremptorily denied her request for $16,000 per month in child support without first calculating child support under the guidelines. Moreover, she avers that the trial justice repeated that error at the July 26, 2016 hearing, at which the trial justice approved the parties’ marital settlement agreement but failed to enter a provisional child support order.', 'It is our opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in not awarding child support on December 16, 2015. On that date, Denise’s counsel conceded to the trial justice that the minor child, Tiffany, did not require $16,000 per month in child support. Additionally, Denise’s counsel acknowledged that Denise had been using funds derived from the joint marital account to support herself and Tiffany while the divorce proceedings were pending. According', '- 12 - to Joel’s counsel, that account had been divided equally between the parties a mere week before Denise’s counsel moved for temporary allowances. It was represented to the court that Denise had received approximately $505,000 from the division of that account. It is our opinion that Denise has failed to prove that the trial justice erred in any way by not ordering an interim child support award at that time. We conclude that the trial justice acted well within the bounds of his discretion when he ruled that ample funds were available to Denise to support herself and Tiffany during the remainder of the divorce proceeding. 7', 'Furthermore, we are of the opinion that Denise’s second argument—that the trial justice erred in failing to order retroactive or interim child support at the July 26, 2016 hearing—was not properly raised below and therefore has been waived. On December 16, 2015, the trial justice told Denise’s counsel that she could negotiate an interim payment with opposing counsel. However, he forewarned her that, “if you think this particular judge is going to award on an interim basis $16,000 in child support on a monthly basis, you’re sorely mistaken[.]” In so doing, the trial justice cited to caselaw outside this jurisdiction for the proposition that “a child only deserves three ponies[.]”8 Nonetheless, he concluded with the following: 7', 'Denise had also been using that same account to support herself and Tiffany before the parties divided the account. 8', 'In his bench decision on December 14, 2016, the trial justice asserted that he was “a proponent of the theories advanced” in Downing v. Downing, 45 S.W.3d 449 (Ky. App. Ct. 2001). In that case, which concerned a modification of child support, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky scrutinized a “share the wealth” approach, which suggests that a court does not need to make findings regarding the children’s needs when child support exceeds the maximum guidelines. Downing, 45 S.W.3d at 455. The appellate court refused to incorporate this approach, finding that, “[b]eyond a certain point, additional child support serves no purpose but to provide extravagance and an unwarranted transfer of wealth.” Id. at 456. It recognized that this reasoning is referred to as the “Three Pony Rule,” which is, “no child, no matter how wealthy the parents, needs to be provided more than three ponies.” Id. (citing Matter of Marriage of Patterson, 920 P.2d 450, 455 (Kan. Ct. App. 1996)). Denise claims that by relying on Downing at the December 16, 2015 hearing, the trial justice peremptorily ruled that such a child support amount would be inequitable to Joel. Even though the trial justice’s reference to Downing at', '- 13 -', '“I’m not going to entertain a motion for temporary allowances in', 'anticipation of the divorce hearing. I’ll hear it all at the same', 'time. If I have to retroactively make an award of child support at', 'the time of the decision, if you folks can’t agree, I’ll be delighted', 'to do that; but I’m not convinced that your client can’t support', 'herself pending this trial, however months or years it goes, quite', 'honestly.” (Emphasis added.) Clearly, the trial justice deferred awarding interim child support in anticipation that the parties would agree upon it. The parties did in fact agree, and there is nothing in the record indicating that Denise raised the issue again at the July 26, 2016 hearing. 9 “[I]n accordance with this Court’s longstanding ‘raise-or-waive’ rule, if an issue was not properly asserted, and thereby preserved, in the lower tribunals, this Court will not consider the issue on appeal.” Adams v. Santander Bank, N.A., 183 A.3d 544, 548 (R.I. 2018) (quoting Miller v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 160 A.3d 975, 980 (R.I. 2017)). For this reason, we are satisfied that Denise has waived this argument.', 'In the face of that waiver, however, it is worth noting that, in January 2016, Joel voluntarily agreed to pay, and Denise accepted, $2,444 per month in interim child support while the divorce proceeding was pending. Those payments continued until December 2016, when final judgment was entered. 10 such an early stage of the proceeding may have been premature, we do not conclude that it approaches reversible error. Moreover, we note that the trial justice’s eventual finding regarding the parties’ combined gross income did not exceed the Family Court child support guidelines. 9', 'We also note that that argument was not raised at the September 28, 2016 hearing, which centered solely on the issue of child support. Furthermore, after the September 28, 2016 hearing, the parties were given thirty days to submit memoranda to the court supporting their respective positions on the issue. Although Joel filed a memorandum with the court, Denise never did. 10', 'Moreover, in the course of his bench decision on December 14, 2016, the trial justice reiterated that Denise had been receiving those interim payments from Joel.', '- 14 -', 'B', 'Century’s Net Income and Distributions', 'Denise next contends that the trial justice wrongfully excluded Century’s net income and distributions to Joel when he calculated Joel’s gross income for the purpose of determining his child support obligation. She argues that the definition of gross income found in the applicable Family Court administrative order is broad enough to encompass income and distributions from an S corporation. She also avers that the trial justice had a “mandatory obligation” to follow the formula set forth in the Family Court administrative order and this Court’s reasoning in Tamayo and, had he done so, he would have properly imputed Century’s income and distributions to Joel’s gross income.', 'Section 15-5-16.2(a) states, in pertinent part:', '“In a proceeding for * * * child support, the court shall order either', 'or both parents owing a duty of support to a child to pay an amount', 'based upon a formula and guidelines adopted by an administrative', 'order of the family court.

She also claims that distributions made in 2015 from the S corporation to Joel were used to pay for his personal income taxes, sole ownership in Century, and personal expenses, including a personal life insurance premium. We shall address each of those arguments below.', '1', 'Century’s 2015 Net Income', 'Denise argues that, because Joel is the sole shareholder of Century, 100 percent of Century’s 2015 net income should be attributable to Joel for the purposes of calculating his child support obligation. She contends, therefore, that the trial justice erred when he found that the S corporation’s net income should not be included in Joel’s gross income, even though it was included on his W-2 form. According to the trial justice, those funds were retained by Century for a legitimate business purpose in order to meet the working capital threshold set by Century’s bonding company. Denise points out to this Court that nowhere in the child support guidelines’ inclusive definition of gross income is there a “legitimate business purpose” exception for corporate profits.', 'In his decision, the trial justice relied heavily on J.S. v. C.C., 912 N.E.2d 933 (Mass. 2009), a decision rendered by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. In that case, a father appealed a child support judgment, arguing that the trial judge erroneously included undistributed earnings of a closely held S corporation—of which he was a majority', '- 18 - shareholder—in calculating his gross income with respect to his child support obligation. J.S., 912 N.E.2d at 940. He argued that the “pass-through earnings” from the S corporation on his income tax return should not have been included because those earnings “were likely to be retained by the corporation rather than distributed to him.” Id. at 941.', 'In J.S., the Supreme Judicial Court took note of new guidelines that had been adopted in Massachusetts since that case commenced; those new guidelines contain the very same definition of gross income as do our current child support guidelines. 11 The court reasoned:', '“The New Guidelines thus suggest that, when setting child support,', 'the judge should determine the income of an S corporation', 'shareholder not by including automatically the pass-through', 'income reported on the shareholder’s tax return, but rather by', 'making a specific determination about what portion (if any) of that', 'pass-through income realistically and fairly is or should be', 'deemed available to the shareholder for purposes of paying child', 'support.” J.S., 912 N.E.2d at 941 n.13 (emphasis added).

C.C., 912 N.E.2d 933 (Mass. 2009), because it relied on a prior version of the Massachusetts guidelines. We disagree. Although the Supreme Judicial Court recognized that new guidelines had been adopted since that case commenced, the court expressly noted that its reasoning was in line with the new guidelines. See J.S., 912 N.E.2d at 941 n.13, 942.', '- 19 -', 'in income, but corporate structures should not be used to shield', 'available income that could and should serve as available sources', 'of child support funds.” J.S., 912 N.E.2d at 942.', 'The court then delineated relevant factors that a trial justice should consider in determining what portion of undistributed earnings may be available to a shareholder for a child support obligation. J.S., 912 N.E.2d at 942-43. Those factors included: (1) “the shareholder’s level of control over corporate distributions” as measured by his or her ownership interest; (2) “the legitimate business interests justifying” the decision to retain corporate earnings—if the purpose was to maintain the business, the Court concluded that those earnings should not be included in gross income; and (3) whether there was “affirmative evidence of an attempt to shield income by means of retained earnings.” Id. at 942-43, 943 n.15. The court further held that the shareholder, regardless of his or her ownership interest, has the burden of proving that retaining the corporation’s earnings was for a legitimate business purpose because he or she has greater access to relevant information about the corporation. Id. at 943-44. After determining that the trial court had not given any specific consideration to any particular facts or circumstances in ruling that all of the corporation’s income should be attributed to the father, the Supreme Judicial Court remanded the case for a new decision that would be in line with its opinion. Id. at 944.', 'We are persuaded by the reasoning set forth in J.S., and observe that the reasoning in that case emanates from a definition of gross income that mirrors our own. The reasoning in that case is instructive in determining whether undistributed pass-through earnings from an S corporation should be attributable to a shareholder’s gross income for calculating child support. See J.S., 912 N.E.2d at 942, 943, 944; see also Tuckman v. Tuckman, 61 A.3d 449, 458 (Conn. 2013) (citing with approval J.S. and incorporating its factors in determining whether pass-', '- 20 - through income from an S corporation should be available for child support purposes). Here, the trial justice examined the relevant factors set forth in J.S. and applied them to this case. He determined that Joel was the sole shareholder of Century and that “all evidence demonstrated that Century Drywall’s retained earnings had been used for legitimate business reasons in the past and were in no way used to shield or manipulate [Joel’s] income to reduce or avoid his child support obligation.” He further opined that, according to Mr. Amico’s testimony, Century had capitalization issues and that the company was required to retain its earnings to maintain sufficient working capital, as required by its bonding company. The court then concluded that, based on Mr. Amico’s uncontradicted testimony, which the trial justice found to be “very informative and quite credible,” the decision to retain earnings “was certainly a legitimate business purpose.” 12 We conclude that the trial justice acted within his discretion in applying a “legitimate business purpose” analysis to find that Century’s retained earnings should not be included in Joel’s gross income for the purposes of determining his child support obligation.', 'Denise further argues that the trial court “misconceived and overvalued [Mr.] Amico’s testimony, ignoring more credible evidence” in the process of conducting the legitimate business purpose test outlined above. Specifically, she claims that, in May 2015, Century’s bonding company advised Century that it needed to maintain $7 million in working capital for 2015, and that it was not until May 2016 that the bonding company increased the minimum retention requirement to $10 million. Denise also points out that Mr. Amico testified that Century’s net worth increased to $8,361,919, which, according to Denise, means that Century actually exceeded its retention requirement in 2015 by $1,361,919. Thus, she contends, it was error for 12', 'We note that, at the September 2016 hearing on child support, Denise never called any witnesses to contradict Mr. Amico’s testimony.', '- 21 - the trial justice to even consider the decision to retain net income as a legitimate business purpose when Century had already met its retention requirements for 2015.', 'During the divorce trial, in April 2016, Joel testified that Century was required to hold $7 million in equity. A month later, Mr. Amico elaborated that the amount that the bonding company required Century to hold in equity was ten percent of the total sales revenue of the corporation. He further testified that, because Century was in such a volatile industry, the company’s business was subject to fluctuation and, thus, “the equity target can be a moving number.” In fact, Mr. Amico later testified in September 2016 that the minimum bonding requirement that Century was required to hold in equity reserves increased to $10 million. He also said that the corporation was undercapitalized and that, as a result, the company could be denied the ability to obtain bonding for future projects if it failed to raise its equity.', 'With respect to whether Century’s 2015 net income was properly excluded from Joel’s gross income calculation, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion. Although there was evidence indicating that, at some point in 2015, the corporation was required to hold at least $7 million in equity and that, by the end of 2015, the corporation exceeded that amount by $1,361,919, Mr. Amico was clear in his testimony that the bond requirement was not static and that the figure was completely dependent on the company’s total sales revenue, which was subject to considerable fluctuation in the construction industry. Indeed, according to the testimony, Century’s minimum bonding requirement rose from $7 million to $10 million over a two year period. For all those reasons, we see no error in the ruling of the trial justice to exclude', '- 22 - Century’s undistributed pass-through income from Joel’s gross income for calculating his child support obligation. 13', '2', '2015 Distribution for Taxes', 'Denise also argues that the trial justice erroneously excluded from Joel’s gross income a distribution of $1,235,846 that Joel used to pay his “personal” income taxes. She alleges that the Family Court must determine an appropriate level of gross income available to a parent to satisfy a child support obligation, and that gross income necessarily would include nontaxable portions owed or deducted as personal income tax liability. She further contends that nothing in the child support guidelines suggests that income must inure to one’s benefit or be actually received by a parent to be included as income, because the child support guidelines require that all sources of earned or unearned income be considered.', 'However, there was evidence presented at trial that this distribution was used to pay taxes on the pass-through income that Joel received from Century. “Courts in several jurisdictions have held that the portion of a distribution designated to pay taxes on earnings legitimately retained by the corporation is not available to a shareholder parent to satisfy a child support obligation.” J.S., 912 N.E.2d at 944 n.18 (citing McHugh v. McHugh, 702 So.2d 639, 642 (Fla. 13', 'Denise additionally argues that the trial justice’s reliance on Hubbard County Health and Human Services v. Zacher, 742 N.W.2d 223 (Minn. Ct. App. 2007), was in error because that case had been deemed inapposite by the Minnesota Supreme Court in Haefele v. Haefele, 837 N.W.2d 703 (Minn. 2013). Although we note that Haefele did rule most of the Zacher opinion inapposite, the trial justice in the case before us relied on Zacher for the proposition that a parent’s ownership interest in an S corporation could be a resource that should be taken into consideration in determining his or her ability to pay child support. Haefele did not deem this portion of the Zacher opinion inapposite; in fact, Haefele supported that proposition at the end of its opinion. See Haefele, 837 N.W.2d at 714 (“[T]he district court [is allowed] to consider, among other things, the extent to which the parent’s gross income is actually available to him or her to pay support.”) (emphasis in original). Therefore, the trial justice’s reliance on Zacher for considering Joel’s ability to pay was not in error.', '- 23 - Dist. Ct. App. 1997); Tebbe v. Tebbe, 815 N.E.2d 180, 184 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004); Walker v. Grow, 907 A.2d 255, 270 (Md. Ct. App. Spec. 2006)). As previously discussed above, the pass- through income that Joel received and on which he paid taxes was actually retained by the corporation for a legitimate business purpose and was not distributed to him. The trial justice found that that income was not available to Joel and that it did not inure to his benefit. We agree, and therefore hold that the trial justice correctly excluded Century’s distribution to Joel that was used to pay the company’s tax liabilities. 14', '3', '2015 Distribution for Stock Buyouts', 'Denise next argues that the trial court failed to quantify and erroneously excluded distributions used by Joel to buy out his partners and acquire sole ownership interest in Century. According to Denise, those distributions were used to pay what were essentially Joel’s personal debts to his former partners. To support this claim, Denise points to Joel’s testimony that he incurred a “personal debt” in the buyout, that he was paying down debt to acquire a marital asset, and that Century itself was not obligated on the note. Denise also notes that Mr. Amico testified that the buyout debts were “outside the business” and enhanced the value of the marital estate.', 'We agree with Denise and hold that distributions used by Joel to satisfy his personal obligation in purchasing the sole ownership in Century should have been included in his gross income calculation to determine his child support obligation. Joel testified that, on January 1, 14', 'Denise alleges in her brief that the parties confirmed at trial that Joel paid $1,082,544 in personal taxes in 2015, not $1,235,846, and that therefore, the trial justice did not conduct a “careful review” as required by the child support guidelines. Even if the amount was in error, this argument is a nonstarter because that distribution was to pay for the corporation’s taxes, not Joel’s personal taxes. For this reason, we reiterate what has been stated above: that none of the distribution, no matter the amount, should have been included in Joel’s gross income to calculate his child support obligation.', '- 24 - 2012, Mr. Elliott sold his shares of stock to Joel and John.', 'According to Joel, Mr. Elliott’s interest was purchased for $2.5 million, and John and Joel were equally obligated on the payment to Mr. Elliott; therefore, Joel’s obligation to Mr. Elliott was $1.25 milion. Joel’s obligation to Mr. Elliott was to be satisfied in two ways: by a $650,000 promissory note payable at four percent interest, with payments to be made quarterly for ten years, and a $600,000 one- time no-interest “balloon payment” due in 2021.', 'Joel further testified that, in December 2013, approximately two years after the agreement with Elliott, he purchased John’s ownership in Century for $7.2 million, leaving Joel as the sole shareholder of the corporation. Joel testified that the obligation to John was too much for him to bear as a personal debt, so the brothers agreed that John would be paid in three ways. First, Joel assigned John his one-third membership interest in ARK Properties, LLC, a company owned jointly by Joel, John, and Mr. Elliott that had an ownership interest in multiple property investments. In their purchase and sale agreement, Joel and John valued Joel’s interest in ARK at $2,890,691. 15 Second, Joel executed a promissory note to John in the amount of $3,425,931, with a ten year term, at four percent interest. Third, Joel assumed John’s obligations for Mr. Elliott’s buyout, which was valued at $883,378.', 'Joel testified that his obligation to both John and Mr. Elliott are obligations for which he “solely [is] personally liable[,]” and that Century is not liable in any way for the payments. Moreover, Joel signed the promissory notes in his personal capacity. Mr. Amico also testified that the buyouts were cross-purchases between shareholders, that Joel acted in his individual capacity in completing those transactions, and that Century did not owe Mr. Elliott or John any 15', 'Joel testified that to complete the transaction, he also conveyed his interest in another company called JMJ, LLC. However, the stock purchase and sale agreement between Joel and John only mentioned Joel’s interest in ARK as consideration for the sale.', '- 25 - moneys regarding the buyouts. Mr. Amico described the buyouts as Joel’s “personal debt held out of convenience to perpetuate a succession plan to maximize surety credit.”', 'Although we have acknowledged our well-settled rule that “a witness’s uncontroverted, positive testimony ordinarily is conclusive upon the trier of fact[,]” nevertheless, we also have held “‘that a trial justice may refuse to accept the uncontroverted testimony of proffered witnesses’ under certain circumstances.” Pelletier v.

Mr. Amico testified that the sheet detailed Century’s stockholder equity from December 31, 2013, through December 31, 2015.', 'The document also revealed that Century made distributions for John’s buyout and Mr. Elliott’s note payments in 2014, as well as note payments to Mr. Elliott and John in 2015. Mr. Amico further testified that those note payments were for the buyouts.', '- 26 -', 'Also, during the trial, Joel testified that, when he received a distribution from Century, he would use that money to write a check to John and to Mr. Elliott to satisfy his obligations under the note payments. Furthermore, Mr. Amico testified that he knew that Joel was current on his payments to John and Mr. Elliott because, in addition to preparing his returns, he could “see the payments going through his distributions at the company level.” Mr. Amico further testified that the distributions from Century that were reflected on the tax returns of Joel and Denise amounted to approximately $1.5 million, that Joel used the money from that distribution to satisfy his buyout obligation, and that, as a result of the acquisition of the company solely in Joel’s name, the marital estate would be enhanced. The following exchange occurred during Mr. Amico’s cross-examination:', '“[DENISE’S COUNSEL:] * * * Now, just to be clear, it’s your', 'testimony that for these distributions for payments that went to', 'Michael Elliott and John Trojan, what would transpire is Century', 'Drywall would cut a check personally to Joel Trojan; and it’s your', 'understanding and testimony that Joel Trojan would then deposit', 'the check into his personal account and then cut out a check to', 'Mike Elliott and John Trojan to pay this personal debt, is that', 'correct?', '“[MR. AMICO:] Yes.”', 'It is thus clear from the evidence that Joel’s obligation to pay Mr. Elliott and John for the purchase of their stock in Century was personal in nature and that Joel used distributions from Century to meet that personal obligation. Importantly, at the September 28, 2016 hearing, Mr. Amico, when asked by the trial justice if he should include the distributions in Joel’s gross income calculation, responded:', '“[MR. AMICO:] The distributions – if the goal is to maintain the', 'same level of living – standard of living for this child, historically,', 'the profits from Century Drywall have never been distributed to', 'enhance the life-style. They’ve always been pretty much retained', 'within the organization. So, factoring that into the equation would', '- 27 -', 'significantly enhance her standard of living beyond what’s been', 'provided to date, based on my understanding of the company and', 'the distribution history.” Based on the evidence presented to the trial justice, Mr. Amico was incorrect when he testified that “factoring [the note payment distribution] into the equation would significantly enhance [Tiffany’s] standard of living beyond what’s been provided to date[.]”', 'Because the note payments are Joel’s personal obligation, he would ordinarily pay them with his own money, i.e., his salary and interest payments he receives from the joint marital account. However, by using Century’s funds to pay for his own personal obligation, Joel no longer is required to pay that debt with his own money. Tiffany’s lifestyle therefore had already been enhanced when Joel received that distribution because the portion of his salary that would otherwise have been used to pay for his personal obligation to the former shareholders became available to Joel to be used for other purposes. The Family Court administrative order is clear: “gross income is defined as gross receipts minus ordinary and necessary expenses required for self-employment or business operation.”', 'Joel’s purchase of John’s and Mr. Elliott’s shares was not an “ordinary and necessary expense[]” for Century. Rather, it was a personal obligation that Joel incurred to secure his sole ownership of the company. The distribution that Joel received from Century to pay for that personal debt he owes to John and Mr. Elliott with respect to their buyouts should therefore be considered when calculating Joel’s gross income.', 'Although we acknowledge that the trial justice considered all relevant factors such as the needs of the child and each of the parents’ financial resources, we nonetheless take this time to stress that “[t]his Court defines a parent’s ability to pay very broadly, to ‘provide the child or children with the greatest possible support.’” Tamayo, 15 A.3d at 1036 (quoting Lembo, 624 A.2d at 1090). Consequently, it is our opinion that the distributions that Joel received from', '- 28 - Century to satisfy the note payments to Mr. Elliott and John should have been considered to be part of Joel’s gross income under the child support guidelines. It is for this reason that we hold that the trial justice erred when he excluded those moneys from Joel’s gross income. We therefore remand this case for a hearing to consider and recalculate the assets and income available to satisfy the child support obligation.', '4', '2015 Distribution for Life Insurance Premium and Other Personal Expenses', 'Denise further argues that the trial justice erred when he excluded from Joel’s gross income a $61,375 distribution from Century that Joel used to pay an annual premium on a personal life insurance policy that named his daughters as beneficiaries. She points out that Joel testified that he received distribution checks from Century, deposited them into his own personal account, and wrote personal checks to pay the premium. We agree with Denise’s argument.', 'In our opinion, the distribution used to pay Joel’s personal life insurance premium should have been considered to be gross income in the calculation for Joel’s child support obligation. At trial, Joel testified that he purchased a life insurance policy and created an irrevocable trust, under which his two daughters are beneficiaries. He said that he funded the trust in that manner so that, in the event of his death, the policy would protect his daughters from having to pay his estate taxes. He further testified that, upon his passing, the policy benefit of $5 million would be deposited into that trust account. According to Joel, the annual premium on that life insurance policy is $61,375, and his brother, John, is the trustee of the irrevocable trust. On cross- examination, Joel testified as follows:', '“[DENISE’S COUNSEL:] So, basically, you take a distribution for', 'this amount from Century Drywall, and you cut a check to your', 'brother John so he can make the [life insurance] payment, is that', 'accurate?', '- 29 -', '“[JOEL:] Yes.”', 'Mr. Amico also confirmed at the September 28, 2016 child support hearing that the Equity Rollforward Sheet indicated that Century made a distribution to Joel “for life insurance for his trust.” In our opinion, the money distributed to Joel to fund the life insurance premium should have been included as gross income because that distribution was used to satisfy a personal debt that Joel chose to take on himself. See Tamayo, 15 A.3d at 1036. There was no evidence introduced at trial that payment of Joel’s insurance premium was an “ordinary and necessary expense” of Century.', 'Denise also avers that the Family Court erred in excluding certain other “substantial financial perks” Joel enjoyed, including luxury automobiles, car insurance, gasoline, country club memberships, cell phones, and other expenses that he financed through distributions from Century. She argues that the trial justice allowed extensive testimony that Denise used marital assets to pay her legal fees, but precluded evidence on whether Joel did the same. Denise further claims that the trial justice should have considered that Century had access to an $8 million line of credit.', 'The record reflects that evidence of those “perks” was presented to the Family Court during the divorce trial to calculate the marital estate. Eventually, a marital settlement agreement was entered into by the parties which resolved any issues outstanding with respect to the marital estate. In fact, the only issue remaining after the Family Court approved the marital settlement agreement was “child support and medical[.]” It is our opinion that Denise was therefore required to present that evidence again at the September 28, 2016 hearing in order to calculate Joel’s child support obligation. No such evidence of “substantial financial perks,” legal fees, or Century’s line of credit was presented to the trial justice at the child support hearing, nor does the', '- 30 - record reflect that Denise’s counsel directed the court to prior testimony of that evidence for purposes of calculating child support. The only distributions that Denise’s counsel raised at the child support hearing were distributions amounting to $1,641,150 in 2015, which, according to Mr. Amico’s testimony and the Equity Rollforward Sheet, included distributions made by Century to Joel to pay for taxes on the corporation’s income, the notes payable to the former shareholders, and Joel’s life insurance premium. We therefore hold that, because the “substantial financial perks,” legal fees, and line of credit were not properly raised at the child support hearing on September 28, 2016, Denise’s argument that the trial justice erred when he did not consider those expenditures in calculating Joel’s gross income for child support purposes has been waived on appeal in accordance with our well-established raise-or-waive rule. 16 See Adams, 183 A.3d at 548.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and vacate in part the judgment entered by the Family Court. The record shall be remanded to that tribunal for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. We direct the trial justice to conduct a hearing in which he shall 16', 'Denise also briefly argues in her memorandum to this Court that the trial justice erred when he allocated future income from her share of the marital estate to her gross income. The trial justice determined that Denise could expect to receive a three percent rate of return on the portion of the marital estate that she received, and he employed that rate of return as her gross income for the purpose of calculating her child support obligation. However, Denise does not cite to any authorities for support and thus that argument does not merit our consideration. We have consistently held that, “under our raise-or-waive rule, ‘even when a party has properly preserved its alleged error of law in the lower court, a failure to raise and develop it in its briefs constitutes a waiver of that issue on appeal and in proceedings on remand.’” Terzian v.

30,"(formerly PC 13-3212) Cranston Police Retirees Action Committee : v. : The City of Cranston, by and through its : Finance Director Robert Strom and its City Treasurer David Capuano, et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This appeal concerns two 2013 Cranston city ordinances that promulgated a ten-year suspension of the cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA) benefit for retirees of the Cranston Police Department and Cranston Fire Department who were enrolled in the City of Cranston’s pension plan. The plaintiff, Cranston Police Retirees Action Committee (CPRAC or plaintiff), initiated this litigation against the City of Cranston (the City), Mayor Allan Fung, and the members of the Cranston City Council (collectively, defendants), alleging a litany of claims ranging from constitutional violations to statutory infringements. A Superior Court justice, sitting without a jury in a trial held over six days in November 2015, found in favor of the defendants on all counts.', 'The plaintiff now raises several issues for our consideration related to the trial justice’s rulings on an assortment of motions and her findings of fact and conclusions of law. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts', 'In 1937, the City established a pension fund for members of its police and fire departments. By the mid-1980s, the pension fund had become a significant financial concern. In the early 1990s, Mayor Michael Traficante met with police and firefighter union leaders in an attempt to address the problem. Ultimately, in 1996, the City passed two ordinances based on an agreement reached with the unions, creating a two-tiered pension system (the 1996 ordinances). The 1996 ordinances, No. 96-54 for firefighters and No. 96-56 for police officers, provided that all members of the police and fire departments hired after July 1, 1995, would be enrolled in the state’s pension system. Additionally, those members with five or fewer years of service could elect to stay in the City’s pension plan or enroll in the state’s pension system. For the members remaining in the City’s pension plan, the 1996 ordinances provided for a minimum 3 percent compounded COLA, or, alternatively, a percentage equal to that of a contractual increase for active members. The unions bargained for this COLA to match the benefits that were being offered under the state’s pension plan.', 'The fiscal issues related to the City’s pension plan did not subside with the passage of the 1996 ordinances. By July 1, 1999, the unfunded accrued liability of the City’s pension plan exceeded more than $169 million. The City’s pension liability remained an issue throughout the early 2000s. Mayor John O’Leary, who succeeded Mayor Traficante, borrowed against the pension fund in his final year in office to pay the then-retirees’ health care costs and base pensions. 1', 'When Mayor Fung took office in 2009, the City was in “dire” fiscal condition. At that time, Cranston faced a severe economic recession that was affecting all parts of the country. As 1', 'Those amounts were repaid to the pension fund the following year.', '-2- such, the City experienced high unemployment rates and over $1 billion in decreased property values. Moreover, state aid decreased substantially between 2007 and 2011, and two devastating floods in the spring of 2010 also inflicted a financial toll on the City. In order to improve its financial situation, the City made cuts to personnel, eliminated city vehicles, and increased health care co-shares for its employees.', 'In 2011, the General Assembly passed the Rhode Island Retirement Security Act (RIRSA), G.L. 1956 chapter 65 of title 45, legislation focused on promoting the sustainability of municipal pension systems. See § 45-65-2. Pursuant to § 45-65-4, a municipality’s pension plan would be in “critical status” if “as determined by its actuary, as of the beginning of the plan year, a plan’s funded percentage for such plan year is less than sixty percent (60%).”', 'A municipality administering a plan in “critical status” is required, under RIRSA, (1) to give notice of such status to plan participants and other listed individuals and entities and (2) to submit a funding improvement plan detailing the municipality’s strategy for emerging from that status. Section 45- 65-6. A commission within the Department of Revenue that had been set up under the statute established guidelines for the funding improvement plans, suggesting that, “[g]enerally, the funding improvement period should not exceed 20 years with the plan emerging from critical status within that timeframe.” Municipalities not in compliance with the statute faced a reduction in state aid. Section 45-65-7.', 'Mayor Fung’s administration analyzed the health of the City’s pension system during his first term. By June 30, 2011, the unfunded accrued liability of the pension plans had risen to $256 million. 2 In 2012, the pension system was funded at only 16.9 percent, meeting the definition for 2', 'One of the biggest factors contributing to this unfunded liability of the plan was historic underfunding of the plan due to the City’s failure to pay 100 percent of its annual required contribution (ARC). Mayor Fung testified that the ARC is the amount that the City is supposed to', '-3- “critical status” pursuant to § 45-65-4. In accordance with § 45-65-6, Mayor Fung sent a letter to all pensioners enrolled in the City’s pension system informing them of the “critical status.” The City next put together an “alternative funding improvement plan consistent with the [requirements of § 45-65-6].” In doing so, the City considered a number of options, including raising taxes, cutting more personnel, and eliminating city services. Additionally, in September 2012, Mayor Fung met with City pensioners to keep them apprised of the pension situation and also to propose a ten-year COLA suspension as the preferred method of raising the plan from critical status. Thereafter, Mayor Fung presented the COLA suspension plan to the City Council in two proposed ordinances in October 2012.', 'Shortly after, Mayor Fung withdrew the proposed ordinances in favor of negotiations with the plan participants, and, in the months that followed, he met with the police and firefighter unions and persons who represented the City’s police and firefighter retirees. After meeting with the unions and retirees, the City’s actuaries ran twenty to thirty additional scenarios for plans to lift the pension system from critical status. Ultimately, however, the City enacted two ordinances on April 23, 2013 (the 2013 ordinances)—No. 2013-5, governing police retirees, and No. 2013-6, governing fire retirees—suspending the minimum 3 percent COLA for ten years, beginning July 1, 2013.', 'Following the passage of the 2013 ordinances, The Cranston Police Department Retirees Association, Inc., and Local 1363 Retirees Association filed suit against the City on behalf of retirees enrolled in the City’s pension plan, alleging that the 2013 ordinances violated the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. The parties reached a settlement agreement, and a final contribute to the pension plan as determined by City actuaries “after reviewing the plan, all the plan participants, the funding of the plan, [and] the investments[.]”', '-4- consent judgment was entered in December 2013.', 'The agreement provided for a COLA suspension in alternating years for ten years, and a 1.5 percent COLA payment in years eleven and twelve. Each retiree was given the opportunity to opt out of the settlement agreement and to retain the right to pursue civil claims against the City. The members of CPRAC are retirees enrolled in the City’s pension system who opted out of the settlement agreement.', 'II', 'Procedural History', 'A', 'Pretrial Motions', 'On June 28, 2013, plaintiff filed an eight-count complaint in Superior Court against the City, Mayor Fung, and the members of the Cranston City Council. 3 The complaint included allegations of violations of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions, a state statute, and breach of contract.4 The defendants filed a motion to dismiss six of the eight counts, as well as an answer to the complaint. The trial justice granted defendants’ motion to dismiss in part, dismissing counts VI and VIII of the complaint. During the course of discovery, defendants filed a motion 3', 'The complaint named John Lanni, Jr., Donald Botts, Jr., Mario Aceto, Michael J. Farina, Michael W. Favicchio, Paul H. Archetto, Richard D. Santamaria, Jr., Sarah Kales Lee, and Steven A. Stycos, in their capacity as members of the Cranston City Council. The named members of the city council, along with Mayor Fung, will be referred to hereafter as the “Non-City” defendants. 4', 'In count I, plaintiff sought a declaration that the 2013 ordinances violated the Contract Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. The plaintiff alleged a breach of contract claim and constitutional violation of the Takings Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions in count II. In count III, plaintiff alleged that the enactment of the 2013 ordinances by the mayor and city council members was facially unconstitutional, and sought a declaratory judgment to that effect. Count IV of the complaint alleged that the enactment of the 2013 ordinances was barred by the doctrine of res judicata and that the ordinances were thus void ab initio. Count V of the complaint asked for equitable or injunctive relief. In counts VI and VII, plaintiff alleged a violation of civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, and the Open Meetings Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 46 of title 42, respectively. Finally, in count VIII, plaintiff alleged that defendants violated the fiduciary duty owed to retirees.', '-5- for a protective order to prevent plaintiff from deposing city councilmember John Lanni, Jr. On September 15, 2015, the trial justice granted defendants’ motion on the basis that Lanni enjoyed the privilege of legislative immunity, and that the topics about which plaintiff sought to question Lanni were related to his position as a legislator.', 'In the month prior to trial, the parties filed several motions for summary judgment. On October 9, 2015, the Non-City defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on all remaining counts. One week later, the City filed a motion for summary judgment as to plaintiff’s Takings Clause claim. The plaintiff filed its own motion for summary judgment on October 19, 2015, seeking summary judgment on its claims based on res judicata and on the violation of the Rhode Island Open Meetings Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 46 of title 42 (the OMA). The City also filed a cross-motion for summary judgment as to the res judicata and OMA counts.', 'The trial justice heard arguments on all four summary judgment motions at a hearing held on November 2, 2015. On that same day, the trial justice issued a decision from the bench, granting summary judgment in favor of the Non-City defendants on all counts, and in favor of the City as to res judicata and the Takings Clause claim. The trial justice reserved judgment on the OMA claim until November 6, 2015, when she rendered a bench decision granting summary judgment in favor of the City.', 'The City had also filed a motion in limine to determine the appropriate burden of proof for the Contract Clause claim. The trial justice heard arguments on this motion at the November 2, 2015 hearing, and rendered a bench decision on November 6, 2015. The trial justice relayed that she would employ a burden-shifting analysis on part of the Contract Clause analysis, with specific burdens of production on each party at each stage of the analysis.', '-6-', 'Three days before trial, the City sought leave to amend its answer to the complaint to specifically deny some of plaintiff’s allegations and to formally add an affirmative defense. The City contended that these amendments would simply ensure that its pleading conformed to the positions that it had taken throughout the litigation and to evidence the City intended to introduce during the upcoming trial. The trial justice granted the City’s motion to amend on the morning the trial began, over plaintiff’s objection.', 'B', 'Trial', 'On November 9, 2015, the first day of trial, three counts of plaintiff’s complaint remained: violation of the Contract Clause, breach of contract, and injunctive relief. Sixteen witnesses testified over the course of five days. Their testimony is summarized below.', 'The plaintiff presented testimony from nine members of CPRAC, two former Cranston mayors, and an actuary, who provided expert testimony. The City presented testimony from the current mayor, the City’s finance director, an actuary, and a current Cranston firefighter.', 'Glenn Gilkenson, president of CPRAC, testified first. Gilkenson retired from the Cranston Police Department in 2008 after twenty-five years of service. Gilkenson testified that, according to the collective bargaining agreement under which he retired, he received a pension and COLA adjustments. According to Gilkenson, after the 2013 ordinances passed, he spoke to a few retired police officers and firefighters who were in the same situation, and they decided to form a nonprofit organization, CPRAC, to fight the suspension of their COLA benefits. Gilkenson testified that CPRAC started with seventy-five members, and, at the time of trial, had seventy-one members. Gilkenson testified that it was CPRAC’s policy and strategy to not negotiate with the City with', '-7- respect to a reduction of the COLA, and he also stated that the COLA freeze had impacted his personal finances.', 'Following Gilkenson’s testimony, plaintiff presented eight other members of CPRAC as witnesses over the course of the first two days of trial: retired firefighter Vincent Matrumalo and retired police officers Edward Walsh, William Lynch, David Greene, Robert Davies, Charles Galligan, Edward Evans, and Vincent Maccarone.', 'Similar to Gilkenson’s testimony, these CPRAC members consistently testified that they had believed they would receive COLA benefits for life, and that the suspension of the COLA benefit had a significant financial impact on their lives. Each of the CPRAC members’ collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) were admitted as trial exhibits. Each CBA, beginning in 1997, provided for COLAs to the pension benefits at a rate of at least 3 percent, compounded on July 1 of each year.', 'The plaintiff then called Michael Traficante, mayor of Cranston from 1985-1999, to the stand. Mayor Traficante testified that he became aware of the City’s pension crisis as early as 1984, when he served as city council president. He further testified about negotiations with the police and firefighter unions in the mid-1990s to address the pension crisis. According to Mayor Traficante, the City explored many alternatives to address the pension liability aside from moving the pensioners into the state system, including a pension bond or supplemental tax, but ultimately decided that moving the pensioners into the state system was the best course of action. The plaintiff also called Mayor Traficante’s successor, John O’Leary, to testify. Mayor O’Leary served as mayor from 1999 until 2003. Mayor O’Leary testified that, in his final year as mayor, he borrowed money from the fire and police pension fund as a one-time allocation to pay for retirees’ health care costs, and that the debt was repaid the following year.', '-8-', 'The City’s current mayor, Allan Fung, took the stand next, having been called by defendants. Mayor Fung testified that, just after he took office in 2009, he examined the City’s fiscal condition and discovered that it was “very dire.” According to Mayor Fung, the economic recession of the late 2000s had taken a toll on the City, as it had on other cities across the country, and made it difficult for the City to raise revenue. Additionally, Mayor Fung testified, the City experienced two devastating floods in 2010, and state aid decreased dramatically in the first few years of his administration—by $18 million between 2007 and 2011. Mayor Fung testified that he felt that if the City did not address the financial crisis, Chapter 9 bankruptcy “could be a very real possibility[.]”', 'Mayor Fung further testified about the critical status of the City’s pension system as of 2011, stating that, at its lowest point, the system was funded at only 16.9 percent, with $256 million of unfunded accrued liability. He testified that a combination of factors led to this situation, including the compounded COLAs for municipal retirees and historic underfunding of the entire municipal pension system.', 'Mayor Fung testified that his administration considered many alternatives to determine the best solution for emerging from “critical status” within the twenty- year guideline. In addition to a ten-year suspension of the COLA, Mayor Fung testified, the City implemented wage freezes, layoffs of City employees, tax increases, health care co-share increases, and expense reduction, in order to raise revenue during its financial crisis.', 'Robert Strom, finance director for the City, testified next for defendants. Strom reiterated Mayor Fung’s statements that the City had suffered a financial crisis during the first few years of the Fung administration. Strom further testified that he believed that the City would face serious consequences if the twenty-year guideline for emerging from “critical status” was not met, including reduced or eliminated state funds, which were instrumental to the City’s budget. Strom', '-9- also testified that raising taxes on the City’s residents would not resolve the pension system’s problems because the City would need to raise taxes so substantially that it would have been unfair and unsustainable, considering the fact that the City already had one of the highest tax rates in the state.', 'The plaintiffs called their retained expert, William Fornia, to the stand on the penultimate day of trial.5 Fornia testified that he is an actuary by profession and had been a pension consultant for several large consulting firms for many years prior to starting his own company. Fornia testified that, based on his expert analysis of the actuarial reports commissioned by the City, the COLA suspension caused an average loss of $210,000 per retiree. Fornia further testified that the City’s pension problems were foreseeable and predictable, and that the City had not chosen the least drastic remedy available when it chose to suspend the COLAs.', 'After the plaintiff rested, the City called two more witnesses to conclude the testimony at trial: expert witness Daniel Sherman, an actuary, and Paul Valletta, Jr., a current Cranston firefighter and president of the firefighters’ union. Sherman rebutted some of plaintiff’s expert’s conclusions, particularly with respect to the pension system’s shortfall calculation and the COLA change alternatives. Valletta testified about the negotiations between Mayor Fung and the unions and retirees prior to the passage of the ordinances. The trial ended on November 17, 2015.', 'On July 22, 2016, the trial justice issued a written decision resolving, in favor of the City, the claims for violation of the Contract Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions, breach of contract, and injunctive relief. The details of her decision that are salient 5', 'The day before Fornia testified, the City moved to prevent him from testifying as to certain subjects, a motion that the trial justice denied.', '- 10 - to the issues plaintiff raises on appeal will be discussed infra. Final judgment in favor of all defendants was entered on August 4, 2016.', 'C', 'Posttrial Motions', 'Following entry of final judgment, the City filed a motion for costs. The plaintiff objected and filed a motion to stay consideration of the bill of costs until plaintiff’s appeal was decided by this Court. The trial justice heard argument on the motions on October 13, 2016, when she summarily denied plaintiff’s motion to stay and awarded costs to the City in the amount of $9,717.85.', 'III', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Before this Court, plaintiff challenges several pretrial decisions, some of the trial justice’s findings and conclusions after trial, and the posttrial award of costs in favor of the City. 6 Specifically, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred by: (1) finding that the 2013 ordinances did not violate the Contract Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions; (2) misapplying the burden of proof in the Contract Clause analysis; (3) misconceiving and misapplying expert testimony; (4) granting summary judgment in favor of the City as to the Takings Clause, res judicata, and OMA claims; (5) granting defendants’ motion for a protective order as to Councilmember Lanni; (6) granting summary judgment in favor of the Non-City defendants on all counts; (7) granting the City’s motion to amend its answer shortly before trial; 6', 'The plaintiff does not challenge the trial justice’s decision following trial with respect to the claims for breach of contract or injunctive relief.', '- 11 - and (8) summarily dismissing plaintiff’s motion to stay and granting, in part, the City’s motion for costs. We will take each issue in turn.', 'A', 'Contract Clause', 'The trial justice concluded that the 2013 ordinances suspending plaintiff’s members’ COLAs did not violate the Contract Clauses of the United States or Rhode Island Constitutions. Before this Court, plaintiff claims two errors as to the trial justice’s Contract Clause analysis. First, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in the determination and application of the burden of proof at trial. Second, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in ultimately finding in favor of the City on this issue.', 'This Court has held that we “will apply a de novo standard of review to questions of law that may implicate a constitutional right.” Goetz v. LUVRAJ, LLC, 986 A.2d 1012, 1016 (R.I. 2010). However, we will not disturb the factual findings made by a trial justice sitting without a jury “unless such findings are clearly erroneous or unless the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence.” Gregoire v. Baird Properties, LLC, 138 A.3d 182, 191 (R.I. 2016) (deletion omitted) (quoting South County Post & Beam, Inc. v. McMahon, 116 A.3d 204, 210 (R.I. 2015)). “When the record indicates that competent evidence supports the trial justice’s findings, we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for his or hers even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting South County Post & Beam, Inc., 116 A.3d at 210).', 'The Contract Clauses of the United States and the Rhode Island Constitutions prevent the state from enacting laws “impairing the obligation of contracts[.]” U.S. Const. Art. I, § 10, cl. 1; R.I. Const. art. 1, § 12. “Although the Contract Clause appears literally to proscribe ‘any’', '- 12 - impairment, * * * ‘the prohibition is not an absolute one and is not to be read with literal exactness like a mathematical formula.’” United States Trust Company of New York v. New Jersey, 431 U.S. 1, 21 (1977) (quoting Home Building & Loan Ass’n v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 428 (1934)). Moreover, “[t]hough the Framers apparently had in mind only purely private contracts (particularly debt obligations) the Clause routinely has been applied to contracts between states and private parties.” Nonnenmacher v. City of Warwick, 722 A.2d 1199, 1202 (R.I. 1999) (deletion omitted) (quoting McGrath v. Rhode Island Retirement Board, Etc., 88 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir. 1996)). The Contract Clause “has been interpreted to apply to municipalities as well.” Id.', 'We have previously adopted the United States Supreme Court’s three-part analysis for Contract Clause issues. Nonnenmacher, 722 A.2d at 1202 (citing General Motors Corporation v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 186 (1992)). “A court first must determine whether a contract exists.” Id. (citing McGrath, 88 F.3d at 16). Second, “[i]f a contract exists, the court then must determine whether the modification results in an impairment of that contract and, if so, whether this impairment can be characterized as substantial.” Id. (citing Energy Reserves Group, Inc. v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 459 U.S. 400, 411-12 (1983)). “Finally, if it is determined that the impairment is substantial, the court then must inquire whether the impairment, nonetheless, is reasonable and necessary to fulfill an important public purpose.” Id. (citing Energy Reserves Group, Inc., 459 U.S. at 412).', '1', 'Burden of Production', 'Before addressing the merits of plaintiff’s Contract Clause argument, we turn to whether the trial justice erred in her conclusions about the burden of production at each stage of the analysis. When the trial justice ruled on the City’s motion in limine regarding the burden of proof for', '- 13 - plaintiff’s Contract Clause claim, she set out the following rubric: (1) “[p]laintiff bears the burden of production in establishing [whether the state law has substantially impaired a contract] beyond a reasonable doubt”; (2) if plaintiff meets that burden, “the burden of production shifts to the defendant to prove” that the 2013 ordinances were reasonable and necessary to fulfill a significant and legitimate public purpose; and (3) “[t]hereafter, a plaintiff may, of course, rebut with evidence that the legislation was not reasonable and necessary * * * beyond a reasonable doubt.” The trial justice further stated that the City’s burden with respect to demonstrating a reasonable and necessary legitimate public purpose would be satisfied by credible evidence. The trial justice also stated that she would use a “less deference” standard in evaluating the City’s argument whether the legislation was reasonable or necessary.', 'On appeal, plaintiff asserts that, despite her articulated rubric, the trial justice gave “nearly complete deference” to the City regarding the degree and necessity of the contractual impairment. The plaintiff argues that the City should have been required to demonstrate, at the very least, a preponderance of the evidence, rather than “credible evidence,” regarding its justification for the impairment; and plaintiff contends that the correct standard in this case should actually be clear and convincing evidence. For its part, the City argues that the trial justice should not have shifted the burden of production at all, but that she ultimately reached the correct conclusion. We review the trial justice’s determination and application of the burden-shifting analysis de novo. See Panarello v. State Department of Corrections, 88 A.3d 350, 366 (R.I. 2014). We note that “it would be reversible error for a trial justice to apply the wrong burden of proof.” Id.', '“[T]he term ‘burden of proof’ embraces two different concepts”—the burden of production and the burden of persuasion. Murphy v. O’Neill, 454 A.2d 248, 250 (R.I. 1983). “The ‘burden of persuasion’ refers to the litigants’ burden of establishing the truth of a given proposition in a case', '- 14 - by such quantum of evidence as the law may require[,]” and it “never shifts.” Id. (punctuation omitted). The burden of production, also referred to as the “burden of going forward with the evidence,” DeBlois v. Clark, 764 A.2d 727, 732 n.3 (R.I. 2001), “shifts from party to party as the case progresses.” Murphy, 454 A.2d at 250.', 'We must first resolve whether the trial justice properly determined that a burden-shifting analysis applies in this case. Courts have not been uniform in shifting the burden of production to the state in the Contract Clause context following a finding of substantial impairment. For example, in Toledo Area AFL-CIO Council v. Pizza, 154 F.3d 307 (6th Cir. 1998), the Sixth Circuit required that a “state must proffer a ‘significant and legitimate’ public purpose for the regulation warranting the extent of the impairment caused by the measure.” Pizza, 154 F.3d at 323 (quoting Energy Reserves Group, Inc., 459 U.S. at 411) (emphasis added). However, in United Automobile, Aerospace, Agricultural Implement Workers of America International Union v. Fortuño, 633 F.3d 37 (1st Cir. 2011), the First Circuit held that “the plaintiffs bear the burden on the reasonable/necessary prong of the Contract Clause analysis[,]” and that “neither [the First Circuit] nor the Supreme Court has ever held” that the state must prove reasonableness and necessity of the regulation. Fortuño, 633 F.3d at 42, 44 (emphasis added).', 'The First Circuit has also acknowledged, however, that “many courts have concluded that this burden rests with the state, and others, including this court and the Supreme Court, have used language that arguably supports such a conclusion.” Id. at 43 (footnotes omitted). Indeed, in Energy Reserves Group, Inc., the United States Supreme Court held that, “[i]f the state regulation constitutes a substantial impairment, the State, in justification, must have a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation[.]” Energy Reserves Group, Inc., 459 U.S. at 411 (emphasis added); see also United', '- 15 - States Trust Company of New York, 431 U.S. at 31 (“In the instant case the State has failed to demonstrate that repeal of the 1962 covenant was similarly necessary.”) (emphasis added).', 'This Court has not yet expressly adopted a burden-shifting analysis regarding the Contract Clause, but we have alluded to it: “if the law constitutes a substantial impairment, can the state show a legitimate public purpose behind the regulation * * *?” Rhode Island Depositors Economic Protection Corporation v. Brown, 659 A.2d 95, 106 (R.I. 1995) (citing Energy Reserves Group, Inc., 459 U.S. at 411-12) (emphasis added). In that case we held, however, that no contractual right was implicated, and therefore we did not reach this factor of the Contract Clause analysis. Id. Given the language of the standard set out in the United States Supreme Court cases and the general logic that the City would have access to the information and motivation to demonstrate its justification for the contractual impairment, we find no fault in the trial justice’s conclusion that the City bore the burden of production as to the reasonable-and-necessary element of the analysis.', 'We proceed now to plaintiff’s argument that the trial justice erred in requiring the City to proffer only credible evidence of its justifications, and that she erred in her application of the burden of proof because she gave the City “nearly complete deference,” which effectively failed to shift the burden of production to the City at all. We have previously held that “a duly enacted ordinance carries with it a presumption of constitutionality which will disappear only on a contrary showing beyond a reasonable doubt.” Town of Glocester v. Olivo’s Mobile Home Court, Inc., 111 R.I. 120, 124, 300 A.2d 465, 468 (1973). “[H]owever, complete deference to a legislative assessment of reasonableness and necessity is not appropriate because the State’s self-interest is at stake.” United States Trust Company of New York, 431 U.S. at 25-26. Thus, as the trial justice in the present case noted, a “less deference” standard was appropriate to analyze the City’s proffered evidence for the reasonableness and necessity of the 2013 ordinances. See Baltimore', '- 16 - Teachers Union, American Federation of Teachers Local 340, AFL-CIO v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, 6 F.3d 1012, 1019 (4th Cir. 1993) (“While complete deference is inappropriate, however, at least some deference to legislative policy decisions to modify these contracts in the public interest must be accorded.”).', 'The specific quantum of proof the City must meet has not been clearly set forth either by this Court or the United States Supreme Court. However, the Supreme Court has said that, if substantial impairment is found, “the State, in justification, must have a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation,” and that the government actor is afforded a limited amount of deference as to that showing. Energy Reserves Group, Inc., 459 U.S. at 412. Thus, we find no error in the trial justice’s determination of the burden of proof in this case.', 'With respect to her application of the burden of proof, a review of the record and the trial justice’s decision demonstrates that the trial justice did not fail to shift the burden of production to the City. It is clear that the trial justice required the City to put forth evidence demonstrating a significant and legitimate public purpose for the 2013 ordinances, and that the 2013 ordinances were reasonable and necessary. Moreover, we disagree with plaintiff that the trial justice afforded the City complete deference. In fact, the trial justice set forth a credible evidence standard to be sure that the City was not afforded complete deference as to its justifications. 7 The trial justice, as required of a factfinder at trial, weighed the evidence and made credibility determinations. The fact that she gave “great weight” to testimony at trial by Strom, Sherman, and Mayor Fung does 7', 'Before trial, the trial justice rejected the City’s request for an “any admissible evidence” standard, noting that “[a]n any admissible evidence standard does not allow for any level of judicial scrutiny.” The trial justice instead determined that she would employ the higher standard of credible evidence in order to balance the interests between the “constitutional context here and the utilization of less deference scrutiny.”', '- 17 - not equate to “complete deference.” Thus, we also find no error in the trial justice’s application of the burden of proof.', '2', 'Substantive Claim', 'We will next examine plaintiff’s arguments as to the merits of its Contract Clause claim. In her decision following trial, the trial justice concluded that plaintiff had met its burden of establishing that the 2013 ordinances substantially impaired the contractual rights of plaintiff’s members beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial justice specifically found that the 3 percent COLA was a vested right under the contract, and that the “cumulative impact [of the 2013 ordinances] to the individual was substantial.” Moreover, the trial justice found that the City had demonstrated a significant legitimate public purpose: “to remedy the fiscal emergency and keep at bay threatened cuts in state aid which would inexorably worsen the fiscal situation.” The trial justice also concluded that the 2013 ordinances were reasonable and necessary, finding that the City presented sufficient evidence that it had considered alternatives, a more moderate course was not available, and the 2013 ordinances were reasonable in light of the surrounding circumstances because they were “circumscribed, temporary, precipitated by a fiscal emergency, and prospective.”', 'The City argues that the trial justice erred in concluding that plaintiff proved the existence of a contractual right and that, therefore, the 2013 ordinances could not have substantially impaired a contractual obligation. Although we recognize the significance of this argument, because the City did not file a cross-appeal, this argument is not properly before us. Miller v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company, 88 A.3d 1157, 1162 n.8 (R.I. 2014) (“[I]f the prevailing party in the trial court wishes to overturn one of the lower court’s rulings below, a cross appeal must be filed.”) (quoting David A. Wollin, Rhode Island Appellate Procedure § 4:5, 4-11', '- 18 - (West 2004)). Thus, we assume, without deciding, the correctness of the trial justice’s conclusion in that regard, and instead move to the third part of the Contract Clause analysis, which requires an inquiry as to “whether the [contractual] impairment [was] reasonable and necessary to fulfill an important public purpose.” Nonnenmacher, 722 A.2d at 1202. The plaintiff challenges the trial justice’s findings as to both whether a legitimate public purpose existed and whether the 2013 ordinances were reasonable and necessary. We will take each argument in turn.', 'a', 'Significant and Legitimate Public Purpose', 'First, plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred in finding that a significant and legitimate public purpose existed because the factors she relied on to reach this conclusion, according to plaintiff, “neither individually nor combined, constitute[d] a ‘fiscal emergency’ as a matter of law to trigger forgiveness under the Contracts Clause.” Specifically, plaintiff avers that the financial problems faced by the City were common to many other municipalities, no immediate action was necessary to remedy the issues, the crisis was not created by the enactment of the pension statute, and a crisis of the City’s own making cannot allow for a finding of a legitimate public purpose.', 'As we have stated, the United States Supreme Court has held that, “[i]f the state regulation constitutes a substantial impairment, the State, in justification, must have a significant and legitimate public purpose behind the regulation, * * * such as the remedying of a broad and general social or economic problem.” Energy Reserves Group, Inc., 459 U.S. at 411-12. The Supreme Court has further instructed that “the public purpose need not be addressed to an emergency or temporary situation.” Id. at 412. We are mindful, however, that a legitimate public purpose is not to be found in all circumstances, particularly when related to economic issues. “If a State could reduce its financial obligations whenever it wanted to spend the money for what it regarded as an', '- 19 - important public purpose, the Contract Clause would provide no protection at all.” United States Trust Company of New York, 431 U.S. at 26; see also Allied Structural Steel Company v. Spannaus, 438 U.S. 234, 242 (1978) (“If the Contract Clause is to retain any meaning at all, however, it must be understood to impose some limits upon the power of a State * * *.”) (emphasis in original). Thus, “the purpose may not be simply the financial benefit of the sovereign.” Buffalo Teachers Federation v. Tobe, 464 F.3d 362, 368 (2d Cir. 2006).', 'This Court has previously discussed public purposes for challenged legislative actions in the context of the Contract Clause. For example, in Nonnenmacher, although we found that an ordinance requiring a setoff of disability payments under a city’s pension plan did not result in a substantial impairment of a contractual right, we stated that, assuming it did, there would be no violation of the Contract Clause because the ordinances in question “serve[d] to protect the solvency of the pension system and thereby serve[d] an important public purpose.” Nonnenmacher, 722 A.2d at 1201, 1203, 1204; see Retired Adjunct Professors of State of Rhode Island v. Almond, 690 A.2d 1342, 1347 (R.I. 1997) (holding that, assuming a statute limiting the amount of part-time work in which a state employee could engage while receiving state pension benefits substantially impaired the contract, it was “both reasonable and necessary to advance the legitimate public purpose of fostering public confidence in the State’s retirement system by restricting the proclivity of some public pensioners to indulge in what is colloquially referred to as ‘double dipping’”). Furthermore, in In re Advisory Opinion to the Governor (DEPCO), 593 A.2d 943 (R.I. 1991), this Court stated that “[t]he concept of public purpose * * * is not static but must be sufficiently flexible to meet the ever-changing needs of our complex society[,]” and, further, that “[t]he modern trend of authority is to expand and to construe liberally the meaning of public', '- 20 - purpose, especially in the area of economic welfare.” In re Advisory Opinion to the Governor (DEPCO), 593 A.2d at 948.', 'Here, the trial justice found that “the 2013 [o]rdinances were passed for a significant and legitimate public purpose[,]” reasoning, in part, that “the City has produced sufficient credible evidence through the testimony of Mayor Fung, Mr. Strom, and Mr. Sherman that the Great Recession, the decline in state aid, and RIRSA’s requirements created an unprecedented fiscal emergency neither created nor anticipated by the City.” The trial justice further concluded that “there is no indication that the 2013 [o]rdinances sought to benefit one particular group or individual over others.”', 'We, too, are of the opinion that the City has demonstrated a significant and legitimate public purpose for the passage of the 2013 ordinances. These ordinances were not intended merely for the “financial benefit of the sovereign[,]” Buffalo Teachers Federation, 464 F.3d at 368, but, rather, were designed to address the City’s serious fiscal crisis, one that was brought about by several factors, many not within the City’s control. One of the most critical factors precipitating the 2013 ordinances was a severe and historic recession in the years just prior to the passage of the ordinances, which the trial justice found “had far reaching and devastating economic and general social consequences” for the City.', 'Moreover, as noted, we have previously opined that “protect[ing] the solvency of [a] pension system” could be a legitimate public purpose—one that, here, is critically important to plaintiff’s members, who derive income from the system. Nonnenmacher, 722 A.2d at 1204. Thus, we find no error in the trial justice’s conclusion that the', '- 21 - 2013 ordinances served a “significant and legitimate public purpose[.]” See Energy Reserves Group, Inc., 459 U.S. at 411.', 'b', 'Reasonable and Necessary', 'The plaintiff also argues that “the City’s suspension of the COLA was neither reasonable nor necessary.”', 'The plaintiff specifically contends that the trial justice erred as to her determination of reasonableness because: (1) the underfunding of the pension plans existed when the City’s contractual obligation to the pensioners began; (2) the trial justice misconstrued the ordinances as “prospective” and “temporary”; and (3) the City did not adequately consider other policy alternatives, but instead chose a drastic impairment which was politically expedient. For its part, the City counters that, as to the “prospective” and “temporary” argument, the proper focus should be on the government action, rather than the effect. The City further asserts that plaintiff’s argument regarding the policy alternatives “completely ignores the record testimony.”', 'Although courts typically “defer to legislative judgment as to the necessity and reasonableness of a particular measure[,]” a municipality will be afforded less deference “[w]hen [it] impairs the obligation of its own contract[.]” United States Trust Company of New York, 431 U.S. at 23. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals has summarized this principle as follows:', '“Ultimately, for impairment to be reasonable and necessary under', 'less deference scrutiny, it must be shown that the state did not (1)', '‘consider impairing the contracts on par with other policy', 'alternatives’ or (2) ‘impose a drastic impairment when an evident', 'and more moderate course would serve its purpose equally well,’', 'nor (3) act unreasonably ‘in light of the surrounding', 'circumstances[.]’” Buffalo Teachers Federation, 464 F.3d at 371', '- 22 -', '(emphasis in original) (deletion omitted) (quoting United States', 'Trust Company of New York, 431 U.S. at 30-31). Furthermore, “the extent of the impairment is ‘a relevant factor in determining its reasonableness.’” Id. (quoting United States Trust Company of New York, 431 U.S. at 27).', 'Here, the trial justice found the ordinances to be reasonable and necessary because the City presented credible evidence that “it adequately considered and tried other policy alternatives”; “a more moderate course was not available”; and “the 2013 [o]rdinances were circumscribed, temporary, precipitated by a fiscal emergency, and prospective.” The trial justice further held that plaintiff did not rebut the City’s evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.', 'Although the plaintiff correctly points out that the underfunding of the pension system existed well before the passage of the 2013 ordinances, it is significant that, quite apart from the historic underfunding, the financial condition of the City and its pension system was greatly impacted by a number of circumstances in the years leading up to the passage of the 2013 ordinances. We appreciate plaintiff’s emphasis on a holding from our neighboring commonwealth that “[i]f the foreseen problem has changed between the time of the contracting and the time of the attempted impairment, but has changed only in degree and not in kind, the impairment is not reasonable.” Massachusetts Community College Council v. Commonwealth, 649 N.E.2d 708, 713 (Mass. 1995). However, the evidence at trial demonstrates that the City’s predicament grew out of more than its continued contractual obligations under CBAs and its failure to adequately fund the pension system. Rather, the difficult economic climate, a ruinous flooding situation, and the reduction in state aid compounded the initial underfunding issue. See Baltimore Teachers Union, 6 F.3d at 1021 n.13 (“To the extent the City was aware of its precarious financial condition and of possible reductions in state aid when it enacted its budget, however, we believe that the magnitude of the reductions in state aid rendered the budgetary shortfall that gave rise to the salary reductions', '- 23 - tantamount to a difference in kind from one the City might otherwise have anticipated.”). We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not misconceive or misconstrue evidence in this regard, and thus we afford significant deference to her factual determinations regarding the City’s financial condition.', 'Furthermore, after reviewing the evidence, we do not discern error in the trial justice’s determination that the City adequately considered other policy alternatives. The trial justice listened to the testimony of several witnesses—whom she deemed credible—who testified to that effect. Indeed, Mayor Fung testified that the City considered raising taxes, making more cuts to city personnel, and drastically reducing city services. Mayor Fung also testified that, in order to meet the City’s obligations under the funding improvement plan with these alternative measures, the budget cuts or tax raise would need to be significant. Moreover, we agree with the trial justice’s conclusions that the 2013 ordinances were narrowly tailored to the problem and that the impairment was temporary and prospective in nature because the 2013 ordinances suspended a future benefit for a finite period of time. The 2013 ordinances did not eliminate the COLA benefit altogether, and only affected COLAs not yet made available to retirees. Thus, granting the trial justice due deference, we find no reversible error in her determination that a more moderate course was not available and that the impairment was reasonable in light of the circumstances.', 'Accordingly, we agree with the trial justice’s conclusion that the 2013 ordinances did not violate the Contract Clauses of the United States or Rhode Island Constitutions.', 'B', 'Expert Testimony', 'The plaintiff argues that the trial justice misconceived and misapplied the testimony of plaintiff’s expert at trial. The plaintiff first avers that, because the trial justice disposed of several', '- 24 - pretrial motions regarding plaintiff’s expert, she, “as fact-finder, repeatedly reviewed the matters analyzed by the expert and the facts underpinning [Fornia’s] anticipated testimony before he ever had a chance to testify[,]” and thus she “essentially pre-judged CPRAC’s expert’s opinion before the expert was given a chance to offer it.” The plaintiff also argues that the trial justice “effectively disqualified” Fornia’s expert opinion because she actively disregarded evidence that was undisputed. The plaintiff further contends that the trial justice promoted form over substance during the trial because “the hoops that [Fornia] was required to jump through to impart his testimony effectively neutered any opinion or guidance he attempted to give the court as fact- finder * * *.”8 Finally, plaintiff argues that the trial justice, in error, effectively shifted the burden of production back to plaintiff to prove, through Fornia’s testimony, that the COLA suspension was the least drastic alternative.', 'Conversely, the City contends that, ultimately, Fornia was not prevented from testifying as to any of his opinions. The City also argues that, because this was a bench trial, plaintiff was not harmed if, in fact, the trial justice elevated form over substance, because she ultimately weighed the testimony. Finally, the City asserts that it proved that the COLA suspension was the least drastic alternative, and that asking Fornia to provide calculations to support his opinion that it was not the least drastic alternative was not impermissible.', '“On review, we accord great weight to a trial justice’s determinations of credibility, which, inherently, are the functions of the trial court and not the functions of the appellate court.” Gregoire, 138 A.3d at 191 (brackets omitted) (quoting South County Post & Beam, Inc., 116 A.3d 8', 'At trial, Fornia’s testimony was frequently interrupted by objections as to the form of questions posed to him.', '- 25 - at 210).

Moreover, “[i]t is the duty of a trial justice who is passing upon an issue of fact to determine such issue according to his own judgment, upon all the evidence, enlightened but not controlled by the opinion of experts.” Ashton v. Tax Assessors of Town of Jamestown, 60 R.I. 388, 396, 198 A. 786, 790 (1938).', 'We begin our discussion by noting that, after reviewing the trial justice’s commentary as to the motion seeking to exclude Fornia’s testimony, as well as Fornia’s actual testimony at trial, we are not persuaded by plaintiff’s claim that the trial justice was “pre-disposed to constrain” the expert’s testimony. The trial justice ultimately denied the City’s motion in limine to exclude Fornia’s testimony and, significantly, at trial, allowed him to testify about his opinions set forth in a disputed expert report, which was admitted as a full exhibit during his testimony.', 'Furthermore, we perceive no reversible error in the trial justice’s handling of the witness and reliance—or lack thereof—on his testimony. In her decision, the trial justice clearly articulated the parts of Fornia’s testimony that she considered to be significant. The trial justice first indicated that she gave weight to Fornia’s opinion that the loss caused by the ordinance was material. 9 As to his opinion about the significant and legitimate public purpose of the 2013 ordinances, the trial justice gave Fornia’s testimony “little weight” and clearly articulated the problems she saw in his 9', 'While the trial justice gave weight to portions of Fornia’s opinion, she did not rely on Fornia’s specific calculation regarding the average loss incurred by individual retirees.', '- 26 - calculations relating to his testimony on this issue. Finally, the trial justice gave no weight to Fornia’s opinion that the City did not choose the least drastic alternative, stating: “Mr. Fornia’s opinion did not consider the feasibility of raising taxes, the decline in state aid, or RIRSA’s requirements. * * * As such, this opinion is unsupported.” The trial justice, sitting without a jury, was entitled to make credibility determinations and weigh the evidence. See Gregoire, 138 A.3d at 191. It is clear that the trial justice carefully considered all of Fornia’s testimony.', 'Moreover, we do not see how plaintiff was prejudiced by the trial justice exalting form over substance during Fornia’s testimony. While we note that there were many objections as to the form of questions and as to evidentiary foundation during trial, it did not appear that Fornia’s testimony was substantively limited in any significant way. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s handling of the plaintiff’s expert at trial, or in her analysis of his testimony.', 'C', 'Takings Clause', 'One month prior to trial, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on plaintiff’s Takings Clause claim. In support of their motion, defendants argued that plaintiff’s members did not have a “constitutionally protected property interest in a lifetime, uninterrupted three-percent COLA.” The defendants further argued that, even if plaintiff’s members had a constitutionally- protected interest, the 2013 ordinances temporarily suspending their annual COLA did not constitute a taking. In its objection to the motion, plaintiff asserted that issues of material fact precluded summary disposition as to this particular claim. The trial justice issued a decision from the bench following a hearing, concluding that “a COLA is a vested benefit” and therefore was a property right for the purpose of the Takings Clause. Ultimately, however, the trial justice found', '- 27 - that “the changes to the plaintiff’s COLA benefits do not constitute an illegal taking[,]” and she granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment.10', 'On appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred in ruling that no unconstitutional taking occurred. The plaintiff argues that the trial justice improperly treated the COLA benefits as “unearned future compensation, or some type of state-created entitlement” and further incorrectly analyzed the issue as a regulatory taking as opposed to a physical taking. The plaintiff also argues that genuine issues of material fact as to the City’s subjective intent and the ordinances’ impact, necessity, and superfluity should have precluded the entry of summary judgment.', 'The defendants counter that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the 2013 ordinances “were prospective, temporary, impaired only a portion of the benefits provided under the collective bargaining agreements, and were part of a larger public program seeking to stabilize the City’s finances,” and thus the trial justice did not err in granting summary judgment. Additionally, defendants argue that plaintiff did not demonstrate a disputed material fact with respect to the City’s legislative findings supporting the ordinances.', 'It is well settled that “[t]his Court will review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.” Cancel v.

Neither party challenges the trial justice’s decision in this respect. Thus, for the purposes of our Takings Clause analysis, we assume, without deciding, that plaintiff’s members have a protected property interest in future COLA payments.', 'According to plaintiff, the trial justice erred in analyzing the COLA suspension as a regulatory taking as opposed to a physical taking. Both this Court and the United States Supreme Court have distinguished between physical and regulatory takings. See Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v.

See Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 475 U.S. 211, 225 (1986) (analyzing a takings claim involving contract rights under the Penn Central framework).

Indeed, the trial justice found, as part of her Contract Clause analysis, and we agree, that the cumulative impact of the COLA suspension on CPRAC’s members was significant. However, critical to this analysis is that the suspension of COLA benefits is “temporary and operates only during a control period.” Buffalo Teachers Federation, 464 F.3d at 375. Furthermore, the COLA suspension impacts only part of the total pension benefits received; it does not take away the base pension payments or any other retirement benefits. See id. (“[T]his is not a case in which a law abrogates an entire contract.”). We agree with the trial justice that these facts are not disputed.', 'Additionally, the government action was focused on future benefits and did not affect any COLA payments made prior to its enactment. The City did not “physically invade or permanently appropriate any of the [retirees’] assets for its own use.” Connolly, 475 U.S. at 225.

The plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred by allowing defendants to relitigate the issue of whether pension benefits could be changed through ordinances rather than through a collective bargaining process. The plaintiff also asserts that there are no meaningful distinctions between the instant litigation and the prior litigation. The defendants, for their part, argue that the issues are different in the instant litigation as compared to the prior litigation because the two sets of ordinances do not change the pension benefits in the same way and the cases were litigated on different legal principles. The defendants also assert that the 2005 decision cannot be applied to prospectively restrain the City from exercising its police powers.', 'As we have stated earlier in this opinion, we review an appeal from cross-motions for summary judgment de novo.

The plaintiff’s claim in its complaint, as well as its argument in connection with its motion for summary judgment, focused exclusively on res judicata, and the trial justice resolved the parties’ cross- motions after considering the arguments set forth regarding res judicata. There is no indication that the trial justice also considered the doctrine of collateral estoppel.

The plaintiff alleged—and provided uncontroverted evidence—that the Attorney General’s office had concluded that the Cranston City Council had indeed violated the OMA by entertaining new business during the March 25, 2013 meeting, when the agenda had not listed any items under the “new business” heading. The defendants filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiff did not have statutory standing to bring the OMA their contractual obligations to police and firefighter retirees through the legislative process.

The attorney general shall investigate the', 'complaint and if the attorney general determines that the allegations', 'of the complaint are meritorious he or she may file a complaint on', 'behalf of the complainant in the superior court against the public', 'body.” Section 42-46-8(a).

Accordingly, judgment as a matter of law in favor of defendants on plaintiff’s OMA violation claim is affirmed.', 'F', 'Legislative Immunity', 'The plaintiff also challenges both of the trial justice’s pretrial rulings that were based on the doctrine of legislative immunity: (1) the grant of defendants’ motion for a protective order concerning the deposition of defendant Lanni, a member of the Cranston City Council; and (2) the grant of defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to the Non-City defendants.', 'The doctrine of legislative immunity extends from the Speech or Debate Clause of the United States Constitution and the similar “speech in debate” clause of the Rhode Island Constitution. See U.S. Const., art. I, § 6, cl. 1; R.I. Const., art. 6, § 5; see also United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 507 (1972); Holmes v. Farmer, 475 A.2d 976, 983 (R.I. 1984). We have previously held that “[t]he speech in debate clause contained in Rhode Island’s Constitution confers a privilege on legislators from inquiry into their legislative acts or into the motivation for actual performance of legislative acts that are clearly part of the legislative process.” Holmes, 475 A.2d at 983. Further, “[i]n order fully to effectuate the purpose and design of the speech in debate clause, it must be construed as an immunity from suit as well as a testimonial privilege.” Id. at 984. This Court has made clear that the privilege extends to municipal officials. Maynard v. Beck, 741 A.2d 866, 872 (R.I. 1999). However, while the privilege protects legislators from being “questioned by any other branch of government for their acts in carrying out their legislative duties relating to the legislative process[,]” its scope “does not extend to actions by legislators outside the legislative process.” Holmes, 475 A.2d at 983.', '- 40 -', '1', 'Lanni Protective Order', 'In the course of discovery, defendants filed a motion for a protective order to prevent plaintiff from deposing defendant Lanni. The defendants argued that Lanni was protected from deposition by the privilege of legislative immunity, and that his testimony would not be relevant to the central issue of the case. The plaintiff objected to defendants’ motion, arguing that the topics plaintiff sought to cover in Lanni’s deposition were outside the scope of legislative immunity, including “information concerning the various police and firefighter Collective Bargaining Agreements, the general financial condition of the City, the actions of actuarial consultants, City spending, and budget * * *.” The plaintiff also argued that it was entitled to ask Lanni about subjects listed as accomplishments and future goals on his campaign website. 17', 'The trial justice granted defendants’ motion on the basis that Lanni enjoyed the privilege of legislative immunity, and that the topics plaintiff sought to question Lanni about were related to his position as a legislator. Specifically, the trial justice held that: “Much of what [CPRAC] requests—information relating to police and firefighter Collective Bargaining Agreements, financial conditions and spending of the City, and actuarial reports—can be easily obtained.” The trial justice also found that the subjects related to statements on Lanni’s campaign website were “less clearly within legislative immunity[,]” but that the privilege applied because “the information from that website is, in substance, material relating to Mr. Lanni’s legislative duties.” 17', 'The subjects found on Lanni’s website, as outlined in plaintiff’s objection to defendants’ motion, were: “Tax Freeze 2005-2006”; “Tax Decrease 2006-2007”; “Tax Freeze 2008-2009”; “Reduce the City’s $300,000,000 unfunded pension liability”; “Improve the City’s Bond Rating”; “Protect the ‘Rainy Day Fund’”; “Achieve Tax Stability”; and “Control ‘Runaway’ city spending.” Lanni’s website, formerly located at http://www.johnlanniforcranston.com, is no longer active. Accordingly, we rely on plaintiff’s filings and the Superior Court’s September 15, 2015 decision for this information.', '- 41 -', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in granting defendants’ motion because the protective order was excessive in scope and prevented plaintiff from deposing Lanni on subjects that should be considered outside the protection of legislative immunity.', 'The defendants counter that plaintiff has failed to identify a subject of inquiry that would not implicate legislative immunity, and therefore the trial justice did not err.', 'It is well settled that, “‘in granting or denying discovery motions, a Superior Court justice has broad discretion,’ which ‘this Court will not disturb save for an abuse of that discretion.’” State v. Lead Industries Association, Inc., 64 A.3d 1183, 1191 (R.I. 2013) (brackets and deletion omitted) (quoting Colvin v. Lekas, 731 A.2d 718, 720 (R.I. 1999)).', 'We see no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s analysis. We recognize that legislative immunity “does not protect the political activities of the legislators”; however, “[i]nquiry by the court into the actions or motivations of the legislators in proposing, passing, or voting upon a particular piece of legislation * * * falls clearly within the most basic elements of legislative privilege.” Holmes, 475 A.2d at 983, 984. The information which plaintiff sought to obtain would have been disclosed to Lanni by virtue of his position as city council member and president; and, more importantly, it formed part of the consideration and approval of the 2013 ordinances. Thus, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in granting defendants’ motion for protective order on the basis of legislative immunity.', '2', 'Non-City Defendants', 'One month before trial, the Non-City defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the allegations in the complaint against them were “premised on their legislative acts,” and thus they enjoyed the privilege of legislative immunity related to those acts. The plaintiff', '- 42 - objected to the motion, arguing that the Non-City defendants’ acts were administrative in nature, and not legislative. The trial justice rejected plaintiff’s argument that the acts were administrative in nature; instead, she found that “[i]t is hard for this [c]ourt to imagine something more clearly legislative in nature than the passage of an ordinance.” Moreover, the trial justice ultimately found that there was “no genuine issue of material fact that the very core of the plaintiff’s claims against the [N]on-City defendants is premised on their performance of legislative acts[,]” and thus, based on the doctrine of legislative immunity, the trial justice held that the Non-City defendants were entitled to summary judgment in their favor.', 'Before us, plaintiff reiterates the argument that the Non-City defendants’ roles in the enactment of the 2013 ordinances were “administrative rather than legislative” in nature, and, thus, they did not enjoy the privilege of legislative immunity. 18 As we have stated, we review the grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo. Cancel, 187 A.3d at 349.', '“To determine whether challenged conduct is legislative * * * a court must consider the nature of the acts in question, rather than the motive or intent of the official performing them.” Maynard, 741 A.2d at 870. According to the United States Supreme Court, some “quintessentially legislative” actions include the “introduction of a budget and signing into law an ordinance[,]” as well as other “integral steps in the legislative process.” Bogan v. Scott-Harris, 523 U.S. 44, 55 18', 'The plaintiff also argues that the motion for summary judgment “should have been captioned as a Rule 12 motion [because] no matters were in consideration other than those that were in the pleadings[,]” and, if considered under that rule, defendants’ assertion of legislative immunity for the Non-City defendants should have been deemed to have been waived because it was raised “on the eve of trial[.]” As defendants contend, plaintiff’s argument as to Rule 12 is waived because it was not raised below. “[I]n accordance with this Court’s longstanding ‘raise-or-waive’ rule, if an issue was not properly asserted, and thereby preserved, in the lower tribunals, this Court will not consider the issue on appeal.” Adams v. Santander Bank, N.A., 183 A.3d 544, 548 (R.I. 2018) (quoting Miller v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 160 A.3d 975, 980 (R.I. 2017)). The plaintiff failed to assert this contention in its papers or at the hearing below. Thus, we decline to address this argument.', '- 43 - (1998). While not all actions entitle a government official to the protection of legislative immunity, it is our opinion that the actions by the Non-City defendants here were certainly “legislative in character[.]” See Maynard, 741 A.2d at 870. It is clear that plaintiff’s claims stem from the Non-City defendants’ participation in the legislative process, as plaintiff does not allege wrongful actions of the Non-City defendants beyond the enactment of the 2013 ordinances. Thus, the Non-City defendants were entitled to summary judgment.', 'G', 'Amendment to Answer', 'In November 2015, three days before the trial started, the City filed a motion to amend its answer to clarify its denial of certain allegations in the complaint and to conform the pleading to the evidence. The proposed amended answer included an additional affirmative defense: that the City exercised its police power when it enacted the 2013 ordinances. The plaintiff objected to the amendment on the basis that it was untimely and prejudicial because plaintiff would not have time to conduct additional discovery about the new affirmative defense prior to trial. The trial justice held a brief hearing on the City’s motion on the morning of the first day of trial. At the hearing, the City argued that the exercise of its police power had been a dominant theme throughout the pretrial proceedings and that formally adding this affirmative defense to its answer merely ensured that the pleading conformed to the evidence. The trial justice granted the motion to amend, concluding that plaintiff had not demonstrated any prejudice that would be caused by the proposed amendments to the answer because the issue of the City’s police power had been at the forefront since the beginning of the case.', 'Before us, plaintiff argues that the trial justice abused her discretion when she allowed the City to amend its answer on the first day of trial because plaintiff was “extreme[ly] prejudice[d]”', '- 44 - by the surprise of the additional affirmative defense and had no time to conduct discovery on this new defense. The plaintiff also faults the trial justice for not asking the City why the amendment was requested so close to the beginning of the trial. The City responds that plaintiff has not adequately explained how it was prejudiced, and therefore, if there was any error in granting the motion to amend, the error was harmless. The City also reasserts that the exercise of police power is inextricably linked to plaintiff’s Contract Clause claim, and therefore there was no surprise that the City added this to its answer.', 'Rule 15 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure allows litigants to request permission from the trial court to file an amended pleading and provides that such permission “shall be freely given when justice so requires.” This Court “accord[s] great deference to the decision by a hearing justice to grant or deny a motion to amend and will not disturb his [or her] decision unless he [or she] abused his [or her] discretion.” CACH, LLC v. Potter, 154 A.3d 939, 942 (R.I. 2017). We have previously held that amendments to pleadings should be allowed unless the nonmoving party can show the amendment will result in “extreme prejudice” to them, and that “mere delay is not enough to deny the amendment[,]” id. (internal citations omitted), unless the trial justice “find[s] that such delay creates substantial prejudice to the opposing party.” Lomastro v. Iacovelli, 56 A.3d 92, 96 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Wachsberger v. Pepper, 583 A.2d 77, 79 (R.I. 1990)).', 'The plaintiff was given an opportunity to explain to the trial justice how it would be prejudiced by the addition of the affirmative defense. Other than stating that it had no time to conduct additional discovery, plaintiff did not explain how it was prejudiced or what additional discovery it would have conducted had the amended answer been filed sooner. In our opinion, plaintiff did not demonstrate either substantial prejudice by the City’s delay in requesting', '- 45 - permission to amend the answer or extreme prejudice by allowing the amendment. We conclude, therefore, that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she granted the City’s motion to amend its answer, and we affirm this order.', 'H', 'Bill of Costs/Motion to Stay Consideration of Bill of Costs', 'On August 5, 2016, one day after the final judgment entered, the City filed a bill of costs, requesting $14,708.01. These costs included fees for acquiring deposition and trial transcripts, printing exhibits, and scanning and making copies of documents. The plaintiff objected to the bill of costs, arguing that the request was excessive because some of the transcripts were generated from witness depositions that were not used during the trial. The plaintiff also filed a motion to stay consideration of the bill of costs until after the appeal was decided by this Court, arguing that the City would not be entitled to these costs if plaintiff prevailed on any of the issues raised in its appeal. The City objected to the motion to stay, arguing that plaintiff had not established that it was entitled to the stay pending appeal. The City also argued that, because an award of costs generates an appealable order, principles of judicial economy dictated that the bill of costs should be decided immediately.', 'The trial justice held a hearing on October 13, 2016. She summarily denied plaintiff’s motion to stay and granted the City’s bill of costs, in part, awarding $9,717.85. The award excluded the trial transcript costs and half of the printing fees requested by the City.', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred by not considering its motion to stay prior to considering the bill of costs and denying the motion to stay without providing any reasoning to support her decision. The plaintiff asserts, without any legal support or discussion, that the trial justice “should have heard CPRAC’s [m]otion to [s]tay and decided on the merits of', '- 46 - that motion before passing on a bill of costs.” The plaintiff also contends that the trial justice’s ruling deprived plaintiff of its ability to seek a stay from this Court because the trial justice proceeded to immediately consider and rule on the City’s request for costs after she denied the motion to stay. With respect to plaintiff’s motion to stay consideration of the City’s request for costs, we hold that plaintiff has waived its argument for failure to adequately develop it for our review. 19 See State v. Florez, 138 A.3d 789, 798 n.10 (R.I. 2016) (“[T]his Court ‘considers an issue to be waived when a party simply states an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues.’”) (brackets and deletion omitted) (quoting Bucci v.

For the sake of clarity, I shall address those two areas of concern separately, and I shall do so with relative brevity. 20', 'A', 'Impairing the Obligation of Contracts under the Contracts Clause 21', 'I readily acknowledge the scholarly nature of the Court’s opinion; it represents an impressively Herculean effort to summarize the complex factual background that the case involves. 22 It also represents an impressive effort to apply to those facts the subtle and very 20', 'It was only after reading over and over again the trial justice’s meticulous fact-finding and credibility assessments and after poring over the often opaque and difficult-to-reconcile principles set forth in the controlling precedents that I concluded that I would be able in good conscience (albeit with much hesitation and many reservations) to concur with the result reached by the majority with respect to both the Contracts Clause and Open Meetings Act issues.', 'As for the other issues addressed by the majority (expert testimony; the Takings Clause; res judicata and collateral estoppel; legislative immunity; the amendment to the answer; and the bill of costs), I join in the opinion of the Court—although I view the bill of costs issue to be exceedingly close. 21', 'The relevant constitutional language should be borne in mind. The stark and straightforward Contracts Clause in the United States Constitution provides that “[n]o state shall * * * pass any * * * Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.” U.S. Const. Art. I, § 10, cl. 1. The parallel Rhode Island constitutional provision is similarly stark and straightforward: “No * * * law impairing the obligation of contracts shall be passed.” R.I. Const. art. 1, § 12 (punctuation omitted). 22', 'I also acknowledge the scholarly and detail-oriented nature of the trial justice’s rescript decision. Her careful fact-finding and credibility assessments have made the task of this Court less onerous—especially in view of the deferential standard of review that is applicable with respect to same. See Lamarque v. Centreville Savings Bank, 22 A.3d 1136, 1140 (R.I. 2011) (“When we review the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury, we accord those findings great deference.”); see also JPL Livery Services, Inc. v. Rhode Island Department of Administration, 88 A.3d 1134, 1142 (R.I. 2014) (“[W]e accord great weight to a trial justice’s determinations of credibility, which, inherently, are the functions of the trial court and not the functions of the appellate court.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '- 49 - nuanced principles of law that presently prevail and by which one is required to abide in analyzing a claim that a particular enactment is violative of the Contracts Clause.', 'I have concluded that the relevant precedent compels me to concur when due weight is accorded to the collection of unanticipated occurrences (e.g., events such as what the trial justice refers to as “the Great Recession” and as “two natural disasters in March of 2010”) as well as the very crucial fact that the contractual impairment at issue is temporally limited. But for me this case is extremely close. To my mind, the Court’s ruling in this case is the equivalent of standing on the banks of the Rubicon. In my heart of hearts, I think that we, as a nation and as a state, have strayed far from what the Contracts Clauses were clearly meant to prohibit: i.e., any law impairing the obligation of contracts.', 'My own thinking in this regard is in accord with the historically-based approach to constitutional issues that Justice Neil Gorsuch of the United States Supreme Court has demonstrated in his perceptive and eloquent dissent in the quite recent case of Sveen v. Melin, 138 S.Ct. 1815 (2018). Sveen, 138 S.Ct. at 1826 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting); see generally Douglas W. Kmiec & John O. McGinnis, The Contract Clause: A Return to the Original Understanding, 14 Hastings Const. L.Q. 525 (1987). In the portion of his dissent in Sveen where he reminds the reader of the unequivocal wording of the Contracts Clause in the United States Constitution, Justice Gorsuch writes as follows in language that I find to be particularly powerful and thought- provoking:', '“The Contracts Clause categorically prohibits states from passing', '‘any * * * Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts.’ Art. I, § 10,', 'cl. 1 (emphasis added). Of course, the framers knew how to impose', 'more nuanced limits on state power. The very section of the', 'Constitution where the Contracts Clause is found permits states to', 'take otherwise unconstitutional action when ‘absolutely necessary,’', 'if ‘actually invaded,’ or ‘wit[h] the Consent of Congress.’ Cls. 2 and', '3. But in the Contracts Clause the framers were absolute. They took', '- 50 -', 'the view that treating existing contracts as ‘inviolable’ would benefit', 'society by ensuring that all persons could count on the ability to', 'enforce promises lawfully made to them * * *.” Sveen, 138 S.Ct. at', '1826-27 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (emphasis in original). I for one yearn for the day when the courts will revert to something substantially closer to an “absolutist” understanding of the Contracts Clause. In the meantime, however, I bow obediently, but discontentedly, to the result that prevailing precedent dictates.', 'B', 'The Open Meetings Act', 'I also very reluctantly concur in that portion of the Court’s opinion that deals with the Open Meetings Act issue. See G.L. 1956 chapter 46 of title 42. After correctly noting that § 42-46-8(a) authorizes “[a]ny citizen or entity of the state” to file an Open Meetings Act complaint with the Attorney General, the Court goes on to point out that § 42-46-8(c) speaks exclusively of the right of an individual (without any mention of entities) to retain private counsel for the purpose of filing a complaint in the Superior Court under the Open Meetings Act. (Emphasis added.) Pursuant to our statutory interpretation jurisprudence, the statute at issue, which is undeniably clear and unambiguous, must be applied as written—i.e., as not authorizing entities to file suit under the Act.

Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of State, 61 A.3d 432, 436 (R.I. 2013) (“It is well settled that ‘the plain statutory language’ is ‘the best indicator’ of the General Assembly’s intent.”) (quoting McCain v.

See Powers v. Warwick Public Schools, 204 A.3d 1078, 1088 (R.I. 2019) (“[I]t is not the function of this Court to act as a super legislative body and rewrite or amend statutes already enacted by the General Assembly.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Olamuyiwa v.

I must respectfully state, however, that I have great difficulty in conceiving of a sound public policy reason to allow individuals to bring suit while not giving entities23 the same right—especially when one keeps in mind the crucially important concept that is the basis for the Open Meetings Act: the need for intense scrutiny of and critical comment about the doings of government. See, e.g., Louis D. Brandeis, Other People’s Money and How the Bankers Use It 92 (Frederick A. Stokes Company 1914) (“Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants * * *.”); see also Rosanova v. Playboy Enterprises, Inc., 580 F.2d 859, 861 (5th Cir. 1978) (“Comment upon people and activities of legitimate public concern often illuminates that which yearns for shadow.”).

31,"No. 2018-211-Appeal. (PM 14-1950) Gary M. Morse : v. : Michael R. Minardi, in his capacity as the : Town of Barrington Tax Assessor, et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. In these actions challenging the assessment of alleged illegal taxes, the plaintiff, Gary M. Morse (Morse), appeals pro se from judgments entered in favor of the defendants, various officials of the Town of Barrington, Rhode Island (Barrington); Sweetbriar, LP (Sweetbriar); and East Bay Community Development Corporation (East Bay) (collectively defendants). This matter came before the Court on May 1, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in the declaratory judgment action and deny and dismiss the appeal in the tax appeal action.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'These appeals involve the real estate taxes on several properties and property owners. Morse is the owner of property located at 2 Westwood Lane in Barrington. Sweetbriar is the owner of a low and moderate income housing development, which is located on Washington Road and Bay Spring Avenue in Barrington (the Sweetbriar development).1 East Bay is currently the owner of the Palmer Pointe housing project, located at Sowams Road in Barrington (the Palmer Pointe project).', 'This controversy’s roots formed in August 2003, when East Bay applied to the Barrington Zoning Board of Review (the board) for a comprehensive permit to develop fifty units of low or moderate income housing in Barrington. East Bay Community Development Corporation v. Zoning Board of Review of Town of Barrington, 901 A.2d 1136, 1141 (R.I. 2006). East Bay’s application went before the board, which denied the application in May 2004, reasoning, inter alia, that the project did not conform to Barrington’s comprehensive plan. Id. at 1141-42. East Bay appealed the board’s decision to the State Housing Appeals Board (SHAB) pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 45-53-5. Id. at 1143. The SHAB reversed the board’s decision because it “was not consistent with local needs and did not weigh the state’s need for low and moderate income housing against some of the other concerns that were raised in opposition to the proposal.” Id. Barrington appealed to this Court, and we affirmed SHAB’s decision. Id. at 1140-41.', 'On December 2, 2008, after final plan approval for the Sweetbriar development was granted, the Barrington town council granted Sweetbriar a tax of 8 percent of gross rental income, 1', 'East Bay, which had developed the Sweetbriar development that is involved in the present controversy, later sold that development to Sweetbriar.', '-2- pursuant to G.L. 1956 §§ 44-5-12(a)2 and 44-5-13.11.3 Subsequently, East Bay filed an application with Barrington in March 2013 to develop another low and moderate income housing development in Barrington, known as Palmer Pointe. In August 2013, Barrington granted comprehensive permits for the Palmer Pointe project.', 'However, Morse was unhappy with the tax assessments that the Sweetbriar development had received; he was also concerned that Barrington was considering applying the same assessment formula to the Palmer Pointe project. Arguing that the Barrington tax assessor had overtaxed his property for the 2012 tax year, as a result of under taxing the Sweetbriar development, on September 4, 2013, Morse filed an appeal to the Barrington tax assessor, pursuant to § 44-5-26. The Barrington tax assessor denied Morse’s tax appeal on October 19, 2013. Morse 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 44-5-12 states, in pertinent part:', '“(a) All real property subject to taxation shall be assessed at its full', 'and fair cash value, or at a uniform percentage of its value, not to', 'exceed one hundred percent (100%), to be determined by the', 'assessors in each town or city; provided, that:', '“(1) Any residential property encumbered by a covenant', 'recorded in the land records in favor of a governmental unit', 'or Rhode Island housing and mortgage finance corporation', 'restricting either or both the rents that may be charged or the', 'incomes of the occupants shall be assessed and taxed in', 'accordance with § 44-5-13.11 * * *.” 3', 'Section 44-5-13.11 provides:', '“Any residential property that has been issued an occupancy permit', 'on or after January 1, 1995, after substantial rehabilitation as defined', 'by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and is', 'encumbered by a covenant recorded in the land records in favor of', 'a governmental unit or Rhode Island housing and mortgage finance', 'corporation restricting either or both the rents that may be charged', 'to tenants of the property or the incomes of the occupants of the', 'property, is subject to a tax that equals eight percent (8%) of the', 'property’s previous years’ gross scheduled rental income or a lesser', 'percentage as determined by each municipality.”', '-3- then appealed that denial to the Barrington Tax Board of Review. On February 26, 2014, the Barrington Tax Board of Review denied Morse’s appeal; the denial was recorded on March 20, 2014. Subsequently, on April 18, 2014, Morse timely filed a complaint in the Superior Court appealing his assessment pursuant to §§ 44-5-26 and 44-5-27 (the tax appeal action). On the same day, Morse filed a separate declaratory-judgment action in the Superior Court (the declaratory- judgment action) against the same defendants as in the tax appeal action in addition to East Bay, as developer of the Palmer Pointe project.', 'Morse filed amended complaints in each action on June 20, 2014. In Morse’s amended complaint for the tax appeal action, he asserted that Barrington had unlawfully taxed the Sweetbriar development at the lower 8 percent of gross rental income rate under § 44-5-13.11 instead of the tax rate for the total valuation of the property. Morse asserted that Sweetbriar was not entitled to the lower tax rate because the property had not undergone “substantial rehabilitation” as required by § 44-5-13.11. He argued that this was so because the Sweetbriar development was a newly-constructed complex, and § 44-5-13.11, he contended, applied only to preexisting buildings. Morse also alleged that the “unlawful” lower tax rate for the Sweetbriar development resulted in his paying proportionally higher taxes on his property, in order to sustain Barrington’s budget. Morse claimed that the tax on the Sweetbriar development violated the Rhode Island Constitution. In conclusion, he asked the Superior Court to set aside the allegedly disproportionate tax increase that had been imposed on his property.', 'In Morse’s amended complaint in the declaratory-judgment action, he sought a declaration that Barrington’s interpretation of §§ 44-5-12(a) and 44-5-13.11 violated the “fair and equal distribution of burdens” clause under article 1, section 2 of the Rhode Island Constitution. He also sought a declaration that the lower tax rate for the Sweetbriar development exceeded Barrington’s', '-4- authority under article 13, section 5 of the Rhode Island Constitution. Finally, Morse requested that the Superior Court set aside the higher tax levy on his property and enjoin Barrington from assessing the Sweetbriar development at the modified rate.', 'The hearing justice consolidated the two actions for hearing; and, on July 30, 2015, the parties submitted stipulated facts and exhibits to the Superior Court. Subsequently, the parties submitted memoranda addressing the issue of standing and their respective interpretations of §§ 44-5-12 and 44-5-13.11. In their joint memorandum, defendants contended that both the tax appeal action and the declaratory-judgment action should be dismissed primarily because Morse lacked standing to bring either claim.', 'A hearing was held on January 29, 2016. At that hearing, Morse explained that he had filed the two Superior Court actions because he believed that he might have an easier time meeting the standing requirements on public policy grounds with the declaratory-judgment action than with the tax appeal action. Morse averred, however, that under § 44-5-26 he had standing to pursue his tax appeal as a “person aggrieved * * * by [an] assessment of taxes[.]” He then argued that the issue before the Superior Court had sufficiently high public importance for him to pursue the declaratory-judgment action, even if he had not suffered a particularized injury.', 'Sweetbriar and East Bay responded that the political arena provided the proper recourse for Morse to voice his opposition to the Sweetbriar development and the Palmer Pointe project. They maintained that Morse did not have standing and that the matter was not of such significant public interest as to warrant the court’s relaxing the standing requirements. They also averred that', '-5- Morse’s interpretation of § 44-5-13.11 was erroneous and that the statute applies to both new construction and preexisting low and moderate income housing.4', 'Barrington added that § 44-5-12(a) specifically allows residential properties encumbered by a low-to-moderate-income restriction to be taxed in accordance with the provisions of § 44-5-13.11. However, Barrington firmly agreed with Sweetbriar and East Bay that Morse did not have standing to pursue his claims.', 'On December 18, 2017, the hearing justice issued a bench decision in which he addressed the issue of standing only. He noted that, for a taxpayer to have standing, he or she must have a personal stake in the controversy beyond that of the public at large. The hearing justice found that Morse’s alleged increased tax burden was the same injury that any other Barrington taxpayer could claim and, thus, he had no particularized injury. Therefore, the hearing justice ruled that Morse lacked standing to bring either action. He also found that the matter was not of such great public importance for the court to overlook the traditional standing requirements. Without addressing the merits of either action, the hearing justice dismissed Morse’s claims.', 'On December 20, 2017, orders entered in both cases dismissing plaintiff’s claims; final judgment entered in favor of defendants in both actions on that same day. Morse filed a timely notice of appeal in the declaratory-judgment action on January 8, 2018. However, he filed an untimely notice of appeal in the tax appeal action on July 12, 2018. 4', 'Thirteen years earlier, the board had requested and received an opinion letter from the Rhode Island Housing Authority (RIHA) on the application of §§ 44-5-12 and 44-5-13.11 to newly- constructed low and moderate income housing. In that letter, which is dated November 18, 2003, RIHA opined that it interpreted §§ 44-5-12 and 44-5-13.11 to apply to newly-constructed buildings in addition to preexisting buildings.', '-6-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This case was tried upon a set of stipulated facts. Review of the trial justice’s decision in these cases is narrowly defined.” Hudson v. GEICO Insurance Agency, Inc., 161 A.3d 1150, 1153 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Delbonis Sand & Gravel Co. v. Town of Richmond, 909 A.2d 922, 925 (R.I. 2006)). “The trial court does not play a fact-finding role, but is limited to applying the law to the agreed-upon facts.” Id.

(brackets omitted) (quoting Hagenberg v. Avedisian, 879 A.2d 436, 441 (R.I. 2005)).', 'We have stated that “[t]he issue of whether plaintiff had standing to bring [his] appeal is a mixed question of law and fact.” Cummings v. Shorey, 761 A.2d 680, 684 (R.I. 2000). “A [hearing] justice’s findings on mixed questions of law and fact are generally entitled to the same deference as the justice’s findings of fact.” Id. (quoting Palazollo v. State, 746 A.2d 707, 711 (R.I. 2000)). “But, when those mixed questions of law and fact impact constitutional matters, we shall review the findings de novo * * *.” Id. (quoting Palazollo, 746 A.2d at 711).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Morse contends that he has standing in both cases because he has been forced to pay a higher amount on his taxes because of Sweetbriar’s favorable tax treatment under §§ 44-5-12 and 44-5-13.11. He also argues that the hearing justice erred in declining to address the merits of his claims. However, as an initial matter, we hold that the declaratory-judgment action did not set forth a cognizable claim. During this term, in Bluedog Capital Partners, LLC v. Murphy, No. 2017-138-Appeal, 2019 WL 1962075 (R.I. May 1, 2019), we stated “that the taxing', '-7- statutes provide the exclusive relief to any person aggrieved by any assessment of taxes against him by any city or town.” Bluedog Capital Partners, LLC, 2019 WL 1962075, at *4 (emphasis added) (quoting Lehigh Cement Co. v. Quinn, 173 A.3d 1272, 1278 (R.I. 2017)). Under this rule, a person challenging an assessment of taxes may not maintain a cause of action for declaratory relief. See id. at *5. Thus, Morse was confined to bringing a tax appeal action under the provisions of §§ 44-5-26 and 44-5-27. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in the declaratory-judgment action.5', 'Turning now to the tax appeal action, we note that Morse filed a notice of appeal from the judgment in that case on July 12, 2018, well after the twenty-day deadline set forth in Article I, Rule 4(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure.6 See Malinou v. Seattle Savings Bank, 970 A.2d 6, 10 (R.I. 2009) (“In accordance with Article I, Rule 4(a) * * * a notice of appeal must be filed ‘within twenty (20) days of the date of the entry of the judgment.’”). When Morse filed a timely notice of appeal from the judgment in the declaratory-judgment action on January 8, 2018, he listed the case numbers for both the tax appeal action and the declaratory-judgment action on the notice and he requested the transcript in the tax appeal action at that time. However, those endeavors do not negate the fact that his notice of appeal in the tax appeal action was not timely 5', '“In so doing, we follow ‘our precedent of affirming the orders and judgments of a trial court when there are other valid reasons to support the order or judgment appealed from.’” Summit Insurance Company v. Stricklett, 199 A.3d 523, 524 n.1 (R.I. 2019) (brackets and deletion omitted) (quoting McGovern v. Bank of America, N.A., 91 A.3d 853, 861 (R.I. 2014)). 6', 'Although Barrington seemed to concede at oral argument that the appeal was properly before this Court, we have consistently stated that “[o]ur appellate jurisdiction may not properly be invoked when an appeal is filed more than twenty days subsequent to the entry of the judgment of which review is being sought.” Iozzi v. City of Cranston, 52 A.3d 585, 588 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Wachovia Bank v. Hershberger, 911 A.2d 278, 280 (R.I. 2006) (mem.)). Thus, because “[t]he filing of a timely notice of appeal is the ‘sole sine qua non of the taking of the appeal[,]’” Pawtucket Redevelopment Agency v. Brown, 106 A.3d 893, 900 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1020 (R.I. 2005)), Barrington could not confer jurisdiction on this Court to hear the appeal where none existed.', '-8- filed. “It is well settled that causes of action may be consolidated for judicial economy when the actions involve common law and facts, but that the consolidated matter does not merge into a single cause of action.” Malinou v. Neri, 197 A.3d 1282, 1286 (R.I. 2018). “Instead, the causes of action ‘remain distinct throughout trial and in the event of an appeal, a notice of appeal must be filed for each action.’” Id. (quoting In re Estate of Ross, 131 A.3d 158, 159 n.2 (R.I. 2016)). Therefore, that appeal is not properly before this Court.', 'Nevertheless, even if we assume, arguendo, that Morse had timely filed an appeal in the tax appeal action, his claim would still fail for want of standing. This Court has held that “[a]t its core, inquiries into standing consider whether the party seeking relief has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to ensure concrete adverseness that sharpens the presentation of the issues.” Warfel v. Town of New Shoreham, 178 A.3d 988, 991 (R.I. 2018) (deletions omitted) (quoting 1112 Charles, L.P. v. Fornel Entertainment, Inc., 159 A.3d 619, 625 (R.I. 2017)). “The party asserting standing must have an injury in fact that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” Id. (deletions omitted) (quoting 1112 Charles, L.P., 159 A.3d at 625). “We have also held that a taxpayer has standing if the individual has a ‘personal stake beyond that shared by all other members of the public at large or the taxpayers of the town.’” Cummings, 761 A.2d at 684 (quoting West Warwick School Committee v. Souliere, 626 A.2d 1280, 1284 (R.I. 1993)).', 'In this case, Morse has not shown that he has a “personal stake beyond that shared by all other members of the public at large or the taxpayers of the town.” Cummings, 761 A.2d at 684 (quoting West Warwick School Committee, 626 A.2d at 1284). Morse is not challenging his own taxes; instead, he argues that an illegal application of §§ 44-5-12 and 44-5-13.11 in favor of Sweetbriar has led to an increase in the taxes levied on his own real property. Any way that Morse', '-9- may try to frame the issue, he does not bear this burden alone. While his proportion of the alleged increased taxes may have been higher because of the assessed value of his property, all taxpayers of Barrington necessarily bear some share of the effect of the decrease in Sweetbriar’s tax burden. Accordingly, it does not appear that the hearing justice erred in determining that Morse lacked standing to challenge Barrington’s application of §§ 44-5-12 and 44-5-13.11 to the Sweetbriar development and the Palmer Pointe project.7', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in the declaratory- judgment action and deny and dismiss the appeal in the tax appeal action. We remand the papers to the Superior Court. 7', 'We have stated that “on rare occasions this Court has overlooked the standing requirement to determine the merits of a case of substantial public interest.” Warfel v. Town of New Shoreham, 178 A.3d 988, 991-92 (R.I. 2018) (brackets omitted) (emphasis in original) (quoting Burns v. Sundlun, 617 A.2d 114, 116 (R.I. 1992)).

This matter arises from a contract dispute between the plaintiff, Chariho Regional School District (Chariho or plaintiff),1 and the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE), the Rhode Island Department of Administration (DOA), the Rhode Island Council on Elementary and Secondary Education, and former Commissioner of Education Kenneth Wagner (Wagner) (collectively, the state defendants). Chariho appeals from an order of the Superior Court granting the state defendants’ motion to dismiss. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the order of the Superior Court. 1', '“Chariho” is the name for the school district comprising the towns of Charlestown, Richmond, and Hopkinton in Washington County. It is also the name of the high school serving those communities.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In July 1996, plaintiff’s predecessor, the Chariho Regional High School District, conveyed a parcel of property on the Chariho campus to RIDE to be “use[d] for ‘vocational purposes.’” The plaintiff remained responsible for operation of the Chariho Area Career and Technical Center (Chariho CTC) located on that property following the transfer of title.2 Nearly fourteen years later, on June 22, 2010, after receiving approval from the Board of Regents,3 plaintiff and RIDE, through then-Commissioner of Education Deborah Gist, entered into an agreement to convey the property back to plaintiff, “provided that Chariho continues to provide career and technical programs to students” (the CTC transfer agreement). Significantly, in paragraph 1(d), the CTC transfer agreement also provided that, “[f]or so long as Chariho operates a career and technical center, RIDE warrants that it will not approve the establishment of any career and technical center in the towns of Charlestown, Hopkinton, Narragansett, New Shoreham, Richmond, South Kingstown, and Westerly * * *.”', 'The plaintiff filed a complaint in Superior Court on August 3, 2016, alleging that the state defendants had breached paragraph 1(d) of the CTC transfer agreement by authorizing career and technical programs at Westerly High School and Narragansett High School.4 Additionally, 2', 'The Chariho CTC is a “regional career and technical center” offering career and technical education programs to students living in all towns in Washington County—Charlestown, Exeter, Hopkinton, Narragansett, New Shoreham, North Kingstown, Richmond, South Kingstown, and Westerly—as well as out-of-county students from Jamestown and West Greenwich.

The plaintiff has also alleged that Westerly and Narragansett are currently seeking RIDE approval for further vocational programs.', '-2- plaintiff alleged that Wagner had unilaterally repudiated the CTC transfer agreement by stating that paragraph 1(d) was not enforceable and that the agreement had never been in effect. The plaintiff sought a declaration that the state defendants had breached the CTC transfer agreement, rendering the transfer of title to the property to Chariho void, as well as a permanent injunction to enforce paragraph 1(d) of the agreement.', 'In response to the complaint, the state defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), and failure to join indispensable parties pursuant to Rule 12(b)(7). The state defendants first argued that the complaint should be dismissed pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(7) because a court is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over a declaratory-judgment action where a plaintiff has failed to include all parties with an interest in the action and who would be affected by a declaration in plaintiff’s favor—in this case, the school departments of the four other towns listed in paragraph 1(d) of the CTC transfer agreement: Narragansett, New Shoreham, South Kingstown, and Westerly. As to Rule 12(b)(6), the state defendants argued, inter alia, that no breach had occurred based on the plain language of the agreement, and that, if there had been a breach, the sole remedy, pursuant to the agreement, was termination of the contract.', 'Additionally, the Narragansett School Committee (Narragansett) and the Westerly School Committee (Westerly) filed motions to intervene, arguing that they had an interest in the action and the right to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(a)(1) and (2). The plaintiff countered that', '-3- Narragansett and Westerly were not proper parties to the action because they did not have the power to sue or be sued and could not demonstrate an interest independent of the state.', 'Following a November 21, 2016 hearing on the motions to intervene and the state defendants’ motion to dismiss, the hearing justice rendered a decision from the bench, granting all motions. As to the motion to dismiss, however, the hearing justice stated that his ruling granting the motion was conditional, and that plaintiff would have thirty days to amend its complaint to add the two remaining school departments listed in paragraph 1(d): New Shoreham and South Kingstown.5 An order granting the motions to intervene was entered on December 6, 2016.', 'The plaintiff filed an amended complaint within thirty days of the hearing justice’s ruling on the motion to dismiss, adding the Narragansett School Department, New Shoreham School Department, South Kingstown School Department, and Westerly School Department as defendants, and also adding a claim for violation of the Contract Clause of the Rhode Island Constitution.6 The state defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), reiterating the same argument as in their prior motion to dismiss. Narragansett, Westerly, and the South Kingstown School Committee7 (South Kingstown) (collectively, the school committee defendants) also filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff’s amended complaint.8 The school committee defendants argued that paragraph 1(d) of the CTC transfer 5', 'The hearing justice did not reach the merits of the state defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) argument at the November 21, 2016 hearing. 6', 'The Contract Clause claim is not an issue on appeal. 7', 'We note that while it was the school committees of Narragansett and Westerly that filed motions to intervene, the amended complaint names the school departments of those towns, in addition to the school departments of South Kingstown and New Shoreham, as defendants. Following the filing of the amended complaint, it has been the school committees who have actively litigated the case at bar.

The plaintiff further argued that it was entitled to a declaration that a breach rendered the transfer of title void, given the language contained in the CTC transfer agreement and the fact that the agreement did not specify termination as the “exclusive remedy.” Finally, plaintiff asserted that paragraph 1(d) of the CTC transfer agreement was not void ab initio because the state was acting within its power to enter into contracts.', 'A hearing on the motions to dismiss the amended complaint was held on March 20, 2017. The state defendants argued that the language of paragraph 1(d) of the CTC transfer agreement was unambiguous in that it distinguished between a program and a “center,” which the state defendants argued meant “a place, where here in this particular building it is a center for vocational education[,]” and that RIDE had not approved any other “center” in breach of the agreement. The state defendants further reiterated at the hearing that termination of the agreement was the exclusive remedy available to Chariho in the event of a breach. The plaintiff countered that breach of the agreement was a question of fact and, furthermore, that the consequence of the term “of no force and effect” in the CTC transfer agreement rendered the contract void ab initio.', 'Following arguments from plaintiff and the state defendants, the hearing justice rendered a decision from the bench granting the state defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint. complaint when the hearing justice granted the state defendants’ motion to dismiss. New Shoreham is not a party to this appeal.', '-5- As to the claim for breach of contract, the hearing justice concluded that he thought the language of paragraph 1(d) was “crystal clear,” and further that “allowing the establishment of a particular type of program in another South County school is not a breach of this agreement.”9 The hearing justice also found that, in the event of a breach, the plain language of paragraph 3(a) of the CTC transfer agreement providing for plaintiff’s remedy could not “be stretched to suggest that the conveyance, that the property be re-conveyed, that it’s void ab initio.” The hearing justice did not hear argument on the school committee defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint, nor did he make a ruling on that motion.', 'An order granting the state defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiff’s amended complaint entered on May 9, 2017, and plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on May 23, 2017.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The sole function of a motion to dismiss is to test the sufficiency of the complaint.” Pontarelli v.

We shall take each issue in turn.', 'A', 'Intervention', 'The plaintiff contends that Narragansett and Westerly should not have been allowed to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(a)(1) or (2). As to Rule 24(a)(1), plaintiff maintains that the rule is narrowly construed, and that nothing in the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act provides intervention as a matter of right. The plaintiff further asserts that Narragansett and Westerly cannot intervene without standing in the action, which they do not have, according to plaintiff, because they were not parties to the CTC transfer agreement.', 'Beyond standing, plaintiff argues, Narragansett and Westerly do not meet the requirements to intervene under Rule 24(a)(2),', '-7- particularly because they cannot demonstrate an interest in the action that would not be adequately represented by the state defendants.10', 'Conversely, the state defendants respond that plaintiff has waived this issue because it did not file an appeal from the hearing justice’s November 21, 2016 decision granting the motions to intervene and the state defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiff’s original complaint. The school committee defendants, for their part, contend that if this Court finds plaintiff’s issue regarding the motion to intervene to be properly before us for review, the hearing justice correctly determined that Narragansett and Westerly have an interest in the action and are indispensable parties.', 'We first turn to the issue of waiver. In support of its assertion that this issue is properly before the Court, plaintiff relies on this Court’s opinion in Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 942 A.2d 284 (R.I. 2007), in which we adopted a long-held federal rule that “a notice of appeal that designates the final judgment encompasses not only that judgment, but also all earlier interlocutory orders that merge in the judgment.” Greensleeves, Inc., 942 A.2d at 290 (quoting John’s Insulation, Inc. v. L. Addison and Associates, Inc., 156 F.3d 101, 105 (1st Cir. 1998)). However, in the case at bar, plaintiff appealed from the hearing justice’s May 9, 2017 order of dismissal, not a final judgment. Final judgment has not yet entered in this case. Furthermore, in contrast to the scenario in Greensleeves, it is not “clear” from plaintiff’s actions or notice of appeal that it intended to appeal the hearing justice’s order granting the motions to intervene. 11 See id. at 291. Thus, we 10', 'The plaintiff, however, has not made any arguments with respect to the hearing justice’s November 21, 2016 conditional grant of the state defendants’ motion to dismiss for failure to join indispensable parties. Rather, plaintiff’s argument focuses solely on the hearing justice’s ruling as to the motions to intervene. 11', 'Additionally, “[i]t is axiomatic that, with limited exceptions, a party can appeal only from ‘a final judgment, decree, or order of the [S]uperior [C]ourt.’” Coates v. Ocean State Jobbers, Inc., 18 A.3d 554, 561 (R.I. 2011) (quoting G.L. 1956 § 9-24-1). “A final judgment or order for purposes of appealability is one that terminates all the litigation arising out of the action between the parties on the merits.” Id.

Lastly, plaintiff asserts briefly that, to the extent that there is an ambiguity in the word “center” in the CTC transfer agreement, the hearing justice’s order of dismissal was in error.', 'In opposition, the state defendants argue that the hearing justice did not err in granting the motion to dismiss because the clear language of the agreement does not preclude RIDE from authorizing career and technical “programs” at other South County schools.

This Court has held that an order granting a motion to intervene is generally not sufficiently final to be appealable. See Town of Coventry v. Hickory Ridge Campground, Inc., 111 R.I. 716, 719, 306 A.2d 824, 826 (1973). Therefore, even if plaintiff had clearly indicated its intent to appeal the order granting the motions to intervene, without entry of final judgment, we still would be without authority to hear plaintiff’s appeal as to this issue.', '-9- equivalent to the approval of one or two individual programs. The state defendants further argue that plaintiff’s allegations as to Wagner’s statements are not sufficient to support a claim for anticipatory breach of contract. The school committee defendants join the state defendants’ argument, and additionally contend that paragraph 1(d) of the CTC transfer agreement is void ab initio because it divests the state and school committees of statutory authority to make decisions regarding education.', 'Paragraph 1(d) of the CTC transfer agreement provides: “For so long as Chariho operates a career and technical center, RIDE warrants that it will not approve the establishment of any career and technical center in the towns of Charlestown, Hopkinton, Narragansett, New Shoreham, Richmond, South Kingstown, and Westerly * * *.” In rendering his decision, the hearing justice found this language of paragraph 1(d) to be “crystal clear.” The hearing justice went on to state that “Chariho was operating a career and technical center; hence the word center, where they were providing technical programs, a number of different career and technical programs under one roof, on one location.” The hearing justice concluded that the parties’ intent was clear “from reading the plain language of the agreement[,]” and that, “[t]o suggest that this language [of paragraph 1(d)] be read to prohibit any South County town from having a vocational program in one of their schools is really giving meaning to this agreement that it plainly wasn’t intended to give.”', 'We begin our analysis by looking at the language of paragraph 1(d). As is well settled by our long-standing principles of contract interpretation, “[t]he determination of whether a contract’s terms are ambiguous is a question of law to be decided by the court.” Botelho v. City of Pawtucket School Department, 130 A.3d 172, 176 (R.I. 2016) (quoting JPL Livery Services, Inc. v. Rhode Island Department of Administration, 88 A.3d 1134, 1142 (R.I. 2014)). Questions of law are reviewed de novo. Id. “A term in a contract is ambiguous when it is ‘reasonably and clearly', '- 10 - susceptible to more than one rational interpretation.’” Id. (quoting Miller v. Saunders, 80 A.3d 44, 49 (R.I 2013)). Moreover, “[i]n determining whether language in a contract is ambiguous, ‘we give words their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning. The subjective intent of the parties may not properly be considered by the Court; rather, we consider the intent expressed by the language of the contract.’” Id. (deletion omitted) (quoting JPL Livery Services, Inc., 88 A.3d at 1142). “Where an ambiguity exists in a provision of a contractual document, the construction of that provision is a question of fact.” Haviland v. Simmons, 45 A.3d 1246, 1258-59 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Fryzel v. Domestic Credit Corporation, 120 R.I. 92, 98, 385 A.2d 663, 666 (1978)).', 'After looking only to the provisions of the CTC transfer agreement and giving those words their plain and ordinary meaning, we are of the opinion that the word “center” is “susceptible to more than one rational interpretation.” Botelho, 130 A.3d at 176 (quoting Miller, 80 A.3d at 49). It is not unreasonable to conclude that a subsection of a primarily nonvocational school offering one or more career or technical programs could be labeled as a career or technical “center,” in the same way that a separate space dedicated to vocational education, like the Chariho CTC, is considered to be a “center.” Indeed, according to plaintiff’s amended complaint, Narragansett High School promotes itself as having an “Agricultural Science and Technology Education Center,” which houses its one vocational program—agricultural science. (Emphasis added.) Furthermore, plaintiff has alleged that students from outside Narragansett and Westerly have the opportunity to attend those high schools’ vocational programs. Therefore, because the resolution of an ambiguity in a contract is a question of fact which we will not resolve at this stage of the litigation, we cannot say that, after assuming the allegations in the amended complaint are true and viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Chariho has failed to state a claim for', '- 11 - which relief may be granted.12 Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the hearing justice erred in granting the state defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiff’s amended complaint.13', '2', 'Exclusive Remedy', 'The plaintiff argues that the hearing justice erred in finding that termination of the contract, as provided for in paragraph 3(a) of the CTC transfer agreement, represented plaintiff’s sole remedy for the state defendants’ breach. The plaintiff contends that the language of the CTC transfer agreement “lacks the requisite specificity regarding exclusivity” of remedies. The plaintiff further argues that, if this Court reads the remedies provision as exclusive, the CTC transfer agreement is void ab initio because it is illusory.14 Conversely, the state defendants argue that paragraph 3(a) of the CTC transfer agreement clearly and unambiguously provides plaintiff with 12', 'We further note that we are not persuaded by plaintiff’s other arguments relating to paragraph 1(d). First, the record does not clearly demonstrate that the hearing justice actually took judicial notice of the fact that other cities and towns run vocational programs. Although the hearing justice commented that he could “probably take judicial notice” of this fact, he also stated that it was not “necessary to get into for purposes of [his] ruling[.]” Furthermore, we disagree with plaintiff’s contention that it has sufficiently pled an anticipatory breach of contract. “In order to give rise to an anticipatory breach of contract, the defendant’s refusal to perform must have been positive and unconditional.” Griffin v. Zapata, 570 A.2d 659, 662 (R.I. 1990) (brackets omitted) (quoting Thompson v. Thompson, 495 A.2d 678, 682 (R.I. 1985)). The plaintiff alleges in its amended complaint that Wagner stated that he believed the CTC transfer agreement was ineffective, and further that “Commissioner Wagner has said that he could establish another career and technical center in South County[.]” (Emphasis added.) We are of the opinion that these allegations are not sufficiently “positive and unconditional” to give rise to an anticipatory breach of the CTC agreement. Id. 13', 'This appeal concerns only the state defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The hearing justice never addressed the school committee defendants’ separate argument in its motion to dismiss that paragraph 1(d) of the CTC transfer agreement is void ab initio, and thus, we decline to examine this issue for the first time on appeal. 14', 'The plaintiff additionally argues that the hearing justice should have, “at a minimum,” granted injunctive relief for anticipatory breach of contract. However, as we have stated, we do not find plaintiff’s allegations in the amended complaint regarding anticipatory breach to be sufficient to state a claim.', '- 12 - an exclusive remedy in the event of breach, and that the remedies prayed for in Chariho’s amended complaint run contrary to that provision. The state defendants also assert that, if plaintiff’s argument has been preserved, the CTC transfer agreement is not illusory because its performance under the contract is not optional.', 'Paragraph 3(a) of the CTC transfer agreement provides:', '“In the event that RIDE fails to perform the obligations set forth in', 'paragraph one of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be', 'terminated and of no force and effect and RIDE waives any and all', 'claims, whether at law or in equity, to recover any funds expended', 'or committed to Capital Projects.” In his decision, the hearing justice concluded that, based on the language of paragraph 3(a), it was “clear here * * * that if RIDE were to establish another center and therefore breach the agreement, under [paragraph] 3 Chariho keeps the money and the building and in addition has no further obligations regarding the operation of a career and technical center.”', 'This Court has not yet specifically addressed the exclusivity of a contract provision stipulating to certain remedies in the event of a breach.

DeMatteo Construction Co., 315 F.3d 43, 49 (1st Cir. 2002) (“Under Massachusetts law, if a contract does not specify that the remedies identified are exclusive, or that they abrogate the common law remedies available, the common law remedies still apply.”); Middleton v. Klingler, 410 N.W.2d 184, 186 (S.D. 1987) (“The general proposition is widely accepted that a remedy reserved by a contract does not deprive a party of other lawful remedies.”); see also 17A Am.

Where, however, there is no express or implied limitation in the contract making the', '- 13 - stated remedy exclusive, the prevailing view is that a party may pursue either the prescribed remedy or any other remedy the law provides.”) (footnotes omitted).', 'We do not disagree with the hearing justice’s summary of the terms of paragraph 3(a). However, we find no language in this agreement that can be read to preclude plaintiff from seeking, at the very least, a declaration that the state defendants have breached the contract. Paragraphs 3(a), (b), and (c) make no mention of exclusivity, nor do they otherwise contain language limiting the remedies available to the parties in the event of breach.15', 'Moreover, “[a] dismissal of a declaratory-judgment action before a hearing on the merits, under Rule 12(b)(6), is proper only when the pleadings demonstrate that, beyond a reasonable doubt, the declaration prayed for is an impossibility.” Tucker Estates Charlestown, LLC v.

Perretta (the Perrettas), appeal from a Superior Court order granting partial summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Note Capital Group, Inc. (Note Capital). First, the Perrettas argue that their appeal from the Superior Court’s interlocutory order is appropriate because the grant of partial summary judgment had an element of finality, as that order allowed Note Capital to foreclose on the Perrettas’ property. Second, the Perrettas contend that Note Capital was not entitled to enforce the note because the chain of title to the note was tainted by an improper transfer. Third, the Perrettas aver that Note Capital was not entitled to enforce the note secured by a mortgage on their property because the note had been lost by the previous holder of the note, American Residential Equities, LIX, LLC (ARELIX),2 prior to the assignment of the mortgage to Note Capital.

Later, on May 4, 2010, GMAC transferred the note and mortgage to ARELIX via an allonge and assignment 3', 'American Residential is a different, but related entity to ARELIX. 4', 'An allonge is defined as “[a] slip of paper sometimes attached to a negotiable instrument for the purpose of receiving further indorsements when the original paper is filled with indorsements.” Black’s Law Dictionary 92 (10th ed. 2014).', '-2- recorded in the Cranston land evidence records.

Additionally, Orlans Moran prepared and delivered a lost note affidavit in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 6A-3-301, outlining the steps it had taken to attempt to recover the note. On November 11, 2014, Note Capital filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court seeking to foreclose on the Perrettas’ mortgage, naming the Perrettas, among others, as defendants.7 Note Capital also joined ARELIX as a plaintiff in the matter.', 'On June 24, 2015, Note Capital filed a motion for partial summary judgment to allow it to foreclose on the property. In support of its motion, Note Capital attached an affidavit executed by Jeffrey Kirsch (Kirsch), who identified himself as an authorized signatory of ARELIX and someone familiar with the company’s business records. In that affidavit, Kirsh detailed the chain of assignments of the mortgage loan from Zurich to Note Capital. Additionally, Kirsch averred 5', 'The Perrettas argued, inter alia, that ARELIX had no interest in the note because the chain of title had been tainted by the assignment from American Residential to GMAC, which occurred two weeks before American Residential had any interest in the note.

The Perrettas also claimed that an issue of fact existed because different versions of the promissory note had been provided to them or filed in various courts. As to the lost note, the Perrettas argued that § 6A-3-309 prevents the transferee or assignee of a lost note from enforcing the note.8 The Perrettas also filed a motion for summary judgment or, in the alternative, motion for judgment on the pleadings.', 'Subsequently, the Perrettas served a subpoena duces tecum upon Orlans Moran, seeking to depose a person with knowledge of the lost note. Orlans Moran designated Erika Hoover (Hoover), a senior operations attorney at Orlans Moran, as its agent for purposes of the deposition. After taking Hoover’s deposition, the Perrettas submitted a supplemental memorandum, attaching the deposition. In response, Note Capital filed a memorandum attaching a separate affidavit executed by Hoover, along with numerous pages of documentation. The Perrettas objected to the filing of the documents, contending that Note Capital should have been prohibited from presenting additional material within ten days of the summary-judgment hearing, pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'A hearing on Note Capital’s motion for partial summary judgment was held on May 10, 2016. After the parties had presented their arguments, the hearing justice observed that Note 8', 'The parties filed supplemental memoranda regarding the issue of whether a lost note may be enforced by a party other than the entity in possession of the note at the time of loss.', '-4- Capital was essentially seeking judicial foreclosure of the mortgage on the Perrettas’ property and found that the Perrettas’ default on the note was not in dispute. The hearing justice next addressed the issue of the lost note and whether Note Capital was entitled to enforce the note. Because this Court had not yet ruled on the issue of whether the assignee of a lost note may enforce the note, the hearing justice surveyed cases from other jurisdictions, determining that there was a split of authority.9', 'Eventually, the hearing justice found that “[i]t would be inequitable for the plaintiff as a valid assignee not to stand in the shoes of the assignor. To hold otherwise would unjustly enrich the defendants because the note could never be enforced.” He pointed to G.L. 1956 § 34-11-24, finding that the rights that the note granted to assignees of mortgages were not in conflict with the provisions of § 6A-3-309 and that an assignee of a lost note could enforce the note as a successor- in-interest to the assignor. In conclusion, the hearing justice found that there was “no genuine issue of fact that [ARELIX] was in possession and had the right to enforce it at the time the note was lost and that it validly assigned the note and mortgage to Note Capital.” In addition, in order to protect the Perrettas’ interests, the hearing justice stated that the order would “terminate any rights of [ARELIX] and any other person to the note other than Note Capital and Note Capital will indemnify the defendants against any claims made pursuant to the note by anyone other than it.”', 'After granting Note Capital’s motion for partial summary judgment, the hearing justice determined that it was “not a final judgment[,]” and he stayed the order for forty days to afford the Perrettas time to file a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court.

This case came before the Supreme Court on March 5, 2019, on appeal by the defendant, Jamal Rogers (defendant), from a judgment of conviction entered in the Superior Court following a jury finding of guilty on five counts of second-degree sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4. Before this Court, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial and that the verdict failed to serve the interests of justice. The case is before us pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 25, 2012, a grand jury returned an indictment that charged defendant with one count of first-degree sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-2 (count one); five counts of second- degree sexual assault, in violation of § 11-37-4 (counts two through six); and one count of assault with intent to commit first-degree sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-1', '-1- (count seven). In January 2017, a jury trial was held in Providence County Superior Court; the state presented two witnesses: Molly,1 the complaining witness, and Detective Sergeant Matthew Ryan (Det. Ryan), the lead investigator. We summarize below the pertinent testimony presented at trial.', 'Molly testified that, in February 2012, she was fifteen years old and a sophomore at Woonsocket High School; at that time, she was participating in an after-school online English makeup class, which took place Monday through Thursday at the high school, from 2:30 p.m. until five in the evening. On Mondays, Molly would walk a short distance to her grandparents’ home after class, and her father would pick her up there.', 'On Monday, February 6, 2012, Molly testified that, after a “really rough day at school[,]” she decided to skip the online course. Instead, she went to Cass Park, a playground adjacent to the high school, to sit on the swings and “reflect and think about [her] day * * * before [she] went home[.]” Noticing that dusk was fast approaching, Molly approached a passing stranger, a “big, chubby’ish” man, and asked if he knew the time. This stranger was defendant.2 The defendant replied in the negative and asked her, “[W]ould you happen to have any weed on you[?]” Molly responded in the negative, and defendant walked away. After waiting on the swings for several more minutes for someone else to walk by, Molly reluctantly decided to walk back to the high school in order to check the time in the main office.', 'The defendant suddenly approached Molly from behind, grabbed the hood of her jacket, and dragged her up a hill in the park, behind the swings. Molly attempted to dig her feet into the ground to make him stop dragging her, and put her hands behind herself to make him let go of 1', 'We refer to the complaining witness in this case by a pseudonym. 2', 'The fact that defendant weighed over 300 pounds on the date of the incident was excluded from evidence.', '-2- her jacket but, at approximately 104 pounds, she “was not strong enough and after a while [she] gave up.” At the top of the hill, hidden in a wooded area near a big rock, defendant continued to restrain Molly and asked her name, her bra size, and whether she was a virgin. “Out of fear,” Molly answered each question. She testified that, as defendant asked her the questions, “[h]e touched my breasts over my clothes and * * * he touched in between my legs and my butt.”', 'When defendant began to kiss Molly, she testified, that she submitted because she was afraid that “something worse would happen.” The defendant removed Molly’s shirt and bra, and touched her breasts. Molly testified that she “attempt[ed] to stop him and gave up because [she] was too weak.” At trial, she explained that she was crying and had her eyes closed “a lot” of the time, because she was afraid. The defendant next asked Molly to “give him a blow job for $20[.]” She refused. The defendant proceeded to unzip his pants and “tried to force [her] to give him a blow job” by pushing her head down towards his penis. Molly struggled to lift her head up, and, after a few attempts, defendant released her head. The defendant pushed Molly onto the ground and pulled her pants and underwear off. She testified: “He undid his pants and boxers and pulled them down to his ankles and then got on top of me.” As Molly lay on her back, defendant laid “99 percent” of his body on top of her and “stuck his penis inside of [her] vagina.” After a few minutes or so, defendant stopped, got up from the ground, and began to put his clothes back on. According to Molly, when his back was turned, she jumped up, grabbed her clothes and ran, naked, down the hill.', 'At this point it was getting dark outside, and, as she ran to her grandparents’ home, crying and vomiting, she put her clothes back on. Although it was rush hour and she ran past homes and open businesses, Molly testified, she saw no one, nor did anyone ask if she needed help. When Molly arrived at her grandparents’ home, it was past 5:30—when she was expected', '-3- to be home—and her grandparents were irate. She did not tell her grandparents about the incident because she was not “comfortable telling them what happened” and she was “ashamed”; she testified: “I felt defiled. * * * I felt dirty. Disgusting.” When Molly’s father arrived to pick her up, he was also furious. At trial, Molly testified that she and her father had a contentious relationship and that her late arrival home that night had made matters worse. After he shouted at her and used demeaning names, the two went home; and, shortly thereafter, she was grounded. Molly did not tell her father about the assault because, she testified, she “was scared and ashamed and embarrassed and it is definitely something that I was not comfortable talking with my father about, something that he wouldn’t understand.”', 'The next day, Molly went to her guidance counselor, Robin Corrigan (Corrigan), and told her that defendant kissed and touched her inappropriately the night before—Molly did not mention that defendant allegedly had raped her. Corrigan contacted the school resource officer, Officer David Chattman (Officer Chattman), to report the assault, and Molly told him what she had told Corrigan. Officer Chattman contacted Det. Ryan, who was the officer in charge of the Juvenile Division of the Woonsocket Police Department, and informed him that a sexual assault had occurred at Cass Park next to the high school. Later that day, Molly met with Det. Ryan at the police station and positively identified defendant from a photo lineup as the man who assaulted her in Cass Park. She placed her initials and the date underneath his photograph; she confirmed her identification of defendant as the man who had sexually assaulted her in court during trial.3', 'Shortly thereafter, Woonsocket police officers were dispatched to locate defendant, who was found in Cass Park. He was taken in for questioning. At the police station, Det.

35,In re Joziah B. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The respondent, Heather B., appeals from a decree entered in the Family Court that terminated her parental rights with respect to her son, Joziah B., who was born on March 1, 2008. 1 This case came before the Supreme Court on February 27, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After reviewing the parties’ memoranda, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the decree of the Family Court. 1', 'In the same petition filed against the respondent, the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families also sought to terminate the parental rights of Joziah’s father. His case is not before us.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On April 30, 2015, over four years ago, the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) filed a petition in Family Court, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7, 2 to terminate respondent’s parental rights with respect to Joziah. 3 The petition listed respondent’s address as “unknown.” In its petition, DCYF alleged that Joziah had been placed in the legal custody or care of the agency for at least twelve months. The petition further alleged that respondent had been “offered or received services to correct the situation which led to the child being placed,” and that, because of Joziah’s age and his need for a permanent home, there was not a substantial probability that the young boy would be able to return safely to respondent’s care within a reasonable period of time. On September 5, 2017, the petition was amended to include an allegation that respondent had abandoned Joziah.', 'To support its petition, DCYF filed a summary of facts in which it alleged that, on September 11, 2013, the department’s child abuse neglect hotline had received a telephone call reporting that Joziah had been left with his maternal aunt with neither clothes nor money to 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-7-7(a) provides, in pertinent part:', '“The court shall, upon a petition duly filed by a governmental child', 'placement agency * * * after notice to the parent and a hearing on', 'the petition, terminate any and all legal rights of the parent to the', 'child * * * if the court finds as a fact by clear and convincing', 'evidence that:', '“* * *', '“(4) The parent has abandoned or deserted the child.

The DCYF further alleged that respondent was homeless, was using, presumedly, illegal drugs, and that Joziah had been present at a time that his mother was actively engaging in acts of prostitution. Additionally, according to the summary of facts filed by the department, respondent’s family was very concerned because respondent “was sending her pimp to pick up [Joziah].” After a departmental investigation, Joziah was placed in a nonrelative foster home because of respondent’s neglect. 4 The summary of facts also asserted that numerous case plans had been provided for respondent and Joziah to address DCYF’s concerns, but that respondent had failed to complete her treatment and had not adequately cooperated with DCYF. For instance, it was alleged that respondent had been discharged from a family visitation program as a result of her “ongoing use of heroin, cocaine, ‘other opiates,’ alcohol and marijuana,” and that she had been diagnosed with “Opioid type dependence, episodic use, Major Depressive Disorder, recurrent episode, moderate degree, Cannabis Dependence, mood Disorder, NOS and PTSD.” The caseworker who drafted the summary of facts also represented that the last contact she had had with respondent occurred on March 23, 2015, and that the last time respondent had contact with Joziah was during a supervised visit that took place on February 27, 2015. 5', 'The summary of facts also revealed that Joziah had endured trauma throughout his life, including being sexually abused by babysitters, witnessing domestic violence, his mother 4', 'The summary of facts also recounted that DCYF previously had accused respondent of neglect at the time of Joziah’s birth because both respondent and the infant Joziah had tested positive for marijuana. 5', 'As further discussed infra, at the hearing on the petition to terminate respondent’s parental rights, the DCYF caseworker provided the court with an update on respondent’s contact with Joziah, and represented that the last contact that respondent had had with Joziah “was around the time she signed off on direct consent adoption to the foster parent[,]” which occurred in November 2015. The trial justice found at that hearing that respondent’s last contact with Joziah was “shortly after November of 2015.”', '-3- performing acts of prostitution, and even being kidnapped for ransom by respondent’s pimp. According to DCYF, at the time of the filing of the petition for termination of parental rights, Joziah was in his fourth nonrelative foster home, had “engaged in incidents of inappropriate sexualized behavior with other foster children and his sister and struggles with symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, anxiety and Attention Deficit hyper Activity Disorder.”', 'In May 2015, an arraignment was held in Family Court, and respondent was referred to the public defender’s office; a public defender entered his appearance on respondent’s behalf later that month. Although a trial was planned, respondent consented to Joziah being adopted in November 2015. Later that month, however, respondent filed an emergency motion to withdraw her consent for the adoption. That motion was scheduled to be heard on January 5, 2016; however, the record reflects that respondent failed to appear at that hearing and the motion was passed. On that same day, the public defender who had been representing respondent was permitted to withdraw from the case.', 'Over a year and a half later, in September 2017, the Family Court ordered that an advertisement be placed in a local newspaper, notifying respondent that a hearing on the petition to terminate her parental rights would be held on October 3, 2017. That advertisement was placed in The Providence Journal on September 22, 2017, and provided that respondent’s parental rights would be terminated if she failed to appear.', 'The respondent was not present at the October 3, 2017 hearing. The court went forward with the hearing, despite respondent’s absence, and received testimony from Denise Zolnierz, the DCYF casework supervisor for Joziah’s case. Ms. Zolnierz testified that, on September 11, 2013, more than four years earlier, DCYF had received a call that respondent had left Joziah with her sister so that respondent could be available to engage in prostitution in Connecticut, and that', '-4- her sister was concerned for the welfare of the child.', 'Ms. Zolnierz testified that DCYF developed case plans for respondent that included mental health counseling, substance abuse treatment, nonoffending parenting, and visitation. According to Ms. Zolnierz, the department made referrals for respondent to accomplish the goals of those case plans, but, besides participating in some of the trauma treatment for Joziah, respondent failed to complete her substance abuse and mental health treatments. Ms. Zolnierz further testified that she did not know where respondent was, that she believed respondent had not visited with Joziah for the past year, and that she thought respondent’s last contact with Joziah “was around the time she signed off on direct consent adoption to the foster parent.” She also believed that respondent had a criminal history and “ha[d] been in and out of the [Adult Correctional Institutions] for various crimes.” Ms. Zolnierz testified that, shortly after respondent consented to Joziah being adopted, the child was hospitalized for mental health and trauma care, and that his foster mother “could not adopt him based on his behaviors.” According to Ms. Zolnierz, at the time of the October 3, 2017 hearing, Joziah was not living in a new preadoptive home and had instead been living in residential care because of his mental health needs. She informed the court that Joziah at that point was “very stable” and was “doing the best he’s done in a long time[,]” and that DCYF was actively seeking a preadoptive home for him.', 'The trial justice then made findings of fact, by clear and convincing evidence, based on the uncontradicted testimony of Ms. Zolnierz and the DCYF summary of facts that had been marked as a full exhibit. The trial justice found as a fact that the case opened to DCYF in September 2013, and noted the allegation that respondent had left Joziah with her sister, who was the foster mother at some point, so that she could engage in prostitution in Connecticut. The trial justice further mentioned the allegation that respondent had not returned for Joziah for a', '-5- period of three months, and also found that Joziah had been removed from his mother’s care. She found that DCYF attempted to assist respondent with multiple case plans and that numerous referrals had been made, but found that respondent “did not comply with any of the referrals or the case plan.” She found that the last time respondent had been in contact with Joziah “was shortly after November of 2015[,]” that the child had been hospitalized, was being treated for trauma, and was, at the time of the hearing on the petition for termination of parental rights, living in residential care, where he had been for over six months. The trial justice further said that Joziah was registered with Adoption Rhode Island and appeared to be stable, but that he had “some serious mental health needs and trauma treatment.” For these reasons, the trial justice determined that respondent had abandoned Joziah as a result of her failure to have contact with him for over six months, that DCYF had attempted to work with respondent for a substantial period of time, and that it was unlikely that Joziah could be returned to his mother’s care within a reasonable period of time, “considering the child’s age and the child’s need for a permanent home.” The trial justice also found that it was in the best interest of the child to be adopted and that respondent did not cooperate with DCYF services to strive toward reunification. For all of those reasons, the trial justice determined that respondent was unfit to parent; she ordered that respondent’s parental rights be terminated and that DCYF, as the guardian of the child “for all purposes[,]” would have “the exclusive right to place [Joziah] for adoption and be the sole party to give or withhold consent.” Shortly thereafter, a decree mirroring the trial justice’s findings was entered.

For this reason, notice of the October 3, 2017 hearing date was improper as a matter of law.', 'We previously have acknowledged that parents have “no absolute right to be physically present at the termination hearing.” In re Ariel N., 892 A.2d 80, 84 (R.I. 2006) (quoting In re Brandon A., 769 A.2d 586, 590 (R.I. 2001)).

36,Terry Ann Smith : v. : Andrew Smith. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The pro se defendant, Andrew Smith, appeals from decisions of the Family Court granting an absolute divorce to defendant and his former wife, Terry Ann Smith, the plaintiff, and ordering an equitable distribution of their marital assets. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 5, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ written and oral arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the decisions of the Family Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This contentious litigation began on November 11, 2014, when plaintiff filed a complaint for divorce from defendant and the case was assigned to the Family Court general magistrate. The defendant, who was represented by counsel at the time, filed an answer and counterclaim for', '-1- divorce on December 23, 2014.1 Both parties cited irreconcilable differences that led to the irremediable breakdown of the marriage as the grounds for divorce.', 'Soon thereafter, on January 16, 2015, the parties were heard on their motions for temporary allowances and, pursuant to a consent order, agreed, inter alia, to sell four parcels of real estate. However, defendant’s obstructive and bad-faith interference with the efforts to sell the real estate led the general magistrate to appoint a commissioner to effectuate the transactions. Nevertheless, defendant—determined to prevent the sales—filed several disingenuous motions seeking to block the sales and remove the real estate commissioner; filed mechanic’s liens on two parcels; and, most egregiously, purportedly conveyed one of the properties to a third party for the consideration of one cent.', 'The record also reflects that defendant deliberately sought to deceive the court, refused to comply with discovery requests, and engaged in vexatious litigation practices by filing a multitude of frivolous motions and appealing nearly every decision by the general magistrate.2 The plaintiff appropriately sought sanctions pursuant to Rule 11 of the Family Court Rules of Procedure for Domestic Relations, claiming that defendant’s motions were meritless and designed to harass and cause unnecessary delay, thereby needlessly increasing the costs of litigation. Given defendant’s numerous pending appeals and frivolous motions, this case was ultimately reassigned to a justice of the Family Court.', 'On December 18, 2017, three years after the initial complaint was filed and after testimony spanning five months, the trial justice granted both parties an absolute divorce and 1', 'On April 13, 2015, defendant’s attorney withdrew as counsel; defendant proceeded pro se. 2', 'The Family Court justice noted that, between April 2015 and June 2016, defendant filed fifty- three motions in this case, which she deemed “part of his stall tactics,” given his concession in open court that he would “make sure that [p]laintiff * * * did not get a penny.”', '-2- issued a ninety-five-page written decision. The trial justice made 113 findings of fact as to the procedural history of the case. Next, the trial justice reviewed the testimony and set forth the various assets and debts of the parties. After reviewing the parties’ circumstances and conduct during the marriage, the trial justice then proceeded to an equitable distribution of the marital property in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 15-5-16.1. Notably, when addressing “either party’s wasteful dissipation of assets[,]” the trial justice recounted defendant’s “egregious behaviors in this case[,]” as well as his unwavering efforts to prevent the Family Court from granting a divorce, all while depleting the marital assets.', 'The trial justice addressed defendant’s request for alimony, which, after examining the statutory factors set forth in § 15-5-16 and reincorporating her previous findings, she denied. The trial justice then considered plaintiff’s complaint for protection from abuse. She found that defendant had placed plaintiff in fear of imminent physical harm, and, thus, granted the relief. Finally, the trial justice addressed plaintiff’s request for Rule 11 sanctions against defendant and concluded that, given “[d]efendant’s vexatious filing of baseless [m]otions” for the “sole purpose and intent to harass the [p]laintiff and dissipate the marital assets[,]” defendant had violated Rule 11, and, thus, ordered him to pay plaintiff’s attorneys’ fees.', 'Lastly, the trial justice made ninety-seven additional findings of fact. Notably, she found that, in light of defendant’s willful depletion of marital assets and interference with plaintiff’s efforts to preserve the value of the marital assets, it was equitable to award plaintiff a disproportionate amount of the marital assets. She awarded plaintiff 70 percent of various sums that defendant had withdrawn or withheld from the joint marital account. She further awarded plaintiff $30,394.81, which represented 70 percent of the “marital assets which were depleted from the marital estate solely due to [d]efendant’s misdeeds[,]” as well as $82,550, which', '-3- represented plaintiff’s 50 percent share of the value of the property that defendant had conveyed for the consideration of one cent. Upon granting the parties’ prayers for divorce, the trial justice proceeded to divide the marital estate. From this decision, defendant appealed. Thereafter, on June 19, 2018, on remand from that appeal, the Family Court entered a decision pending entry of final judgment that memorialized the conclusions contained in the December 2017 decision. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from that decision, and we consolidated the appeals for briefing and argument.', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, defendant contends that the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to grant plaintiff’s complaint for divorce, as well as his counterclaim for divorce, because doing so would violate his religious right to the sacrament of marriage. This argument is without merit.', 'At the outset, we note that defendant makes this argument in the face of his own counterclaim seeking an absolute divorce from his union with plaintiff. It is undisputed that the Family Court possesses subject-matter jurisdiction to grant a petition for divorce. The General Assembly, by enacting G.L. 1956 § 8-10-3, specifically granted the Family Court the authority to “hear and determine all petitions for divorce from the bond of marriage[.]” See § 8-10-3(a); see also Rogers v. Rogers, 18 A.3d 491, 493 (R.I. 2011) (recognizing that the Family Court clearly has subject-matter jurisdiction with respect to petitions for divorce).', 'Thus, contrary to defendant’s assertions, the Family Court is vested with statutorily-conferred authority to oversee proceedings stemming from divorce actions, which includes the authority to grant an absolute divorce to the faithful among us whose religious beliefs repudiate divorce.3 See Ditson v. Ditson, 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 8-10-3(a) provides, in relevant part, that the Family Court has the power to “hear and determine all petitions for divorce from the bond of marriage[,] * * * all motions for allowance, alimony, support and custody of children, allowance of counsel and witness fees, and', '-4- 4 R.I. 87, 105-06 (1856) (recognizing that marriage, as a contractual relationship, affects the parties’ status, and that the state thereby has the sovereign authority to fix or alter the status of its citizens); see also Crow v. Crow, 41 R.I. 258, 259, 103 A. 739, 739 (1918) (holding that jurisdiction over divorce is statutory).', 'The defendant also argues that the Family Court justice erred in the equitable distribution of the parties’ marital assets, pursuant to § 15-5-16.1. However, our review of the record convinces us that the Family Court justice did not abuse her discretion in disproportionately distributing the marital assets.', 'It is well established that “[t]he equitable distribution of marital assets is left to the sound discretion of the Family Court justice who is obligated to consider the factors prescribed by the Legislature in G.L. 1956 § 15-5-16.1.” Andreozzi v. Andreozzi, 813 A.2d 78, 81 (R.I. 2003) (brackets omitted) (quoting Viti v. Viti, 773 A.2d 893, 895 (R.I. 2001)). In deciding the issue of equitable distribution, the Family Court justice considered the relevant statutory factors, including: (1) the length of the marriage; (2) the conduct of the parties during the marriage; (3) each party’s contributions towards the acquisition, preservation, and appreciation of assets; (4) each party’s homemaking contributions; (5) the health and age of the parties; (6) the amount and sources of income of the parties; (7) the occupation and employability of the parties; (8) each party’s opportunity for future acquisition of capital assets and income; (9) the lack of dependent children; (10) defendant’s wasteful dissipation of marital assets; and (11) defendant’s bad-faith conduct. See § 15-5-16.1.', 'The record establishes that the trial justice issued a meticulous ninety-five-page written decision that sets forth the extensive travel of the case and includes findings on credibility and other matters arising out of petitions and motions relative to real and personal property in aid thereof[.]”', '-5- the numerous issues raised in this three-year divorce proceeding.', 'Her conclusions are memorialized in a fifteen-page decision pending entry of final judgment. When distributing the marital assets, the trial justice carefully considered the factors enumerated in § 15-5-16.1, taking into account the conduct of both parties, including defendant’s misconduct and shocking dissipation of the parties’ marital assets. We thus hold that the Family Court justice did not err, nor did she abuse her discretion in any way. Because the trial justice “scrupulously considered” all the requisite statutory elements and applied those factors to her well-supported findings of fact, we will not disturb her decisions. See Tarro v. Tarro, 485 A.2d 558, 560 (R.I. 1984).', 'Additionally, the defendant challenges the Family Court justice’s imposition of Rule 11 sanctions, thereby requiring him to pay the plaintiff’s reasonable attorneys’ fees. Under Rule 11, trial courts have “broad authority to impose sanctions * * * for advancing claims without proper foundation[.]” Michalopoulos v. C & D Restaurant, Inc., 847 A.2d 294, 300 (R.I. 2004). As such, “a trial justice has discretionary authority to formulate what he or she considers to be an appropriate sanction, but must do so in accordance with the articulated purpose of the rule: ‘to deter repetition of the harm, and to remedy the harm caused.’” Pleasant Management, LLC v. Carrasco, 918 A.2d 213, 217 (R.I. 2007) (quoting Michalopoulos, 847 A.2d at 300). “[T]his Court will not reverse a trial justice’s imposition of sanctions for a litigant’s misconduct unless ‘the trial court based its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.’” Id. (quoting Michalopoulos, 847 A.2d at 300). Based on the record before us, which clearly establishes that the defendant acted in bad faith with the purpose and intent to harass the plaintiff and filed numerous frivolous motions that forced the plaintiff to incur additional legal fees, we see no abuse of discretion in imposing the sanction. If ever there was a case in which this sanction was warranted, the facts of this case cry out for such a remedy.', '-6-', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the decisions of the Family Court.

37,Supreme Court No. 2017-133-M.P. Wanda I. Trinidad : v. : Employees’ Retirement System of : Providence.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The petitioner, Wanda I. Trinidad (Trinidad), filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari seeking review of a decision of the Retirement Board of the Employee Retirement System of Providence (the board) denying Trinidad’s application for accidental-disability retirement benefits, and instead awarding her ordinary- disability benefits. This Court granted the petition, and Trinidad’s case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 27, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this matter should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ memoranda and oral arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and we proceed to decide the case at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the board’s decision to deny Trinidad accidental-disability benefits.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Beginning on March 9, 2004, Trinidad served as a bus monitor for the City of Providence.', 'On May 9, 2014, Trinidad submitted an application for accidental-disability retirement benefits to the respondent, the Employees’ Retirement System of Providence', '-1- (respondent), alleging that she had suffered a work-related injury on January 26, 2011.1 Included with her application was a written statement by Trinidad detailing the events that she maintained caused her injury. In her statement, Trinidad explained that, while working as a bus monitor, she injured her left wrist when she walked to the back of a moving bus to assist a child with a nosebleed and caught her hand on a seat.', 'After the alleged incident, Trinidad visited the emergency room and was initially diagnosed with a sprain. However, her pain persisted, and Trinidad sought treatment from Gregory Austin, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon.', 'While treating with Dr. Austin, Trinidad underwent an MRI, “which demonstrated question of triangular fibrocartilage tear.” In addition, Trinidad received cortisone injections and a wrist splint. Eventually, Dr. Austin performed an arthroscopy, which revealed “a fair amount” of swelling, “but no specific or repairable” tears. Following the arthroscopy, Trinidad’s problems continued, and she underwent a second MRI, which Dr. Austin determined revealed a tear.', 'Dr. Austin ultimately recommended and performed “an ulnar shortening” surgery; nevertheless, Trinidad’s symptoms remained.', 'In furtherance of her application, Trinidad underwent three independent medical examinations (IMEs), performed by three separate physicians selected by the board, to determine her eligibility for accidental-disability benefits pursuant to § 17-189(f) of the Providence Code of Ordinances governing accidental-disability retirement. 1', 'Initially, the retirement office did not process Trinidad’s application because § 17-189(f) of the Providence Code of Ordinances, governing accidental-disability retirement, provides that an “application to accomplish such retirement must be filed within eighteen (18) months of the date of the accident, unless a waiver is granted through a resolution approved by a majority of the city council.” On November 17, 2014, the Providence City Council granted Trinidad a waiver of the eighteen-month period, and Trinidad reapplied for accidental-disability retirement on December 1, 2015.', '-2-', 'The first doctor, Arnold-Peter C. Weiss, M.D., performed an IME and generated a report, dated April 14, 2016, detailing his evaluation. Therein, Dr. Weiss noted that Trinidad’s pain was “of uncertain etiology far exceeding what one would expect from either the mechanism of injury or the treatment that’s been provided.” As to causality, Dr. Weiss explained, “I’m not sure that I can causally relate the patient’s current upper extremity complaints of pain to her actual on-the- job incident as opposed to some other conversion disorder or other psychiatric reactive phenomenon.” Doctor Weiss went on to explain that objectively he did not believe Trinidad was “totally disabled[,]” but he noted that, “[f]rom a subjective complaint, and the significant symptoms she’s had,” she may be disabled; he gave Trinidad an “[e]xtremely poor” prognosis. Lastly, Dr. Weiss concluded his report by noting that Trinidad’s injury, if any, was “very insignificant,” but stated that, “[e]ven if she objectively is not disabled and has no physical capabilities that are inappropriate at this juncture, psychologically I believe she’s completely unable to use the left upper extremity due to fear, anxiety or some other conversion reaction disorder.”', 'Next, Philip J. Reilly, M.D., performed an IME on April 19, 2016. In his report, Dr. Reilly opined “to within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the patient’s current left upper extremity pain and resultant disability are a result of the accident she sustained on January 26, 2011.” Moreover, Dr. Reilly stated that Trinidad “has a permanent disability with regard to being employed as a bus monitor” and concluded that “she is simply unable to perform these activities.” Doctor Reilly noted that there may be psychiatric influences that affect Trinidad’s ability to recover, but determined that her overall prognosis was poor.', 'The third examining doctor, Jack D. Goldstein, M.D., explained his findings in a report dated April 28, 2016. Doctor Goldstein stated that it was unlikely that Trinidad would improve', '-3- to the point where she could return to her former job. In addition, Dr. Goldstein stated: “Clearly her injury as stated is the initial and only cause of her current disability. I feel that she is currently disabled from her previous job and this was entirely caused by the accident as described although it is difficult to assess what exactly was injured at the time of injury.”', 'The matter came before the board’s disability subcommittee (the subcommittee) for hearings regarding Trinidad’s application. After the subcommittee held hearings, it recommended to the full board that Trinidad’s application be denied. Accordingly, on January 25, 2017, the board voted to deny the application. Then, on March 1, 2017, the board issued a written decision. In its decision, the board provided findings of fact and summarized the IMEs of the three physicians. The board concluded that “[t]he evidence provided does not establish that Trinidad is ‘incapacitated for the performance of duty and * * * she shall be retired’ pursuant to [§ 17-189(f)].” The board explained that the reports from the IMEs and other evidentiary material “do not support granting an accidental disability retirement.” Rather, the board reasoned, the record established that “Trinidad is unable to work as a bus monitor because of subjective complaints without an actual diagnosis.” The board again provided an overview of the reporting doctors’ findings based on the IMEs, and ultimately relied on the opinion of Dr. Weiss. The board explained that “Dr. Weiss, the only orthopedic hand surgeon to examine Trinidad, found that Trinidad is not totally disabled and concluded that it was difficult to explain her significant subjective complaints from the innocuous incident on January 26, 2011.” Additionally, the board emphasized that “Dr. Weiss specifically noted there are certainly no objective signs of Chronic Regional Pain Syndrome Type I (RSD) from a physical exam perspective.” Basing its decision thereon, the board denied Trinidad’s application for accidental- disability retirement benefits and instead granted Trinidad ordinary-disability benefits. Trinidad', '-4- petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari to review the board’s decision, and we granted that petition.', 'Trinidad argues before this Court that each IME clearly establishes that she had a cognizable work-related injury that left her unable to perform her bus monitor duties. Furthermore, Trinidad maintains that her on-duty injury prevents her from returning to her work as a bus monitor and that she therefore qualifies for accidental-disability benefits, rather than ordinary-disability benefits, and should be compensated at the higher accidental-disability benefit rate. Trinidad proffers that the board erred in requiring that she be “totally disabled” to qualify for accidental-disability retirement benefits. Furthermore, Trinidad argues that the board over-relied on Dr. Weiss’s opinion when, in fact, the board should have given his opinion little or no weight at all.2', 'The respondent asserts that the board based its decision on legally competent evidence that Trinidad’s employment was not the natural and proximate cause of her disability. The respondent contends that each of the IMEs indicated confusion regarding Trinidad’s medical history, “with one expert (Weiss) expressly denying that the [i]ncident caused her disability.”3', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews decisions of the [retirement] board by a writ of certiorari.” Pierce v. Providence Retirement Board, 15 A.3d 957, 961 (R.I. 2011); see also Article I, Rule 13(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. “In so doing, ‘our task is to discern whether any 2', 'In her initial statement submitted pursuant to Article I, Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, Trinidad asserted an argument concerning a fourth IME; however, she subsequently withdrew that argument in later submissions to this Court. 3', 'The respondent also argues that it remained unclear whether Trinidad had suffered a subsequent injury to her hand after the incident on January 26, 2011; however, there is no specific evidence of this in the record now before the Court.', '-5- legally competent evidence supports the lower tribunal’s decision and whether the decision-maker committed any reversible errors of law in the matter under review.’” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Sobanski v. Providence Employees’ Retirement Board, 981 A.2d 1021, 1022 (R.I. 2009) (mem.)). We have held that in our review for “‘legally competent evidence’ we look for ‘some or any evidence supporting the agency’s findings.’” Id. (quoting Auto Body Association of Rhode Island v. State Department of Business Regulation, 996 A.2d 91, 95 (R.I. 2010)). “When we evaluate questions of law, our review is de novo.” Id. “If an error of law is found, it must ‘so infect the validity of the proceedings as to warrant reversal.’” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Cullen v. Town Council of Lincoln, 850 A.2d 900, 903 (R.I. 2004)). “Accordingly, if the board did not lack competent facts supporting its decision and did not commit legal errors ‘infecting the validity of the proceedings,’ this Court will affirm its decision.” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Cullen, 850 A.2d at 903).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The respondent does not dispute that Trinidad is disabled; rather, the issue before this Court is whether the board relied upon legally competent evidence to deny Trinidad’s application for accidental-disability retirement benefits and instead grant her ordinary-disability benefits. “The sole difference between accidental and ordinary benefits is the manner in which an employee becomes disabled, which accounts for the difference in compensation.” 4 Pierce, 15 A.3d at 961 (quoting Connelly v. City of Providence Retirement Board, 601 A.2d 498, 500 (R.I. 1992)). Essentially, the retirement system provides benefits that are more lucrative to members 4', '“[A] recipient of ordinary-disability retirement receives a pension of no more than 45 percent of his [or her] final compensation, whereas the pension provided to a recipient of accidental disability retirement is equivalent to 662/3 percent of the member’s final compensation.” Pierce v. Providence Retirement Board, 15 A.3d 957, 961 (R.I. 2011).', '-6- disabled on the job than those disabled outside of work. Id. Accordingly, “entitlement to accidental-disability retirement’s greater benefits requires a member to meet criteria that are more discriminating than the other * * * retirement options.” Id. at 962.', 'This Court has explained that the clause, “the retirement board shall retire the said member for accidental disability,” found in § 17-189(f) of the Providence Code of Ordinances, is “mandatory, not discretionary” in nature. Prew v. Employee Retirement System of City of Providence, 139 A.3d 556, 563 (R.I. 2016) (emphasis in original) (quoting Connelly, 601 A.2d at 500). “Consequently, this Court has declared that, once the employee has established that he or she qualifies for accidental-disability retirement, the board is not vested with discretion to deny the application.” Id. at 563-64.', 'Section 17-189(f) details the requirements an employee must establish to qualify for accidental-disability retirement benefits.5 Prew, 139 A.3d at 564. First, an employee is required to submit an application for accidental-disability retirement “within eighteen months of the accident or upon a waiver granted by the city council[,]” and then “must submit to medical examinations by three independent medical examiners selected and retained by the city.” Id. This Court has enumerated the requirements of § 17-189(f) as follows:', '“The examinations, along with any additional investigation', 'undertaken by the city’s director of personnel, must establish the', 'following: (1) the employee is physically or mentally incapacitated 5', 'Since the board’s vote on January 25, 2017, and its subsequent written decision on March 1, 2017, the Providence Code of Ordinances has been updated by two supplements. The first was issued on July 7, 2017, and the second was issued on April 10, 2018; however, the language of § 17-189(f) remains unchanged. We also note that the board incorrectly cited to § 17-189(6) rather than to § 17-189(f), the subsection in effect at the time of its decision. As we mentioned in Prew—where the board also miscited the statute—“the differences between the erroneously cited language and the actual law at the time the board issued its decision are not substantive for purposes of this case, [however,] these errors are troubling”; we urge the board to be more prudent in their decision writing.

Employee Retirement System of City of Providence, 139 A.3d 556, 560 n.3 (R.I. 2016).', '-7-', 'for the performance of service * * *; (2) that the incapacitation is a', 'natural and proximate result of an accident or accidents; (3) such', 'accident or accidents occurred while the employee was in the', 'performance of duty; (4) the disability was not caused by the', 'employee’s willful negligence or misconduct; (5) the disability is', 'not the result of age or length of service; (6) the employee should', 'be retired; and (7) the definite time, place, and conditions of the', 'duty that resulted in the employee’s disability.” Id. (internal', 'quotation marks, brackets, and footnotes omitted).', 'As detailed above, in addressing causality, Dr. Weiss explained in his report that he found “it difficult to explain the patient’s significant subjective complaints and pain-based behavior given the fairly innocuous incident that she sustained as a bus monitor.” Further, Dr. Weiss reported: “I’m not sure that I can causally relate the patient’s current upper extremity complaints of pain to her actual on-the-job incident as opposed to some other conversion disorder or other psychiatric reactive phenomenon.” As we explained in Morse v. Employees Retirement System of City of Providence, 139 A.3d 385 (R.I. 2016), there is no unanimity requirement in the ordinance governing the board’s review of the IMEs submitted in connection with an application for benefits. Morse, 139 A.3d at 394. In Morse, we explained that “[i]f two independent medical examiners, plus the member’s treating physicians, opine that the member is disabled, and one physician disagrees, it is certainly reasonable to conclude that the evidence is that the member is disabled.” Id. at 393. However, we further clarified that “the board has the authority, indeed the obligation, to review the opinions of each of those physicians and determine why there is a disagreement.” Id. We then stated that “[t]he board certainly has the ability to determine that the one dissenting physician is more persuasive than the others, but that decision must be based on a reasoned analysis of the evidence before the board.” Id.', 'The board’s decision in this case analyzed the opinions of Trinidad’s treating physician and the three physicians who conducted IMEs pursuant to § 17-189(f). As noted, the board,', '-8- quoting § 17-189(f), concluded that “[t]he evidence provided does not establish that Trinidad is ‘incapacitated for the performance of duty and * * * she shall be retired’ pursuant to said ordinance.” Further, the board stated that the record before it indicated that Trinidad “is unable to work as a bus monitor because of subjective complaints without an actual diagnosis.” In reaching its conclusion, the board reasoned that “Dr. Austin * * * was unable to ascertain the cause of her pain and finally diagnosed her with chronic pain syndrome” and that “Dr. Reilly came to the same diagnosis of chronic pain syndrome.” Moreover, the board acknowledged that Dr. Goldstein did state that the incident was the cause of Trinidad’s disability but that he was unable to provide any diagnosis for Trinidad’s symptoms. Dr. Goldstein also noted that it is difficult to assess the precise injury at the time of the incident. Lastly, the board emphasized Dr. Weiss’s opinion, as “the only orthopedic hand surgeon to examine Trinidad,” and highlighted Dr. Weiss’s conclusion that Trinidad is not totally disabled, referring to his findings “that it was difficult to explain her significant subjective complaints from the innocuous incident[.]” The board reiterated that “Dr. Weiss specifically noted that there are certainly no objective signs” of chronic pain syndrome from a physical exam perspective. Accordingly, it is our opinion that Dr. Weiss’s evaluation constituted legally competent evidence supporting the board’s decision denying Trinidad accidental-disability retirement benefits.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decision of the board.', 'Justice Flaherty, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the holding of the majority in this case. I do so because I am convinced that the petitioner, Wanda Trinidad, has presented medical evidence that demands a conclusion that she is physically unable to perform her job as a', '-9- bus monitor and that her disability is the natural and probable result of the injury that she sustained while in the course of her duties on January 26, 2011. Therefore, it is my opinion that her application for accidental-disability retirement benefits should have been granted.', 'As the majority has articulately explained, petitioner was examined by three orthopedic surgeons of the board’s choosing in connection with her application for accidental-disability retirement benefits. Each of those physicians knew of her medical history, including her mental health history, and each had the benefit of the reports of her treating physician, Gregory Austin, M.D., who is also an orthopedic surgeon. Each of the doctors performed an independent medical examination at the behest of the board, and each was aware that Dr. Austin had begun his treatment with conservative therapy, but that lack of progress had caused Dr. Austin eventually to perform two surgeries on petitioner’s left wrist.', 'The first of these independent medical examiners was Philip J. Reilly, M.D., who examined petitioner on April 19, 2016. Doctor Reilly reported that petitioner had been injured in the course of her employment and had tried, without success, to return to work. Doctor Reilly’s physical examination revealed the presence of fluid in petitioner’s hand and wrist. He also opined that there were objective signs that her chronic pain syndrome was causally connected to the injury that she sustained while in the course of her duties. Significantly, Dr. Reilly was of the “opinion to within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the patient has a permanent disability with regard to being employed as a bus monitor.” It was further his “opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that this disability is causally related to the January 26, 2011 accident.”', '- 10 -', 'Jack D. Goldstein, M.D., another orthopedic surgeon, examined petitioner on behalf of the board on April 28, 2016. Doctor Goldstein also recounted petitioner’s medical and surgical history. His examination revealed a limited range of motion of petitioner’s left wrist and, after examining her, he was of the opinion that it was not likely that she would improve to the extent that she could return to work. Indeed, Dr. Goldstein said, in no uncertain terms, that “[c]learly her injury as stated is the initial and only cause of her current disability. I feel that she is currently disabled from her previous job and this was entirely caused by the accident as described although it is difficult to assess what exactly was injured at the time of injury.” Doctor Goldstein concluded by saying that it was unlikely that she would be able to return to her former job and that she should be retrained for some light duty occupation. His opinions were also set forth to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.', 'Finally, petitioner was examined by Arnold-Peter C. Weiss, M.D., on April 14, 2016. Although Dr. Weiss said that he was unable to connect petitioner’s current complaint of pain to petitioner’s on-the-job incident, a review of Dr. Weiss’s report can lead to no conclusion other than that it lacks the clarity and definitiveness of the reports of the other examining physicians. For instance, Dr. Weiss refers to petitioner’s injury as arising from a “fairly innocuous incident[,]” but in the very next sentence relates that she underwent “some significant surgery[.]” Moreover, far from rendering an opinion based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty, as the other two independent medical examiners had done, Dr. Weiss simply states that “I’m not sure that I can causally relate the patient’s current upper extremity complaints of pain to her actual on-the-job incident[.]” He then suggests that perhaps the cause is “some other conversion disorder or other psychiatric reactive phenomenon.”', '- 11 -', 'Doctor Weiss’s conclusions were, at best, equivocal. On the one hand, he reports that “from an objective examination perspective I do not believe this patient is totally disabled[,]” even though total disability is not the standard that is required.1 But, on the other hand, he opines that “[f]rom a subjective complaint, and the significant symptoms she’s had, including her anxiety disorder, she may be disabled.” Despite his misgivings over Ms. Trinidad’s claimed inability to work, he nonetheless restricted her from lifting any weight in excess of five pounds with her left upper extremity.2', 'It is significant to me that the board chose to rely solely on the opinion of Dr. Weiss, the only examiner who did not unequivocally believe that the petitioner’s disability was not work- related. The board held that it gave more weight to Dr. Weiss’s opinion because he was a hand specialist, but it cannot escape mention that it was the board and the board alone who chose the examiners.', 'The majority has concisely, and quite correctly, set forth the appropriate standard of review, and it cannot be gainsaid that that standard is daunting. The majority has also correctly and accurately cited this Court’s decision in Morse v. Employees Retirement System of City of Providence, 139 A.3d 385 (R.I. 2016). In Morse, this Court rejected the board’s unofficial “unanimity rule” and held that there was no requirement that the physicians conducting independent medical examinations be unanimous in their opinions and findings of disability. See 1', 'At oral argument, counsel for the board conceded that the appropriate standard does not include a requirement that the applicant be totally disabled. 2', 'All the examining physicians reported that petitioner had a preexisting history of anxiety, depression, and panic attacks. Doctors Reilly and Goldstein, as orthopedic surgeons, declined to comment on what impact these prior conditions may have had on Ms. Trinidad’s recovery or progress. On the other hand, Dr. Weiss, also an orthopedic surgeon, took the liberty of expressing an opinion about her psychiatric condition—an opinion that was indisputably outside the realm of his expertise.', '- 12 - Morse, 139 A.3d at 393-94. It is also true that, in rejecting the board’s unanimity rule, we opined that the board might be free to conclude that a single dissenting doctor’s opinion was more persuasive than the conclusions reached by the other medical examiners. Id. at 393. We cautioned, however, that such a conclusion “must be based on a reasoned analysis of the evidence before the board.” Id.', 'It is here that I find fault with the decision of the board and the reasoning of the majority. There can be no question that the pension system of the City of Providence, like the pension systems of so many other municipalities and states, is stressed and seriously underfunded. It is certainly laudable that the board has sought to endeavor to limit some of the generous disability findings that have resulted in pension abuse in the past. Nonetheless, this petitioner’s case deserves to be assessed on its own merits, and it is apparent to me that the board has overlooked the great weight of the evidence and has failed to reasonably analyze the evidence before it in order to reach a decision denying Ms. Trinidad an accidental-disability pension. Morse, far from enabling such an action, in fact cautions against it.', 'It cannot escape notice that the board has seized on our decision in Morse to reach the decision that it has made in this case. In Morse, the board argued that the mere presence of a medical examiner’s dissenting opinion was sufficient to deny disability benefits because the board construed the ordinance to require that the examiners be unanimous. See Morse, 139 A.3d at 386. In reversing the board, this Court rejected such a narrow construction. Now, the board argues that it need not credit the majority opinion if a dissenter believes there might not be a disability. In its post-Morse epiphany, the board urges that two strong majority opinions should', '- 13 - be ignored while an internally contradictory and diffuse opinion should carry the day. 3 It is my opinion that the majority’s decision here sets our holding in Morse on its head and allows, and perhaps encourages, the board to find one doctor who will determine that an applicant is not disabled and then cling to that opinion to deny the application in the face of other multiple, unequivocal opinions to the contrary.', 'Finally, it is my opinion that the majority has also overlooked our holding in Prew v. Employee Retirement System of City of Providence, 139 A.3d 556 (R.I. 2016), in which we held firmly that ordinances such as the one at issue here are remedial in nature, and that any ambiguities should be construed liberally so that the purpose of the ordinance might be carried out. See Prew, 139 A.3d at 563.

38,"Bluedog Capital Partners, LLC : v. : John A. Murphy, in his capacity as Tax : Collector for the City of Providence, et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. In this action challenging the assessment of alleged illegal taxes, the plaintiff, Bluedog Capital Partners, LLC (Bluedog), appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court granting the motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure filed by the defendants, John A. Murphy, in his capacity as tax collector for the City of Providence (the city); David Quinn, in his capacity as tax assessor for the city; and Michael Pearis, in his capacity as finance director for the city (collectively defendants).1 This matter came before the Court on March 27, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'On appeal, Bluedog would have us adopt the words of former President Calvin Coolidge: “The collection of any taxes which are not absolutely required * * * is only a species of legalized larceny.” Silent Cal’s Almanack: The Homespun Wit and Wisdom of Vermont’s Calvin Coolidge 112 (David Pietrusza ed., 2008) (quoting Calvin Coolidge, 30th President of the United States, Inaugural Address, March 4, 1925).', '1', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The following facts, sparse as they are, have been gleaned from Bluedog’s complaint. On or about October 3, 2014, Bluedog, a private lender, loaned $35,000 to Fogliare Group, LLC (Fogliare), in consideration of a first-priority mortgage on Fogliare’s real property, which has a street address of 170 Bartlett Avenue, Providence, Rhode Island (the property). Bluedog recorded the mortgage in the Providence land evidence records.2 The property encompasses two lots: Assessor’s Plat 90, Lot 13, which is located within the city (the Providence parcel); and Assessor’s Plat 2-5, Lot 1520, which is located within the City of Cranston (the Cranston parcel). The city noticed a tax sale for the Providence parcel in tax year 2015; and, thereafter, on July 1, 2015, it sold the Providence parcel at a tax sale, with a collector’s deed being recorded in the Providence land evidence records on July 9, 2015. On June 2, 2016, Bluedog filed a two-count complaint, seeking a declaration that defendants had illegally assessed the Providence parcel (Count I) and seeking injunctive relief against the sale of the property (Count II). Bluedog alleged that its mortgage was “subject to the tax sale[,]” and that, in tax year 2015, the total assessed value of the Providence parcel was $102,200.3', 'On June 24, 2016, defendants filed a motion to dismiss Bluedog’s complaint, pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). In their memorandum in support of the motion to dismiss, defendants argued that G.L. 1956 § 44-5-26 provides the exclusive procedures for the tax-abatement relief that Bluedog 2', 'The date that Bluedog recorded this mortgage appears neither in the complaint nor anywhere else in the record before this Court. 3', 'In its complaint, Bluedog averred that “[t]he Providence and Cranston Assessor’s Lots indicate that most if not all of the house on the Property is located on the Cranston Parcel. Also, approximately two-thirds (2/3) of the entire Property lot is located on the Cranston parcel.”', '2 sought and that Bluedog had not complied with those procedures.4 Moreover, defendants averred that, even if Bluedog sought to bypass those procedures by invoking the Superior Court’s equity jurisdiction under § 44-5-27, the three-month statute-of-limitations period for such actions had expired; defendants alleged that Bluedog had filed its complaint “more than seven (7) months after the limitations period expired for the most recent tax year at issue (2015) * * *.” (Emphasis in original.) Finally, defendants contended that there was nothing for the Superior Court to enjoin because the tax sale had already taken place. 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 44-5-26(a) provides:', '“Any person aggrieved on any ground whatsoever by any', 'assessment of taxes against him or her in any city or town, or any', 'tenant or group of tenants, of real estate paying rent therefrom, and', 'under obligation to pay more than one-half of the taxes thereon, may', 'within ninety (90) days from the date the first tax payment is due,', 'file an appeal in the local office of tax assessment; provided, if the', 'person to whom a tax on real estate is assessed chooses to file an', 'appeal, the appeal filed by a tenant or group of tenants will be void.', 'For the purposes of this section, the tenant(s) has the burden of', 'proving financial responsibility to pay more than one-half (½) of the', 'taxes.

Provided, that', 'a city or town may request and receive an extension from the', 'director of the Rhode Island department of revenue.”', '3', 'In Bluedog’s memorandum in support of its opposition to defendants’ motion to dismiss, Bluedog contended that “there are certain situations which have been recognized in Rhode Island for bypassing the normal review procedures set forth in * * * §§ 44-5-26 and 44-5-27.” Bluedog argued that one such case is where, as here, a tax is alleged to be illegal.5', 'On November 17, 2016, a hearing on defendants’ motion to dismiss was held in Providence County Superior Court. At that hearing, defendants began by arguing that the statute of limitations for tax year 2015 had run on October 24, 2015, and that the complaint, which was filed in June 2016, was therefore untimely.', 'They also averred that the complaint merely alleged an overassessment because the property was at least partially within the city’s jurisdiction, and that, even if the taxes were alleged to be illegal, Bluedog was required to appeal the assessment to the board of tax assessment review or else bring an action sounding in equity, pursuant to § 44-5-27, in the Superior Court. The defendants cited the Superior Court decision underlying this Court’s opinion in Narragansett Electric Company v. Minardi, 21 A.3d 274 (R.I. 2011), in which the hearing justice found that the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act could not be used to replace the procedures set forth in §§ 44-5-26 and 44-5-27. See Minardi, 21 A.3d at 277.', 'Moreover, defendants quoted this Court’s opinion in Pascale v. Capaldi, 95 R.I. 513, 188 A.2d 378 (1963), in which we stated: “In our opinion the legislature did not intend that a petition under the uniform declaratory judgments act was to take the place of a taxpayer’s suit and, therefore, the Superior Court had no jurisdiction under the act to grant the [taxpayer’s] prayers.” Pascale, 95 R.I. at 514, 188 A.2d at 379. Finally, defendants argued, and the hearing justice 5', 'See Narragansett Electric Company v. Minardi, 21 A.3d 274, 278 (R.I. 2011) (“Significantly, § 44-5-27 states that ‘the remedy provided in § 44-5-26 is exclusive;’ however, a taxpayer alleging an illegal tax may proceed directly to the Superior Court.”) (brackets omitted) (quoting § 44-5-27).', '4 seemed to agree, that, because the tax sale had already occurred, there was nothing for the Superior Court to enjoin and, thus, there was no relief that could be granted under Count II of the complaint.', 'Bluedog responded by outlining the deferential standard that courts give to plaintiffs on motions to dismiss in general, and specifically in declaratory-judgment actions. Bluedog then described the necessary elements to allege an illegal tax, which includes situations where the taxing authority acted without jurisdiction or where the tax was so palpably exorbitant and excessive as to amount to constructive fraud.6 Bluedog maintained that the tax in this case fit the latter criterion because the building that the city had taxed was located “entirely outside of the City of Providence.” The hearing justice then indicated that, even if she were willing to give Bluedog the benefit of the doubt regarding whether the taxes were illegal, the three-month statute of limitations under § 44-5-27 had clearly run by the time Bluedog filed its complaint. Bluedog responded that the statute of limitations did not apply in this case because a “declaratory judgment action is outside of what is contemplated in those statutes[,]” and the statute of limitations applied only to “an ordinary request for equitable relief.”', 'In her bench decision, the hearing justice determined that at the crux of this case is “whether or not procedurally and legally * * * the [c]ourt had the authority to actually hear the instant matter.” She then quoted the language of both § 44-5-26 and § 44-5-27, outlining the procedures for challenging an assessment of taxes and the exceptions to those procedures. She then indicated that, despite Bluedog’s contentions, this Court’s opinions in Minardi and CIC-Newport Associates v. Stein, 121 R.I. 844, 403 A.2d 658 (1979), indicate that any suit challenging a purported illegal assessment of taxes—such as the one at issue in this case—“would need to sound in equity and 6', 'Bluedog contended in its complaint that in tax year 2016 the city reduced the assessed value of the Providence parcel from $102,200 to $28,400.', '5 they are therefore time-barred.” Accordingly, the hearing justice granted defendants’ motion to dismiss Count I of Bluedog’s complaint. The hearing justice likewise granted defendants’ motion to dismiss as to Count II, stating that “there is really nothing to enjoin here. There is no harm that is presently threatened or imminent because * * * the property has already been sold.”7', 'On December 9, 2016, an order entered dismissing Bluedog’s complaint, with prejudice. On December 14, 2016, Bluedog filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The sole function of a motion to dismiss is to test the sufficiency of the complaint.” Gannon v. City of Pawtucket, 200 A.3d 1074, 1077 (R.I. 2019) (quoting Minardi, 21 A.3d at 277). “In passing on a Rule 12(b) dismissal, this Court applies the same standard as the trial justice.” Id.

(quoting Minardi, 21 A.3d at 278). Additionally, “[a] party may raise a statute-of- limitations defense by way of a motion to dismiss, ‘provided the alleged timing defect appears on the face of the complaint.’” Barrette v. Yakavonis, 966 A.2d 1231, 1234 (R.I. 2009) (brackets omitted) (quoting Martin v. Howard, 784 A.2d 291, 297 (R.I. 2001)).', '“We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.” State v.

In 7', 'It was learned at oral argument before this Court that an entity known as “Angel Realty” purchased the property at the tax sale. However, prior to foreclosure of the right of redemption, Bluedog paid the amount that Fogliare had owed in taxes and redeemed title to the property.', '6 so doing, “our ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.” Id. (quoting Alessi v. Bowen Court Condominium, 44 A.3d 736, 740 (R.I. 2012)). However, “taxing statutes are to be strictly construed with doubts resolved in favor of the taxpayer.” Balmuth v.

Quinn, 173 A.3d 1272, 1278 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Minardi, 21 A.3d at 278). “Section 44-5-26(a) provides an administrative appeal process to ‘any person aggrieved on any ground whatsoever by any assessment of taxes against him or her.’” Id.

(quoting Minardi, 21 A.3d at 278).', 'The full text of § 44-5-27 reads:', '“The remedy provided in § 44-5-26 is exclusive if the taxpayer', 'owned or possessed any ratable estate at all, except that, in a proper', 'case, the taxpayer may invoke the equity jurisdiction of the', '[S]uperior [C]ourt; provided, that the complaint is filed within three', '(3) months after the last day appointed for the payment, without', 'penalty, of the tax, or the first installment of the tax, if it is payable', 'in installments. A taxpayer alleging an illegal or void tax assessment', 'against him or her is confined to the remedies provided by', '7', '§ 44-5-26, except that the taxpayer is not required to file an appeal', 'with the local assessor.” (Emphasis added.)', 'Because Bluedog’s complaint alleged that at least part of the property was located in the city, this is not a case where there was no ratable estate to tax in Providence. See § 44-5-27 (“The remedy provided in § 44-5-26 is exclusive if the taxpayer owned or possessed any ratable estate at all * * *.”); see also St. Clare Home v. Donnelly, 117 R.I. 464, 469, 368 A.2d 1214, 1217 (1977) (“However, our examination of [§ 44-5-26] leads us to conclude that this restriction is not applicable where the taxpayer possesses only tax-exempt property which is not ratable.”). At bottom, then, Bluedog’s complaint essentially alleges an overassessment of taxes, not an illegal tax. Under these circumstances, because Bluedog has failed to comply with the taxing statutes, its complaint must fail as a matter of law. Nevertheless, even if we assume for purposes of defendants’ motion to dismiss that Bluedog had alleged an illegal tax, there is no question that Bluedog did not file its complaint within the three-month statute of limitations set forth in § 44-5-27.', 'We have noted that “[t]he ability of a taxpayer to file a suit in equity directly in the Superior Court, however, is sharply circumscribed by a brief limitations period. Lehigh Cement Co., 173 A.3d at 1278 (quoting § 44-5-27). Section 44-5-5 vests municipal councils with the ability to “determine the date on which taxes are due and payable and the date on which they are subject to a penalty[.]” For tax year 2015, the Providence City Council, by Providence City Ordinance No. 335 of Ch. 15-12, approved on June 11, 2015, mandated that the first installment of tax payments be made on or before July 24, 2015. It follows that, because § 44-5-27 requires that the complaint be filed “within three (3) months after the last day appointed for the payment, without penalty, of the tax, or the first installment of the tax[,]” the statute of limitations for an action under that section', '8 would have run on October 24, 2015. Therefore, on its face, Bluedog’s complaint, filed on June 2, 2016, was untimely.', 'Bluedog attempts to “slay this procedural Goliath[,]” Lehigh Cement Co., 173 A.3d at 1278, by arguing that a declaratory-judgment action alleging the assessment of illegal taxes falls outside the taxing statutes and, thus, is not subject to the statute of limitations in § 44-5-27. However, this Court has stated that “the taxing statutes provide the exclusive relief to any person aggrieved by any assessment of taxes against him by any city or town.” Id. (emphasis added) (quoting Minardi, 21 A.3d at 278). Therefore, any action challenging the assessment of taxes, for any reason, that does not follow the normal procedures set forth under § 44-5-26, must be brought pursuant to § 44-5-27. Accordingly, even when resolving all doubts in the complaint in favor of Bluedog, we hold that the hearing justice did not err when she granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).

The defendant, Javier Merida (Merida or defendant), appeals pro se from an order of the Superior Court denying his motion to correct sentence, pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. On February 28, 2019, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, further briefing or argument is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons explained herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This Court thoroughly recounted the underlying facts of this matter in our consideration of defendant’s direct appeal and postconviction-relief appeal.1 Therefore, we only recount facts relevant to this appeal and other facts necessary for context. 1', 'See Merida v.

State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 230, 231 (R.I. 2008). On July 7, 2006, the trial justice sentenced defendant to two forty-year terms of imprisonment, with twenty years to serve and twenty years suspended, with probation, on the two first-degree child molestation sexual assault counts; and one thirty-year term, with ten years to serve and twenty years suspended, with probation, on the second-degree child molestation sexual assault count; all sentences were to be served concurrently. Id. at 230.', 'From May 2004 until his determination of guilt in May 2006, defendant was on what he characterizes as “twenty-four hour electronic home confinement” as a condition of bail.2 In October 2016, following the completion of defendant’s direct and postconviction-relief appeals, he filed a “motion for correction of sentence” pro se, pursuant to Rule 35, which was later heard by the same trial justice who presided over Merida’s trial. Merida also filed a motion to appoint counsel for the hearing, but the trial justice denied the motion.', 'At the hearing on his motion to correct his sentence, defendant argued that the twenty-four months he spent on home confinement should be credited toward his overall sentence, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-19-2(a). Specifically, he argued that this Court’s opinion in State v. Quattrocchi, 687 A.2d 78 (R.I. 1996), established that home confinement was a form of “imprisonment” for which credit could be given pursuant to § 12-19-2(a). The trial justice then reviewed several relevant cases decided by this Court, taking time to explain each case to defendant and 2', 'The record reveals that defendant’s motion to set bail was granted on May 10, 2004, and a pretrial order was entered for pretrial community confinement pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 42-56-20.2, specifying that “[e]lectronic monitoring devices shall be used.”', '-2- distinguishing the cases based on their facts.3 Merida also argued that a prisoner, whom he knew, had received credit toward his sentence for the time he spent on home confinement while awaiting trial. However, at that hearing, defendant could not remember all the details of that case. The trial justice therefore continued the hearing, at defendant’s request, so that defendant could obtain more information regarding the case he had mentioned.', 'One week later, on November 9, 2016, at the continued hearing, Merida argued that two of his cellmates, Mr. Bagley and Mr. DePina, received credit for home confinement toward their overall sentence. However, the trial justice found those cases distinguishable, explaining that, “[i]t appears that Mr. Bagley was sentenced for bail violation and asked for credit for time served and home confinement, but it wasn’t a sentencing after trial where he was held in home confinement as a condition of bail prior to trial.” She further explained that Mr. DePina was sentenced after a plea agreement with a “capped” plea, stating that, “if I did give him credit for time served in home confinement, it was in accordance with an agreement whereby he agreed to plead guilty and he pled guilty.” Having heard defendant’s arguments, the trial justice issued a bench decision denying defendant’s request to receive credit for time spent on home confinement.', 'Merida filed a timely notice of appeal on December 1, 2016.4 Before this Court, Merida argues that: (1) the trial justice erred in her interpretation of case precedent, specifically our opinion 3', 'Most of the cases that the trial justice discussed involved home confinement as a condition of parole or a plea agreement.

The only case that the trial justice found to be relevant to the issue of whether home confinement should count as credit toward a completed sentence was a case from the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. See United States v. Zackular, 945 F.2d 423, 424-25 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding that a defendant is not entitled to credit toward an overall sentence for a period spent in home confinement). 4', 'This Court remanded the case to Superior Court for the entry of the order denying defendant’s motion, and an order entered to that effect on November 8, 2018. The papers were returned to this Court on November 15, 2018.', '-3- in Quattrocchi, arguing that the interpretation was inconsistent with the provisions of § 12-19-2(a); (2) his equal-protection rights were violated by virtue of the failure to award him credit for his pretrial time on home confinement;5 and (3) the trial justice erred in denying his motion to appoint counsel, given the complexity of the legal issues and the fact that English is defendant’s second language.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“A motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35 is essentially a plea for leniency.” State v.

Skirvin, 113 R.I. 443, 446, 322 A.2d 297, 299-300 (1974)). “Such an individual is ‘in limbo because the time spent awaiting trial or sentence can not be credited towards any future parole.’” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Skirvin, 113 R.I. at 446 n.1,', '-5- 322 A.2d at 300 n.1). This Court has previously stated that “the phrase ‘while awaiting trial and while awaiting sentencing’ must be construed as embracing confinement time spent for any reason whatsoever in connection with an offense for which a defendant is subsequently sentenced.” Id. (quoting State v. Holmes, 108 R.I. 579, 582, 277 A.2d 914, 916 (1971)).', 'In Holmes, we noted that § 12-19-2 “is subject to administrative rather than judicial application.” Holmes, 108 R.I. at 585, 277 A.2d at 917. Thus, it is for the director of the ACI to apply the provisions of § 12-19-2 and to give credits to those persons who were forced to await trial in confinement prior to their conviction. See id. However, G.L. 1956 § 42-56-20.2(j), entitled “No incarceration credit for persons awaiting trial[,]” states that “[n]o detainee shall be given incarceration credit by the director [of the ACI] for time spent in community confinement while awaiting trial.” (Emphasis added.) That provision specifically prohibits the director from granting a person credit for time spent on home confinement prior to trial and prior to conviction.', 'This Court has stated that, “when we are faced with statutory provisions that are in pari materia, we construe them in a manner that attempts to harmonize them and that is consistent with their general objective scope.” State v. Dearmas, 841 A.2d 659, 666 (R.I. 2004). Because both § 12-19-2 and § 42-56-20.2 govern sentencing of a person convicted of a crime, they may be read together as part of a greater statutory sentencing scheme created by the General Assembly. See id. Reading the two provisions together, it is clear that, if the accused is unable to make bail and must await trial at the ACI, then, pursuant to § 12-19-2, the director of the ACI must grant credit for that time if the accused is later convicted. On the other hand, if the accused makes bail and is able to', '-6- await trial in his home, then, pursuant to § 42-56-20.2(j), the director cannot give credit for that time, even if the accused is confined in his home as a condition of bail.6', 'Nevertheless, Merida argues that our opinion in Quattrocchi, where we held that “[w]e are persuaded that home confinement is a form of imprisonment during which an employee’s liberty is significantly restrained[,]” when read in conjunction with § 12-19-2, entitles him to a reduced sentence for the time he spent on home confinement. Quattrocchi, 687 A.2d at 79. However, that case involved an application of G.L. 1956 § 28-33-17.1(c) of the Workers’ Compensation Act, which prohibits an injured employee from collecting workers’ compensation benefits “for any period during which the employee was imprisoned as a result of a conviction of a criminal offense.” Id. As such, Quattrocchi is inapplicable here, where an application of the plain meaning of § 42-56-20.2(j) would bar the director of the ACI from awarding credit to a person convicted of a crime for the time that the person spent on community confinement while awaiting trial.', 'We also note that prohibiting credit for time spent on home confinement, as a condition of bail, is consistent with the spirit of § 12-19-2(a). The purpose of that statute is to relieve those persons who were unable to make bail from the burden of their confinement at the ACI before trial. See Ilacqua, 765 A.2d at 824. That concern is inapplicable where, as here, the accused was able to make bail and remain at home pending the outcome of trial. Therefore, we hold that the trial justice’s interpretation of § 12-19-2(a) and § 42-56-20.2(j) was correct, and that Merida should not be credited with the time he spent on home confinement. 6', '“[T]he right to bail, although guaranteed, is not absolute and may be granted subject to conditions reasonably calculated to further the purpose of bail itself, that is, to ensure the presence of the accused at court.” Bridges v.

However, because defendant did not raise this argument below, we deem it waived.', 'The raise-or-waive rule is well settled in this state, and this Court generally “will not consider on appeal an issue that was not raised before the trial court.” Harvey Realty v. Killingly Manor Condominium Association, 787 A.2d 465, 466-67 (R.I. 2001). We have recognized that the raise-or-waive rule “will not be disturbed unless ‘basic constitutional rights are concerned.’” State v. Gomez, 848 A.2d 221, 237 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Donato, 592 A.2d 140, 141 (R.I. 1991)). “To fall within this exception, the defendant must show: (1) that the error complained of amounts to more than harmless error; (2) that a sufficient record exists to permit a determination of the issue; and (3) that ‘counsel’s failure to raise the issue before trial must be premised upon a novel rule of law that counsel could not reasonably have known during the trial.’” State v.

In each of the fact patterns that Merida offered to the trial justice as examples of persons receiving credit for time spent on home confinement, the defendant was provided credit as a condition of a plea, or in the context of parole.

Nevertheless, a Rule 35 motion is not a “critical stage of a prosecution” where the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches, because the proceeding occurs after a prosecution has been completed.

40,"In re Estate of Elizabeth Brown, a/k/a Letizia : I. Brown.",non-criminal,affirm,"['PER CURIAM. The appellant, Mary Ryan, appeals pro se from an April 26, 2013 final judgment of the Providence County Superior Court and a June 5, 2013 order of the same court. The April 26, 2013 judgment denied and dismissed Ms. Ryan’s probate appeal and prohibited Ms. Ryan, with significant exceptions, from “filing pleadings or other documents” in Superior Court unless they had been signed by a licensed attorney. The June 5, 2013 order denied Ms. Ryan’s motions to vacate that were filed pursuant to either Rule 59 or Rule 60 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Ms. Ryan also raises the issue of the attorneys’ fees awarded to opposing counsel in an April 22, 2013 order of the Superior Court. Ms. Ryan makes numerous contentions of error on appeal. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that these appeals may be decided at this time.', '-1-', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we remand with directions to modify the April 22, 2013 attorneys’ fees order in accordance with this opinion, we affirm in part and vacate in part the April 26, 2013 judgment, and we affirm the June 5, 2013 order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Given the fact that we reach the ultimate conclusion that Ms. Ryan’s failure to provide this Court with the necessary transcripts dooms many of her appellate contentions, we shall provide only those minimal facts necessary to address Ms. Ryan’s contentions.1 In relating what transpired in the Burrillville Probate Court and in Ms. Ryan’s probate appeal to the Superior Court, we rely primarily on the trial justice’s August 2, 2012 bench decision.', 'Ms. Ryan’s case began some fourteen years ago in Probate Court, where there was a dispute with respect to a guardianship for Ms. Ryan’s aunt, Elizabeth Brown, and, ultimately, a dispute over Ms. Brown’s estate after she passed away. Ms. Ryan eventually appealed to Superior Court from an April 27, 2005 denial by the Probate Court of: (1) her motion for sanctions against opposing counsel;2 and (2) her motion to waive the requirement of a filing of a corporate surety bond, which the court had imposed as a condition of her becoming administratrix of the estate. A bench trial on Ms. Ryan’s probate appeal took place in Superior Court commencing on July 23, 2012 and ending on July 27, 2012. Ms. Ryan has opted not to 1', 'The Court notes that a veritable torrent of motions has been filed in this action, virtually all of them by Ms. Ryan. We need not, and therefore shall not, detail those motions that are not germane to our resolution of this appeal. 2', 'This Court notes that the identity of opposing counsel has remained the same throughout the Probate Court, Superior Court, and Supreme Court stages of the case. The record contains absolutely no indication that said counsel has ever acted in this burdensome case in a less than commendably professional and ethical manner.', '-2- provide us with the transcripts of that trial. On August 2, 2012, the trial justice issued a bench decision with respect to the probate appeal.', 'In that bench decision, the trial justice stated that Ms. Ryan had requested the court to authorize William Rose, a family member of Ms. Ryan’s and an intervenor in the Superior Court action, “to stand as surety for Ms. Ryan’s conduct as administratrix and to eliminate the requirement of corporate surety as required by the Probate Court.” In the words of the trial justice, Ms. Ryan was also appealing the Probate Court’s “refusal to order sanctions against [opposing counsel] for allegedly bringing a frivolous guardianship proceeding” with respect to Ms. Brown before she passed away. The trial justice proceeded to make factual and credibility findings. The trial justice held, just as the Probate Court had held, that she would not sanction opposing counsel for his role in the guardianship proceedings involving Ms. Brown before her death. She also questioned Ms. Ryan’s standing to bring such a motion for sanctions. The trial justice proceeded to expressly hold that “the evidence in this case clearly demonstrates that corporate surety not only is advisable but it is absolutely necessary.” She further noted that G.L. 1956 § 33-17-1.2 gives the Probate Court the discretion to require corporate surety and that there are numerous factors to be considered in making such a determination. Finally, the trial justice noted that Ms. Ryan had “failed to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that her surety or that of Mr. Rose would be sufficient.”', 'At the conclusion of that bench decision, the trial justice noted that opposing counsel had orally moved at the end of the trial for sanctions. She found that opposing counsel’s motion had merit. As such, she instructed Ms. Ryan and Mr. Rose to “show cause why they should not be sanctioned pursuant to Rule 11 [of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure] and General Laws [1956 §] 9-29-1” and why the trial justice “should not order them to pay the reasonable', '-3- expense of [opposing counsel’s] defense of himself and [his client].” An order memorializing the bench decision thereafter entered on August 3, 2012.', 'On October 4, 2012, opposing counsel filed a “motion for approval of attorneys’ fees and expenses” seeking attorneys’ fees from Ms. Ryan and detailing in an affidavit and documentation attached thereto data as to his time spent working on the above-referenced defense, his hourly billing rate, and the like. Ms. Ryan objected to that motion.', 'On October 18, 2012, Ms. Ryan filed a motion to vacate and correct the record (the first motion to vacate) seeking to vacate (presumably pursuant to Rule 60 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure) an order that had entered in the case on December 15, 2005. That December 15, 2005 order did the following: (1) it denied Ms. Ryan’s motion for “[c]onditional [i]mmunity;” (2) it denied Ms. Ryan’s motion to assign; (3) it denied Ms. Ryan’s motion for sanctions; (4) it denied Ms. Ryan’s motion to compel/enforce subpoena of the deposition of opposing counsel; (5) it denied Ms. Ryan’s motion to amend and supplement reasons of appeal; (6) it denied opposing counsel’s motion for a protective order; and (7) it denied opposing counsel’s motion for sanctions. In her memorandum in support of her motion, she also sought relief with respect to an order from 2006 that she had presented for the signature of a justice of the Superior Court (who was not the trial justice) but which that justice never signed. On January 25, 2013, after hearing argument on Ms. Ryan’s October 18, 2012 motion to vacate, the trial justice denied the motion in a bench decision. She stated that Ms. Ryan had failed to pursue her remedies with respect to those orders given that “[s]he had years; years to submit the[ ] orders and get * * * things straightened out.” The trial justice further noted that trial had already taken place and a decision had been rendered so no useful purpose would be served in vacating a December 15, 2005 pre-trial order.', '-4-', 'In the meantime, on November 2, 2012, Ms. Ryan had filed a motion to vacate the Superior Court’s order of August 3, 2012 denying her probate appeal (the second motion to vacate), which motion Ms. Ryan amended on November 5, 2012, on the grounds that: (1) there was new evidence; (2) the Superior Court “overlooked evidence and misconceived information;” and (3) the order was violative of her due process rights and was unjust.3 It is unclear from the record whether Ms. Ryan intended that November 2, 2012 motion to be filed pursuant to Rule 59 or Rule 60 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, but that fact has no bearing on the disposition of this appeal. The trial justice conducted a hearing on that motion, along with the first motion to vacate, on January 25, 2013, and she rendered a bench decision denying the motion on January 28, 2013. An order entered on June 5, 2013, denying both of Ms. Ryan’s motions to vacate. Ms. Ryan timely appealed from that order.', 'While those motions were pending, on November 2, 2012, Ms. Ryan also filed a motion to disqualify the trial justice. The trial justice conducted hearings on that motion on November 14 and 21, 2012 and December 11, 2012. On January 4, 2013, the trial justice denied Ms. Ryan’s motion in a bench decision.', 'Subsequently, on April 22, 2013, an amended order entered (the original February 5, 2013 order previously having been vacated) approving opposing counsel’s October 4, 2012 request for attorneys’ fees and awarding him fees in the amount of $7,875. In that amended order, it is represented that a hearing took place on the matter of attorneys’ fees on February 1, 2013. Ms. Ryan has opted not to provide us with the complete transcript of that hearing. 3', 'It appears from the record that Ms. Ryan filed at least two motions to amend her motion to vacate. It is not immediately apparent from the docket whether or not both of those motions were granted. However, for the purposes of our review, that is of no moment.', '-5-', 'Subsequently, on March 4, 2013, Ms. Ryan filed her objection to Rule 11 sanctions, in response to the court’s original August 3, 2012 order directing her to show cause why she should not be sanctioned and held liable for “reasonable costs” in the case. Ultimately, an order imposing sanctions entered against Ms. Ryan on April 26, 2013, prohibiting her “from filing pleadings or other documents in the State of Rhode Island Superior Court unless they have been signed, pursuant to Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, by a licensed attorney, admitted to practice in Rhode Island[.]” The order also provided significant exceptions to that prohibition, stating:', '“a. Ms. Ryan may apply to Presiding Justice of the Superior', 'Court, in writing and with notice to all interested parties, for leave', 'to proceed in a self-represented capacity and to sign and file', 'pleadings and other documents on her own behalf;', '“b. Ms. Ryan is permitted to proceed in a self-represented', 'capacity and to sign and file pleadings and other documents on her', 'own behalf in connection with an appeal of any order or final', 'judgment entered in this case;', '“c. Ms. Ryan is permitted to proceed in a self-represented', 'capacity and to sign and file pleadings and other documents on her', 'own behalf in any legal action in which she is a named defendant', 'or is permitted by the Presiding Justice of the Superior Court, upon', 'written motion with notice to all parties and hearing, to intervene', 'as a party defendant and to act in a self-represented capacity;', '“d.

Ms. Ryan has opted not to provide us with the transcripts of those hearings or of the bench decision.', 'On April 26, 2013, final judgment also entered in the case. That judgment denied and dismissed Ms. Ryan’s probate appeal and reiterated the above-quoted prohibition (with its exhaustive series of exceptions) with respect to Ms. Ryan’s future right to file documents on a pro se basis in the Superior Court. Ms. Ryan filed a timely appeal from the final judgment.', 'II', 'Issues Raised on Appeal', 'Ms. Ryan appeals from the April 26, 2013 final judgment denying her probate appeal and issuing a prohibition limiting her ability to submit pro se filings in the Superior Court. Ms. Ryan claims that the trial justice erred in denying her probate appeal on the ground that she lacked standing to have brought a motion for sanctions against opposing counsel in Probate Court. She also alleges error by the trial justice in not accepting a surety bond from Mr. Rose. She further posits that the trial justice’s order prohibiting her from submitting filings on a pro se basis in the Superior Court violated her constitutional rights and did not adequately detail the specific conduct deemed to be violative of Rule 11.', 'Ms. Ryan also appeals from the June 5, 2013 order denying her motion to vacate a pre- trial order issued in 20054 (the first motion to vacate) and denying her separate motion to vacate both the August 2, 2012 bench decision and the August 3, 2012 order denying her probate appeal (the second motion to vacate). With respect to the first motion to vacate, she contends on appeal 4', 'On appeal, Ms. Ryan represents that her first motion to vacate dealt with one signed pre- trial order and one proposed and unsigned pre-trial order, whereas the motion itself refers only to the signed pre-trial order, which Ms. Ryan refers to as a judgment.', '-7- that the Superior Court justice signed the 2005 order at issue in error. She further avers that the trial justice erred in finding that her motion to vacate with respect to that order was time-barred. With respect to the second motion to vacate, Ms. Ryan posits that the denial of that motion was done “arbitrarily;” in addition, she alleges numerous other errors.', 'In the course of appealing from those four separate rulings of the Superior Court, Ms. Ryan raises the following appellate contentions: (1) the trial justice “lacked jurisdiction to review a guardianship case;” (2) the trial justice violated the law of the case doctrine; (3) the trial justice “mischaracterized Mrs. Ryan’s Probate Appeal, Mrs. Ryan’s motions * * *, court proceedings, orders from other Judges and the facts of the case;” (4) the award of attorneys’ fees to opposing counsel was in error; (5) Ms. Ryan was not given “proper notice” of court appearances or the opportunity to obtain and present evidence; (6) the trial justice violated her due process rights “when she proceeded to trial without having the proper parties established;” (7) the trial justice violated Ms. Ryan’s due process rights when she denied Ms. Ryan’s right to a jury trial; and (8) the trial justice was biased, thus denying Ms. Ryan a “fair and impartial trial.”', 'Ms. Ryan specifically requests that this Court “vacate and reverse the R.I. Superior Court order imposing sanctions * * * [and] reinstate Mrs. Ryan’s Constitutional Rights; vacate and reverse the Superior Court’s Order awarding [opposing counsel] attorneys fees; vacate the Court’s denial of Mrs. Ryan’s Motion to Disqualify [the trial justice]; vacate and reverse the Superior Court’s order dismissing Mrs. Ryan’s Probate appeal; direct the Probate Court to accept Mr. Rose’s Universal Surety Bond; change the venue of the Probate proceedings to the City of Providence; [and] take whatever measures this Court deems necessary in the interest of justice regarding [opposing counsel] * * *.”', '-8-', 'III', 'Standards of Review', 'As we have stated, “a probate appeal is de novo in nature[.]” Lett v.

Rhode Island Department of Corrections, 68 A.3d 543, 548 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).

But without the transcript of the bench decision we are unable to discern whether or not the trial justice discussed the specific conduct forming the basis of her decision. Nor do we have the benefit of the full record needed for us to ascertain whether or not the record was sufficiently developed to support a finding of widespread abuse of the judicial system by Ms. Ryan.

In view of the controlling precedent and the pertinent legal principles, we are unable to give our approval to such a temporally unlimited sanction after taking into account the facts of this case, as vexatious as many of those facts are.', 'We acknowledge that the order in question quite laudably contains four specific exceptions. However, the presence of these exceptions alone does not suffice to prevent the order from being overly broad.', 'Accordingly, it is clear to this Court that there was a reasonable alternative available to the trial justice; which alternative would be making the limitation on Ms. Ryan’s filing pro se in Superior Court time-limited. See Laurence, 68 A.3d at 548. Therefore, we hold that the trial justice abused her discretion, and we direct the Superior Court to limit the duration of the present order’s effectiveness to two years from the date of the issuance of this opinion; at the end of that two-year period, Ms. Ryan may file a motion in the Superior Court requesting the court to review the terms of the order in view of the then-existing factual context.', 'See Pleasant Management, LLC, 918 A.2d at 217.', 'B', 'Attorneys’ Fees', 'We note that Ms. Ryan has opted to provide no more than a single page of the transcript of the February 1, 2013 hearing on opposing counsel’s motion for attorneys’ fees.

The record also includes the order entered by the trial justice as to', '- 13 - attorneys’ fees. Based on our thorough review of those documents, we are of the opinion that the award of attorneys’ fees in this particular case moderately exceeded what was called for under the totality of the circumstances, especially in view of the fact that other sanctions were subsequently imposed.', 'General Laws 1956 § 33-22-26 provides for the awarding of attorneys’ fees in this context, and it states that “costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees in the discretion of the court may be awarded * * * as justice may require.” Regardless of what the record before us reflects concerning abuses of the judicial system by Ms. Ryan during the pendency of this action, she was entitled to have her probate appeal heard in Superior Court. As such, after thoughtful deliberation, it is our judgment that a twenty-five percent reduction in the amount of attorneys’ fees to be awarded is appropriate in this case.', 'Accordingly, we hold that the amount of attorneys’ fees awarded (viz., $7,875) constituted a partially unsustainable exercise of discretion on the part of the trial justice; and we remand the case to the Superior Court with the direction that it enter instead an award of $5,906.25 in attorneys’ fees.

It is unclear from her filings before this Court exactly what substantive decision memorialized in the December 15, 2005 order Ms. Ryan is contending was in error and should be vacated. Given that the December 15, 2005 order memorialized a number of decisions by the Superior Court justice presiding over this case at that time, we are at a loss as to exactly what Ms. Ryan believes constitutes reversible error. Indeed, Ms. Ryan merely states in general terms that the order at issue did not correctly reflect the Superior Court’s October 19, 2005 rulings whereas the order she was proposing to have entered did reflect rulings made by a Superior Court justice in January of 2006.', 'See Terzian v.

We deem it unnecessary in this opinion to delve into a detailed discussion of any of those additional contentions, although we have given due consideration to each and every one of them.

What is more, we have scrutinized the voluminous record presented to us in order to wade through the tortuous history of this case.6 From the record before us, we are unable to perceive any support for any of Ms. Ryan’s remaining contentions on appeal.', 'Accordingly, in our judgment, the trial justice did not err with respect to any of the issues on appeal that we have been able to review in light of the record that has been presented to us.

41,State : v. : Thomas Sanchez. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Thomas Sanchez, seeks review of a judgment of conviction after a jury found him guilty of two counts of first degree robbery and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery. Sanchez raises a sole issue before this Court— whether or not the admission of an out-of-court statement made by Maria Rojas, an alleged coconspirator who did not appear at Sanchez’s trial, deprived him of his right to confront the witnesses against him, in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution. After thoroughly reviewing the record and after carefully considering the arguments of the parties, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'It has been said that nothing good happens after midnight. The facts before us in connection with this case provide some support for that adage. One night in February 2014, four friends—Leonardo Sanchez, Miguel Sanchez, Yonathan Melendez, and Joan Mustafa—spent the evening and early morning enjoying the nightlife of downtown Providence while partying at a', '-1- local nightclub.1 When the establishment closed at 3 a.m., the revelers visited a 7-Eleven and ordered some pizza. While they were eating, Christopher Xavier approached Leonardo, claiming that he knew him. Although he believed that Xavier might have been an occasional customer at his father’s store, Leonardo told Xavier that he did not recognize him.', 'Meanwhile, Melendez had become engaged in a conversation with two women who had entered the store with Xavier. One of the women was Maria Rojas, who invited the group to an “after party.” After some cajoling, Melendez persuaded his compatriots to accompany the women to the party. A third woman joined the group and together, the four young men and three women squeezed into Leonardo’s car as Maria directed them to her home, which was located on a dead end street in Pawtucket.', 'Upon arriving, the group got out of the car and descended into a “make-shift” basement apartment. The “after party” the young men found there did not meet their expectations, and they found it to be sorely lacking in the expected festive accoutrements. When he later testified at trial, Melendez said that the men remarked at the time, “Ah, there’s no alcohol. There’s no music. There’s no party. What’s going on?” Both Melendez and Leonardo testified that the apartment was brightly illuminated, like “[a] normal apartment[,]” and that they could see clearly. That said, the friends observed that the apartment was in a state of disarray and that a young man and a woman, later identified as Julian Diaz and his girlfriend, were sleeping in the living room.2 The friends had been in the basement apartment for about ten to fifteen minutes when they were joined by three new arrivals—Christopher Xavier, Josue Laboy, and defendant Thomas Sanchez. 1', 'To avoid confusion, Leonardo and Miguel, who share their last name with defendant, will henceforth be referred to by their first names. No disrespect is intended. 2', 'Julian Diaz later testified that Maria Rojas’s two young children were sleeping elsewhere in the apartment.', '-2-', 'Leonardo testified that, after Maria asked defendant why he had arrived so late, defendant replied, “Oh, I’m late because I went home to get this,” as he brandished what Leonardo believed to be a handgun that defendant had removed from his waistband. Also, Melendez later claimed at trial that, at some point soon after defendant and the other men arrived, Melendez excused himself to use the bathroom. He was soon joined by defendant, who offered to allow Melendez to “have sex with this girl” if Melendez were to pay him. According to Melendez, he rejected that offer and decided that it was time to leave. A few minutes later, Melendez and Miguel made their exit from the apartment.', 'Leonardo testified that, seeing his friends leave, he turned to say goodbye to the remaining partyers. Suddenly, defendant grabbed him from behind and held the handgun to his head. At the same time, Leonardo testified, Xavier held two knives to his abdomen. Leonardo testified that defendant then told him, “Run your pocket.” Mustafa, who was huddled in the corner of the room, urged Leonardo to “give everything away. Give everything away.” Leonardo did not heed that advice, and instead fought with defendant, lunging for the gun. Although he put up a valiant effort, in the end, Leonardo was subdued after defendant slammed the weapon into Leonardo’s face three times.', 'Leonardo testified at trial that his face was so bloody that he “couldn’t see nothing.” He claimed that someone picked him up from the floor and that one of the women told him to remove his ring. With some effort he managed to remove the ring from his finger, and he “gave it to one of the girls.” Someone, Leonardo was not sure who, relieved him of his wallet, cell phone, and $150 in cash. After Leonardo’s pockets were unburdened, Maria helped him into the bathroom so that he could wash himself.', 'Melendez testified that, while the scene in the basement was playing out, he and Miguel', '-3- were waiting outside by the car. Melendez testified that one of the women came outside and told them that Mustafa and Leonardo wanted them to rejoin the party and that the woman insisted that everyone was having fun. Despite having reservations, Melendez said that he eventually decided to return to the party, but that Miguel remained outside.', 'Leonardo and Melendez each testified that defendant accosted Melendez as soon as he reentered the apartment; according to Melendez, defendant positioned himself behind Melendez while he held what Melendez believed to be a handgun while another man held a knife to Melendez’s throat. Melendez said that, although defendant was behind him, he was able to see defendant’s face during the encounter. Melendez further testified that someone told him, “Run your shit[,]” and Mustafa, who was sitting in a chair nearby, urged him, “Look what they did to Leonardo just do what they say.”', 'Melendez averred that, unlike Leonardo, he acted on Mustafa’s advice, and he was soon separated from his jewelry, personal phone, work phone, roughly $800 in cash, and his “good luck charm,” a $2 bill. Melendez testified that defendant also demanded that he hand over his sweater. According to Melendez, defendant removed his own shirt, which had been soiled by Leonardo’s blood, and donned Melendez’s sweater.', 'Melendez, Leonardo, and Mustafa were then allowed to leave, but Leonardo and Melendez each testified that their assailants were taunting them and bragging about having their belongings, and that one of their assailants—Leonardo testified that it was the man holding the knives—explained that he was aware of where the victims lived and that he threatened to hurt them or their families if they called the police. Before they left, Melendez asked defendant to return his sweater—he claimed it was a Christmas gift from his sister—and his work phone, and defendant complied with those requests. Despite the assailants’ threats, Melendez called the police with his newly returned phone as Leonardo, Mustafa, and Melendez were leaving the', '-4- apartment. The men got into Leonardo’s car and drove to a Dunkin’ Donuts about a block away, where they reconnected with Miguel and waited for the police.', 'When police officers arrived at the scene, they stopped a vehicle as it was leaving the premises. Inside that vehicle were Julian Diaz, Josue Laboy, Christopher Xavier, Maria Rojas, two other women, and Maria’s two young children. The defendant, who had been seated in the front passenger seat, already had left the vehicle and fled. The officers followed tracks in the snow through several residential lots and soon discovered defendant a few streets away from Maria’s apartment, hiding under a deck. Police searched defendant and discovered that he was in possession of $737 in cash, two earrings, and a cell phone. A search of the suspects’ car revealed a black BB gun on the floor behind the passenger seat and a magazine for the BB gun in the front passenger door compartment.', 'Police arrested defendant, Rojas, Diaz, Xavier, and Laboy, and, on May 15, 2014, all five were charged by indictment with three counts of robbery and one count of conspiracy to commit robbery.3 Trial testimony revealed that Leonardo and Melendez both identified defendant from a photographic array of twelve pictures, both claiming that defendant was the man who had wielded what they believed was a firearm during the robbery. Diaz and Xavier each pled nolo contendere to the charges brought against them. Subsequently, at trial, both Diaz and Xavier acknowledged that, during the course of their plea colloquies, each had admitted to helping Sanchez commit the robberies. Xavier agreed during his trial testimony that he had answered “yes” during his plea colloquy when asked if defendant had held a gun to one of the victims.4 3', 'The third count of robbery against defendant was dismissed prior to the conclusion of his trial. The charges against Laboy were dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure after he signed an affidavit detailing the events of the party-cum-robbery. 4', 'Although the photographic array and plea colloquies were not transmitted to this Court as part of the record below, defendant did not dispute at trial that it was his picture that had been', '-5-', 'At defendant’s trial, Laboy, Diaz, Xavier, and defendant all testified about the events of that night. Laboy’s testimony was largely corroborative of that provided by Leonardo and Melendez. Significantly, Laboy testified that, about twenty minutes after the four friends had arrived at the party, defendant struck Leonardo with a handgun and told him, “Run your pocket. Give me your money[,]” while another man wielded two knives. Laboy further testified that defendant later robbed the second victim (Melendez) while using the “same gun.” The stories told by defendant, Diaz, and Xavier, however, were considerably inconsistent. Significant to this appeal, however, Maria Rojas absconded and a warrant was issued for her arrest. By the time of defendant’s trial, she had not been apprehended and therefore was unavailable to testify at trial.', 'When defendant took the stand in his own defense, he testified that he had joined Xavier and Laboy on the way to Maria’s apartment to pick up some of Xavier’s friends. According to defendant, neither he nor Xavier ever entered the apartment; instead, according to defendant, they remained outside in the car. The defendant testified that when Maria, her two children, Diaz, Laboy, and three other women packed into the car some time later, the new arrivals started “passing stuff out” and he was handed an iPhone. The defendant said he fled when police stopped the car because he believed that his fiancée might have called the police earlier that night, and he feared that police would arrest him for domestic abuse. He testified that the large amount of cash that was found on his person when he was apprehended belonged to him and that he had earned that money working on a construction job for his fiancée’s father.', 'Although Diaz and Xavier each had averred previously in open court that defendant had committed the robberies at the time they pled nolo contendere to charges relating to the events of identified in the photographic array by Leonardo and Melendez, nor did he take issue with the way Diaz and Xavier characterized the admissions they had previously made during their respective plea colloquies.', '-6- that night, at defendant’s trial, each recanted his earlier version of events. Each claimed that he had not been paying attention to what was being said during his plea colloquy.', 'Indeed, in a complete reversal, Diaz took credit for robbing all four of the hapless friends, contradicting the testimony of Leonardo, Melendez, and Laboy that Miguel had not even been present at the time of the robberies. Diaz further swore that it was he who had battered the victims while Laboy and Maria helped him rifle through the victims’ pockets. According to Diaz, both defendant and Xavier were outside in the car during the entire encounter. Significantly, Diaz’s identification of the weapon used in the robbery oscillated between a BB gun, a .22 caliber handgun with the serial number shaved off, and “a high-power BB gun” bearing a legible serial number. Diaz claimed that he dropped the weapon in the back seat of the getaway car after the robberies and that he left the magazine inside the apartment, varying from the state’s version of events that police had found the weapon’s magazine in the passenger door compartment of the car.', 'Interestingly, Xavier also testified that it was he who bore sole responsibility for the robberies, explaining that his weapon of choice had been knives. Contradicting the version of events he had previously said was true during his own plea hearing, Xavier testified that, although defendant was in the room during the robberies, and not outside as Diaz had testified, Xavier did not recall seeing defendant holding a gun. In fact, Xavier claimed that he was “dumbfounded” when police found a BB gun in his car because, he said, he had never seen the weapon before.', 'Officer Donti Rosciti, of the North Providence Police Department, also testified about his', '-7- investigation of the robberies.5 On cross-examination by defendant, Officer Rosciti confirmed that Maria had acknowledged that she stole one of the victim’s earrings. Later, during redirect examination, the prosecutor further inquired about Maria Rojas’s statement to police.

Judgment was entered on September 6, 2016, and defendant filed a notice of appeal on October 21, 2016.6 The defendant argues before this Court that the introduction of Maria Rojas’s out-of-court statement during Officer Rosciti’s testimony, in view of Rojas’s failure to appear as a witness at trial, violated his right to confront the witnesses against him afforded by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'The sole issue to be determined by this Court is whether or not defendant’s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights were violated. Before we reach the merits of that argument, however, we must first determine whether or not it has been preserved for our consideration. 6', 'It is unclear whether the notice of appeal was filed by defendant’s trial attorney, who is currently disbarred, or by defendant himself, as his trial counsel’s signature does not appear on the document. In any case, we note that defendant’s appeal was not timely filed. See Article I, Rule 4(b) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure (“In a criminal case the notice of appeal by a defendant shall be filed with the clerk of the Superior Court within twenty (20) days after the entry of the judgment or order appealed from.”). We will nevertheless review this case as though defendant had filed a common law petition for writ of certiorari so that we may avoid depriving defendant of the opportunity to seek review of his criminal conviction. We therefore proceed to the merits of defendant’s argument.', '-9-', 'A', 'The Objection', 'We repeatedly have “made it abundantly clear that ‘a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.’” Atryzek v.

To support that argument, defendant directs us to our holding in Offley, in which we recognized that a party’s failure to explain the specific grounds for his objection may not necessarily be fatal if “the reason for the objection is clear from the context in which it was made.” Offley, 131 A.3d at 670.', '- 10 -', 'In Offley, the defendant argued on appeal that the admission of a witness’s prior testimony was error because a proper foundation had not been laid.

We arrived at this conclusion after noting that the objections were made as the prosecutor was reading the prior testimony into evidence and, importantly, that the defendant was “rebuffed” by the trial justice multiple times when he attempted to explain the rationale for his objections, both at counsel table and at sidebar. Id.', 'In contrast, an examination of the transcript in the case before us at this time reveals that defendant was not “rebuffed,” and that, when the trial justice attempted to clarify the nature of the question, a discussion ensued but defendant did not provide any reason for his objection. What is more, there is no indication that the trial justice understood that defendant’s objection sounded in the Confrontation Clause.', 'Importantly, we previously have considered and rejected an argument that was strikingly similar to defendant’s argument in this case. See Moten, 64 A.3d at 1239. In Moten, the defendant alleged on appeal that the introduction of a nontestifying declarant’s statement violated the defendant’s right to confront the witnesses against him. Id. at 1237-38. As is the case here, however, when the defendant in that case made his objection at trial, he failed to state the basis for the objection. Id. at 1239. The defendant in Moten sought to circumvent this infirmity by arguing that “it was clear that counsel was objecting to his inability to confront the', '- 11 - [nontestifying witness]” because of the declarant’s absence at trial. Id. In our view, however, we deemed it “equally—if not more—plausible that the prosecutor and the trial justice understood defendant’s objection to be on hearsay grounds[,]” and we thus concluded that the defendant’s naked objection failed to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis of the defendant’s objection. Id. at 1239, 1240.', 'Just as the defendant did in Moten, defendant in this case objected at the moment a witness was testifying about an out-of-court statement by a nontestifying witness. See Moten, 64 A.3d at 1239. It was therefore “equally—if not more—plausible that the prosecutor and the trial justice understood defendant’s objection to be on hearsay grounds.” Id. As we noted in Moten, “[a] hearsay objection is not equivalent to an objection based on the constitutional right to confront a witness.”7 Id. at 1239 n.7. At the same time, we recognize that the objection was repeated and that the principles set forth in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), are no longer new law.8 We will, therefore, assume without deciding that a Confrontation Clause objection was properly articulated.', 'B', 'Harmless Error', 'There is no doubt that even a properly articulated objection premised on the Sixth Amendment must be viewed through the prism of the effect the evidence may have had upon the 7', 'An examination of the transcript leads easily to the conclusion that the objection made by defendant was intended, and understood by both the prosecutor and the trial justice, to be founded on hearsay. Although defendant has not pursued that argument before this Court, it appears to us that that objection should have been sustained on hearsay grounds. However, any error arising from the decision to admit the testimony is, for reasons set forth in this opinion, not reversible. 8', 'In Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004), the United States Supreme Court established that the introduction of testimonial hearsay against a defendant violates the Confrontation Clause unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had previously had a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine the witness. See Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68.', '- 12 - trial. This is so because “[v]iolations of the Confrontation Clause are subject to harmless-error analysis[,]” and “[t]he inquiry is whether, assuming the defense had been afforded the opportunity to cross-examine the unavailable witness and that ‘the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.’” State v. Roscoe, 198 A.3d 1232, 1245 (R.I. 2019) (quoting State v. Albanese, 970 A.2d 1215, 1222 (R.I. 2009)). The record before us reveals that the evidence placing a gun in defendant’s hand during the robberies was both abundant and compelling. Three witnesses—Leonardo, Melendez, and Laboy—testified at trial that it was defendant who wielded a firearm during the robberies. Testimony at trial revealed that each victim independently identified defendant in court and from a photographic array following the incident, and each asserted that the individual whom they identified as defendant had used a firearm during the robbery. Laboy also testified that defendant had used a gun to effectuate the robberies.', 'In contrast, the testimony of defendant’s cohorts with respect to the events of that fateful night was inconsistent to a startling degree. At trial, Diaz and Xavier testified that defendant had been uninvolved in the robberies. That story starkly conflicted with the facts that those two men admitted that they had sworn to during their own plea colloquies, however, when each had previously admitted to conspiring with defendant to commit robbery. Indeed, Xavier agreed at trial that he had claimed during his plea colloquy that defendant had used a firearm when he robbed and struck Leonardo. Moreover, Diaz and Xavier could not agree as to where defendant was during the robberies; Diaz claimed that defendant spent the encounter outside the apartment, while Xavier claimed that defendant had been present during the robberies, but that he had not participated in them. Furthermore, Diaz and Xavier each claimed sole responsibility for the', '- 13 - robberies—an obvious impossibility that shredded the credibility of both of them—and Diaz’s description of the weapon that he claimed to have used varied among a BB gun, a .22 caliber handgun with an obliterated serial number, and “a high-power BB gun” bearing a legible serial number.', 'Importantly, defendant’s own testimony matched neither of the stories provided by Diaz or Xavier. What is more, when defendant was apprehended after fleeing from police, he was found in possession of roughly the same amount of cash that one of the victims claimed had been stolen from his person, one of the victim’s phones, and some of the victims’ jewelry. Further, a BB gun and magazine were found near the seat in the getaway car that had been occupied by defendant.', 'It is clear to us that the state’s case against the defendant neither rose nor fell with Rojas’s statement that the defendant employed a weapon during the robberies. The statement attributed to Rojas by the testifying police officer is relatively unimportant in light of the testimony of the three witnesses who claimed that the defendant had used the gun, and it was wholly cumulative of the overwhelming evidence of the defendant’s guilt that was presented by the state. See State v. Doctor, 644 A.2d 1287, 1290 (R.I. 1994) (laying out factors to consider in a harmless error analysis: “the importance of the witness’ testimony in the prosecution’s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution’s case”) (quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986)). Therefore, we can reach no conclusion other than, had the defendant “been afforded the opportunity to cross-examine” Maria Rojas, and had “the damaging potential of the cross-examination [been] fully realized,” the remaining', '- 14 - evidence was sufficiently compelling to support the jury’s finding of guilty and, therefore, the admission of Rojas’s out-of-court declaration was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

However, I feel obliged to disassociate myself from that small portion of the Court’s opinion which, in discussing the issue of whether or not a particular objection was sufficiently articulated at trial and thereby preserved for appellate review, engages in speculative dicta suggesting that there is even an arguable possibility that any objection on Crawford1 grounds was adequately preserved.

42,Joshua Mello : v. : Sean Killeavy. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. In this negligence action, the plaintiff, Joshua Mello (Mello), appeals from a Superior Court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Sean Killeavy (Killeavy), based on the exclusivity provision of the Workers’ Compensation Act, G.L. 1956 § 28-29-20 (the exclusivity provision). On appeal, Mello contends that, despite the limitation on remedies contained in the exclusivity provision, G.L. 1956 § 28-35-58 allows him to bring a claim against his fellow employee for tortious acts of the coemployee that were outside the scope of employment, even after he collected workers’ compensation benefits.1 This matter came before the Court on March 6, 2019, for oral argument after full briefing of the issues. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'After a careful review of the record, we recite the following pertinent facts. Mello and Killeavy were both employees of Ramsay’s, Inc. (Ramsay’s), a small, family-owned company that 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 28-35-58 governs the liability of third persons for damages when an employee is injured.', '-1 - provides maintenance and groundskeeping services for cemeteries in Rhode Island. Killeavy had worked as a seasonal laborer for Ramsay’s since August 2015. Beginning in December 2008, Ramsay’s employed Mello, first as a laborer, and later as a crew chief. The two employees apparently enjoyed a friendly relationship, and they engaged in practical jokes while on the job. Unfortunately, one such prank went too far.', 'On August 17, 2016, Mello and Killeavy were working at St. Mary’s Cemetery in Bristol, Rhode Island. At one point during the workday, while Mello was occupying a bathroom stall, Killeavy, using a gas canister that he found on the job site, poured gasoline onto the bathroom floor as a practical joke. Expecting only to create a loud “popping” noise to scare Mello, Killeavy ignited the gasoline. 2 Unbeknownst to Killeavy, however, the gasoline had flowed into the stall that Mello occupied, and, when the gasoline burst into flames, Mello was injured. As a result, Mello was hospitalized with significant burns, leaving him unable to work for over a year. On September 7, 2016, Ramsay’s, through its workers’ compensation insurer, The Beacon Mutual Insurance Company, filed a memorandum of agreement with the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training providing for workers’ compensation benefits to be paid to Mello, and Mello accepted the benefits. Additionally, on October 14, 2016, after having learned of the details of the incident, the owner of Ramsay’s fired Killeavy.', 'On September 30, 2016, Mello filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court against Killeavy, alleging negligence and stating that “[o]n or about August 17, 2016 the [p]laintiff was at all times in the exercise of due care and performing duties on behalf of his employer” when the accident occurred. Killeavy answered, denying Mello’s claims; he additionally sought defense 2', 'At oral arguments, Mello’s attorney contended that this act was similar to a prank that Mello had previously performed on Killeavy.', '-2 - and indemnity in this action pursuant to his parents’ homeowners’ insurance policy. 3 He also sought defense and indemnity from United Ohio Insurance Company, which had provided both a commercial package insurance policy and a commercial excess insurance policy to Ramsay’s at the time of the incident.4 Killeavy later propounded requests for admissions upon Mello. 5', 'On February 21, 2017, Killeavy filed a motion for summary judgment, along with a statement of undisputed facts, arguing that the exclusivity provision of the Workers’ Compensation Act barred Mello’s negligence claim because Mello had accepted workers’ compensation benefits from his employer for an injury occasioned by the acts of a fellow employee while on the job. In his memorandum in opposition to Killeavy’s motion, Mello did not dispute Killeavy’s statement of undisputed facts. However, he argued that, because Killeavy may have been on a lunch break at the time the injury occurred, Killeavy would not be considered an “employee” at the time of the incident and that § 28-35-58 would allow Mello to maintain a separate cause of action against Killeavy as a “third party,” despite Mello’s acceptance of workers’ compensation benefits. Along with his opposition memorandum, Mello attached correspondence from Ramsay’s noting that meal breaks were noncompensable. Mello also provided the court with a copy of the transcript of the deposition of Enzly Ramsay, the owner of Ramsay’s, who noted that his company had no set time 3', 'The insurer, Metropolitan Group Property and Casualty Insurance Company, filed a separate declaratory-judgment action, arguing that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Killeavy pursuant to a “business activities” exclusion in its insurance policy. Metropolitan Group Property and Casualty Insurance Company v.

However, as counsel indicated at oral argument, United Ohio is now providing for Killeavy’s defense in the instant matter. 5', 'In response to Killeavy’s request for admissions, Mello admitted that both he and Killeavy were employees of Ramsay’s on August 17, 2016. He also admitted that he accepted workers’ compensation benefits for the injuries he incurred that day.', '-3 - or policy for when employees could take their lunch breaks and that Mello, as supervisor, would have had discretion to decide when to take them.', 'A hearing on Killeavy’s motion for summary judgment was held on April 21, 2017. Mello argued that Ramsay’s provided him workers’ compensation benefits before investigating whether or not Mello’s injury occurred while he was on a lunch break. However, Mello admitted that, under Rhode Island law, even if an employer improperly granted workers’ compensation benefits, the employee is bound by the provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Act.6 Mello then reiterated his argument that his injury had not occurred in the course of Killeavy’s employment because Killeavy was on lunch break at the time. Additionally, he contended that Killeavy’s act was so egregious that it was outside the scope of his employment with Ramsay’s. In response to the hearing justice’s inquiry as to why Mello had alleged that he received the injury while “performing duties on behalf of his employer,” Mello’s attorney replied that he had not been told about the lunch break at the time, but had changed his theory of the case once Mello informed him of the full story. However, Mello admitted that he had not sought to amend his complaint at any time to articulate his new theory.', 'In the end, the hearing justice granted Killeavy’s motion for summary judgment. She first noted that the main issue in the case was the application of the exclusivity provision to Mello’s negligence claim. The hearing justice interpreted the exclusivity provision as providing immunity to employers and employees, and quoted our opinion in Manzi v. State, 687 A.2d 461 (R.I. 1997) (mem.), in which we stated that the Workers’ Compensation Act “bars a plaintiff from filing a 6', '“Once a [workers’] compensation act has become applicable either through compulsion or election, it affords the exclusive remedy for the injury by the employee or his dependents against the employer and insurance carrier.” Cianci v.

Moreover, she cited several of our opinions in reasoning that “it is well settled that there is no exception to this particular provision for intentional torts or wrongful conduct of a fellow employee.” The hearing justice then stated that, by accepting workers’ compensation benefits, Mello had waived any right he might have had to challenge whether he was injured during the course of his employment. She concluded by finding that the caselaw and statutes were clear: There was no exception to the immunity granted to coemployees under the exclusivity provision, which meant that Mello could not maintain his suit against Killeavy.', 'On April 27, 2017, Mello prematurely appealed to this Court.7 On May 16, 2017, an order entered granting Killeavy’s motion for summary judgment, and final judgment entered in favor of Killeavy that same day.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“A motion for summary judgment ‘is designed to decide in an expeditious fashion cases presenting groundless claims.’” Hexagon Holdings, Inc. v.

Panciera Lease Co., Inc., 612 A.2d 40, 42 (R.I. 1992) (emphasis added). “Workers’ compensation benefits are meant as full compensation for any loss or harm that is alleged to have been caused by any entity to which immunity from suit is extended under § 28-29-20.” Id.', 'Moreover, § 28-29-17 of the Workers’ Compensation Act provides, in pertinent part, that an employee:', '“[S]hall be held to have waived his or her right of action at common', 'law to recover damages for personal injuries if he or she has not', 'given his or her employer at the time of the contract of hire or', 'appointment notice in writing that he or she claims that right and', 'within ten (10) days after that has filed a copy of the notice with the', 'director [of the department of labor and training.]” As such, “[a]n employee who has not retained his or her common law rights under § 28-29-17 is barred by the prohibitions contained in § 28-29-20 from bringing a tort action against his or her employer in situations in which ‘workers’ compensation benefits are appropriate.’” Kulawas v.

Products Corp., 560 A.2d 949, 950 (R.I. 1989)).', 'Mello concedes that he was injured by Killeavy while on the job site and that Killeavy was a coemployee of Ramsay’s at the time. He has also admitted that he accepted workers’ compensation benefits from Ramsay’s for his injuries. Additionally, it is clear that Mello did not notify Ramsay’s of his intention to preserve any common-law right to sue in accordance with § 28-29-17. Accordingly, absent any other mitigating factor—such as a statute or interpretation', '-7 - thereof from this Court—summary judgment would be appropriate on Mello’s claim for negligence against Killeavy.', 'However, Mello contends that § 28-35-58 enables him to maintain a suit against Killeavy, even though he accepted and received workers’ compensation benefits from Ramsay’s. This provision states, in pertinent part:', '“Where the injury for which compensation is payable under chapters', '29–38 of this title was caused under circumstances creating a legal', 'liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages in', 'respect of the injury, the employee may take proceedings, both', 'against that person to recover damages and against any person liable', 'to pay compensation under those chapters for that compensation,', 'and the employee shall be entitled to receive both damages and', 'compensation.” Section 28-35-58(a). Under § 28-35-58, even after accepting workers’ compensation benefits, “[a]n injured employee is not * * * barred from seeking damages from an entity not made immune under § 28-29-20 for any loss or harm due to the wrongful conduct of such an entity.” DiQuinzio, 612 A.2d at 43.', 'Mello avers that the absence of the word “employees” after the word “employer” in § 28-35-58 implies that the Legislature did not intend to extend immunity to fellow employees when the injury at issue “was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages in respect of the injury[.]” He claims that this occurs, as was purportedly the case here, when an employee performs an act that is outside the scope of his employment and that act injures a fellow employee.8 Under Mello’s theory, a person who was injured on the job and collected workers’ compensation benefits would not thereafter be barred by the exclusivity provision from suing the coemployee who caused the injury when the coemployee’s 8', 'We note that, due to the allegations in Mello’s complaint that he was performing duties on behalf of his employer when he was injured, coupled with his lack of supporting affidavits in his opposition to the motion for summary judgment, we will not consider his argument that he was on an uncompensated lunch break at the time of the injury.', '-8 - acts could be considered to be outside the scope of employment. However, we have had occasion to interpret each of the above provisions of the Workers’ Compensation Act, and have found no basis in the law to create a judicial exception to the exclusivity provision for injuries caused by acts of coemployees.', 'In DiQuinzio, the plaintiff was injured on the job when a truck driven by a coemployee collided with another vehicle while on the highway.

McGovern, 639 A.2d 1369 (R.I. 1994). In that case, the plaintiff was injured when a vehicle driven by a coemployee collided with a cement truck. Boucher, 639 A.2d at 1371. The plaintiff collected workers’ compensation benefits for the injury he suffered and subsequently sued the third-party tortfeasors for damages. Id.

Panciera Lease Co., Inc., 612 A.2d 40, 41 (R.I. 1992).', '-9 - injury. Id. The coemployee moved for summary judgment, claiming that she was immunized from contribution for the plaintiff’s injury. Id. Nonetheless, the trial justice allowed the claim for contribution to move forward, stating that, when reading §§ 28-29-20 and 28-35-58 together, it was clear “that § 28-29-20 in the context of the entire statutory scheme does not immunize employees, directors, officers, or agents ‘where they are individually legally liable’ but does immunize them when they are sued to impute liability to the employer.” Id. at 1372.', 'The coemployee petitioned for a writ of certiorari, which we granted; we ultimately quashed the motion justice’s ruling. Boucher, 639 A.2d at 1379. This Court cited several cases, including DiQuinzio, in noting that no cause of action, either direct or for contribution, may be had against an entity or person made immune under § 28-29-20. Id. at 1374-76. We held that the trial justice had erred in creating an exception to the immunity granted to coemployees under § 28-29-20 and that, because the plaintiff had no right to sue the coemployee for the injuries he sustained, and for which he collected workers’ compensation benefits, the third-party tortfeasors similarly had no claim for contribution against the coemployee for those same injuries. Id. at 1374, 1376.', 'While Mello suggests that the rule may seem harsh in light of his injuries, in the past we have made no exception to the exclusivity provision for acts of coemployees that could be considered to be outside the scope of employment. See Diaz v. Darmet Corporation, 694 A.2d 736, 738 (R.I. 1997); see also Kong v. Kuncio, 754 A.2d 103, 103 (R.I. 2000) (mem.). In Diaz, the plaintiff was injured at work after being assaulted by the president of the company at which he was employed. Diaz, 694 A.2d at 737.

Thereafter, the plaintiff sued the president of the company in', '- 10 - Superior Court. Id. However, the Superior Court determined that the exclusivity provision barred this claim. Id. The plaintiff appealed, arguing that there was a willful-or-intentional-tort exception to the exclusivity provision. Id. This Court held that, “[o]n the basis of the statutory provisions and our prior case law interpreting those provisions,” the Superior Court was correct in determining that there is no intentional-tort exception to the exclusivity provision, and that “an employee waives his or her common-law remedy if the employee fails to properly notify the employer of his or her intention to rely on the common law.” Id. at 738 (quoting Lopes, 560 A.2d at 951).', 'Additionally, in Kong, the plaintiff suffered injuries after being hit by a car driven by a coemployee while in their employer’s parking lot after work. Kong, 754 A.2d at 103. The plaintiff received workers’ compensation benefits and then attempted to sue the coemployee and his wife for the same injuries. Id. We held that, by virtue of receiving workers’ compensation benefits and not having notified his employer of his intent to preserve his common-law rights, the plaintiff had waived any common-law right he may have had to sue either the coemployee or his wife because any “liability [was] based solely upon the negligence of the co-employee, who [was] entitled to immunity under § 28-29-20.” Id.', 'In support of his purported “scope of employment” exception, Mello cites D’Andrea v. Manpower, Inc. of Providence, 105 R.I. 108, 249 A.2d 896 (1969), in which we stated that an employee acts within the scope of his or her employment when “at the time and place of the injury [the employee] was reasonably fulfilling the duties of his employment or something incidental thereto.” D’Andrea, 105 R.I. at 108, 249 A.2d at 899.', 'However, D’Andrea is readily distinguishable from the instant case. There, we created an expansive definition of an employee’s scope of employment, which tended to favor the person seeking workers’ compensation benefits.', '- 11 - See id. Notably, D’Andrea did not involve an injury brought about by a coemployee, or the exclusivity provision, and we have never applied the D’Andrea standard for scope of employment in such cases. Id., at 109-10, 249 A.2d at 897-98; see Kong, 754 A.2d at 103; Diaz, 694 A.2d at 737. While Mello contends that we should apply that standard to third parties, his argument ignores the fact that neither the exclusivity provision nor § 28-35-58 provides for a “scope-of- employment” exception in the first place. Accordingly, we decline to extend the D’Andrea standard to create liability for coemployees where none existed before.', 'Finally, Mello advances public-policy arguments in favor of the application of a scope-of- employment exception to the exclusivity provision, citing to cases from other jurisdictions. We are well aware that other jurisdictions have created exceptions, “either by legislative enactment or judicial opinion,” to this strict rule granting immunity for tortious acts of coemployees. See Lopes, 560 A.2d at 950-51 (footnote omitted). Nevertheless, “in the absence of a legislatively created exception to § 28-29-20, we shall adhere to the principle that an employee waives his or her common-law remedy if the employee fails to properly notify the employer of his or her intention to rely on the common law.” Diaz, 694 A.2d at 738 (quoting Lopes, 560 A.2d at 951). To hold otherwise would be to essentially rewrite the exclusivity provision, a task this Court is not at liberty to perform. See State v. Calise, 478 A.2d 198, 201 (R.I. 1984) (holding that the Court has “neither the authority nor the competence to rewrite [a statutory] definition”).', 'There being no disputed issues of material fact left in this case, summary judgment was appropriately granted in favor of Killeavy on Mello’s negligence claim.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

On May 1, 2017, the defendant, Francisco Guerrero, petitioned this Court for the issuance of a writ of certiorari to allow him to appeal a December 1, 2015 judgment of conviction on criminal charges relating to an altercation that occurred in September of 2012. (A jury had found him guilty on June 29, 2015, and the trial justice thereafter denied his motion for a new trial.) On May 18, 2017, we granted the petition for a writ of certiorari.', 'Before this Court, defendant contends that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence and was otherwise clearly wrong in denying his motion for a new trial, asserting that the state did not meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not act in self-defense.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this case should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided at this time.', '1', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On the afternoon of September 1, 2012, there was an altercation between two taxi drivers, defendant and one Abdoylaye Diop, outside the Providence Amtrak station.1 Following the altercation, Mr. Diop was taken from the scene and admitted to Rhode Island Hospital for the treatment of injuries which he sustained during the altercation.', 'On July 11, 2013, the state filed a criminal information, charging Mr. Guerrero with: (1) assault with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a knife, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2; (2) assault and battery resulting in serious bodily injury, in violation of § 11-5-2; and (3) wearing or carrying concealed on his person a knife having a blade of more than three inches in length, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-42.', 'The defendant was tried before a jury in Providence County Superior Court on June 24, 25, 26, and 29, 2015. We relate below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial', '1. The Testimony of Abdoylaye Diop', 'Mr. Diop testified that, on September 1, 2012, in the course of his employment as a taxi driver, he went to the Amtrak station in order to pick up a fare. He stated that he parked his taxi in the line of taxis and then went to join two of his taxi driver friends who were sitting on a nearby cement wall. 1', 'Admitted into evidence at the trial was a surveillance tape from a video camera at the Amtrak station. (Although the camera was located at a considerable distance from the site of the fracas and the tape was grainy in quality, it does nonetheless constitute some evidence of what transpired.)', '2', 'Mr. Diop further testified that defendant, with whom Mr. Diop stated he had some familiarity, was also in the taxi line at the Amtrak station that day.2 Mr. Diop described defendant as being shorter and older than he. Mr. Diop stated that, on the day in question, after he had been sitting on the wall for “like, one to two minute[s],” defendant, who was standing beside his own taxi, pointed toward Mr. Diop and said: “You. Hey. Why are you looking at me?” Mr. Diop testified that the three men on the wall asked defendant to whom he was speaking and that defendant pointed at Mr. Diop and said: “You. You know who I’m talking to. You. Why are you looking at me? You know I don’t like you.” Mr. Diop testified that he responded to defendant: “Do you own my eyes? I can look wherever I want to look.” He testified that he then rose from the cement wall and that he and defendant walked toward each other while he repeatedly asked defendant: “Do you own my eyes?”', 'Mr. Diop further testified that, when the two men had closed the distance between them, he pushed defendant with both hands, employing sufficient force that defendant “moved a little bit.” Mr. Diop stated that, at some point during that altercation, defendant stabbed him in the stomach with a knife. Mr. Diop further testified that, after defendant had stabbed him in the stomach, defendant also stabbed him in his left leg. According to Mr. Diop, defendant stabbed him in the leg when he began kicking defendant’s hand in an attempt to get away from the knife that he realized defendant was wielding.', 'Mr. Diop proceeded to testify that another taxi driver, a man he identified as William, inserted himself between defendant and Mr. Diop, pointed out to Mr. Diop that he was bleeding 2', 'Mr. Diop testified that, a few days before September 1, 2012, he had intervened in an argument between defendant and another taxi driver after defendant acted in a way that did not conform to the protocol of the taxi line at the Amtrak station. Mr. Diop stated that, later that same day, he saw Mr. Guerrero in the bathroom of the Omni Hotel. According to Mr. Diop, they spoke about the taxi line protocol.', '3 from the stomach, and physically separated the two men. Mr. Diop testified that defendant then entered his taxi and drove away. Mr. Diop further testified that, after defendant drove away, he was in pain, bleeding from wounds in his stomach and his leg, and eventually losing consciousness. Mr. Diop stated that he called for emergency medical personnel, who arrived on the scene and took him to Rhode Island Hospital.', 'It was further Mr. Diop’s testimony that he underwent several surgical procedures as a result of the altercation. Mr. Diop stated that he has permanent scars as a result of the wounds which defendant inflicted upon him; and he even went so far as to display to the jury a surgical scar running down his abdomen during his testimony.', '2. The Testimony of Francisco Guerrero', 'The defendant testified3 that, prior to September 1, he had seen Mr. Diop in “different places where you would pick up people” because they had both been employed as taxi drivers in Providence for some time. The defendant further testified that, prior to the date of the altercation with Mr. Diop, he had been told by fellow taxi drivers Jose Lizardo, William Toribio, and Kenny Guzman, that Mr. Diop was “problematic.”', 'The defendant also testified that, on September 1, 2012, Mr. Diop came up to him, “almost running,” and defendant asked him: “Why are you looking at me like that?” The defendant further testified: “[Mr. Diop] pushed me right away. He started kicking me, and I was afraid for my life.” He also testified that, while running at him, Mr. Diop said: “I’m going to kill you. I’m going to kill you. I’m going to kill you.” He additionally testified as follows:', '“So he kicked me right here, and he kicked me right here in the ribs,', 'and he knocked my glasses off (indicating). I lost my breath, and I', 'couldn’t really see him anymore. 3', 'The defendant testified through an interpreter. He stated that he can speak some English (“the basics, not too many words”).', '4', '“* * *', '“I tried to take the knife out, and I lunged to him, and I hit right here', 'in the stomach, and he kept on kicking me.”', 'The defendant testified that he “tried to get away, but [Mr. Diop] cornered me in a way that he would keep on kicking me, and I couldn’t.” He thereafter testified that, during the altercation, Mr. Diop “had me surrounded, cornered, telling me that he was going to kill me.” The defendant added that, after a third man interrupted the scuffle, defendant entered his taxi and drove away. When asked on redirect examination why he had the knife in his possession, defendant testified as follows:', '“I’ve had that knife for about, almost eight years. I had it in my', 'backpack for when I was peeling an orange, and I forgot about it,', 'and I put it here in my backpack.”', '3. The Testimony of William Toribio and Jose Lizardo', 'William Toribio testified that, prior to September of 2012, he had told defendant to “watch out” for Mr. Diop “because Mr. Diop has had problems with other people * * *.” He also testified that, on September 1, 2012, he was in his taxi in the Amtrak station line, texting someone while waiting for a fare. He stated: “[W]hen I looked up, I saw Mr. Diop attacking Mr. Guerrero, and I also saw him kicking Mr. Guerrero.” Mr. Toribio further testified that he exited his vehicle and approached the two men, intending to intervene; he added that he heard Mr. Guerrero say, “Back up. Back up.” He further stated that he did not hear Mr. Diop say anything.', 'Jose Lizardo likewise testified that he was present that day and witnessed the altercation, but he stated that he could not understand what either man was saying.', '5', 'B', 'The Jury Verdict and the Subsequent Motion for a New Trial', 'On June 29, 2015, the parties having rested, the trial justice instructed the jury. Included among the instructions was one concerning self-defense. Neither party objected to the jury instructions. Later on the same day, the jury returned a guilty verdict as to all three counts.4', 'On August 31, 2015, a hearing was held on defendant’s previously filed motion for a new trial. The defendant contended that the jury’s verdict should be overturned because the state had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had not acted in self-defense. The defendant specifically requested that the trial justice, in his role as the metaphorical thirteenth juror, consider defendant’s arguments as to the use of excessive force and as to the duty to retreat.', 'After reviewing in detail his jury instructions as well as the conflicting witness testimony and the video evidence, the trial justice stated that he would have reached the same conclusion as the jury did; accordingly, he denied the motion for a new trial. Subsequently, on October 22, 2015, the trial justice sentenced defendant as follows: on Count Two, assault and battery resulting in serious bodily injury, ten years, with three years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation; and, on Count Three, possession of a knife with a blade of more than three inches, one year, to be served concurrently.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When addressing a motion for a new trial based upon the weight of the evidence, “the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses 4', 'Count One, assault with a dangerous weapon, was dismissed pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, after the jury rendered its verdict and before defendant was sentenced.', '6 and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Prout, 996 A.2d 641, 645 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). As we have frequently stated, the trial justice must then: “(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Silva, 84 A.3d 411, 416 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Espinal, 943 A.2d 1052, 1058 (R.I. 2008); State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 121 (R.I. 2006). After carrying out that analysis, if “the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, he or she should deny the motion for a new trial.” Prout, 996 A.2d at 645 (internal quotation marks omitted). However, if the trial justice disagrees with the jury’s verdict or does not believe that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, he must conduct a fourth step of analysis in order to determine “whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.” State v. Diaz, 159 A.3d 1053, 1061 (R.I. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).5', 'This Court accords the trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial great deference due to the fact that “a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Id. at 1062 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, “[a]bsent clear error and absent a determination by this Court that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case, we will defer to the trial justice’s ruling.” State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). In providing a record for this 5', 'As will be made clear infra, the trial justice in this case had no need to reach this fourth step in the analytical process.', '7 Court to review, a trial justice “need only cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the justice has applied the appropriate standards.” State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 30 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). The trial justice need not provide more than “a few sentences of [his or her] reasoning on each point.” State v. Muralles, 154 A.3d 925, 932 (R.I. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'The defendant contends on certiorari that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because, in defendant’s view, the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence when he agreed with the jury’s verdict.6 He argues “that the trial justice did not take into account that Mr. Guerrero had to appreciate that he knowingly had an opportunity to retreat in safety” and that, therefore, the verdict went against the weight of the evidence presented.', 'It is clear from our review of the record that the trial justice properly completed each of the necessary analytical steps. First, the trial justice considered the evidence in light of the jury charge; he discussed the lengthy instruction that he had given to the jury regarding self-defense, including his specific instruction to the jury that one may not use excessive force. He also noted that he had “indicated there is a duty to retreat * * *. And there is a test of the defendant’s state of mind, and it is in the consideration as to whether or not defendant’s actions were justified.” He concluded 6', 'It is our considered judgment that defendant’s contention on appeal that the trial justice did not properly consider the excessive force question has been waived. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n.19 (R.I. 2007); Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n.1 (R.I. 2002) (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”). Although defendant alludes to that issue in his briefing before this Court, he makes no meaningful argument with respect to the excessive force issue; instead, he limits himself to challenging the trial justice’s discussion of the duty to retreat. See State v. Mendez, 116 A.3d 228, 242 n.19 (R.I. 2015).', '8 this step of the analysis by noting that he had given an additional instruction as to the state’s burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant did not act in self-defense.', 'Proceeding to the second step in the analytical process, the trial justice independently evaluated the evidence and weighed the credibility of the witnesses. He explained that the video “was a little grainy, and it was sometimes from a distance, but it depicted the entire confrontation at the Providence Train Station that occurred on the date this offense happened.” The trial justice explained:', '“Mr. Guerrero stated * * * ‘I tried to get away, but he cornered me.’', 'That’s my note that I wrote in my trial notebook. The Court did not', 'see that on the video. I didn’t see any cornering.', '“Mr. Guerrero testified, I didn’t feel good. All he kept saying is,', 'I’m going to kill you, and I felt horrible.', '“Now, the Court has considered that, and that differs from Mr. Diop,', 'who was the victim, his version of the events.” Thereafter, the trial justice expressed his disbelief in defendant’s testimony regarding the threats which he alleged Mr. Diop had made, which conclusion, the trial justice stated, was reinforced by the fact that neither Mr. Toribio nor Mr. Lizardo had testified that they heard those statements or threats.', 'The trial justice also stated that, although Mr. Diop was the initial aggressor, defendant had a duty to retreat before acting in self-defense. In State v. Garrett, 91 A.3d 793 (R.I. 2014), this Court noted our well-established doctrine that, before an individual who perceives himself threatened by another may resort to using deadly force, he or she “must attempt to retreat if [he or she is] consciously aware of an open, safe and available avenue of escape.” Garrett, 91 A.3d at 801 (internal quotation marks omitted). In Garrett, this Court upheld the denial of a motion for a new trial because there existed a duty to retreat even when the defendant’s avenue of escape would', '9 have required her to walk over debris and proceed up a set of stairs—even though that avenue of escape involved turning her back to the aggressor. Id. at 804-05.', 'In the course of his ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice determined that defendant did not satisfy that duty to retreat before responding with deadly force (his knife). In our judgment, defendant’s challenge to the trial justice’s determination with respect to defendant’s duty to retreat is unavailing. In reaching his conclusion, the trial justice considered the avenues of retreat available to defendant and noted: “at a minimum, there was an opportunity to back up a few more steps, put some space between Diop and [defendant], and see if Diop advanced further.” The trial justice additionally stated:', '“[I]ndependently, looking at this evidence, the Court feels that, one,', 'the amount of force and the immediate nature of that force was', 'excessive, that there was an opportunity to retreat, and, at the very', 'minimum, there was an opportunity that retreat would have included', 'backing up a few more steps and would allow any observer to see if', 'Mr. Diop was going to continue his aggressions towards Mr.', 'Guerrero.”', 'Additionally, because defendant was familiar with the Amtrak station, having worked as a taxi driver there for some years, the jury was (and the trial justice was) entitled to draw the inference that he was aware of the available avenues of escape in that area. See State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1012 (R.I. 2005) (noting that the jury was entitled to draw an inference as to the defendant’s awareness of an avenue of escape).', 'On certiorari, defendant also emphasizes the short time span within which the scuffle occurred. Notably however, the trial justice expressly recognized “the speed with which this event was unfolding,” and noted that it “is not something that the Court takes lightly.” It is clear to us that the trial justice addressed all of the relevant evidentiary issues, and we perceive no reversible error in his ruling with respect to conducting the second step in the analytical process.', '10', 'Upon concluding the above analyses, the trial justice reached the third step in the analytical process and stated that he would have reached the same result as the jury did. See Silva, 84 A.3d at 416. We note that the trial justice’s conclusion that he would have reached the same result as the jury “is a significant consideration in this Court’s review of a denial of a motion for [a] new trial * * *.” Id. at 418. Because the trial justice would have reached the same conclusion as the jury, he properly concluded his analysis at that point and denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. See Prout, 996 A.2d at 645; Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1028.', 'Accordingly, after a thorough review of the record in this case, it is our judgment that the defendant has failed to demonstrate that the trial justice clearly erred or overlooked or misconceived relevant or material evidence in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial. See State v. Yon, 161 A.3d 1118, 1130 (R.I. 2017). We are satisfied that the trial justice more than adequately performed his role under each step of the analysis of the defendant’s motion for a new trial. We therefore affirm the Superior Court’s denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

This case originates with the tragic death of four- year-old Nicholas Gear, who drowned in a swimming pool owned by his grandmother, Laura Gear (Gear), on May 27, 2012. His parents, the plaintiffs Raymond Oliver and Tiffany Gear (plaintiffs), appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant, NAMCO, LLC (NAMCO or defendant), the company that sold the swimming pool to Gear. On appeal, the plaintiffs argue that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether: (1) NAMCO negligently failed to warn Gear about the safety features of the pool ladder and its locking mechanism; (2) Gear considered the installer to be NAMCO’s agent; and (3) NAMCO negligently failed to properly vet and supervise the installers listed on a document given to purchasers of pools. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel1', 'On March 19, 2012, Gear purchased an above-ground swimming pool and accompanying “‘Slide & Lock’ A-Frame Pool Ladder” from a NAMCO store in Seekonk, Massachusetts.

While she was at the store on that date, Gear inquired as to how to have the pool installed at the property where she resided in Portsmouth, Rhode Island.

At her deposition, Andrea Caouette, district manager at NAMCO, testified that the list is assembled at NAMCO’s corporate headquarters by the “Installation Manager.” However, she could not speak to NAMCO’s process for creating the list. John Dominique, co-owner of the pool installer Lot-2 Enterprises, testified that he went to the Seekonk store in 2008 or 2009 to inquire about being placed on the list, and that he gave his name and his company name to an employee at the store. John Dominique further testified that he did not fill out an application; but, five to six months later, he received a call telling him that he would be placed at the bottom of the list. John Dominique had attempted to be placed on the list while working for another company prior to this date, but was unsuccessful. 3', 'In the complaint, plaintiffs allege that Lot-2 is co-owned by Mary Dominique and her husband, John Dominique.

Additionally, Lot-2 sent Gear a contract for the pool installation in the mail, which was signed on the day of installation.', 'On May 21, 2012, Lot-2 installed the pool. John Dominique, owner and primary contractor of Lot-2, testified at his deposition that he did not ask Gear to see a building permit prior to the pool installation, but “thought [he] saw [a permit] in the window” of the house. As to the installation process, Gear testified at her deposition that the installers dug an area for the pool, set the pool in the ground, began filling the pool with water, and then instructed Gear to “check [the water] and shut it off at night.” Gear testified that she understood that the company installed only the pool itself, and not the ladder or the fencing surrounding the pool. A valid permit to install the pool was never obtained by the installer, Seddon, or Gear. The following day, a friend of Gear’s assembled the ladder. Both the swimming pool and the safety ladder were packaged with instructions from the manufacturer.', 'On May 27, 2012, Nicholas was left in Gear’s care.

Furthermore, NAMCO asserted, plaintiffs could not prove that its actions were the proximate cause of Nicholas’s death. The plaintiffs filed an objection to NAMCO’s motion, arguing that a question of fact existed as to whether Lot-2 acted with apparent or inherent agency authority on behalf of NAMCO.6 Moreover, plaintiffs contended that NAMCO had “failed in its duty to warn Gear of the dangers of not utilizing the sliding safety lock mechanism and safety padlock system” of the ladder.', 'A hearing on defendants’ motions for summary judgment was held on February 1, 2016. At the hearing, plaintiffs additionally argued that “NAMCO did nothing to vet Lot 2 Enterprises[,]” and further that “NAMCO owns the list that was given and Lot 2 was on the list.” The hearing justice commented that plaintiffs were “skating on thin ice when this comes to NAMCO.” At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing justice denied the motions for summary judgment as they related to the four other defendants. The hearing justice stated that he was “really close to granting summary judgment for NAMCO,” but he reserved judgment on the motion until a later date. On June 6, 2016, while hearing arguments on unrelated motions, the hearing justice revisited NAMCO’s motion for summary judgment.

Additionally, as discussed supra, a factual issue remains in dispute with respect to the relationship between NAMCO and the installers on the list, and whether Gear could have reasonably believed that an agency relationship existed.

Before us are former spouses who disagree about the ex-husband’s entitlement to visitation with the two dogs that they acquired during their marriage. This case came before us pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In October 2016, after twenty-three years of marriage, the plaintiff, Diane Giarrusso, and the defendant, Paul Giarrusso, entered into a Marital Settlement Agreement (MSA), formalizing the terms of the dissolution of their marriage.1 A final judgment officially dissolving the marriage entered in January 2017; the judgment incorporated the MSA without merging it. Paragraph fourth of the MSA gave Diane “all right title and interest in and to [the two dogs:] the greyhound ‘Marox’ 1', 'We shall refer to the parties by their first names to avoid any confusion; no disrespect is intended.', '-1- and the Chihuahua ‘Winnie.’ [Paul] [was] permitted to take the dogs for visits from Tuesday morning at 8 a.m. through Thursday morning at 8:00 a.m.”2', 'Paul enjoyed his weekly visitation with Marox and Winnie from October 2016 until the end of March 2017, when this simple arrangement went awry and Diane unilaterally ceased allowing the weekly visits. In May 2017, Paul filed a motion for post-final judgment relief, claiming that Diane had denied his visitation time with the dogs for several weeks. Paul requested that the Family Court enforce the MSA by ordering Diane to comply with the visitation schedule, provide makeup visits for the weeks denied to him, and award him attorney’s fees for his pursuit of the court-enforcement order. Diane objected to Paul’s motion and, in July 2017, filed her own motion for relief. Diane claimed that Paul had not properly cared for the dogs when they were with him and had attempted to keep the dogs away from her, thereby breaching the MSA. Diane sought to enjoin and restrain Paul from having any time with the dogs.', 'A justice of the Family Court held a hearing on December 4, 2017; Paul and Diane testified, and the hearing justice reviewed text messages and emails exchanged between the parties as well as veterinary bills and records. Diane testified that Paul had not taken proper care of the dogs since the couple’s separation and that his failure to properly care for the dogs constituted a breach of the MSA. She testified that Marox returned from one visit with one of his claws damaged, hanging and bleeding. Marox returned from another visit with a “huge bubble on his lip.” Diane took 2', 'The final judgment of divorce added that Diane and Paul', '“agreed that should [Diane] move outside of the state of Rhode', 'Island where it would no longer be feasible for [Paul] to have weekly', 'visitation with the dogs as scheduled in the Marital Settlement', 'Agreement, [Paul] would then have the dogs for three months during', 'the summer, a week around Christmas, a week in February and a', 'week in April, said weeks to be agreed by the parties.”', '-2- Marox to the vet both times. According to Paul, the MSA gave Diane complete control over the care of the dogs, such that he could not take them to the vet or make any decisions about their care. He testified that all he could do was play with them. He also testified that he heard about the damaged claw for the first time while in court and that the bubble on Marox’s lip had appeared while he was away for a two-week work-related trip.', 'According to Diane, the final straw for her occurred on March 29, 2017, the last day she allowed Paul his visitation with Marox and Winnie. That afternoon, Paul had contacted Diane because the dogs were acting strangely and Winnie was whimpering. Paul testified that he knew something was wrong with Winnie because he “let out a cry” when Paul picked him up to put him on Paul’s bed.3 Paul called Diane and held the phone close to Winnie so Diane could hear the tone of the whimper. The erstwhile spouses argued through text messages about whether Diane would pick up only Winnie to take him to the vet or whether she would pick up both dogs because, according to Diane, the dogs became anxious when they were separated. Diane and Paul eventually agreed that Diane would pick up both dogs so she could take Winnie to the vet.', 'When Diane arrived at Paul’s house, however, Marox was missing. Paul testified that he had let the dogs out to relieve themselves and he thought both dogs had returned inside the house, but then he could not find Marox.4 Diane testified that Marox’s disappearance was posted on Facebook and that she, friends, and neighbors spent an hour and a half looking for the greyhound. Paul testified that his sister helped in the search as well. Diane testified that she “was so upset and hysterical” during the search effort that she “was puking on the side of the road.” Eventually, Paul found Marox, who had apparently been in his house the entire time, stuck in a closet. Paul had 3', 'Paul further explained: “[B]ecause, naturally, the dogs sleep in my bed.” 4', 'Paul also testified that his yard was not fenced but that the dogs did not go far before relieving themselves and returning inside for a treat.', '-3- been tipped off by Winnie, who was sitting outside the closed closet door. According to Diane, when she saw Marox, the dog was in Paul’s arms, “violently shaking, like it was traumatized.” Diane testified that she “was already hysterical at that point[,] [but] then [she] went right over the top, screaming and yelling and swearing at the top of [her] lungs.”5', 'Paul also testified that he was emotional on March 29, crying over Marox’s disappearance both before Diane arrived and throughout the search for Marox. He stated that he had not tried to trick Diane by hiding Marox in a closet and then claiming Marox had run off, and that he had been genuinely confused because, after he had spoken with Diane on the phone, he had let the dogs out to relieve themselves and thought that both dogs had come back inside. He testified that he had tried to see the dogs in the weeks following March 29, but Diane had not responded to his communications. During his testimony, Paul’s distress about the litigation over the dogs was palpable.', 'At the end of the hearing, Diane argued that the hearing justice should withdraw the court’s approval of the MSA because, in light of the incidents described during the testimony, the MSA provision allowing Paul weekly visitation was inequitable. For his part, Paul argued that Diane had breached the terms of the MSA, which she had effectively admitted when she stated that she had not allowed him to see the dogs since March 29.', 'The hearing justice stated her findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record, all of which were memorialized in an order entered on January 12, 2018.6 The hearing justice found that 5', 'Diane also complained that Paul’s driveway was icy and not safe for dropping off the dogs or picking them up, especially because he lived on a busy road, where a prior dog of theirs had been hit by a car. 6', 'There was also an order entered on December 28, 2017, to which Diane objected as “not completely set[ting] forth the full findings of the [c]ourt” from the December 4 hearing.

The hearing justice also found that both Paul and Diane loved the dogs and wanted to care for them and that Paul always acted in good faith with respect to the dogs. The hearing justice ordered that Paul “has the dogs Tuesdays through Thursdays as provided in [the MSA]” and awarded attorney’s fees to Paul in the amount of $5,248.70.

Diane also argues that the hearing justice was clearly wrong when she concluded that there was no inequity in enforcing the MSA as written because, according to Diane, the evidence showed that the dogs returned to her injured on at least two occasions, proving that Paul failed to properly care for the dogs and to provide safe conditions for them. Diane contends that, because the dogs are chattel, Paul had an obligation to return the dogs to her in an undamaged condition. Because he did not meet this obligation, she asserts, allowing Paul to have the dogs two days a week is inequitable.', 'Diane further argues that, pursuant to Gorman v. Gorman, 883 A.2d 732 (R.I. 2005), the hearing justice should have withdrawn the court’s approval of the MSA and reformed the MSA.8 Paul briefly responds that the hearing justice did not either overlook or misconceive any of the testimony she heard or evidence she reviewed.', 'We begin our analysis by quickly dispensing with Diane’s argument that the hearing justice erred by not reforming the MSA. “It is well settled that a property settlement agreement that has been ‘incorporated by reference, but not merged into the final divorce decree, retains the characteristics of a contract.’” Esposito v. Esposito, 38 A.3d 1, 5 (R.I. 2012) (brackets omitted) (quoting Zaino v. Zaino, 818 A.2d 630, 637 (R.I. 2003)). “We also have held that ‘for a contract to be subject to judicial reformation, the court must first find a mutual mistake.’” Id. (brackets 8', 'At the end of her prebriefing statement, Diane also briefly mentions that the hearing justice erred by awarding attorney’s fees to Paul. This argument is waived for two reasons. First, Diane affirmatively agreed at the hearing that the fees and costs awarded in the amount of $5,248.70 were reasonable and she did not object to the court’s order memorializing both the award and her consent thereto. Diane, therefore, failed to preserve this issue for our review. See Pineda v. Chase Bank USA, N.A., 186 A.3d 1054, 1060 (R.I. 2018). If she had properly preserved this issue, however, she waived our review by “simply stating [the] issue [in her prebriefing statement] without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing * * *.” See Terzian v. Lombardi, 180 A.3d 555, 558 (R.I. 2018) (brackets omitted) (quoting Horton v.

Dufault, 958 A.2d 620, 624 (R.I. 2008)). “When a mutual mistake is manifest in the agreement at the time it is entered into, the agreement fails in a material respect correctly to reflect the understanding of both parties.” Id. (quoting Dufault, 958 A.2d at 624). In the case at bar, the hearing justice appropriately treated the MSA as a contract and the dogs as personal property. She explicitly found that Diane understood the contract and concluded there was no mistake in the contract. Both parties testified that, at the time they entered into the MSA, they intended for Diane to have all rights to the dogs, with weekly visitation for Paul. There is, therefore, no mutual mistake in the MSA’s visitation term and no indication that the hearing justice misconceived the evidence when she concluded that the MSA need not be reformed. See Bober, 92 A.3d at 157; Gorman, 883 A.2d at 740-41.', 'With respect to Diane’s arguments that the MSA is inequitable and that Paul has acted in bad faith, we have previously recognized the Family Court’s important role in monitoring property settlement agreements between spouses and ensuring an equitable division of assets.

The plaintiff, Family Dollar Stores of Rhode Island, Inc. (Family Dollar), appeals from a September 20, 2016 judgment entered in Providence County Superior Court in favor of the defendants, Justin B. Araujo and the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (the Commission), following an August 16, 2016 bench decision dismissing Family Dollar’s case without prejudice. Family Dollar argues on appeal that the hearing justice erred in dismissing its case because, as it contends, “the dispute involved declaratory relief related to the enforcement of a contract” and that, therefore, “the Superior Court was the correct forum for the dispute.”', 'Both defendants cross-appeal from a November 9, 2016 order granting Family Dollar’s emergency motion for a thirty-day extension of time within which to file its notice of appeal. The defendants contend on appeal that “the Superior Court erred in granting Family Dollar’s motion for extension of time” for the following reasons: (1) “Family Dollar did not make the', '-1- requisite showing of excusable neglect;” and (2) “the equities did not favor granting Family Dollar’s motion for extension because Family Dollar would not suffer prejudice by a denial of [that motion].”', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that these appeals may be decided at this time.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the September 20, 2016 judgment of the Superior Court. With respect to the cross-appeal, we affirm the November 9, 2016 order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The sequence of events which forms the basis of this action is not in dispute to any significant degree. In setting forth those events, we rely on the August 16, 2016 and November 9, 2016 bench decisions of the hearing justice and other documents contained in the record before this Court.', 'According to Family Dollar’s complaint, it hired Mr. Araujo on or about June 12, 2007 as a Customer Service Representative/Clerk. Family Dollar states in its memorandum submitted pursuant to Article I, Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure that Mr. Araujo was employed with Family Dollar until February 12, 2014. On September 23, 2014, Mr. Araujo and Family Dollar entered into a settlement agreement to resolve a workers’', '-2- compensation claim that had been filed by Mr. Araujo. That settlement agreement included the following very pertinent release language:', '“This release waives any other claims I could make against my', 'employer, its agents, assigns, or successors, including, but not', 'limited to, claims under the Americans with Disabilities Act,', 'claims with the Rhode Island Governor’s Commission on the', 'Handicapped, Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, Equal', 'Employment Opportunity Commission, FETA, United States', 'Department of Labor, United States Department of Justice,', 'Workers’ Compensation Court, or any other agencies, tribunals,', 'commissions, or courts.” As consideration for executing the settlement agreement, which includes the just-quoted release, Family Dollar paid Mr. Araujo the sum of twenty thousand dollars.', 'On November 28, 2014, Mr. Araujo filed a charge of discrimination with the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights and the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in which he alleged that Family Dollar discriminated against him on the basis of a disability. (The defendants acknowledge that the focus or gravamen of that charge of discrimination was unrelated to the injury that was the subject of Mr. Araujo’s workers’ compensation claim that Mr. Araujo and Family Dollar settled, as described above.) That charge alleged that the final discriminatory act occurred on February 12, 2014—i.e., before Mr. Araujo signed the above-quoted release. On July 31, 2015, the Commission issued a finding of probable cause that Family Dollar and its district manager had engaged in disability discrimination in violation of the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act and the Civil Rights of People with Disabilities Act.', 'In accordance with G.L. 1956 § 28-5-24.1(c), Family Dollar was then afforded the option of having the matter adjudicated in Superior Court, but it declined to pursue that course of action.', '-3- Subsequently, on December 30, 2015, the Commission issued a complaint, and a hearing was scheduled. That hearing was later continued.', 'On March 10, 2016, Family Dollar filed its complaint seeking a declaratory judgment to the effect that the parties had entered into a valid and enforceable settlement agreement releasing Family Dollar from the claims that Mr. Araujo asserted against it in his charge before the Commission and also alleging breach of contract. On April 15, 2016, Mr. Araujo filed a motion to dismiss the declaratory judgment and breach of contract action in Superior Court pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Thereafter, on April 22, 2016, the Commission moved to intervene in the case pursuant to Rule 24 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. That motion was ultimately granted, and the Commission was added as an additional party to the case. On May 26, 2016, the Commission also filed a motion to dismiss the case. As the hearing justice so succinctly put it, defendants contended in their motions to dismiss that it would be “improper for the Court to exercise * * * jurisdiction in this case while the underlying matter at the center of the dispute is pending before the Commission;” indeed, the hearing justice stated that defendants were contending that “Family Dollar declined to have the matter adjudicated in the Superior Court * * * [and] must now exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking relief in court.” On July 12, 2016, a hearing was held on those motions to dismiss.', 'Subsequent to that July 12, 2016 hearing, the hearing justice issued a bench decision on August 16, 2016.', 'In that decision, he noted that the release contained in the settlement agreement between Family Dollar and Mr. Araujo could be asserted as a defense before the Commission and that the Commission had “looked at similar releases in many, many cases * * *.” He then pointed to the fact that, once the Commission had passed upon the validity', '-4- vel non of the release, Family Dollar would have a right to an appeal to the Superior Court. In holding that “the proper forum for determining the validity of the release [was] before the Commission,” the hearing justice cited to the potential for inconsistent results from different tribunals, and he added that “Family Dollar must exhaust all administrative remedies before proceeding to [the Superior Court].”', 'The hearing justice further noted that Family Dollar could have had the matter removed from the Commission to the Superior Court pursuant to § 28-5-24.1(c), but it did not do so. Finally, he opined as follows:', '“Our general tendency, like that of most American courts, has been', 'to require [parties] to stay on the dispute resolution path for which', 'they originally opted until they reach the end of that path. In this', 'case this matter has progressed to the point where there was to be a', 'hearing on this matter. Given that the parties are this far along in', 'the process before the Commission, it is appropriate to require the', 'parties to complete that process.” The hearing justice then granted, without prejudice, defendants’ motions to dismiss.', 'That decision was reflected in an order entered on September 20, 2016. A judgment also entered on that same day, entering judgment in favor of defendants and against Family Dollar on all counts of its complaint. It is from that judgment that Family Dollar is appealing.', 'We next turn our attention to the facts forming the basis of the cross-appeal. Those pertinent facts relate to events occurring after the August 16, 2016 bench decision of the hearing justice. At some point following that bench decision, but prior to September 7, 2016, copies of the order and the judgment reflecting the decision to dismiss Family Dollar’s case, both of which were ultimately entered on September 20, 2016, were filed with the court for the hearing justice’s review and signature.', 'According to the representations made by Family Dollar’s counsel before the Superior Court and before this Court, on September 7, 2016, Family Dollar’s', '-5- counsel called the court to inquire whether the order and the judgment had been signed by the hearing justice and entered in the docket, and he was told that they were still pending. (Knowing the date of entry of the judgment and order in this case was of special pertinence to Family Dollar because the entry of a final order or judgment triggers the twenty-day period within which a party must file its notice of appeal as provided for in Article I, Rule 4(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure.) Family Dollar’s counsel represented, in an affidavit provided to the Superior Court with his eventual motion for an extension of time to file the notice of appeal, that he had contacted the clerk’s office on one other occasion in either late September or early October, but that he could not recall the exact date. He further represented to the Superior Court that he then sent an email message to the hearing justice’s clerk on October 19, 2016 for the same purpose. It was his representation that he subsequently emailed the hearing justice’s clerk again on October 31, 2016 and that that was the first time he was informed that the order and judgment had entered on September 20, 2016. At that point, Family Dollar had missed the twenty-day period in which to appeal the judgment of the Superior Court to this Court.', 'For that reason, on November 3, 2016, Family Dollar filed an emergency motion for a thirty-day extension of the time within which to file its notice of appeal pursuant to Rule 4(a). A hearing was held on that motion on November 9, 2016.', 'During that hearing, counsel for Family Dollar argued that his failure to file a notice of appeal on behalf of Family Dollar within the prescribed twenty-day period was the result of excusable neglect due to the fact that he did not know that the judgment he intended to appeal from had been entered on September 20, 2016. He represented that he had received numerous notifications through the Superior Court’s electronic filing system in the course of the case but that he had received no such notification when the order and the judgment entered.', 'He', '-6- acknowledged that he had eventually come to understand that, “if the Court files something and it’s submitted and accepted, I don’t get a * * * notification * * *.” However, he also noted that this was his first appeal under the new electronic filing system and that his lack of familiarity was not with the rules, but rather with the new electronic filing system.', 'At the close of the November 9, 2016 hearing, the hearing justice issued a bench decision in which he began by noting that the standard that it was his duty to apply was that of excusable neglect. He then candidly stated that he himself was “not totally familiar and comfortable with the way our electronic filing system deals with the orders and judgments.” He went on to expressly state that, in his opinion, Family Dollar’s failure to file a timely notice of appeal was due to “a lack of understanding of the process as distinct from a lack of understanding of the rules[.]” The hearing justice further noted that counsel for Family Dollar had contacted his chambers to inquire about the order and the judgment. He additionally stated that this was a case of excusable neglect and that he could excuse counsel “once and once only.” He consequently granted Family Dollar’s motion filed pursuant to Rule 4(a) for a thirty-day extension of the time within which to file its notice of appeal. An order entered the same day granting Family Dollar’s motion and providing that Family Dollar had until the end of that day to file its notice of appeal with respect to the September 20, 2016 judgment of the Superior Court. Family Dollar then proceeded to file its notice of appeal on the same day—November 9, 2016.', 'The defendants then filed a timely notice of appeal from the November 9, 2016 order granting Family Dollar’s emergency motion for an extension of time to file its notice of appeal.', 'Having summarized the travel of this case thus far, we would reiterate for the sake of clarity that Family Dollar is appealing from the September 20, 2016 judgment in defendants’ favor on the underlying issue of whether or not the case should have been dismissed. The', '-7- defendants are cross-appealing from the November 9, 2016 order granting Family Dollar’s emergency motion for an extension of the time within which to file its notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The Defendants’ Cross-Appeal—Excusable Neglect', 'Due to the fact that the cross-appeal raises a threshold issue as to whether or not Family Dollar filed a timely notice of appeal, we will begin our analysis by addressing the cross-appeal.', '1.

Discussion', 'On appeal, defendants contend that “Family Dollar’s lack of knowledge of the Superior', 'Court’s rules and process relative to the entry and notice of Orders and Judgments cannot', 'constitute excusable neglect as a matter of law.” They point out that this Court has stated that', 'ignorance of court rules and court procedures is not a defense. They further aver that, pursuant', 'to Rule 77(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, Family Dollar should have known', 'of its responsibility “to routinely check the docket for a notation of Order and Judgment', 'entering.” It is their contention that “Family Dollar’s acts or omissions are outside the course of', '-8- conduct a reasonably prudent person would have taken under similar circumstances * * *.” Finally, they posit that the “equities did not favor granting Family Dollar’s motion for extension because Family Dollar would not suffer prejudice by a denial of the same,” especially given the fact that its Superior Court action was dismissed without prejudice.', 'Pursuant to Article I, Rule 4(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, a notice of appeal must be filed within twenty days of “the date of the entry of the judgment, order, or decree appealed from * * *.” We have likewise stated that “the twenty-day appeal time commence[s] to run from the first day following the day when the first valid appealable order was entered.” Blais v. Beacon Mutual Insurance Co., 812 A.2d 838, 839 (R.I. 2002) (mem.) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). It is clear in this case that the judgment from which Family Dollar is appealing was entered on September 20, 2016. It is undisputed that Family Dollar did not file its notice of appeal within the prescribed twenty-day window. However, Rule 4(a) also provides that a trial court may extend the time for filing a notice of appeal for a period of up to thirty days “[u]pon a showing of excusable neglect[.]” See Boranian, 983 A.2d at 838 (“Relief from a counsel’s failure to comply with procedural requirements will not be granted unless it is first factually established that his [or her] neglect was occasioned by some extenuating circumstance of sufficient significance to render it excusable.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). As such, with respect to the cross-appeal in this case, we are tasked with reviewing, under the abuse of discretion standard, the hearing justice’s ruling that Family Dollar’s failure to file its notice of appeal within the twenty-day window was due to excusable neglect.', 'This Court has defined “excusable neglect” as follows:', '“[a] failure to take the proper steps at the proper time, not in', 'consequence of the party’s own carelessness, inattention, or willful', '-9-', 'disregard of the process of the court, but in consequence of some', 'unexpected or unavoidable hindrance or accident, or reliance on', 'the care and vigilance of his counsel or on promises made by the', 'adverse party.” Duffy v. Estate of Scire, 111 A.3d 358, 366 (R.I.', '2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have further opined that “[e]xcusable neglect that would qualify for relief from judgment is generally that course of conduct that a reasonably prudent person would have taken under similar circumstances.” Boranian, 983 A.2d at 839 (internal quotation marks omitted). What is more, “[e]xcusable neglect should be interpreted flexibly, because [t]he determination of excusable neglect is at bottom an equitable one, taking account of all relevant circumstances * * *.” Duffy, 111 A.3d at 366 (internal quotation marks omitted). Some of those circumstances include: “the length of delay and its potential impact on judicial proceedings, the reason for the delay, including whether it was within the reasonable control of the movant, and whether the movant acted in good faith.” Boranian, 983 A.2d at 839 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also UAG West Bay AM, LLC, 987 A.2d at 880.', 'Turning to the facts of the instant case, after a thorough review of the record and consideration of the parties’ contentions on appeal, we are not inclined to second-guess the hearing justice with respect to his conclusion that it appears that the underlying cause of the delay was counsel’s lack of familiarity with the electronic filing system and not with the rules. Accordingly, under the circumstances of the instant case and bearing in mind that the electronic filing system was of recent vintage at the time in question,1 we cannot say that the hearing justice abused his discretion in holding that the delay in filing the notice of appeal was the result of excusable neglect. 1', 'The amendments to the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure which provided for the implementation of the electronic filing system as to civil cases took effect on November 5, 2014.

Such notation is sufficient notice for all purposes for which notice of the entry of an order is required by these rules * * *.” Pursuant to that rule, the judgment at issue in this case was entered into the docket on the electronic filing system on September 20, 2016; no additional notice was provided (electronically or otherwise) to the parties of that entry. However, Family Dollar’s counsel represented that he had received thirty-eight notifications in this case alone from the Superior Court’s relatively new electronic filing system and that, accordingly, he had relied on that course of conduct as the basis for his belief that the electronic filing system would similarly notify him when the judgment and the order entered. As such, the record reflects that the delay in filing the notice of appeal in this case was caused by a lack of understanding of what notice is and is not provided under the electronic filing system, not a lack of understanding of the court rules.', 'The defendants point out that the thirty-eight notifications from the electronic filing system that were received by Family Dollar’s counsel were notifications of filings by the parties and were not notice of the entry of any order, judgment, or decree of the court. However, even given that fact, we remain of the opinion that the expectation of Family Dollar’s counsel that he would receive notification from the electronic filing system of the entry of the judgment at issue was understandable under the circumstances. The electronic filing system had only recently been implemented in the Superior Court during the time period at issue in this case; indeed, even the hearing justice frankly admitted that he was “not totally familiar and comfortable with the way our electronic filing system deals with the orders and judgments.” In our opinion, in the circumstances of this case, a reasonably prudent person could have likewise relied on receiving', '- 11 - notice from the electronic filing system of the entry of the judgment in the case. See Boranian, 983 A.2d at 839.', 'What is more, we note that Family Dollar’s counsel represented that he made an effort to contact the court at least twice to inquire about the status of the order and the judgment. He did not behave in a careless or inattentive manner; nor did he willfully disregard the process of the court. See Duffy, 111 A.3d at 366. For that reason, it is evident to this Court that Family Dollar’s counsel acted in good faith. See Boranian, 983 A.2d at 839.

Araujo * * * preclude[d] him from proceeding with the Charge of Discrimination * * * currently pending before the [Commission].”3 Family Dollar contends that it was not required to exhaust administrative remedies because “the question before the Superior Court was a pure question of law, which should be decided by the courts.” It notes that Family Dollar’s “right[s] under the Release are separate and distinct from the statutory rights the Commission is empowered to enforce.”', 'After a thorough review of the record in this case and after careful consideration of the parties’ arguments, we conclude that the hearing justice erred in dismissing Family Dollar’s action under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9.', 'We have indicated that “[a] release is a contractual agreement, and the various principles of the law of contracts govern the judicial approach to a controversy concerning the meaning of a particular release.” Young v. Warwick Rollermagic Skating Center, Inc., 973 A.2d 553, 558 (R.I. 2009). Moreover, we have specifically stated that “[c]ontract interpretation is a question of law; 3', 'In view of the fact that Family Dollar’s appellate argument focuses solely on the dismissal of its declaratory judgment count and in view of the fact that the breach of contract count was dismissed without prejudice (as was the declaratory judgment count), we need not and shall not pass upon the hearing justice’s dismissal without prejudice of the breach of contract claim.', '- 14 - it is only when the contract terms are ambiguous that construction of terms becomes a question of fact.” Dubis v. East Greenwich Fire District, 754 A.2d 98, 100 (R.I. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In deciding whether or not to issue a declaratory judgment with respect to whether the release at issue serves as a bar to Mr. Araujo’s recovery in this case, the Superior Court was originally and will be hereafter presented with the very limited task of interpreting a contract between the parties. To reiterate, the only issue in the case before the Superior Court with respect to the declaratory judgment count was the validity and effectiveness of the release contained in the settlement agreement between Family Dollar and Mr. Araujo—an issue well within the Superior Court’s jurisdiction and competence and one with which the justices of the Superior Court must deal frequently.4 What is more, a declaratory judgment action is a statutory remedy available to Family Dollar which is quite separate and distinct from the proceedings before the Commission. See G.L. 1956 chapter 30 of title 9. Indeed, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act clearly allows the holder of a release document such as the one at issue in this case to seek from the Superior Court a declaration as to the validity and enforceability of the release. See § 9-30-2. Prompt and definitive resolution of release-related issues is one of the many salutary efficiencies made possible by the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. Accordingly, it is entirely clear to this Court that Family Dollar’s complaint with respect to the validity and enforceability of the release may proceed in Superior Court.', 'This Court’s jurisprudence with respect to the election of remedies doctrine similarly leads us to conclude that the hearing justice erred in the instant case. As we have previously 4', 'We need not pass upon whether or not, in the circumstances of this case, the Commission has authority to pass upon the validity and effectiveness of the release. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n.4 (R.I. 2009) (noting “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”).', '- 15 - stated, “[t]he doctrine of election of remedies is one that is grounded in equity and is designed to mitigate unfairness to both parties by preventing double redress for a single wrong.” Weeks v. 735 Putnam Pike Operations, LLC, 85 A.3d 1147, 1154 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State Department of Environmental Management v. State Labor Relations Board, 799 A.2d 274, 278 (R.I. 2002). The doctrine applies only in cases where “the parties have two or more inconsistent remedies” and where “asserting one necessarily negates or repudiates the other.” Silva v. Silva, 122 R.I. 178, 184, 404 A.2d 829, 832 (1979); see also Coderre v. Zoning Board of Review of City of Pawtucket, 105 R.I. 266, 274, 251 A.2d 397, 402 (1969). There is of course “no bar to the use of concurrent and consistent remedies.” Silva, 122 R.I. at 184, 404 A.2d at 832; see also Coderre, 105 R.I. at 274, 251 A.2d at 402.', 'In applying that precedent to the instant case, we do not hesitate to conclude that there is no viable election of remedies issue in this case. In the judgment of this Court, and contrary to the assertion of defendants, it matters not that Family Dollar opted not to have the case removed to Superior Court pursuant to § 28-5-24.1(c) because we are confronted with the plain blunt fact that Family Dollar did not commence this litigation before the Commission and thus did not affirmatively elect any remedy. See, e.g., Rhode Island Employment Security Alliance, Local 401, S.E.I.U., AFL-CIO v. State Department of Employment and Training, 788 A.2d 465, 468 (R.I. 2002) (stating that the plaintiffs, “having elected their remedies, are now barred from pursuing the matter in court until the remedy they initiated has been exhausted”) (emphasis added); Cipolla v. Rhode Island College, Board of Governors for Higher Education, 742 A.2d 277, 282 (R.I. 1999) (stating that “[o]nce the plaintiff entered the grievance procedure, he had selected the remedy to adjudicate his claim, and he should have pursued that remedy to its conclusion”) (emphasis added). Consequently, Family Dollar is entitled to have the question of', '- 16 - the validity and enforceability of the contractual settlement agreement passed upon by the courts at this juncture. It is our opinion that the election of remedies doctrine is inapplicable to the case before us.', 'Additionally, we do not believe that the doctrine of the exhaustion of administrative remedies is applicable to this case since we are not confronted with a situation where Family Dollar is aggrieved by a decision of an agency and must exhaust all avenues of review within that agency before proceeding to court; rather, this is a purely contractual issue. See Almeida v. Plasters’ and Cement Masons’ Local 40 Pension Fund, 722 A.2d 257, 259 (R.I. 1998) (“The general rule is that a plaintiff first must exhaust his administrative remedies before seeking judicial review of an administrative decision.”). The validity and applicability of the release is a legal question, unquestionably within the jurisdiction and purview of the Superior Court. See Burns v. Sundlun, 617 A.2d 114, 117 (R.I. 1992) (noting, in holding that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies did not apply in that case, that the question was a “pure question of law”). As such, in our judgment, the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is inapplicable to the instant case.', 'In conclusion, we hold that the hearing justice erred in dismissing Family Dollar’s declaratory judgment action. It certainly has not been established beyond a reasonable doubt that Family Dollar would not be entitled to relief under any set of conceivable facts on either its declaratory judgment or breach of contract claims. See Chase, 160 A.3d at 973. What is more, it is certainly clear that defendants have not borne their burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the declaration requested in the declaratory judgment count in the complaint is an impossibility. See Tucker Estates Charlestown, LLC, 964 A.2d at 1140.', '- 17 -', 'Accordingly, Family Dollar’s declaratory judgment action may proceed in Superior Court on remand.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the above-stated reasons, the November 9, 2016 order of the Superior Court is affirmed.

Although I am not unsympathetic to the plight of the plaintiff’s counsel in navigating the intricacies of the court’s relatively new electronic filing system, I would point out that Rule 77(d) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure is neither new nor confusing. Because I do not believe that the plaintiff has met the high standard that this Court has set for a finding of excusable neglect, I respectfully dissent.', 'As the majority explains, the defendants’ cross-appeal is grounded in two procedural rules and this Court’s previous interpretation and application of those rules.', 'Rule 77(d) provides: “Immediately upon the entry of an order or judgment the clerk shall make a note in the docket. Such notation is sufficient notice for all purposes for which notice of the entry of an order is required by these rules * * *.” Article I, Rule 4(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure requires that a notice of appeal be filed within twenty days “of the date of the entry of the judgment, order, or decree appealed from[,]” but, “[u]pon a showing of excusable neglect, the trial court may extend the time for filing the notice of appeal by any party', '- 18 - for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days from the expiration of the original time prescribed by this [rule].”', 'We have previously described “excusable neglect” as', '“a failure to take the proper steps at the proper time, not in', 'consequence of the party’s own carelessness, inattention, or willful', 'disregard of the process of the court, but in consequence of some', 'unexpected or unavoidable hindrance or accident, or reliance on', 'the care and vigilance of his counsel or on promises made by the', 'adverse party.” Boranian v.

The plaintiff’s counsel asserts that he was caught unaware of the entry of judgment on September 20 because he did not receive a notification from the electronic case management system that the judgment had been entered, and some of his attempts to inquire directly at the Superior Court went unanswered. The plaintiff’s counsel submitted an affidavit with plaintiff’s motion for extension of time to file the notice of appeal in which he attested that he had received thirty-eight electronic notifications about this case from the electronic filing system since he filed the complaint in March 2016, but that he had not received a notification that the order and judgment had been entered on September 20, 2016. There is no indication, however, that he had received notifications in the past when an order in the case was entered on the docket—only that he received a notification when opposing counsel electronically filed the proposed order and proposed judgment as well as many other notifications (the content and context of which were not provided in the written arguments to the Superior Court or to this Court).', 'The record indicates that plaintiff’s counsel received an electronic notification on August 24 that the proposed final judgment had been filed with the electronic filing system. Counsel called the Superior Court clerk’s office on September 7 to inquire about its status; he was told that the document was pending. Counsel followed up once more by telephone in late-September or early-October, then he emailed the hearing justice’s deputy clerk on October 19.', 'Not receiving a response, counsel sent another email on October 31, to which the deputy clerk replied that the judgment had been entered on September 20.', '- 20 -', 'In light of the clear wording of Rule 77(d), it was the responsibility of counsel to monitor the docket to determine whether the judgment had been entered electronically or the old- fashioned way.

Four contacts with the clerk’s office in a nearly eight-week period are simply not sufficient.', 'Taking all of the relevant circumstances into account and considering our high standard for excusable neglect, counsel’s confusion as to the process of docketing orders and judgments does not rise to the level of excusable neglect because counsel has not established extenuating circumstances that were out of his control. See Cambio, 987 A.2d at 880. Despite the hearing justice’s acknowledgment that there were many areas of confusion as the Superior Court transitioned to the electronic filing system, the plaintiff’s counsel’s misplaced expectation that he would be notified electronically when the judgment entered was not “occasioned by [an] extenuating circumstance of sufficient significance to render it excusable.” Id. (quoting King, 103 R.I. at 157, 235 A.2d at 875). And, in my opinion, the hearing justice abused his discretion by so concluding. See id. at 878.

On January 12, 2016, Mark Powers petitioned this Court for issuance of a writ of certiorari to review a Final Decree of the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court (WCC), which had been issued on December 23, 2015. That decree denied and dismissed Mr. Powers’s appeal, in accordance with a written decision of the Appellate Division dated December 16, 2015. This Court granted Mr. Powers’s petition for a writ of certiorari on September 13, 2016.', 'Before this Court, Mr. Powers contends: (1) that he “should not be estopped from arguing that he was a full-time employee working part-time hours simply because a stipulation was entered in the Workers’ Compensation Court stating that he was a part-time employee;” and (2) that “the average weekly wage, as calculated pursuant to [G.L. 1956] § 28-33-20 for the purpose of determining workers’ compensation benefits, must include monies received by an employee from the state for hours not worked, pursuant to an approved work-sharing program under [G.L. 1956] § 28-44-69.”', '-1-', 'This case first came before the Court on September 27, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this matter should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we concluded that cause had been shown, and we assigned this case to the regular calendar for further briefing and argument. We heard oral arguments on September 27, 2018.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of this matter are not in dispute. On December 31, 2012, Mr. Powers injured his left knee while shoveling snow during the course of his employment with the Warwick Public Schools. Due to his injury, he was unable to work from January 1, 2013 until April 3, 2013. At the time of the injury, in addition to receiving remuneration from the Warwick Public Schools, Mr. Powers was also receiving work-sharing benefits from the state under an approved work-sharing program pursuant to § 28-44-69.1 As a result of his inability to work due to injury, he applied for workers’ compensation benefits.', 'His “average weekly wage” for workers’ compensation benefits pursuant to § 28-33-20 was calculated thereafter, but that calculation did not take into account the work-sharing benefits which Mr. Powers had been receiving. On March 8, 2013, Mr. Powers filed a “claim for a trial,” pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 28-35-20(d),2 in order to challenge the calculation of his average weekly wage before the WCC. 1', 'The work-sharing benefits program is explained more fully infra. 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 28-35-20(d) provides as follows:', '“Any party aggrieved by the entry of the order by the judge may', 'claim a trial on any issue that was not resolved by agreement at the', '-2-', 'The parties then filed trial memoranda and agreed to a stipulation of facts before the WCC, which stated as follows:', '“1.

Nothing more of pertinence was submitted, and the parties rested on the day of trial. On September 25, 2013, the trial judge of the WCC issued a bench decision, in which he found that work-sharing benefits were “tantamount to unemployment compensation benefits” and were properly not included in Mr. Powers’s average weekly wage.

Lynch, 878 A.2d 1021, 1035 (R.I. 2005). The subject of the stipulation “is no longer a question for consideration by the tribunal.” In re McBurney Law Services, Inc., 798 A.2d at 882. However, it is equally true that, “[a]lthough a court is generally bound by a stipulation of facts, parties cannot take away the court’s responsibility to make conclusions of law and other independent findings.” Cabana v. Littler, 612 A.2d 678, 685 (R.I. 1992); see also Armstrong v. Polaski, 116 R.I. 661, 666, 360 A.2d 558, 561 (1976) (“[C]ourts generally say that the resolution of questions of law is a judicial function', '-5- that should be approached uninfluenced by the agreement of the parties as to what the law is.”). As such, “[c]ourts * * * are not bound to accept as controlling, stipulations as to questions of law.” T I Federal Credit Union v. DelBonis, 72 F.3d 921, 928 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also 73 Am. Jur. 2d Stipulations § 4 at 533-34 (2012) (“Parties to an action may not stipulate to legal conclusions to be reached by the court[;] * * * stipulations as to the law are invalid and ineffective.”).', 'Specifically at issue before this Court are the statements in the stipulation relative to: (1) Mr. Powers being a “part-time employee;” and (2) Mr. Powers having received “unemployment compensation benefits” in addition to the income earned from his employer in the twenty-six weeks3 prior to his injury. In our opinion, taking into account the above-cited precedent and the ordinary and commonsensical meaning of the words “part-time,” Mr. Powers’s stipulation that he was a part-time employee is clearly a factual assertion. See State v. Bergevine, 883 A.2d 1158, 1159 (R.I. 2005) (mem.) (“That seems to us to be the common sense of the matter; and common sense often makes good law.”) (quoting Peak v. United States, 353 U.S. 43, 46 (1957)). As such, Mr. Powers is thus bound by that stipulation. See In re McBurney Law Services, Inc., 798 A.2d at 882. Mr. Powers also implies in his brief that his stipulation to being a part-time employee was a “clear mistake of fact or an erroneous legal conclusion.” However, our case law has required “fraud, mutual mistake or actual absence of consent” to modify such a 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 28-33-20(a)(3)(i) requires the consideration of the gross wages earned by a part-time employee in the twenty-six weeks immediately prior to the week of injury for determination of the average weekly wage.', '-6- stipulation. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the issue of whether or not Mr. Powers was a full-time or a part-time employee is not open for consideration before this Court.4', 'Conversely, it is clear to us that the stipulation as to Mr. Powers having received “unemployment compensation benefits” is a legal conclusion to which this Court is not bound. See T I Federal Credit Union, 72 F.3d at 928; 73 Am. Jur. 2d Stipulations § 4 at 533-34. Indeed, the determination as to whether or not work-sharing benefits are akin to unemployment compensation benefits and should or should not be taken into account when determining a worker’s average weekly wage is a question of statutory construction, and questions of statutory construction are questions of law. See City of East Providence v. Public Utilities Commission, 566 A.2d 1305, 1307 (R.I. 1989) (stating that a “dispute relat[ing] to statutory interpretation * * * is a question of law for which the Supreme Court has the ultimate responsibility”). Consequently, our analysis and conclusions are not influenced by Mr. Powers having stipulated to receiving unemployment compensation benefits.', 'B', 'Work-Sharing Benefits', 'We turn next to Mr. Powers’s argument before this Court that the calculation of the average weekly wage which he was to be awarded by the WCC, pursuant to § 28-33-20, should have taken into account monies he received from the state pursuant to an approved work-sharing program under § 28-44-69. This is an issue of first impression in Rhode Island. 4', 'We note that our legal determination in this case as to whether or not work-sharing benefits are to be included in calculating the average weekly wage is not influenced by Mr. Powers’s having stipulated to being a part-time employee. Section 28-33-20, which provides for the method of calculating the average weekly wage, contains one subsection applicable to full- time employees and one subsection applicable to part-time employees. However, the language on which we base this decision is identical in both subsections. See Parts III.B.1 and III.B.3 infra.', '-7-', '1. Relevant Statutory Sections', 'Section 28-44-69 lays out the work-sharing program in Rhode Island. The program allows an employer to avoid layoffs by reducing the hours to be worked by a specific group of employees pursuant to a work-sharing plan. Such a work-sharing plan must be approved by the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. See § 28-44-69(b)(1). The state then pays the employees some portion of the difference between their actual income from the work-sharing employer and what they would have received had they been working on a full- time basis.5 The employer is required to continue paying health and retirement benefits as if the employee has remained a full-time employee.', 'See § 28-44-69(b)(1)(v).', 'Additionally, the program requires the affected employee to remain available to work a normal, full-time work week for the work-sharing employer. See § 28-44-69(g)(2). Of additional relevance to this case is the fact that the statute provides that claims for work-sharing benefits shall be filed in the same manner as claims for unemployment compensation benefits and that “[p]rovisions applicable to unemployment compensation shall apply to work-sharing claimants to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the established work-sharing provisions.” Section 28-44-69(h)(6) and (7).', 'Also of import in our assessment of this action is § 28-33-20.

The Decision of the Appellate Division of the WCC', 'The Appellate Division reconciled the two just-discussed statutes by finding that work- sharing benefits are not to be considered in calculating a particular employee’s average weekly wage. The Appellate Division noted that work-sharing benefits are paid for time not worked, and it could not equate them with a wage—the ordinary meaning of which the Appellate Division understood to be “the value received for the duties and labors which a workman performs, i.e., the value received for services actually rendered.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)', '-9-', 'The Appellate Division further pointed out that vacation pay, overtime, and bonuses are all expressly included in the average weekly wage calculation and that the Supreme Court has held that holiday pay is also to be included in the average weekly wage calculation.

Work-sharing benefits are the antithesis of monies paid for hours worked. They are by definition monies paid for hours not worked; and they are monies paid by the state, not by the employer. We are of the opinion that we simply need not go beyond this ordinary understanding of the term “wages” to reach our conclusion in the instant case.', 'We draw confidence in this opinion when we further note that, in view of the fact that work-sharing benefits are monies paid by the state for hours not worked, they align with traditional unemployment compensation benefits, which are likewise paid to an individual by the 7', 'Mr. Powers encourages us to look at the term wages as encompassing “earnings” and “earning capacity.” It is his contention that we have equated the terms in our case law.

However, neither the Bailey case, nor the other cases cited by Mr. Powers, dealt with work-sharing benefits; and they do not alter our conclusion in the instant case.

We recognize that there are certain differences between traditional unemployment compensation benefits and work-sharing benefits, and we do not mean to suggest that they are one and the same. However, we deem it within the bounds of our inquiry to look to the indications in the statutory schemes before us which lead us to the conclusion that, in this context, work-sharing benefits should be treated like traditional unemployment compensation benefits. See State v. Matthews, 111 A.3d 390, 404 n.15 (R.I. 2015) (“[I]t is a virtual truism that all language is understandable only in context.”).', 'Of significance is the fact that § 28-44-69, which establishes the work-sharing program, is included in the statutory chapter which provides for unemployment compensation benefits—viz., chapter 44 of title 28.

Accordingly, it is apparent from the broader statutory schemes at issue that work-sharing benefits, at least in the context of the instant case, are to be treated like traditional unemployment compensation and should not be included in determining average weekly wage. It is clear to this Court that such benefits are not included as part of the term “wages” in § 28-33-20.', 'Mr. Powers contends that work-sharing benefits should be equated, not with traditional unemployment compensation benefits, but with holiday pay and vacation pay. This Court has ruled that holiday pay is to be included in the determination of average weekly wage. Smith v. Colonial Knife Co., Inc., 731 A.2d 724, 725 (R.I. 1999). Likewise, vacation pay is expressly included in the average weekly wage calculation pursuant to § 28-33-20(a)(1) and (a)(3)(i). See also Cole, 679 A.2d at 878. However, we are unpersuaded by the comparison thereto that Mr. Powers seeks to draw. It is true that an employee does not actually work when receiving vacation or holiday pay. However, we are of the opinion that the term “wages” understandably includes vacation and holiday pay, as those are incidents of employment. Section 28-44-69(a)(4) (providing that “paid vacation and holidays * * * are incidents of employment”); see Cole, 679 A.2d at 878 (“Vacation pay is an incident of employment. * * * [I]t is a benefit that an employee acquires over time as a result of continued employment with the same employer.”). Those benefits are earned as a function of the fact of previous and continuing service to an employer, and they are paid to the employee by the employer. Work-sharing benefits are not incidents of', '- 15 - employment; they are not acquired over time due to service to that employer. Rather, as we have stated previously, work-sharing benefits are monies being paid by the state for the employee not to work. As such, we are unpersuaded by Mr. Powers’s attempt to liken work-sharing benefits to vacation and holiday pay.', 'We are not insensitive to the policy considerations which might militate in favor of broader statutory coverage so as to allow work-sharing benefits to be taken into account in determining average weekly wage, but it is our role to apply the law as it is written. “[I]t is not the function of this Court to act as a super legislative body and rewrite or amend statutes already enacted by the General Assembly.” Willis v.

48,"Christy’s Auto Rentals, Inc. : v. : Massachusetts Homeland Insurance : Company et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. This case arose out of a dispute concerning a motor vehicle collision that occurred in October of 2012 while Christian Lanoie was driving a vehicle that he had rented from Christy’s Auto Rentals, Inc. (Christy’s). In the wake of that collision, Christy’s brought a declaratory judgment action in the Superior Court, naming as defendants both Mr. Lanoie and his insurer, Massachusetts Homeland Insurance Company (Homeland).1 On January 25, 2016, the Providence County Superior Court denied Christy’s motion for summary judgment and granted Homeland’s cross-motion for summary judgment, after hearings were conducted with respect to both motions. The grant of summary judgment was predicated on the hearing justice’s determination that Christy’s lacked standing. However, after ruling that Christy’s lacked standing, the hearing justice nonetheless went on to opine that Mr. Lanoie’s 1', 'Christy’s also brought a separate civil action sounding in tort against Mr. Lanoie in the Providence County Superior Court (PC-2014-2123). That case remains pending in the Superior Court.', '-1- policy of insurance with Homeland did not provide coverage for the collision at issue and that such coverage was not statutorily mandated.', 'Christy’s timely appealed to this Court, contending that the hearing justice incorrectly determined: (1) that Homeland did not waive standing as a defense; (2) that Christy’s did not have standing to pursue the declaratory judgment action; (3) that Homeland’s insurance policy did not provide coverage with respect to the collision at issue; and (4) that coverage was not mandated by G.L. 1956 § 27-7-6.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the hearing justice’s ruling with respect to Christy’s lack of standing.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In relating the pertinent facts, we rely primarily upon the transcripts of the November 17 and December 17, 2015 hearings in the Superior Court as well as other documents contained in the record before us.', 'A', 'Underlying Truck Rental Agreement and Accident', 'On October 9, 2012, Mr. Lanoie entered into a Rental Agreement with Christy’s for the purpose of renting a 2007 Mitsubishi Fuso box truck for one day. At that time, Mr. Lanoie was employed by a barbecue vendor as a manager. It is uncontested that he rented the truck in order to transport barbecue equipment back to the vendor’s home base after the equipment had been used at a seasonal fair in Topsfield, Massachusetts. When he entered into the Rental Agreement, Mr. Lanoie declined to purchase the proffered “Liability Protection” option, and he so indicated by affixing his initials to a section of the Rental Agreement that acknowledged that he “agree[d]', '-2- to be responsible for all damage or loss [he might] cause to others.” At the time that he signed the agreement with Christy’s, Mr. Lanoie had a personal automobile insurance policy issued by Homeland. That policy covered Mr. Lanoie’s personal vehicle from November 6, 2011 through November 6, 2012.', 'It is uncontested that, on October 10, 2012, Mr. Lanoie returned the rental vehicle to Christy’s and that a corner of the vehicle had been damaged as a result of colliding with a concession trailer at the fair. The concession trailer was owned by Dean and Flynn Fiesta Shows (Dean and Flynn). It appears that the trailer incurred damages in the amount of $1,300; Dean and Flynn was compensated by Christy’s on December 7, 2012. Several months later, in April of 2014, Christy’s sued Mr. Lanoie in order to recover the amount paid to Dean and Flynn and to obtain compensation for the damages to the Christy’s vehicle. At the same time, Christy’s filed the instant declaratory judgment action against Homeland.2', 'B', 'Declaratory Judgment Action Against Homeland', 'In the declaratory judgment action against Homeland, Christy’s sought a ruling that the damages Mr. Lanoie caused to its rental vehicle and to the Dean and Flynn trailer were covered under Mr. Lanoie’s policy with Homeland. In its answer, Homeland asserted that Mr. Lanoie’s policy did “not cover the damages for which the plaintiff complains.” Homeland also denied many of the allegations set forth in the petition for declaratory judgment—notably including Christy’s allegation that the Superior Court “has jurisdiction to declare the rights, status, and 2', 'Mr. Lanoie is a nominal defendant in this declaratory judgment action.

Moorland Farm Condominium Association, 86 A.3d 354, 360 (R.I. 2014).

At the conclusion of the latter hearing, the hearing justice ruled from the bench.', 'In his bench decision, the hearing justice ruled that, because standing was “raised in a motion for summary judgment where the plaintiff had the opportunity and in fact argues substantively on the issue and had the right to address it[;] * * * the issue was not waived by the failure to put it in the answer.” Having determined that there was no waiver, the hearing justice then proceeded to rule on the merits of the standing argument and held that “this claim is barred because * * * Christy’s lacks standing.” The hearing justice acknowledged that “the Supreme Court has never firmly decided this,” but he noted that “I do see language that says that in Rhode Island and most other jurisdictions an injured party lacks standing to maintain a direct action for damages against a tortfeasor’s insurer until and unless the injured party secured a judgment against the tortfeasor.”', '-4-', 'Although he had just specifically determined that Christy’s lacked standing, the hearing justice did not simply decline to opine on other issues. Instead, he went on to state that, “even if they [i.e., Christy’s] had standing in this particular instance, there wouldn’t be coverage under the policy * * *.” He additionally held that the Rental Agreement at issue “is not covered by [§ 27-7-6].”3 Accordingly, the hearing justice granted Homeland’s motion for summary judgment and denied Christy’s cross-motion. Final judgment entered in favor of Homeland on January 25, 2016, and Christy’s timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well established that “[t]his Court examines an appeal from cross-motions for summary judgment de novo” and that we “apply the same standards as those used by the trial court.” Glassie v.

Gannon, 713 A.2d 218 (R.I. 1998), as supportive of its contention that Rules 8(c) and 12(h) mean that standing “may be waived if not properly pled in the answer.” In our view, however, Christy’s reads this Court’s opinion in Direct Action far too broadly. The Direct Action opinion did not state that the defense of standing must be raised in an answer as though it were one of the defenses itemized in Rule 8(c). What this Court actually noted in Direct Action was that the issue of standing “was never raised before the trial justice and, therefore, [was] * * * waived.” Direct Action, 713 A.2d at 222 (emphasis added).4 The whole thrust of the Direct Action opinion with respect to the waiver of the defense of lack of standing was that the trial justice had not been alerted to that issue at any time; the opinion makes no reference whatsoever to Rules 8(c) or 12(h) or to what must be included in a responsive pleading. See id.', 'Moreover, even assuming arguendo that the defense of lack of standing constitutes an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c) (even though it is not specifically mentioned therein), it is nonetheless our view that Homeland’s raising said defense in its motion for summary judgment was sufficient in view of the totality of what transpired in the Superior Court.5 See Industrial National Bank v.

As such, it is now our role to grapple with that long-deferred issue. In applying this Court’s venerable principles concerning standing to the circumstances of this declaratory', '-9- judgment action, Christy’s suit must fail because it has not alleged an injury in fact as our jurisprudence requires. We have been very clear as to this principle. See, e.g., Cruz v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 108 A.3d 992, 996 (R.I. 2015) (“The determination of whether a party has standing begins with the pivotal question of whether the party alleges that the challenged action has caused him or her injury in fact.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Bowen, 945 A.2d at 317 (holding that the injury must consist of a “legally cognizable and protectable interest [that] must be concrete and particularized * * * and * * * actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'A party who is not in privity of contract may not seek enforcement or interpretation of that contract. See generally Mruk v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 82 A.3d 527, 534-35 (R.I. 2013) (stating that “an individual who [is] not a party to a contractual agreement lacks standing to challenge its validity”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Christy’s is a stranger to the contract about which it seeks an interpretation (viz., the contract of insurance between Homeland and Mr. Lanoie). Christy’s asserted injury (viz., that it was “damaged as a result of Mr. Lanoie’s negligence and breach of the Rental Agreement and his liability insurer has refused to indemnify him”) is, in the words of this Court in Bowen, completely “conjectural” and “hypothetical” unless and until there is an unsatisfied final judgment in Christy’s tort action against Mr. Lanoie. See Bowen, 945 A.2d at 317; see also Hunt v. Century Indemnity Co., 58 R.I. 336, 343, 344, 192 A. 799, 802, 803 (1937) (holding that an injured third party “is as much entitled to invoke every right or remedy to make the contract effective to do the thing intended by the original parties to it as is the insured” because that third party “stands in the shoes of the insured, at least after he has obtained a judgment against the insured”) (emphasis added). Because Christy’s lacked standing to pursue its declaratory judgment action against Homeland,', '- 10 - Homeland was indeed entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the hearing justice properly granted Homeland’s motion for summary judgment.7', 'Christy’s does not remain without a remedy; the tort action currently pending against Mr. Lanoie offers Christy’s a procedurally proper avenue to pursue the damages to which it believes it is entitled. See Mendez, 849 A.2d at 331 n.2 (stating that “an injured party lacks standing to maintain a direct action for damages against a tortfeasor’s insurer until and unless the injured party has secured a judgment against the tortfeasor”) (emphasis added). If Christy’s succeeds in obtaining judgment against Mr. Lanoie and is unable to collect on that judgment from him, it would then have a legally cognizable interest that is no longer hypothetical.', 'In conclusion, we perceive no error whatsoever in the hearing justice’s granting of summary disposition to Homeland, and we therefore affirm the hearing justice’s ruling that Homeland did not waive the standing defense and that Christy’s lacked standing to pursue this declaratory judgment action.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the above-stated reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court granting Homeland’s motion for summary judgment on standing grounds in this declaratory judgment action. We remand the record to that tribunal. 7', 'Since we are affirming the hearing justice’s determination that Christy’s lacked standing to pursue this declaratory judgment action, we would simply observe that the portions of the hearing justice’s bench decision wherein he opined that the collision at issue was not covered under Mr. Lanoie’s policy of insurance with Homeland, as well as the portion of his decision wherein he opined about the non-applicability of G.L. 1956 § 27-7-6, are mere dicta.

49,In re Sophia M. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. Anna Brugeman (Anna or mother) appeals from a Family Court decree finding that she abused and neglected her infant child, Sophia. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the decree of the Family Court as it pertains to Anna Brugeman.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Sophia was born to Anna and Ernest M. (Ernest or father) on November 14, 2015. According to the parents, on the evening of December 4, 2015, three-week-old Sophia was fed, bathed, and placed in her bassinet prior to 9 p.m. without any sign of injury. Anna testified that, when Sophia woke up crying during the night, Anna “couldn’t keep [her own] eyes open,” so she asked Ernest to feed Sophia, telling him that she would wake up for the next feeding. Anna said she went back to sleep until 7:30 the next morning. In the meantime, Ernest tended to Sophia, changing her diaper before giving her a bottle. Ernest testified that, while he was feeding Sophia,', '-1- her lip struck his collarbone. According to Ernest, Sophia cried for about five minutes after the incident, but she then took her bottle.', 'Anna testified that she first noticed an injury to Sophia’s lip the next morning. When she asked Ernest how the lip bruising occurred, Ernest told her that when he was burping Sophia, her lip hit his collarbone. Ernest testified that, after this brief conversation with Anna, he changed Sophia’s diaper and dressed her, but did not see any other injuries on her body. Later that day, Anna and Ernest brought Sophia and L.M.,1 Ernest’s other daughter, to a mall to take pictures with Santa, accompanied by L.M.’s mother. After arriving home from the mall, Sophia napped while Ernest took L.M. to the dog park at their apartment complex.', 'Anna changed Sophia’s diaper when the infant woke from her nap that afternoon. Anna testified that she noticed a “weird shaped” bruise on Sophia’s back, a lot of bruising above her upper shoulder blades, and a “little red bruise” on her stomach. Anna took pictures of the bruises and sent them to her mother around 2:30 p.m.; her mother advised her to call the pediatrician. Sophia’s pediatrician suggested that Anna take Sophia to the hospital.', 'Shortly after, when Ernest and L.M. returned from the dog park, Anna told Ernest about her conversations with her mother and Sophia’s pediatrician. Anna testified that Ernest was hesitant to go to the hospital at that point and that he suggested that they should wait until Monday to see if it cleared up. After a brief discussion, Ernest and Anna took Sophia to Hasbro Children’s Hospital around 5:30 p.m., and the infant was admitted.', 'Ernest recalled at trial, however, that when he arrived home from the dog park earlier that afternoon, Anna notified him of a rash on Sophia’s stomach, not bruising. He testified that he treated Sophia’s stomach with lotion, and suggested to Anna that they take Sophia to a doctor if 1', 'We shall refer to Ernest’s other minor child by her initials.', '-2- the “rash” did not clear up in a day or so.2 Ernest testified that he then took L.M. to CVS, and that it was only after he returned that Anna showed him the mark on Sophia’s back. Ernest testified that he told Anna to call the pediatrician, and that he did not hesitate to take Sophia to the hospital.', 'Christine Barron, M.D., the on-call physician at Hasbro’s child protection center, was consulted to examine Sophia at the hospital on the day after her admittance. Doctor Barron reviewed Sophia’s emergency department records, obtained histories from Anna and Ernest separately, and then conducted a physical examination of Sophia. In his statement to Dr. Barron, Ernest said that the lip injury to Sophia occurred while he was burping Sophia, and that Sophia lifted her head and “cracked on his collarbone[.]” Ernest could not provide Dr. Barron with an explanation for the other bruises on Sophia’s stomach, upper back, mid-back, right flank, and diaper area. Anna gave a similar history to Dr. Barron, differing only on the specific time that she noticed the bruise on Sophia’s stomach and the question as to whether or not that bruise was actually a rash. Anna also informed Dr. Barron of a family history with “von Willebrand disease,” a mild bleeding disorder.', 'Doctor Barron ordered a skeletal survey, a head CT scan,3 and a “full workup,” all of which came back normal; also, there was no indication that Sophia had a bleeding disorder. Doctor 2', 'Anna also testified that she and Ernest had a conversation about a rash on Sophia’s stomach. According to Anna, however, Ernest told her in passing that he noticed a rash on Sophia’s stomach when he changed her diaper in the morning, prior to the visit to the mall with Santa. Anna testified that she told Ernest to put lotion on it, but that she did not inspect the rash on Sophia’s stomach herself. 3', '“CT” is the abbreviation for “computerized tomography,” also known as “computerized axial tomography,” which is a “technique * * * used in diagnostic studies of internal bodily structures, as in the detection of tumors or brain aneurysms.” American Heritage Dictionary 380 (5th ed. 2011).', '-3- Barron’s physical examination revealed that Sophia had petechia4 on her chest and “bruises of different colors” on her abdomen, diaper area, upper back, mid-back, and right flank into her right buttocks. Although she could not age the bruises, Dr. Barron listed the stomach bruise as “acute[,]” meaning “identifying usually within 12 to 24 hours.” Additionally, Dr. Barron testified that the bruise on Sophia’s right flank had not been documented in the emergency department, but emerged a few hours after Sophia arrived at the hospital. She testified that this injury did not occur while Sophia was in the hospital, explaining that it would not be uncommon for a bruise to “take a few hours or * * * even a day to demonstrate itself.” Doctor Barron noted that, from the day of her admittance until her discharge on December 11, 2015, Sophia’s injuries healed normally and she did not sustain any additional bruising while in the hospital.', 'In accordance with her standard protocol, Dr. Barron also reviewed the medical history of L.M., then three years old. L.M.’s medical records indicated that she had been brought to the hospital with unexplained bruising on her stomach and diaper area a few weeks after she was born, and that L.M.’s mother was instructed “not to allow the father to be [L.M.’s] sole caregiver[.]” Although the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) had not been contacted during L.M.’s visit to the hospital, Dr. Barron testified that “on full review of the older sibling[,] * * * those injuries would be consistent with child physical abuse.” Doctor Barron stated that she found the similarities between the bruising history of L.M. and Sophia to be significant, but she emphasized that she did not base her decision in Sophia’s case on the information in L.M.’s records. 4', '“Petechia” is defined as “[a] small purplish spot on a body surface, such as the skin or a mucous membrane, caused by a minute hemorrhage * * *.” American Heritage Dictionary 1320 (5th ed. 2011).', '-4-', 'After her initial interviews with Anna and Ernest, Dr. Barron explained to both parents that “the history that was provided for [Sophia’s] lip injury was not consistent with the amount of force that is necessary to cause that injury.” Three days later, when Dr. Barron met with the parents again, Ernest provided Dr. Barron with a different history for Sophia’s lip injury. Ernest told Dr. Barron at that time that he remembered that Sophia hurt her lip not when he was burping her, but instead when he was leaning over to grab a bottle out of the warmer. Doctor Barron testified that she found this second explanation to be “more probable” because it implied more force; but, she also commented that she found it “concerning” that the story changed after she had informed the parents that the history they had originally provided was not consistent with the injury.5', 'Ultimately, Dr. Barron concluded that Sophia’s injuries were caused by “blunt force trauma that would be consistent with child physical abuse”; she reported those findings to DCYF and the Warwick Police Department. Following her release from the hospital, Sophia was placed in the care of her paternal aunt. DCYF filed an abuse-and-neglect petition on December 8, 2015, pursuant to G.L. 1956 chapter 11 of title 40, alleging that: (1) Anna and Ernest failed to provide Sophia a minimum degree of care; (2) Sophia was “without proper parental care and supervision”; and (3) Ernest and Anna inflicted, or allowed to be inflicted, physical injury upon Sophia.6 Trial 5', 'Ernest offered a third explanation for Sophia’s lip injury in September 2016 to the investigating officer, Detective John McHale. Ernest told Det. McHale that he held Sophia with one hand under her buttocks and her head resting on his shoulder as he reached down to pick up a bottle off a table that was roughly two feet tall. Ernest stated that he felt Sophia falling as he reached down and when he stood back up, she struck her lip on his shoulder. Detective McHale surmised that the difference between the second and third explanations was that, in the third explanation, Ernest would have bent down even further, generating more force when standing back up. 6', 'General Laws 1956 § 40-11-2(1) reads, in relevant part:', '“(1) ‘Abused and/or neglected child’ means a child whose physical', 'or mental health or welfare is harmed, or threatened with harm,', 'when his or her parent or other person responsible for his or her', 'welfare:', '-5- commenced before a Family Court justice on January 26, 2017, and ended on May 8, 2017, after eleven separate days of testimony.', 'After considering all of the testimony and exhibits, the trial justice found clear and convincing evidence of child physical abuse. The trial justice determined that Ernest had caused Sophia’s lip injury while the child was in his exclusive control. Additionally, the trial justice found that “[a]lthough Sophia’s injuries may not have occurred over a prolonged period of time,” based on Dr. Barron’s testimony regarding the bruises, “Sophia’s injuries were not the result of a one- time episode of abuse, but sustained over a period of time.” She went on to state, “it is clear to this [c]ourt that the bruises were all in various stages of forming or healing.” The trial justice found that Sophia’s injuries were the result of child physical abuse and that both Anna and Ernest had: (1) failed to provide Sophia with “a minimum degree of care, supervision, or guardianship”; (2) “inflicted or allowed to be inflicted upon the child physical injury”; and (3) “created or allowed to be created a substantial risk of physical injury to the child.” In her decision dated July 10, 2017, she determined that Sophia was abused and neglected as to both Ernest and Anna; she ordered that', '“(i) Inflicts, or allows to be inflicted, upon the child physical or', 'mental injury, including excessive corporal punishment; or', '“(ii) Creates, or allows to be created, a substantial risk of physical', 'or mental injury to the child, including excessive corporal', 'punishment; or', '“* * *', '“* * *', '“(v) Fails to provide the child with a minimum degree of care or', 'proper supervision or guardianship because of his or her', 'unwillingness or inability to do so by situations or conditions such', 'as, but not limited to: social problems, mental incompetency, or the', 'use of a drug, drugs, or alcohol to the extent that the parent or other', 'person responsible for the child’s welfare loses his or her ability or', 'is unwilling to properly care for the child[.]”', '-6- Sophia be committed to the care, custody, and control of DCYF until further order of the court. Anna filed a notice of appeal on July 18, 2017.7', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Rule 17(b) of the Family Court Rules of Juvenile Proceedings provides that a “determination that a child is abused, neglected, or dependent shall be made upon clear and convincing evidence.” In re Madlyn B., 187 A.3d 1105, 1118 (R.I. 2018) (alteration omitted) (quoting In re Adner G., 925 A.2d 951, 957 (R.I. 2007)). It is well settled that the clear and convincing standard is “a higher standard of proof than that of a fair preponderance of the evidence but less than that required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt.” In re Emilee K., 153 A.3d 487, 497 (R.I. 2017). Moreover, we have stated that the clear and convincing standard is “significant[,]” id., and “requires that the fact-finder form a clear conviction without hesitancy of the truth of the precise facts in issue.” In re Madlyn B., 187 A.3d at 1118 (quoting In re Adner G., 925 A.2d at 957). Nonetheless, it remains true that a trial justice’s “findings are entitled to great weight and will not be reversed on appeal unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence, or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. at 1118-19 (quoting In re Adner G., 925 A.2d at 957). Accordingly, on appeal, this Court will “examine the record to determine whether legally competent evidence exists in it to support findings made by the trial justice.” In re Adner G., 925 A.2d at 957 (quoting In re Mackenzie C., 877 A.2d 674, 685 (R.I. 2005)). 7', 'Anna filed her notice of appeal prematurely, before a final decree entered on August 3, 2017. “This Court, however, will treat the premature notice[] of appeal as if [it] had been timely filed after the judgment was entered.” In re Briann A.T., 146 A.3d 866, 872 n.5 (R.I. 2016). Ernest did not appeal the decree.', '-7-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, Anna argues that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived relevant law and evidence, ignored evidence contradicting her findings, and disregarded uncontroverted evidence. Specifically, Anna argues that the trial justice disregarded Dr. Barron’s expert testimony in finding that Sophia’s injuries were “sustained over a period of time,” that there “were at least three * * * separate events” that caused Sophia’s injuries, and that the bruises were all in various stages of healing. Anna also argues that the trial justice based her finding of abuse and neglect on “an impermissible pyramid of inferences[,]” and she further argues that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the evidence is that Ernest’s actions were the sole cause of Sophia’s injuries. Conversely, DCYF avers that the trial justice did not misapply the law, and further argues that the trial justice did not err in finding clear and convincing evidence of abuse and neglect “[i]n light of the medical testimony and the parents [sic] lack of any explanation for [Sophia’s] multiple bruising[.]”8', 'After careful examination of the record, we are of the opinion that, under the clear and convincing standard, the evidence in this case is not sufficient to support a finding of abuse or neglect as to Anna. We begin our review of the evidence with several uncontested facts. First, Anna and Ernest were the exclusive caretakers of Sophia, and, second, Sophia was placed in her bassinet around 9 p.m. on December 4, 2015, without any visible sign of injury. It is also uncontested that Ernest’s actions were the sole cause of the injury to Sophia’s lip. A fourth virtually unassailable factual finding by the trial justice is that Sophia’s injuries were the result of 8', 'The Court Appointed Special Advocate also submitted a counterstatement to the Court, similarly arguing that the trial justice did not misconceive or overlook relevant law or evidence.', '-8- blunt-force trauma consistent with child physical abuse. Doctor Barron based her expert opinion upon the knowledge that a three-week-old infant is immobile and unable to injure herself.', 'Significantly, however, we are unable to find sufficient evidence in the record to support the trial justice’s critical finding of fact that “Sophia’s injuries were not the result of a one-time episode of abuse, but sustained over a period of time.” Doctor Barron described Sophia’s stomach bruise as “acute[,]” meaning “identifying usually within 12 to 24 hours[,]” and the right flank bruise as “evolving,” a type of bruise that can also take time to present itself. Doctor Barron did not suggest, however, that the bruises were the result of more than one occurrence of abuse. Rather, she testified that “sometimes it can take a few hours or * * * even a day [for a bruise] to demonstrate itself[,]” and that, although some of the bruises were of different colors, she could not age them. Therefore, we agree with Anna that the trial justice misconstrued this part of Dr. Barron’s testimony.', 'Moreover, in her decision, the trial justice characterized as “jarring” the similarities between the injuries sustained by L.M., Ernest’s oldest daughter, and those suffered by Sophia “when both girls were of the same age and under the care of the same [f]ather[.]” Although the injuries to L.M. were not reported to DCYF at the time, they were, according to Dr. Barron, consistent with child physical abuse. The evidence of injuries to L.M. may well have been relevant to the neglect and abuse charges pending against Ernest relating to Sophia, which were tried in the same proceeding as those against Anna. Such evidence, however, had little relevance, if any, with respect to Anna. Even if Anna were aware of the incident with L.M., there was no suggestion, prior to Dr. Barron’s assessment, that the injuries to L.M. may have been caused by physical abuse.', 'Anna also asserts that the trial justice erroneously relied on In re Chester J., 754 A.2d 772 (R.I. 2000), and In re Frances, 505 A.2d 1380 (R.I. 1986), contending that these two cases “could', '-9- not be more distinguishable” based upon the extent of the injuries and the time frame of the abuse. In her decision, the trial justice cited to In re Chester J. and In re Frances to support her finding of abuse and neglect, stating:', '“The Rhode Island Supreme Court has held that there is no duty', 'upon the state to discern which parent actually inflicted the abuse', 'against the child. See In re Chester J., 754 A.2d 772, 778 (R.I.', '2000). Allowing a parent to ignore or stand by while such abuse', 'and neglect occurs is tantamount to the parent inflicting the abuse', 'themselves. See [i]d. While this is an Abuse and Neglect trial, the', 'Rhode Island Supreme Court has also held that termination of', 'parental rights was justified where a parent claimed ignorance to the', 'source of a child’s serious injuries. See In re Frances, 505 A.2d', '1380, 1385 (R.I. 1986). Inferences to be drawn from the evidence', 'in the record should not be ignored. See [i]d. at 1384.”', 'In In re Frances, this Court affirmed a finding of abuse in a parental-rights termination case in which an eleven-month-old child was found to be in a permanent vegetative state with serious head injuries, extreme dehydration, and bruises—some days or weeks old—scattered about her body. In re Frances, 505 A.2d at 1382. This Court noted that the treating physician described the child’s injuries to be “in various stages of healing” and that the mother could not give an adequate explanation for any of her child’s severe injuries, ultimately finding that “[i]t was reasonable for the trial justice to conclude on the basis of the evidence before him that a loving, caring parent would have known the source of the injuries and would have reported this information to physicians or to the police if she had not caused them herself or permitted them to happen.” Id. at 1384-85.', 'In the case of In re Chester J., we similarly affirmed a Family Court decree terminating parental rights to a child who suffered severe injuries when he was seven months old, including at least nine rib fractures, two leg fractures, bruises, lesions, and bite marks. In re Chester J., 754 A.2d at 773-74, 777, 778. The child’s treating physician testified that these injuries were in various', '- 10 - stages of healing, leading this Court to agree with the trial justice that the injuries were “incurred over a sustained period.” Id. at 773-74, 777. Additionally, the trial justice in that case had found that the child’s primary caregivers, his mother and father, “expressed ‘complete and total ignorance of how the child’s horrific injuries were inflicted[,]’” and that the child’s mother provided inconsistent explanations for the child’s severe injuries. Id. at 776, 777. This Court held that “the state [wa]s not required to prove which parent actually inflicted the abuse[,]” because “[a]llowing parents to ignore or to stand by while such abuse and neglect occurs is tantamount to the parents inflicting the abuse themselves for purposes of a termination * * *.” Id. at 778.', 'It is perhaps axiomatic to observe that no two cases are precisely alike. Here, however, there are obvious stark differences between the circumstances concerning the injuries sustained by Sophia and those inflicted upon the children in In re Chester J. and In re Frances. Not only were the injuries in In re Chester J. and In re Frances far more severe than the bruises presented by Sophia, they were sustained over a much longer period of time. See In re Chester J., 754 A.2d at 773-74, 777; In re Frances, 505 A.2d at 1382. Thus, we are satisfied that the cases upon which the trial justice relied to support her finding of abuse and neglect are readily distinguishable.9', 'Moreover, the evidence suggests that Anna did not “ignore” or “stand by while such abuse and neglect occur[ed.]” In re Chester J., 754 A.2d at 778. Rather, according to the testimony at trial, upon noticing the bruises while changing Sophia’s diaper on the afternoon of December 5, 9', 'Anna also contends that the case at bar is analogous to In re Adrina T., 162 A.3d 658 (R.I. 2017), in which we vacated a trial justice’s finding of abuse and neglect against a mother whose child sustained a leg fracture when she left the child in the sole care of the father for a few hours. In re Adrina T., 162 A.3d at 660, 670-71. In re Adrina T. is analogous to the case before us in that we are unable to find evidence “in the record that reflects a pattern of injuries ‘incurred over a sustained period.’” Id. at 670 (quoting In re Chester J., 754 A.2d at 777). However, there are two distinguishing, critical factors in In re Adrina T. not present in the case at bar: (1) undisputed evidence demonstrating that the mother was not present when the child was injured; and (2) expert medical testimony suggesting that the child’s injuries could have been accidental. Id.', '- 11 - 2015, Anna photographed the bruises, contacted her mother, and then called the pediatrician. Following these conversations and, according to Anna, after encountering some resistance from Ernest, she took Sophia to the emergency room approximately three hours after discovering the injuries.', 'Additionally, at trial, Dr. Barron confirmed that Anna reported the injuries “immediately[,]” and she testified that it was “appropriate” for Anna to “seek additional help and then follow the advice of the physician.” We are of the opinion, therefore, that Anna’s response to discovering the bruising, even if arguably dilatory, does not support a finding of abuse or neglect.', 'Actions that take place in the privacy of one’s home or behind closed doors are often not amenable to definitive determinations. In the case at bar, the trial justice was understandably troubled that Anna never awoke when her baby “was screaming[,]” neither parent could provide an adequate explanation for Sophia’s injuries, and neither “ever asked, suspected or accused the other of causing any of [her] injuries[.]” Based upon our review of the record, however, we are convinced that such facts, together with the trial justice’s other factual findings, do not create a reasonable inference, by clear and convincing evidence, that Anna neglected or abused Sophia, or allowed abuse to be inflicted upon her. DCYF has failed to produce sufficient evidence to meet that exacting standard of proof. Thus, after careful review, we are unable to conclude that the trial justice’s findings are supported by legally competent evidence.10 10', 'We take this opportunity to note that it has been over three years since the child was placed in the custody of her paternal aunt while trial and appeal were pending. We find it concerning that there has been little movement toward reunification during that time in this case. The pendency of an appeal from a finding of abuse and neglect should not be the reason for delaying efforts to reunify the child with one or both parents, should that be in the best interest of the child.', '- 12 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we vacate the decree of the Family Court as it pertains to Anna Brugeman.

50,Claire Letizio et al. : v. : Natale J. Ritacco et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. In this negligence action, the plaintiffs, Claire Letizio and Christopher Letizio (the Letizios), appeal from an order of the Superior Court denying their motion for a new trial after a jury found in favor of the defendants, Natale J. Ritacco and Margaret H. Ritacco (the Ritaccos). This matter came before the Court on February 28, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of this case, which are largely undisputed, are as follows. On March 5, 2015, there had been a light snowfall, leading to some accumulation at the Ritacco residence in Westerly, Rhode Island. The Ritacco residence has a long, relatively flat driveway and a side entrance with two stone steps that lead up to a side door. That day, Mr. Ritacco cleared the snow off his driveway', '-1- using a snow blower. He used a shovel to clean the stone steps. As was his custom, he did not spread ice melt, fearing that it could be tracked into the house after having been caught underfoot. Also, when later asked if he had spread ice melt, he recalled that there was no surface “icing up” on that day.', 'The next day, March 6, was a cold but sunny day in Westerly, and there was no precipitation all day. That night, sometime between 5:30 p.m. and 6 p.m., Mrs. Letizio arrived at the Ritacco residence, along with her daughter, who went there to meet the Ritaccos’ daughter and two other classmates to get ready for a high school dance that was taking place later that night. Mrs. Letizio parked in front of the right bay door of the Ritaccos’ garage, which was located at the end of their driveway, and proceeded to the side door of the house. As she was making her way up the steps, Mrs. Letizio’s daughter slipped on some ice that had formed on the stone stairs, but she was not injured.', 'Once in the house, the girls went upstairs to get ready for the dance. Mrs. Letizio waited downstairs with Mr. Ritacco and informed him multiple times that his steps were icy.1 After Mrs. Ritacco had arrived home and the girls had finished getting ready, Mrs. Letizio told the Ritaccos that she could give the girls a ride to the dance because her house was close to the school where the dance was taking place. Sometime around 7 p.m., as she was getting ready to leave, Mrs. Letizio reminded Mr. Ritacco that it was getting icy outside and that the steps were icy. As a result, Mr. Ritacco advised Mrs. Letizio and the girls to leave the house through the garage.2 However, Mr. Ritacco did not follow the group outside of his home. 1', 'There was conflicting testimony regarding whether Mrs. Letizio told Mr. Ritacco that her daughter had slipped on the steps. However, both parties agree that Mrs. Letizio told Mr. Ritacco that the steps were icy. 2', 'There is some dispute about whether the group exited through the overhead garage doorway, or a side access door in the garage. However, this fact is not crucial to the outcome of this case.', '-2-', 'Upon arriving outside, the girls safely entered Mrs. Letizio’s vehicle through the passenger’s side front and back doors. Mrs. Letizio was not so fortunate. As she was walking to the driver’s side front door, she slipped on some ice that had formed on the pavement near the front left wheel of her car, and she broke her ankle. She lay on the ground until she was able to get the attention of her daughter, who immediately went to get the Ritaccos to aid her mother. Although the Ritaccos offered to call for an ambulance, Mrs. Letizio refused, and instead ambulated herself into the passenger’s front seat of the vehicle. Mrs. Ritacco then drove Mrs. Letizio to the hospital, while Mr. Ritacco brought the girls to the dance. On his way home, Mr. Ritacco purchased some ice melt at the store, which he later spread on the area of his driveway where Mrs. Letizio had fallen.', 'At the hospital that night, doctors discovered that Mrs. Letizio had fractured the tibia, fibula, as well as the talus bones in her leg as a result of the fall.3 However, due to the swelling in her leg, doctors could not perform surgery at that time, so she was sent home and told to return five days later. Then, on March 11, Mrs. Letizio underwent an open reduction, internal fixation surgery, in which doctors inserted six screws, two wires, and a plate to mend the broken bones in her leg. As a result, Mrs. Letizio endured hundreds of hours of treatment and physical therapy.', 'The Letizios filed a complaint in Washington County Superior Court on November 12, 2015, alleging negligence against the Ritaccos, and seeking damages for the cost of Mrs. Letizio’s medical expenses and lost wages, as well as pain and suffering.4 Additionally, they sought punitive damages, alleging that the Ritaccos’ conduct was reckless and willful. The parties 3', 'This is known as a “trimalleolar” fracture. 4', 'Mr. Letizio brought a claim for loss of consortium.', '-3- attempted, unsuccessfully, to arbitrate their dispute. Later, a three-day trial began on July 24, 2017, during which the jury heard from six witnesses, all called by the Letizios.', 'The Letizios called Mr. Ritacco as their first witness, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-17-12.5 He recounted that March 5, 2015, was a cold and snowy day and that he had cleared off the driveway with his snow blower and the stone steps with a shovel. Mr. Ritacco stated that the next day, when he went out to get the paper and the mail, there was no visible ice on the driveway. He also testified that there was no ice around the spot where he had parked his car when he went to pick up his daughter from school, between 2:30 p.m. and 3 p.m. Mr. Ritacco stated that Mrs. Letizio informed him of the icy condition of the steps when she walked into the house. Additionally, after having his memory refreshed, he testified that, as she was getting ready to leave, Mrs. Letizio reminded Mr. Ritacco that the steps were icy; therefore, Mr. Ritacco led the guests out a different way. He testified that he pointed them to the garage, that they exited through a door attached to the garage, and that Mrs. Letizio slipped soon after the group was outside. He also noted that, although he went outside to aid Mrs. Letizio, he was unable to help Mrs. Letizio to her feet because he had a bad back. Upon further questioning from the Letizios’ counsel, Mr. Ritacco testified that he had not put ice melt on the driveway, despite the fact that the area where Mrs. Letizio slipped was in the shade for most of the day. On cross-examination by his attorney, Mr. Ritacco noted that the driveway was clear and clean after he was done removing the snow on March 5. He also testified that, during the day on March 6, his car was parked in the same area where Mrs. Letizio would later park her car that night. 5', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-17-12 states: “No person shall be disqualified from testifying in any civil action or proceeding by reason of his or her being interested therein or being a party thereto.”', '-4-', 'The Letizios called Mrs. Ritacco to the stand next. Her version of events did not differ substantially from that of Mr. Ritacco. She testified that she had no independent recollection regarding whether her husband used ice melt on the driveway on March 6; she did however indicate that it was not his regular practice to do so every time it snowed. On that day, she had pulled into the garage after she arrived home from work. Mrs. Ritacco testified that she did not recall Mrs. Letizio mentioning ice, but that she did recall admonishing the girls to be careful because they were wearing high heels and it was cold outside. On cross-examination by her own attorney, Mrs. Ritacco recalled letting the guests out of the side access door inside the garage. She indicated that the lights by the garage door were on, illuminating the portion of the driveway where Mrs. Letizio had parked her car. Finally, she testified that she had driven Mrs. Letizio to the hospital in Mrs. Letizio’s vehicle after walking roughly the same path that Mrs. Letizio took; Mrs. Ritacco specifically noted that she did not encounter any ice in her path.', 'Next, the Letizios’ daughter testified that she slipped and fell multiple times on the stone steps as she was walking into the Ritaccos’ house on the evening of March 6. She stated that her mother was nervous and that her mother told Mr. Ritacco that there was ice on the steps and that it was icy outside. She also indicated that she heard Mr. Ritacco tell her mother that he did not use ice melt because he did not like having it tracked into his house.', 'Finally, Mrs. Letizio testified that she had driven her daughter to the Ritaccos’ house on the evening of March 6.6 She recalled seeing her daughter slip while attempting to make her way up the steps and that she was “very shocked” to see so much ice on the steps. She also stated that she told Mr. Ritacco that the steps were icy and that her daughter had slipped twice. Mrs. Letizio 6', 'The Letizios’ damages are not at issue on appeal. Therefore, we will not discuss the testimony of Mr. Letizio and Adrian Hamburger, M.D., who testified only to the damages that the Letizios had incurred.', '-5- then testified that she told the Ritaccos that they could not use the entrance with the stone steps to leave, and that Mr. Ritacco told her to go through the garage. She recalled exiting the house from the overhead garage-door opening, not through the side access door as the Ritaccos had recalled in their testimony. Mrs. Letizio testified that she slipped as she was approaching the front left wheel of the car, and that she laid on her back on the ground for several minutes before anyone went out to help her.', 'On cross-examination by the Ritaccos’ attorney, Mrs. Letizio stated that the driveway “[a]ppeared fine” when she arrived at the Ritacco house on the evening of March 6. She recounted that the driveway was clear to the pavement and that there was no visible ice in the driveway. She noted that the sun was still up when she arrived and that there was enough light to see where she was going when she left. Mrs. Letizio testified that she had not seen any ice as she walked from the garage to her vehicle before she slipped. She also recalled that neither Mrs. Ritacco nor Mr. Ritacco had slipped when they went outside to help her.', 'After plaintiffs had rested their case, the Ritaccos moved to dismiss the punitive damages claim; that claim was dismissed after the Letizios made no objection. The Ritaccos then rested; the attorneys gave their closing arguments; and the trial justice charged the jury on the law of negligence generally, and then specifically as to cases of premises liability with respect to invitees, informing them that, in order to find for the Letizios, they “must determine that the [d]efendants knew or should have known of the defect or condition which is alleged to have caused the [p]laintiff’s fall, and that the [d]efendants failed to remedy the defect or condition within a reasonable time.” He also instructed the jury regarding the adverse inferences it could draw from subsequent remedial measures, such as Mr. Ritacco placing ice melt on the driveway after Mrs.', '-6- Letizio’s fall. Neither party objected to the jury instructions. After deliberating, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the Ritaccos.', 'Subsequently, the Letizios moved for a new trial under Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and failed to do substantial justice between the parties. A hearing on the motion was held on August 22, 2017, and the trial justice issued a bench decision on August 31, 2017. In that decision, the trial justice set forth an in-depth analysis of the testimony of the four witnesses to the events that occurred on the evening of March 6, 2015. He took special note of the fact that there had been no precipitation on March 6, 2015, and he discounted the weight of the testimony regarding how the shadows in the driveway may have caused the ice to form. He also noted that the there was no dispute that the driveway was clear of snow to the pavement when Mrs. Letizio and her daughter arrived. Additionally, the trial justice stated that it was not per se negligent to not put ice melt on a driveway as a preventative measure. He then determined that, in light of all the evidence that he had discussed, and his instructions to the jury, he could not fault the jury for finding as they had in this case. After setting forth his duties under Rule 59, the trial justice stated:', '“The Supreme Court has explained * * * that where on the credible', 'evidence reasonable minds can differ as to the inferences to be', 'drawn from the evidence and the ultimate conclusion, that in that', 'case the verdict of the jury should stand. I think this is such a case,', 'and that’s the reason I’m going to deny the motion for a new trial.”', 'An order entered on September 8, 2017, denying the Letizios’ motion for a new trial; and, on September 14, 2017, the Letizios timely appealed to this Court.', '-7-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled that our review of a trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial is deferential.” Kemp v. PJC of Rhode Island, Inc., 184 A.3d 712, 719 (R.I. 2018) (brackets omitted) (quoting Bates-Bridgmon v. Heong’s Market, Inc., 152 A.3d 1137, 1143 (R.I. 2017)). “In considering a motion for a new trial, the trial justice sits as a super juror and is required to make an independent appraisal of the evidence in light of his or her charge to the jury.” Id. (brackets and deletion omitted) (quoting Berman v. Sitrin, 101 A.3d 1251, 1260 (R.I. 2014)). “If, after conducting this analysis, the trial justice concludes that the evidence is evenly balanced or that reasonable minds could differ on the verdict, she or he should not disturb the jury’s decision.” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Martin v. Lawrence, 79 A.3d 1275, 1283 (R.I. 2013)). “If the trial justice has performed this task, then his or her decision will not be disturbed unless the plaintiff can show that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id.

Nickerson Community Center, 177 A.3d 468, 476 (R.I. 2018)).', 'This case turns on the duty that landowners owe to those who enter onto their premises and, specifically, whether the Ritaccos breached that duty. “With respect to invitees and licensees, courts must determine whether landowners have satisfied their affirmative duty to exercise', '-8- reasonable care for the safety of all people reasonably expected to be upon the premises.” Bucki v. Hawkins, 914 A.2d 491, 495 (R.I. 2007). “That duty includes an obligation to protect against the risks of a dangerous condition existing on the premises, provided the landowner knows of, or by the exercise of reasonable care would have discovered, the dangerous condition.” Id. (brackets omitted) (quoting Mead v. Papa Razzi Restaurant, 840 A.2d 1103, 1107 (R.I. 2004)).', 'Consistent with this standard, the Letizios first argue that, while there was no evidence that Mr. Ritacco had actual knowledge of the ice on his driveway, there was overwhelming evidence that he had constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition; they contend that no reasonable person could have found otherwise. They base this argument on the fact that the stone steps and the part of the driveway on which Mrs. Letizio had fallen receive the same amount of sunlight during the day.', 'However, it is clear to us that the trial justice properly performed his task under Rule 59. He analyzed the testimony at trial, clearly considering the testimony that the driveway and stone steps received the same amount of sunlight. He also took into consideration, however, the fact that both Mr. Ritacco, and later, Mrs. Letizio, saw no ice on the driveway prior to the incident. To the trial justice, this case came down to the question of whether a “reasonably prudent New England homeowner” was required to perform an inspection on his property upon being informed of the existence of ice on his steps. In his decision, the trial justice stated: “My job now under Rule 59 is to review the evidence as I have, and exercise my independent judgment as to whether the jury verdict was supported by the evidence, and whether or not it did substantial justice between the parties.” In the end, he determined that he could not find fault in the fact that the jury rendered a verdict for the Ritaccos and that, therefore, this case fell squarely into the situation where if “the trial justice concludes that the evidence is evenly balanced or that reasonable minds could differ', '-9- on the verdict, she or he should not disturb the jury’s decision.” Kemp, 184 A.3d at 719 (brackets omitted) (quoting Martin, 79 A.3d at 1283).', 'Even so, the Letizios argue before this Court that the jury may have misunderstood that the Ritaccos did not need to have knowledge of the specific spot where the dangerous condition existed. They cite Aubin v. MAG Realty, LLC, 161 A.3d 1143 (R.I. 2017), to advance this contention. In that case, the plaintiff slipped and fell on a patch of ice in the parking lot of his apartment building. Aubin, 161 A.3d at 1145. The plaintiff sued the owner of the complex, alleging negligence. Id. The case went to trial, and the defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the plaintiff’s case, arguing that it had no notice of the dangerous, icy condition of the parking lot. Id. The trial justice granted the motion after both parties had rested, and the plaintiff appealed. Id.', 'On appeal, the defendant in Aubin argued that the decision granting judgment as a matter of law should be upheld because the plaintiff had only complained generally about icy conditions and the defendant had no knowledge of the specific patch of ice upon which the plaintiff fell. Aubin, 161 A.3d at 1147. We held that there was enough evidence to send the case to the jury, stating:', '“The defendant had notice that icy conditions were present on its', 'property during certain types of weather, and that icy conditions', 'would come and go as the weather changed. In our opinion, it would', 'be impractical to burden a tenant with the responsibility to call his', 'landlord every day to give notice of new patches of ice in order to', 'satisfy the notice requirement of a premises liability claim. Rather,', 'this burden is sustained by providing notice of the recurring', 'condition.” Id.', 'Unlike the motion for a new trial at issue here, the grant of the motion for judgment as a matter of law in Aubin was based on that trial justice’s determination that no reasonable juror could have found that the defendant had knowledge of the ice on the premises. See Aubin, 161 A.3d at', '- 10 - 1145. At trial in the present case, Mr. Ritacco testified that he knew that the area of the steps and driveway receive similar amounts of sun and was susceptible to refreezing when the temperature dropped. Certainly, as we held in Aubin, there may have been enough evidence for a jury to determine that the Ritaccos had constructive knowledge of the icy conditions generally. See id. at 1147. However, as the trial justice noted, reasonable minds could differ on this point, as there was evidence that Mrs. Letizio had not seen any ice on the driveway at the same time that she saw ice on the stone steps. Therefore the jury, and the trial justice acting as the super juror, was not required to make a finding that the Ritaccos had constructive notice of the ice on the driveway after receiving actual notice of the ice on the steps.', 'This Court has noted that “[a] plaintiff in a slip and fall case must present evidence of an unsafe condition on the premises of which the defendant was aware or should have been aware, and that the condition existed for a long enough time so the owner of the premises should have taken steps to correct the condition.” Kemp, 184 A.3d at 720 (quoting Bromaghim v. Furney, 808 A.2d 615, 617 (R.I. 2002)). In this case, from our review of the evidence, there was little testimony regarding how long the ice had been on the driveway. What we do know is that, when Mrs. Letizio exited her car sometime between 5:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. that evening, she did not see any ice on the driveway. Additionally, the weather had been dry for approximately twenty-four hours after the previous day’s light snowfall, meaning that no new precipitation had accumulated on the driveway between the time Mrs. Letizio left her car to enter the house and the time she fell on the driveway. Moreover, Mr. Ritacco testified that he had parked in the same spot as Mrs. Letizio earlier that day and had not noticed any ice on the driveway. Viewing this evidence together, it was reasonable for the jury, and later the trial justice, to find that the Ritaccos had no constructive knowledge of the ice on the driveway generally or on the specific patch upon which Mrs. Letizio slipped.', '- 11 -', 'Finally, the Letizios argue that the trial justice should have recognized that the Ritaccos had not fulfilled their duty as landowners to warn Mrs. Letizio of the icy condition of their driveway. While it is true that a landowner does have a duty to either remediate or warn licensees and invitees on their property, this duty does not arise unless and until the property owner has at least constructive knowledge of the dangerous condition. See Fisher v. Almac’s, Inc., 117 R.I. 244, 244-45, 366 A.2d 161, 162 (1976). Accordingly, without a finding that the Ritaccos had some knowledge of the icy condition on the driveway, no reasonable jury could have imposed liability on the Ritaccos, even for a failure to warn Mrs. Letizio of the dangerous condition on the driveway.', '“This Court has adhered to the long-standing principle that ‘generally, the question of negligence is a question of fact to be determined by the jury.’” Dent v. PRRC, Inc., 184 A.3d 649, 654 (R.I. 2018) (brackets and deletion omitted) (quoting Clarke v. Rhode Island Electric Lighting Co., 16 R.I. 463, 465, 17 A. 59, 60 (1889)). Here, in its role as factfinder, the jury seemingly rejected any possible inferences that could have been drawn in favor of the Letizios on the issue of the Ritaccos’ knowledge of the ice on the driveway when it determined that they were not negligent; the trial justice found that the jury’s determination was not in error because the evidence was evenly balanced in this case. After thorough consideration of the record before us, we are not convinced that the trial justice “overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong” in this case while acting in his capacity as super juror.

51,": In re: 25 Burnside Avenue, Narragansett, : Rhode Island. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. Kevin Hunt, an interested party in this receivership case, appeals from a Superior Court decision and order authorizing the permanent receiver to distribute the proceeds from the sale of 25 Burnside Avenue in Narragansett in accordance with the receiver’s recommendations. On appeal, Kevin argues that the Superior Court justice erred by (1) misreading and misapplying the provisions of a marital settlement agreement in distributing the proceeds from the sale of the property; (2) attributing the entire balance of an outstanding mortgage to Kevin’s share of the proceeds; and (3) ordering Kevin to pay rent retroactively. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.

Kevin and Allie had entered into a marriage settlement agreement (the MSA) on January 20, 2006, which was incorporated but not merged into the final judgment of divorce. Under the terms of the MSA, Kevin and Allie agreed that the property had a fair market value of $900,000 as of the date of the MSA.2 The MSA also provided that Kevin would vacate the property and Allie would have its exclusive use no later than April 15, 2006.', 'Section 3 of the MSA sets forth Kevin’s and Allie’s agreement with respect to the ultimate division and distribution of the property.

According to the Receiver’s Recommendation on Allowance of Claims, at the time of the MSA’s execution, the only recorded encumbrance was the 2004 Mortgage with Citizens Bank in the amount of $190,000. Approximately one month after the parties executed the MSA, an additional mortgage to Citizen Bank for $150,000 was executed and recorded. Kevin’s counsel represented to the Superior Court that the 2006 Mortgage had been applied for prior to the execution of the MSA. Even if the parties intended the MSA to reflect both mortgages, however, the $360,000 amount stated in the MSA exceeds the sum total ($340,000) of the 2004 Mortgage and the 2006 Mortgage ($190,000 and $150,000, respectively). 6', 'Both mortgages in this case were executed in favor of Citizens Bank of Rhode Island.

Similar to the 2004 Mortgage and the 2004 Note, both Kevin and Allie’s signatures appear on the 2006 mortgage deed, but only Kevin’s signature appears on the corresponding note. Allie has maintained throughout the receivership proceedings that she did not sign the 2006 mortgage deed. Allie does not dispute, however, that she signed the 2004 mortgage deed.', 'In early 2016, Allie learned that Citizens Bank had scheduled a sale of the property to foreclose upon the 2006 Mortgage.

Allie objected to this request at a May 31, 2016 hearing, noting that, as summer quickly approached, “[t]his is the time to be marketing and selling” the property because it is “prime beach-front property[.]” Allie suggested to the court that Kevin pay fair market rent for the valuable summer months if he was going to further delay the property’s sale.', 'The Superior Court denied Kevin’s request for additional time to gather his loan documents. Kevin next filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition on June 7, 2016, which, in effect, allowed him to remain at the property. The petition was eventually dismissed by the Bankruptcy Court on August 25, 2016.', 'In September 2016, the Receiver filed a motion for an order directing Kevin to immediately vacate the property, holding Kevin in contempt of court, and imposing sanctions against Kevin. In his motion, the Receiver stated that, at the May 23, 2016 hearing for the appointment of a permanent receiver as well as immediately after that hearing, he had informed Kevin that rent was required in order for Kevin to remain at the property. The Receiver argued that renting the property weekly during the summer season could have substantially contributed to the receivership estate.', 'The Superior Court granted the Receiver’s motion and ordered Kevin to vacate the property by October 18, 2016. The order provided that, if Kevin did not vacate the property by 11:59 p.m. on October 18, 2016, the court would hold a hearing at 9:30 a.m. on October 19, 2016, to consider whether Kevin should be held in contempt of court.

At that hearing, the Superior Court granted', '-6- Kevin an additional week to vacate the property; Kevin substantially complied with the order by removing himself and the children and most of his belongings.', 'Soon thereafter, the Receiver sold the property for $577,500. The sale closed on February 1, 2017. Citizens Bank had filed a motion to allow its secured claims related to the 2004 Mortgage and the 2006 Mortgage, which was granted on February 2, 2017. Allie filed a limited objection to the approval of the 2006 Mortgage, arguing that it should not be deducted against her interest because, despite what appears to be her signature on the document, she did not sign the 2006 mortgage deed, nor is her signature or name on the 2006 Note.', 'On February 17, 2017, the Receiver filed a First and Final Report (the Final Report) and, on February 19, 2017, he filed a Recommendation on Allowance of Claims (the Recommendation). The Recommendation suggested that Kevin’s past-due rent, calculated to be $38,250,8 should be added to the receivership estate, bringing the total cash-on-hand amount to $582,776.97. Next, the Receiver recommended that the receivership estate be divided equally, in accordance with the Sale Provision of the MSA, between Allie and Kevin, each being attributed $291,388.', 'The Recommendation then proposed that all court-approved administrative fees, costs, and expenses—estimated at $60,000—be deducted on the basis of a 30/70 split between Allie and Kevin, respectively. In the Final Report, the Receiver explained that Kevin “had caused numerous and substantial issues and delays” throughout the receivership proceedings, which had 8', 'The Receiver calculated the total amount of rent due based on a rental rate of $2,250 per month for the months of May 2016, September 2016, and October 2016, and at a rental rate of $2,250 per week for the months of June 2016, July 2016, and August 2016 (three months at $2,250 = $6,750; and fourteen weeks at $2,250 = $31,500, for a total of $38,250). This amount was based on the recommendation of the real estate agent who facilitated the sale of the property.', '-7- “substantially” increased the fees. Therefore, he recommended that Kevin “should bear a greater burden of the Receiver’s fees[.]”', 'Finally, the Receiver deducted the balance of the two Citizens Bank mortgages and an IRS claim solely from Kevin’s share. The Receiver charged the $209,422.04 owed Citizens Bank to Kevin because only Kevin had signed both the 2004 Note and the 2006 Note. The Receiver also reported that several IRS liens, related exclusively to Kevin or Kevin’s business, were filed against the property between December 2010 and April 2015, totaling over $323,000 with interest and penalties. The Receiver also included a final calculation of distribution, with an alternative calculation if the Superior Court determined that the 2004 Mortgage should be paid before distribution to Kevin and Allie.', 'Kevin filed a limited objection to the Final Report and the Recommendation on February 24, 2017. He objected to utilizing the Sale Provision, attributing the Citizens Bank loans solely to him, and charging him for past-due rent. He also objected to the 30/70 attribution of administrative fees; however, Kevin and Allie later resolved that dispute separately.', 'After conducting a hearing on March 3, 2017, and requesting supplemental memoranda from the parties, the Superior Court justice issued a decision on May 8, 2017, adopting the Receiver’s recommendations. In his decision, the Superior Court justice concluded that the MSA “unambiguously” sets forth two paths for equity distribution: one in which Kevin pays all the property-related expenses for four years and “buys out” the property from Allie at 38 percent of the net equity value on December 31, 2009; and one in which Kevin fails to make all of those payments, the property is subsequently sold, and Allie and Kevin split the net proceeds equally.', 'The Superior Court justice next concluded that making use of the Sale Provision is correct because Kevin did not make a “buyout” payment equivalent to 38 percent of the property’s net', '-8- equity to Allie on December 31, 2009. The Superior Court justice also determined that Allie was not responsible for the debts underlying the 2004 Mortgage and 2006 Mortgage because she did not sign the related notes. Finally, the Superior Court justice ruled that the Receiver’s allocation of past-due rent to Kevin was proper because Kevin’s financial obligations were reinstated upon the dismissal of the bankruptcy case.

Associates, 637 A.2d at 356 (emphasis in original).', 'As the Superior Court justice noted, when read in its entirety, the MSA clearly sets forth two ways in which the property can be distributed as a marital asset. First, the Buyout Provision gives Kevin the opportunity to “buyout” Allie’s interest in the property. Subsection 3(B) provides that Allie shall convey the property to Kevin “after the full and successful completion of all payments provided for herein[,]” which we deem to encompass both the four-year, property- related payments and the payment of 38 percent of the property’s net equity value as of December 31, 2009. The MSA specifically provides, in Subsection 3(E), that “[Allie] shall convey to [Kevin] all right, title, and interest in and to said property contemporaneous with [Kevin’s] payment of the net equity percentage due and owing to [Allie.]”', 'Alternatively, the Sale Provision provides for a contingent avenue if Kevin “is unable to make all payments as set forth herein[.]” In that case, the property is to be “placed on the market', '- 11 - for the best available price and sold as soon as possible” and the net proceeds are to be distributed equally.', 'We agree with the Superior Court justice that the contingent Sale Provision controls if the Buyout Provision is not perfected. Reading the MSA in an “ordinary, common sense manner[,]” Carney, 89 A.3d at 776 (quoting Paul, 982 A.2d at 993), the MSA first contemplates Kevin purchasing Allie’s interest for 38 percent of the net equity value; and, secondly, it contemplates selling the property and dividing the net proceeds equally. We are of the opinion that the MSA, when read as a whole, plainly requires Kevin to make two types of payments in order to utilize the Buyout Provision. Although he did pay the property-related expenses for the required four-year period, he never tendered the 38 percent net equity payment to Allie.', 'We are, therefore, satisfied that the Superior Court justice correctly interpreted the MSA in concluding that the net proceeds of the property are to be divided equally between Kevin and Allie.', 'B', 'Obligation of the Secured Claims', 'Kevin further argues that the Superior Court justice erred when he attributed the debt underlying the 2004 Mortgage solely to Kevin’s 50 percent share of the property’s proceeds. He argues that, pursuant to the MSA, the outstanding 2004 Mortgage should be deducted equally from both Allie and Kevin’s shares.11 The Superior Court justice determined that Allie’s lack of signature on the 2004 Note relieved her of any financial obligation to repay the loan under the 2004 Note. The Superior Court justice additionally reasoned that, because the relevant sentence 11', 'Kevin also argues that the Superior Court justice erred when he attributed the debt underlying the 2006 Mortgage to his share, but, as noted above, he concedes that he waived this argument for appeal.', '- 12 - in Subsection 3(D) provides that Allie was entitled to 50 percent of the net proceeds, the use of the 2004 Mortgage in calculating net equity was irrelevant. We disagree.', 'Whether the balance of the 2004 Mortgage is deducted from the total proceeds of the sale before distributing equal shares to Kevin and Allie, or whether the mortgage balance is deducted solely from Kevin’s share, turns on the meaning of the phrase “net proceeds.” The Sale Provision of the MSA provides that Allie shall receive “fifty (50%) [percent] of the net proceeds” from the sale, whereas the Buyout Provision states that she shall receive “thirty-eight (38%) percent of the then existing net equity after deducting from said fair market value the outstanding mortgage balance on the Citizens Bank Mortgage.” Moreover, in Subsection 3(A), Kevin and Allie agree that, at the time the MSA was executed, the fair market value of the property was $900,000, with an outstanding mortgage at the time of $360,000, “for net equity” of $540,000.12 Thus, it is clear that the parties intended to deduct the outstanding mortgage from the fair market value in arriving at the “net equity” value.', 'We are of the opinion that a similar interpretation applies to the term “net proceeds.” The fact that Allie did not sign the 2004 Note does not alter the analysis. She was clearly aware of the 2004 mortgage loan, she signed the mortgage deed, she recognized its existence in the MSA, and she agreed to deduct its outstanding balance in calculating the net equity value of the property. We are convinced, therefore, that the employment of the term “net proceeds” in this context is not ambiguous; it refers to the sale price of the real estate less all selling costs, including the payoff of existing mortgages. 12', 'As noted supra at n.5, the outstanding amount of the 2004 Mortgage at the time the MSA was executed was $190,000.', '- 13 -', 'Accordingly, we vacate paragraph two of the May 25, 2017 order to the extent that it deducts the entire balance of the 2004 Note from Kevin’s share of the proceeds, and we remand the case to the Superior Court for a recalculation of the distribution of the net proceeds. In doing so, however, we are mindful that the total payoff of the 2004 Note may include late fees, penalties, and costs attributable to Kevin’s failure to make payments in a timely manner. All such expenses should be charged to Kevin’s share of the proceeds.', 'C', 'Rent', 'Finally, Kevin maintains that the Superior Court justice erred when he required Kevin to reimburse the receivership estate $38,250 from his share of the proceeds for past-due rent, arguing that no court order or agreement ever existed requiring him to pay rent. He further contends that the Superior Court justice failed to specify when the rent “properly started.”', 'In fashioning the order with respect to the payment of past-due rent, it is clear that the Superior Court justice adopted the recommendation of the Receiver that the sum of $38,250 be added to the receivership estate before the estate be divided equally between Kevin and Allie. The Receiver detailed his calculations in the First and Final Report and the Request for Approval of Fees, Costs, and Expenses. He addressed rental payments for the period from April 26, 2016, through October 25, 2016, at the rate of $2,250 per month in May, September, and October, and at the rate of $2,250 per week during the months of June, July, and August. Although Kevin objected to the assessment of any past-due rent, he did not challenge the rental rates utilized by the Receiver.', 'It is our opinion that the Superior Court justice did not err in crediting the receivership estate the sum of $38,250 for the fair amount of rent that Kevin should have been paying during', '- 14 - the pendency of the receivership. Such an outcome is just and equitable in light of the fact that Kevin was able to reside in the former marital domicile for those six months rent-free, and in violation of a Family Court order.

Presuming that he was riding down a grassy slope on the side of a stairway, plaintiff was unaware of a series of concrete retaining walls located on the slope. The plaintiff alleged he was thrown from his bicycle after his tire became wedged in a crack in one of the concrete retaining walls. As a result, plaintiff sustained a double compound fracture to his left arm.', 'On February 18, 2013, plaintiff filed suit, asserting that defendants were negligent in maintaining the park. Pretrial discovery proceeded; in its interrogatory answers, the city stated that there had been no previously reported injuries in that area of the park.', 'During his deposition, John Arrighi (Arrighi), a city employee who performed routine maintenance work in the park, testified that at the end of each shift, city employees are required to prepare paper logs, which they call “trip tickets,” identifying the location and type of work performed during the shift. When shown a photograph of the area where plaintiff alleged that he had been injured, Arrighi confirmed that he did not observe the condition that was depicted in the photograph, and stated: “If I saw this, I would have documented it on my trip ticket. * * * [S]o it would have [gone] to the correct channel so it would have been repaired.” Arrighi testified that the trip tickets he personally filled out were “a lot more extensive” than a document, identified as an expenditure log, that he was shown during his deposition. 3', 'The record refers to this area as a “park.”', '-2-', 'Also during discovery, the city produced “Work Order Detail Reports” (work orders) and “Detailed Location Expenditures” (expenditure reports), documenting the maintenance work performed at the park.

The plaintiff filed an objection in which he contended that, under the doctrine of spoliation of evidence,5 the city’s destruction of the trip tickets gave rise to an adverse inference—namely, that the city knew about the defective condition of the retaining wall. According to plaintiff, this negative inference was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether an exception to the RUS applied in this case. 4', 'Under G.L. 1956 § 32-6-3,', '“an owner of land who either directly or indirectly invites or', 'permits without charge any person to use that property for', 'recreational purposes does not thereby:', '“(1) Extend any assurance that the premises are safe for any', 'purpose;', '“(2) Confer upon that person the legal status of an invitee', 'or licensee to whom a duty of care is owed; nor', '“(3) Assume responsibility for or incur liability for any', 'injury to any person or property caused by an act of omission of', 'that person.” 5', 'Spoliation is defined as “[t]he intentional destruction, mutilation, alteration, or concealment of evidence[.]” Black’s Law Dictionary 1620 (10th ed. 2014).', '-3-', 'On August 4, 2015, the motion for summary judgment was argued; and, in a bench ruling, a justice of the Superior Court determined that the only evidence before the court was “speculation that there may have been trip-tickets that would have documented the hazard.” Specifically, the hearing justice found that there was “no evidence that these tickets were destroyed in an attempt to conceal something from the plaintiff” and that there was “no other evidence that anyone had any knowledge of this defect[.]” Accordingly, the hearing justice concluded that “the plaintiff has not put forward sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact that would defeat the recreational use’s strong standard and show that the town was aware there was a strong likelihood of injury in that park.” The city’s motion for summary judgment was therefore granted, and final judgment subsequently entered in favor of defendants.

Napolitano, 911 A.2d 1035, 1038 (R.I. 2006). To accomplish this purpose, the RUS as originally enacted provided that those who come upon the private land of another for recreational purposes are considered to be trespassers, “thus greatly reducing the duty of care that owners owe to recreational users.” Symonds ex rel. Symonds v. City of Pawtucket, 126 A.3d 421, 424 (R.I. 2015). Although the RUS initially applied to private landowners, not governmental entities, in 1996, the RUS was amended by the Legislature to include within the umbrella of immunity publicly-owned recreational facilities. See § 32-6-2(3), as amended by P.L. 1996, ch. 234, § 1. So now, in the courts of this state, members of the public who frequent most public parks, beaches, and other recreational sites are viewed as trespassers to whom there is no duty to maintain these facilities in a reasonably safe condition.', 'However, the RUS’s immunity is “not absolute.” See Roy v. State, 139 A.3d 480, 488 (R.I. 2016). An exception to the RUS, § 32-6-5(a)(1), provides that the statute does not limit liability “[f]or the willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity after discovering the user’s peril[.]” As such, given that users of recreational properties are classified as trespassers, “landowners who open their land to the public for recreational use owe no duty to users of the property other than to refrain from willful or wanton conduct after a user of the property is discovered in peril.” Symonds ex rel. Symonds, 126 A.3d at 424 (citing Berman v.

Thus, the city is immune from liability under the RUS. Before this Court, plaintiff contends that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the exception set forth in § 32-6- 5(a)(1) applies in this case. The fragile premise upon which this appeal rests is the alleged spoliation of the trip tickets.', 'The plaintiff asserts that, because the trip tickets may have contained detailed notes regarding the condition of the area where plaintiff had sustained injury, the city’s alleged destruction of the trip tickets raised the adverse inference that the city knew about the defective condition of the wall and failed to guard or warn against it. We reject this contention.', 'Spoliation of Evidence', 'Under the doctrine of spoliation of evidence, “the deliberate or negligent destruction of relevant evidence by a party to litigation may give rise to an inference that the destroyed evidence was unfavorable to that party.” Tancrelle v. Friendly Ice Cream Corporation, 756 A.2d 744, 748 (R.I. 2000); see also McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 282 (R.I. 2012); Mead v. Papa Razzi Restaurant, 840 A.2d 1103, 1108 (R.I. 2004) (Mead I). “Although a spoliation instruction is improper when ‘the destruction was a matter of routine with no fraudulent intent,’ it is appropriate when ‘the act was intentional or intended to suppress the truth.’” State v. Roberts, 841 A.2d 175, 180 (R.I. 2003) (quoting State v. Barnes, 777 A.2d 140, 145 (R.I. 2001)); see Mead v. Papa Razzi, 899 A.2d 437, 442-43 (R.I. 2006) (recognizing that this Court has held that a spoliation instruction was appropriate “where a corporate defendant (1) failed to produce a document which the evidence tended to show was routinely generated by the corporation and', '-6- (2) was unable to provide a satisfactory explanation as to why the document was not prepared with respect to the incident in the case before the court”).', 'In Mead I, this Court determined that the spoliation doctrine applied where a defendant failed to produce an incident report which, it was undisputed, was systematically prepared and retained in accordance with its mandatory corporate policy, without a “satisfactory explanation” as to why a report was not available with respect to the incident before the court. Mead I, 840 A.2d at 1108; see also Kurczy v. St. Joseph Veterans Association, Inc., 820 A.2d 929, 947 (R.I. 2003) (upholding spoliation instruction when a defendant failed to produce board-meeting minutes despite testimony that minutes were normally retained in the ordinary course of the board’s business).', 'In contrast, there is no indication in the record before us that defendants deliberately or negligently destroyed evidence in anticipation of trial. Unlike Mead I, there is no evidence that the city routinely retained trip tickets in the regular course, nor is there any evidence that defendants tactically discarded only those trip tickets pertaining to plaintiff’s accident. As noted by the hearing justice, “[t]here’s no evidence that these tickets were destroyed in an attempt to conceal something from the plaintiff.” Rather, the record suggests that the information on the handwritten trip tickets was manually transcribed into computer-generated forms, such as the work orders and expenditure reports.6 Moreover, defendants aptly note that the use of trip tickets as a means of gathering information that is then transcribed into the computer-generated work 6', 'During his deposition, Arrighi was asked about the process for submitting trip tickets. Arrighi explained: “There’s a bracket on the wall where everyone puts their sheets, and I believe it goes to the secretary.” When subsequently asked whether the secretary used the information from the trip tickets to complete the expenditure forms, Arrighi responded: “I don’t know. I assume that’s how that gets to that, yes.”', '-7- orders and expenditure reports “provides more than a satisfactory explanation as to why the hand-written notes are not routinely kept by the [c]ity.”', 'Because there is no evidence that the city acted deliberately, negligently, or in bad faith with regard to the trip tickets, the spoliation doctrine is inapplicable in this case. Accordingly, the hearing justice did not err in finding that the spoliation doctrine did not apply to the circumstances presented by this case.', 'The § 32-6-5(a)(1) Exception to the RUS', 'Even if the alleged destruction of the trip tickets warranted an application of the spoliation doctrine, this only permits the drawing of an inference that the city was on notice that the retaining wall had a defect and was in need of repair. However, notice of a defective condition alone is not enough to bring plaintiff’s claim within the exception to the RUS.', 'The plaintiff contends that the city’s implied knowledge of a defect in the wall is sufficient to prove “willful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition * * * after discovering the user’s peril[.]” Section 32-6-5(a)(1). To support his argument, plaintiff asserts that, according to Berman, notice of a defective condition is sufficient to show willful and malicious conduct. This assertion is misplaced.', 'In Berman, the plaintiff sustained catastrophic injury when he walked down what appeared to be a path leading off Newport’s famed Cliff Walk and the ground beneath him gave way. Berman, 991 A.2d at 1042. There were no signs warning of this grave danger. Id. at 1055. In deciding whether the City of Newport had “discovered the user’s peril[,]” this Court “interpreted the term ‘discovering’ as used in § 32-6-5(a)(1) liberally and held that it included incidents where the City of Newport had not come upon a specific user in peril but had been put on sufficient notice of a dangerous condition.” Cancel v. City of Providence, 187 A.3d 347, 351', '-8- (R.I. 2018) (discussing Berman, 991 A.2d at 1049, 1050, 1051). Notably, this Court held that “[i]t is because of the multiple incidents of death and grievous injury that we conclude that the city [could] not successfully defend [the plaintiff’s] claim based on an assertion that it had no specific knowledge of [the plaintiff] or any peril confronting him.” Berman, 991 A.2d at 1051. Accordingly, this Court held that “a fact-finder reasonably could find that * * * the city voluntarily and intentionally failed to guard against the dangerous condition, knowing that there existed a strong likelihood that a visitor to the Cliff Walk would suffer serious injury or death.” Id. at 1052.', 'After viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, we are of the opinion that the facts and circumstances of this case are far from the extreme and egregious conduct attributed to the City of Newport in Berman. This Court declared in Berman that the City of Newport could not seek the protections of the RUS because of the numerous prior incidents of death and serious injury. Id. at 1051. We determined that the City of Newport knew that the plaintiff and other users were in a position of peril and was on notice of the defective condition of the Cliff Walk. Id. As this Court emphasized, “it [was] the number of serious injuries flowing from a known risk that brings us to this conclusion today.” Id. Unlike Berman, however, the record before the Court in the case at bar is devoid of any evidence that anyone else had ever been injured by the retaining wall or that the city was notified about its defective condition. Furthermore, the record before us lacks any indication that defendants had actual knowledge of the condition, had received complaints about the surrounding area, or had notice of any past incidents resulting from the defective condition of the retaining wall. As there simply is no evidence to support a finding that the city “willful[ly] or malicious[ly] fail[ed] to guard or warn against a dangerous condition * * * after discovering the user’s peril[,]” § 32-6-5(a)(1), we', '-9- see no error in the hearing justice’s refusal to apply the exception of § 32-6-5(a)(1) to plaintiff’s claim.', 'In a final attempt to prevent this claim from falling through the cracks, the plaintiff seeks to have this Court examine the definition of the term “peril.” See Lacey v. Reitsma, 899 A.2d 455, 456, 458 (R.I. 2006) (holding that § 32-6-5(a)(1) was inapplicable where the plaintiff, a nine-year-old boy, veered over a cliff while riding his bicycle in a state park, because there was no evidence that the defendants discovered the plaintiff “in a position of peril and then failed to warn him against the potentially dangerous condition”). In essence, the plaintiff asserts that the defective condition of the retaining wall placed him in a “position of peril” because it exposed him to a risk of harm. Nonetheless, because the plaintiff failed to raise this argument in the Superior Court, our raise-or-waive rule precludes us from addressing that contention.', 'See Waterman v. Caprio, 983 A.2d 841, 847-48 (R.I. 2009) (“According to our oft-repeated ‘raise or waive’ rule, we will not address an issue that was not presented to the trial court.”).

53,State : v. : Daniel Lastarza. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. The defendant, Daniel Lastarza (defendant), is before the Supreme Court on appeal from a judgment of conviction following a jury finding of guilty of second-degree murder, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1. The trial justice sentenced defendant to fifty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with forty years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation for the entirety of his sentence. On appeal, the defendant advances two arguments. First, he contends that the trial justice erred when she failed to instruct the jury on the lesser-included offense of voluntary manslaughter. Next, the defendant assigns error to the trial justice’s refusal to grant a mistrial based on alleged improper comments by the state’s attorney during closing argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On July 23, 2014, defendant and Christopher Tucker (Tucker), a neighborhood acquaintance of about two months, devised a plan whereby they would perpetrate a scam upon a scrap-metal salvage company known as “I Buy Junk Cars, LLC” (the company) by selling a broken down 2001 Ford Expedition—a vehicle that neither man owned—to the company. This scheme was neither well-planned nor carefully executed, and had a catastrophic conclusion. It', '-1- began when defendant arrived by bicycle at 149 Ridge Street, a multifamily building located in Providence, where Tucker resided. After he gave the Ford Expedition a cursory inspection in the backyard, defendant called the company and spoke with the owner, Jonathan Stack (Stack). The defendant described the make, model, and characteristics of the vehicle to Stack, and the two agreed that the company would purchase the Expedition and tow it away for $400. One of Stack’s drivers was dispatched to retrieve the vehicle.', 'Approximately ten minutes later, Jerry Nassi, Jr. (Nassi), a tow-truck driver and employee of the company, received a text message from Stack with a phone number to call and schedule a time to buy and tow the vehicle. When Nassi contacted defendant, a meeting was arranged at the Ridge Street location to complete the transaction. However, Nassi’s arrival was postponed by defendant when the true owner of the Ford Expedition, John Rocha (Rocha), a maintenance worker for 149 Ridge Street, showed up to work at the property.', 'At approximately 3 p.m., when the coast was clear, defendant notified Nassi that he could come and tow the vehicle. The defendant had falsely identified himself as “Peter” when he spoke to both Stack and Nassi because, according to his trial testimony, he was “scamming [Stack] out of a junk car”; he also told Nassi when he arrived that he owned the building and that the “owner” of the vehicle lived on the third floor. The defendant explained to Nassi that he was coordinating the sale because the “owner” was behind on rent. Nassi proceeded to the third floor of the building, where he met Kristen Litzenberger (Litzenberger), Tucker’s wife, and the putative owner of the vehicle. Together, Nassi and Litzenberger filled out the bill of sale for the vehicle, and Nassi paid her $400 in cash. Nassi then went back downstairs, intending to tow the vehicle. It did not go well.', 'As Nassi backed his tow truck into the driveway, an irate Rocha suddenly reappeared and informed Nassi that the vehicle belonged to him, not Litzenberger, and that he was going to call', '-2- the police. As Rocha was calling the police, however, Tucker came out of the building and sought to turn the tables by accusing Nassi of trying to steal the vehicle and saying that Nassi “set his girl up” and had not given them the money. Nassi thereupon produced the signed bill of sale, and Tucker attempted to grab it out of his hands. Tucker then took a swing at Nassi, just grazing him; and, failing that, Tucker retreated inside the building. Unfortunately, the events of this failed caper spiraled out of control.', 'While Nassi and Rocha waited for the police, Nassi called Stack and explained the situation. When Stack arrived on scene, Tucker and defendant were nowhere in sight. This was the first in a series of disappearances and reappearances by this felonious duo. Approximately two hours later, the police arrived; took statements from Nassi, Stack, and Rocha; and arrested Litzenberger. As Nassi and Stack left 149 Ridge Street together at approximately 5:30 p.m., Stack spotted Tucker, who he apparently recognized from the description that Nassi had given to the police, standing on Atwells Avenue; Nassi pulled the truck over, just past The $3 Bar, a drinking establishment located on Atwells Avenue (the bar). Stack jumped out of the truck and ran to confront Tucker. The confrontation moved inside the bar, with Tucker and Stack arguing; Stack threatened to call the police and have Tucker arrested. As they continued to argue, Nassi appeared and the men moved deeper into the bar; eventually, the trio left through the back door. In the rear parking lot of the bar, the dispute became violent.', 'Stack and Tucker began pushing and shoving each other when, suddenly, Tucker grabbed Stack in a headlock and flipped him over, onto the ground. Tucker began to choke Stack by pressing his forearm across Stack’s throat. Up until this point, Nassi was a bystander until he heard Stack say, “he’s biting me, he’s choking [me], get him the F off of me.” When Nassi’s efforts to pull Tucker away from Stack failed, he began punching Tucker in order to separate him from Stack.', '-3-', 'Unbeknownst to the three men, defendant was lurking behind a fence, watching as the physical altercation unfolded. According to defendant’s trial testimony, in an attempt to defend Tucker, who was being beaten by Nassi, defendant grabbed a “charred wooden” two-by-four1 from an outdoor fireplace and ran toward the trio. The defendant struck Nassi with the board, and Nassi retreated a short distance away. As Stack lay on the ground, defendant delivered two fatal blows to Stack’s head. Nassi returned to Stack’s side; Nassi testified that Stack “was bleeding from his mouth, his head was crushed * * * there was just a lot of blood.” Nassi rolled Stack onto his side to keep him from choking while he waited for an ambulance to arrive. Stack succumbed to his injuries on July 26, 2014.', 'While Nassi remained with Stack, defendant and Tucker ran towards Kenyon Street, about two blocks away from the scene. At that point, the events took another bizarre turn. The defendant proceeded to call the police and reported that “Tucker had been beaten by two men * * * with sticks[.]” He then returned to the area surrounding the bar, where Providence police officers had begun an investigation.', 'In an apparent effort to deflect his guilt, defendant interjected himself into the police investigation. As Nassi and a Providence police detective were talking, defendant approached the detective and pointed to Nassi, identifying him as the person who “tried to * * * kill the guy[.]” Nassi was placed in the back of a police cruiser and, according to Nassi, as defendant walked away, “he looked back at [Nassi] and he smiled and, like, waved, like, very―like he was slick. He got away with something.”', 'The defendant next approached Detective James Clift, a police detective assigned to the Bureau of Criminal Identification, and informed the detective that he had witnessed the assault. Detective Clift asked defendant to walk with him back to the scene, where he asked Detective 1', 'The board itself was two inches by two-and-three-quarter inches wide, just over forty-three inches long, and weighed approximately three pounds.', '-4- Koren Pacheco Garcia to speak with defendant and “find out exactly what he had seen during the altercation.” As Det. Clift continued his investigation, the owner of a neighboring restaurant approached him and told him that there was a man sitting out front eating Chinese food who, according to his workers, was involved in the altercation. Detective Clift and another officer immediately proceeded to the front of the restaurant and saw that it was defendant who was sitting in the doorway, eating Chinese food. Detective Clift approached defendant and asked if he had given a statement yet. The defendant replied that he had the detective’s phone number and was going to call her later to give his statement.', 'Detective Clift conferred with another officer and went back to speak to defendant, who had fled the scene yet again. A search ensued, and defendant was spotted on his bicycle, pedaling away for the last time. Detective Clift then learned that defendant had given a false name during his interaction with Det. Pacheco Garcia, and he immediately placed a radio alert to locate defendant in the area.', 'The defendant went to 9 Lyon Court in Providence, the home of his girlfriend, Joanne Kissinger (Kissinger). Kissinger testified that, as they sat together on the patio, defendant “appeared to be very distraught” while he continued to eat his Chinese food. She explained that tears were welling up in his eyes as he started telling Kissinger about the events leading up to the fatal encounter; she testified, however, that defendant told her that he had told the police “everything that happened” and gave them his contact information. As the two were speaking, defendant was also trying to call his son and, after several failed attempts, texted his son saying, “Please call me. I’m going to jail for putting Johnny Stack in the hospital.” Within minutes, the police arrived and questioned defendant about his having given them a different name. The defendant stated that he believed there was a warrant for his arrest. He was taken into custody.', '-5-', 'Detective Clift and his intrepid team were able to retrieve security tapes from several locations that depicted many of the details that had been recounted to them by the witnesses they had interviewed, including the actual assault. On January 16, 2015, a grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with one count of murder, in violation of § 11-23-1, and one count of assault with a dangerous weapon, “to wit, a wooden 2 x 4 framing stud,” in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2, for the alleged assault on Nassi. Trial commenced on November 29, 2016, and on December 8, 2016, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as to second-degree murder on count one. The defendant was acquitted of assault with a dangerous weapon. The defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied, and a judgment of conviction entered on March 24, 2017. The defendant timely appealed.', 'Analysis', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she failed to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter and instead gave an involuntary-manslaughter instruction, which involved factual prerequisites that did not exist in this case. The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred in refusing to declare a mistrial based on what he characterizes as the state’s “wholly improper” statements made during closing argument and, further, that the cautionary instructions given by the trial justice failed to dispel the prejudicial effect of the state’s summation.', 'The Jury Instructions', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews issues pertaining to jury instructions on a de novo basis.

However, defendant concedes that he did not object to the trial justice’s instructions on second-degree murder or involuntary manslaughter. Despite an opportunity to review the jury instructions before the charge and an opportunity to be heard at sidebar, defendant failed to articulate an objection at trial, as required by Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.2 See State v. Marrapese, 116 R.I. 1, 11, 351 A.2d 95, 100 (1976) (explaining that failure of trial counsel to articulate their objections at the time instructions were given to the jury as required by Rule 30 precluded “appellate counsel from attempting to launch a belated challenge to the sufficiency of the charge”).', 'Clearly, defendant’s failure to object to the jury instructions is fatal to his appellate contentions.3 A party must proffer a specific objection at trial so that the trial justice is alerted to 2', 'Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides in part: “No party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the party’s objection.” 3', 'In fact, not only did defendant fail to object to the involuntary manslaughter instruction, defendant argued involuntary manslaughter (an unintentional killing) and not voluntary manslaughter (an intentional killing) in his closing argument to the jury:', '-7- the allegation of error and thus has an opportunity to rule on it.

Hunt, 137 A.3d 689, 693 (R.I. 2016). Because defendant’s contention was not properly preserved for appellate review and there is no issue of constitutional dimension presented, defendant has waived the issue on appeal. See State v. Davis, 877 A.2d 642, 648 (R.I. 2005) (“The failure to contemporaneously object to the trial justice’s instructions results in a waiver of any claim of error on appeal, unless, in the rare instance, ‘the alleged error rises to substantial constitutional dimensions.’”) (quoting Jefferson v.

In this case, contrary to defendant’s contentions, the prosecutor’s statements during closing argument were based in large part upon the evidence and testimony adduced at trial. For example, defendant took the stand and testified that he was, in fact, “scamming [Stack] for the car”; that it was not his “first time” junking a car that did not belong to him (conduct also known as larceny); and that it was “fair to say [he] lied to the police” several times during the investigation.', '-9-', 'Also bearing on his credibility, defendant acknowledged, before the jury, a lengthy criminal history that included eight stolen-car convictions, five larceny convictions, two breaking-and-entering convictions, fraudulent use of a credit card, eluding police, and obstruction of justice. It is clear from the record that the jury was confronted with the sworn testimony of an admitted liar and a thief who tried to convince the jury that he acted in defense of Tucker, and that he therefore should be absolved of any criminal responsibility. It was the state’s burden in this case to disprove beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted in self- defense. In the context of the record of this case, we find nothing inflammatory or overtly prejudicial in these accurate statements. A criminal defendant is not entitled to a sanitized version of the facts or to be shielded from his own testimony.', 'On several occasions, this Court has held that “[a] prosecutor is given considerable latitude in closing argument, as long as the statements pertain only to the evidence presented and represent reasonable inferences from the record.” State v. Boillard, 789 A.2d 881, 885 (R.I. 2002). “[W]hile there is no formula in law which precisely delineates the proper bounds of a prosecutor’s argument, prejudice obviously inheres if the remarks are totally extraneous to the issues in the case and tend to inflame and arouse the passions of the jury.” Id. (deletion omitted) (quoting State v. Mancini, 108 R.I. 261, 273-74, 274 A.2d 742, 748 (1971)). “The probable effect of the prosecutorial statements on the outcome of the case must be evaluated by examining the remarks in the context in which they were made.” Id.', 'When defendant elected to testify on his own behalf at trial, he placed his credibility in issue; he then volunteered information about his past crimes and the scam that ended with Stack’s murder.', 'It is our opinion that the prosecutor’s statement did not exceed the “considerable latitude” he was allowed as it “pertain[ed] only to the evidence presented.” State v. Horton, 871 A.2d 959, 965 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885). We note that,', '- 10 - “while incidents of prosecutorial name-calling during closing arguments are inappropriate and unacceptable,” id., the comments made by the prosecutor in this case did not cross that line. Nothing the prosecutor said was “totally extraneous to the issues in the case[,]” Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885, and, because the prosecutor’s remarks specifically addressed defendant’s performance on the witness stand, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not err in denying the motion for a mistrial in relation to the prosecutor’s closing remarks.', 'Moreover, defendant’s argument concerning the insufficiency of the cautionary instructions without any evidence “that the jury was not capable of complying with the trial justice[’]s cautionary instruction” is without merit. See State v. Disla, 874 A.2d 190, 198 (R.I. 2005) (quoting State v. Powers, 566 A.2d 1298, 1304 (R.I. 1989)). After the state’s closing argument and defendant’s motion for a mistrial, the trial justice instructed the jury as follows:', '“As jurors, you are concerned with facts determined from', 'testimony and other evidence. You are the judges of a witness’[s]', 'credibility. You determine what amount of weight should be given', 'to each witness’[s] testimony. It is the duty of the [c]ourt to', 'instruct you on the law of the case. The law is to be applied by me', 'to the facts in the case as you determine those facts to be. To the', 'extent the attorneys here have in any way offered their personal', 'opinion of what the facts in this case are, or their opinion on the', 'weight of evidence, such suggestions are of no moment. It is', 'entirely up to you to determine the facts and the weight to be given', 'to the testimony and evidence.”', 'In spite of the defendant’s contention that the cautionary instructions “could not dispel the prejudicial effect of the state’s summation[,]” we perceive nothing in the record that indicates that any taint that might have existed was not cured by the trial justice’s curative instruction. See State v. McManus, 941 A.2d 222, 234 (R.I. 2008) (explaining that nothing before the Court would lead to a finding that the jury could not decide the case “based on a dispassionate evaluation of the evidence”) (quoting State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1034 (R.I. 2004)). In fact, because the defendant was acquitted of one of the two counts of the indictment, for the alleged', '- 11 - assault on Nassi, we are convinced that the jury decided this case based upon the evidence adduced at trial and was not prejudiced by the prosecutor’s closing argument. Our review of the record fails to reveal that the jury was unable to comply with the trial justice’s cautionary instruction, and we “must assume that the jury did disregard the witness comments as it was instructed to do.” Disla, 874 A.2d at 198 (quoting Powers, 566 A.2d at 1304). We are therefore satisfied that, in the circumstances of this case, the cautionary instruction cured the prejudice created by the prosecutor’s comments labeling defendant as a “scam artist[,]” “liar[,]” and a “thief.”', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.

54,State : v. : Julio Morais. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. After a bench trial in Providence County Superior Court, the trial justice found the defendant, Julio Morais (defendant), guilty of four counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred, pursuant to Rule 23(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, when he accepted a jury-waiver form that the defendant had signed outside the presence of the trial justice; thus, the defendant contends that the trial justice lacked jurisdiction to conduct a bench trial. The defendant further contends that his colloquy with the trial justice failed to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial. Finally, the defendant argues that the trial justice did not adequately explain the differences between a jury trial and a bench trial. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In light of the nature of defendant’s appeal now before us, we do not deem it necessary to discuss the specific and graphic nature of the criminal activity for which defendant stands', '-1- convicted. We simply note that on December 9, 2010, defendant was charged by criminal indictment with five counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.1 and 11-37-8.2, for alleged incidents involving his stepdaughter. Prior to trial, defendant signed a jury-waiver form in the cellblock of the Providence County courthouse—the validity of which is at issue in this appeal. On September 9, 2013, after defendant had signed the jury-waiver form, the following colloquy transpired between the trial justice and defendant, on the record, in open court:', '“THE COURT:', 'Sir, there is one other thing that we', 'will do today, before we will begin', 'the trial. The State has all of or', 'many of their witnesses all set to go', 'tomorrow so we won’t be doing', 'anything today on your trial, except', 'it is my understanding that you have', 'made a decision in this case to give', 'up your right to a jury trial. Is that', 'correct, sir?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'That is true.', '“THE COURT:', 'Before you do that, sir, I want to', 'make sure you understand that you', 'have a constitutional right to have a', 'trial by jury and that jury would', 'consist of your fellow citizens here', 'in the State of Rhode Island. They', 'come in for jury duty and then we', 'have a process of selecting them, and', 'in a criminal case like this we would', 'have 12 jurors sit right over there in', 'the jury box and listen to the case', 'and make a decision as to your guilt', 'or innocence at the end of the trial', 'and it is my understanding, sir, you', 'do not want a jury trial, correct?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'No, I do not.', '“THE COURT:', 'So you are asking that I make the', 'decision as the Judge at the end of', '-2-', 'the case that I will make the decision', 'as the judge in this trial as to your', 'guilt or innocence? Correct, sir?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'Yes.', '“THE COURT:', 'And you are comfortable doing that?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'Yes.', '“THE COURT:', 'And I’m sure you spoke to * * *', 'your attorney about that and he—', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'Yes.', '“THE COURT:', 'And he answered any questions you', 'may have had about how that process', 'works?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'Yes.', '“THE COURT:', 'And you understand what you are', 'doing?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'Yes.', '“THE COURT:', 'You are not confused at all?', '“THE DEFENDANT:', 'No.', '“THE COURT:', 'All right.', 'Well, this defendant', 'appears to be articulate and appears', 'to understand the nature of the right', 'that he is giving up, and has elected', 'to proceed to a bench trial with a', 'decision [that] will be made by the', 'Judge rather than electing trial by', 'jury. So, I have a form in front of', 'me. I’m going to sign it.” Following a brief discussion regarding other matters, the trial justice stated: “I have signed his waiver of jury trial. It is a voluntary and knowing waiver[.]”', 'While the record indicates that the colloquy was between the trial justice and defendant, we note that, because English is not defendant’s first language, a Creole interpreter was present', '-3- and assisted defendant throughout the above discussion and during the course of trial.1 Moreover, in an affidavit submitted as part of his appeal, defendant attested that his attorney and the interpreter were present in the cellblock when he signed the jury-waiver form.', 'Thereafter, the matter proceeded to a bench trial, which ran from September 10, 2013, until September 18, 2013. The trial justice ultimately found defendant guilty of four counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault and sentenced him, on November 18, 2013, to four concurrent fifty-year sentences, with thirty-five years to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions and fifteen years suspended, with probation.2 On November 19, 2013, defendant filed a timely notice of appeal. On appeal, defendant challenges the trial justice’s jurisdiction to preside over his bench trial on the basis that defendant signed his jury-waiver form outside of the presence of the trial justice and also alleges that the trial justice’s colloquy with defendant was inadequate to establish a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his right to a jury trial.3', 'On November 28, 2017, this Court granted defendant’s request—uncontested by the state—to “remand the * * * case to the Superior Court for the purpose of conducting a brief hearing to determine where [defendant] signed the jury waiver form * * * and further, to hold [defendant’s] appeal in abeyance until the trial justice makes that determination.” The trial justice held a hearing for that purpose on January 19, 2018.', 'During that hearing, after 1', 'At the outset of the proceedings on September 9, 2013, the trial justice stated: “I want the record to reflect that throughout this trial we have this interpreter assisting the defendant so he can fully understand the nature of these proceedings obviously with the assistance of that interpreter. So she will be seated with [defense counsel] and the defendant throughout the trial.” 2', 'Prior to trial, the state dismissed count five pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 3', 'The defendant’s privately-retained trial counsel filed the timely notice of appeal; however, the trial transcript was not ordered at that time, and therefore the appeal was not docketed in this Court. In the summer of 2016, defendant contacted the Office of the Public Defender. After the office interviewed defendant and found him to be financially eligible, it ordered the trial transcript. The defendant’s appeal was docketed in this Court on March 29, 2017.', '-4- acknowledging his lack of recall regarding the specific series of events of the 2013 trial, the trial justice explained the following on the record:', '“I can say that when we reach that point in a case, what typically', 'happens in almost every case that I can recall is I take the bench', 'when the defendant is already in the courtroom with defense', 'counsel. I am handed the waiver of jury trial forms. I then review', 'that form with the defendant, in particular verifying that he did in', 'fact sign it, that he did in fact discuss it to whatever extent he', 'needed to with his attorney. I hold the form up and say is that your', 'signature, and sometimes have a brief colloquy. So, I’m satisfied', 'that he understands that he is giving up the right to have the case', 'tried in front of a group of his fellow citizens from the State and', 'that I would be the fact finder and decider of the case in a jury', 'waived trial. I do that consistently, but obviously that process', 'from beginning to end does not focus and has never focused on', 'where the document was actually signed.', '“So, I agree that there is nothing in the colloquy in this case that', 'indicates where the form was signed, and it is not a question I', 'typically ask. So, in this case I cannot say whether the form was', 'signed in the courtroom, in another location such as the cell block,', 'I really have no independent recollection of where the form was', 'signed that was reviewed with the defendant.” Thereafter, defendant’s case was returned to this Court for full briefing and argument.', 'In challenging the trial justice’s jurisdiction over his trial, defendant contends that “he signed the jury waiver form—drafted in a language that he does not speak or read—while being held under lock and key in the Licht Courthouse cellblock.” Thus, he argues that his written waiver was invalid under Rule 23(a)’s open-court requirement. Further, defendant avers that, even if the written requirement was satisfied, the trial justice’s colloquy with defendant was inadequate because the trial justice erred in not considering certain factors in making his determination on defendant’s knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver and the trial justice did not address certain distinctions between a jury trial and a bench trial. On the other hand, the state argues that the written waiver requirement of Rule 23(a) was met because defendant', '-5- acknowledged in a sworn affidavit that he had executed the waiver prior to trial. In addition, the state posits that the trial justice adequately ensured that defendant’s waiver of a jury trial was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“When interpreting statutes and court rules, we apply a de novo standard of review.” State v. Goncalves, 941 A.2d 842, 847 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Brown, 898 A.2d 69, 76 (R.I. 2006)). “In construing statutes or court rules, it is a fundamental principle of our jurisprudence that ‘when the language of a rule is clear and unambiguous, this Court must give the words of the rule their plain and ordinary meanings.’” Cashman Equipment Corporation, Inc. v.

Moreau, 119 A.3d 1, 9 (R.I. 2015)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'As we have explained, “Rhode Island law is well settled that a criminally accused defendant has an absolute right to waive a trial by jury if the waiver is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.” State v. Moran, 605 A.2d 494, 496 (R.I. 1992); see G.L. 1956 § 12-17-3; Super. R. Crim. P. 23(a); but see Singer v. United States, 380 U.S. 24, 26 (1965) (holding that there is no federal constitutional right to a jury-waived trial). “This substantive right to invoke a bench trial belongs to the defendant and is subject only to the procedural requirement that a trial justice determine that the defendant understands and accepts the consequences of executing a waiver[,]”', '-6- pursuant to Rule 23 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Moran, 605 A.2d at 496. Rule 23(a) provides that “[c]ases required to be tried by jury shall be so tried unless the defendant in open court waives a jury trial in writing with the approval of the court.”', 'The defendant avers that the language of Rule 23(a) requires that the waiver form be signed in the presence of the trial justice and that a defendant’s understanding of his waiver be placed on the record in open court. The defendant cites to our opinions in State v. DiStefano, 593 A.2d 1351 (R.I. 1991), and State v. Paull, 739 A.2d 661 (R.I. 1999), in support of his position that his jury-trial waiver was void. In DiStefano, the defendants voluntarily waived their rights to a jury trial, orally, in open court; however, the defendants did not, and were not asked to, put their waivers in writing. DiStefano, 593 A.2d at 1352. Accordingly, this Court held on appeal that the defendants had not properly waived a trial by jury because a written waiver was required pursuant to Rule 23(a). Id. In Paull, the defendant orally waived his right to a jury trial in open court prior to a one-day bench trial at which the trial justice found the defendant guilty. Paull, 739 A.2d at 661. Following his conviction, the defendant signed a jury-trial waiver form while he awaited transportation to the ACI. Id. Again, we held that the defendant’s waiver did not abide by the standards of Rule 23(a) and that his waiver was therefore invalid. Id. at 662.', 'We did not hold in those cases, however, that a defendant must sign and execute a written waiver in open court before the trial justice.', 'Accordingly, because it is undisputed—as evidenced by defendant’s affidavit—that defendant signed the jury-waiver form prior to the commencement of his bench trial, and because a waiver colloquy took place in open court on the record, our opinions in DiStefano and Paull are factually distinguishable from the facts of the case now before us.', '-7-', 'We next consider the language of Rule 23(a) in light of our rules of statutory and court rule interpretation. In DiStefano, we explained that “an examination of decisions from other jurisdictions reveals that criminal rules of court pertaining to jury waiver are often strictly construed.” DiStefano, 593 A.2d at 1352. Moreover, we held that “it is well[]settled that when a statute is free from ambiguity and expresses a clear and definite meaning, we must impart to the words contained therein their plain and obvious meaning.” Id. “Consequently because a rule of court has the full force and effect of law we must accord the rule the same principles of construction” as a statute. Id.', 'Because this is an issue of first impression for this Court, defendant refers us to a provision of the New York Constitution and a corresponding state statutory provision governing jury-trial waivers in support of his argument that his waiver was invalid because he did not sign the waiver form in open court in the presence of the trial justice. The New York Constitution requires that a jury waiver be made “by a written instrument signed by the defendant in person in open court before and with the approval of a judge or justice of a court having jurisdiction to try the offense.” New York Const. Art. 1, § 2 (emphasis added); see N.Y. Crim. Proc. Law § 320.10(2) (“Such waiver must be in writing and must be signed by the defendant in person in open court in the presence of the court, and with the approval of the court.”). The defendant refers us to a New York appellate court case that has interpreted these constitutional and statutory requisites to require a defendant to sign his or her waiver in writing in open court before the trial justice in order to give up his or her right to a jury trial. See People v. Davidson, 525 N.Y.S.2d 855, 856-57 (N.Y. App. Div. 1988). In Davidson, the court concluded that the record lacked evidence establishing that the defendant had executed the jury-waiver form in “open court” and further reasoned that the record was devoid of anything which would allow the', '-8- court to conclude that the defendant’s waiver “was ‘made knowingly and understandingly, based on an intelligent, informed judgment[.]’” Id. at 857 (internal citations omitted).', 'In reading the plain language of New York’s constitutional and statutory counterpart to our Rule 23(a), we are unconvinced by defendant’s suggestion that we should follow the interpretations by courts applying the New York framework. It is clear that the language of the New York Constitution and statute is glaringly different from the requirements of Rule 23(a). Unlike the New York statutory language—providing that the waiver must be “signed by the defendant in person in open court in the presence of the court”—Rule 23(a) and our caselaw interpreting the rule simply mandate that, in addition to the requirement that a waiver be made in open court through a discussion with the judge, the waiver must be put in writing prior to the start of a bench trial. The plain language of Rule 23(a) does not require that a defendant must sign and execute the written waiver form in the presence of the trial justice.', 'On the other hand, in arguing that defendant’s jury-trial waiver here satisfied Rule 23(a), the state refers us to Ohio’s statutory equivalent, which reads, in part:', '“In all criminal cases pending in courts of record in this state, the', 'defendant may waive a trial by jury and be tried by the court', 'without a jury. Such waiver by a defendant, shall be in writing,', 'signed by the defendant, and filed in said cause and made a part of', 'the record thereof. * * *', '“Such waiver of trial by jury must be made in open court after the', 'defendant has been arraigned and has had opportunity to consult', 'with counsel.” Ohio Rev. Code Ann. § 2945.05. The Ohio appellate courts have interpreted the phrase “in open court” to mean orally and on the record.4 In State v. Burnside, 930 N.E.2d 372 (Ohio Ct. App. 2010), the Court of Appeals of 4', 'The defendant also refers us to Ohio law and cites to State v. Pless, 658 N.E.2d 766 (Ohio 1996). However, in that case, the Ohio Supreme Court did not address whether the waiver must be signed in the presence of the judge; rather, the court simply ruled based upon the fact that a written waiver was never filed. Id. at 768-69. As noted in our discussion herein, defendant in the', '-9- Ohio stated that the “open court” requirement was satisfied as long as there is “some evidence in the record of the proceedings that the defendant acknowledged the waiver to the trial court while in the presence of counsel, if any.” Burnside, 930 N.E.2d at 377. In reaching its conclusion, the court referred to holdings by both the Court of Appeals of Ohio and the Supreme Court of Ohio that the waiver requirements of the applicable rule of criminal procedure and “[§] 2945.05 are satisfied when [a] defendant signs a written waiver outside of the courtroom and the court reaffirms this waiver in open court.” Id. at 378 (internal citation omitted); see also State v. Tango, 53 N.E.3d 961, 968 (Ohio Ct. App. 2015) (rejecting the defendant’s argument that his jury-trial waiver was invalid where he discussed and signed the waiver form with counsel prior to his court hearing, because the trial judge had engaged in a verbal colloquy with the defendant on the record to confirm his desire to waive a jury trial); State v. Strickland, 918 N.E.2d 170, 174 (Ohio Ct. App. 2009) (holding that “it is not necessary that the written waiver be signed in open court to be valid”; rather, “as long as the signed writing has been made a part of the record and the waiver is reaffirmed in open court, the procedural requirements of [Ohio’s jury-trial waiver statute and corresponding rule of criminal procedure] are satisfied”).', 'We held in DiStefano that “[t]he purpose of requiring a defendant to execute a written waiver is both to ensure that the defendant is aware of the importance and the significance of the right he or she is waiving and to provide evidence of the defendant’s consent.” DiStefano, 593 A.2d at 1352. “The sole purpose in requiring the approval of the court and mandating that the waiver be made in open court is to assure that the defendant who waives a jury trial does so intelligently and with full knowledge of the consequences of his waiver.” State v. Cruz, 517 A.2d 237, 243 (R.I. 1986). case at bar signed a waiver form, and the form was made part of the record. Consequently, we find that Pless is also inapplicable to the facts of this case.', '- 10 -', 'We opine that Ohio’s framework is a more similar counterpart to our Rule 23(a) than the New York framework, and we therefore reach a similar holding as the Ohio courts. During the colloquy on the record, the trial justice in the present case confirmed defendant’s decision to waive his right to a jury trial on the record, in open court, and the trial justice approved and signed the written jury-waiver form that had been executed by defendant. Accordingly, we are satisfied that the written waiver met the requirement of Rule 23(a), and we proceed to consider whether defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to a jury trial.5', 'According to defendant, notwithstanding the open-court issue, his jury-trial waiver was invalid based on the colloquy between him and the trial justice.', 'Specifically, defendant highlights his inability to speak English, his lack of education, and his unfamiliarity with the criminal justice system in support of his argument that he could not have intelligently waived his right to a jury trial. Further, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in conducting the discussion with him because the trial justice did not inform defendant of certain information regarding the jury-trial process.', 'We begin with defendant’s contention that the trial justice failed to consider his personal background. As set out above, in Moran, we explained that the “substantive right to invoke a bench trial belongs to the defendant and is subject only to the procedural requirement that a trial justice determine that the defendant understands and accepts the consequences of executing a waiver.” Moran, 605 A.2d at 496. In that case, in an open-court colloquy, the trial justice questioned the defendant concerning his “long-time mental infirmity and his understanding of 5', 'While we hold that the written-waiver requirement was satisfied under the facts before us and pursuant to the language of Rule 23(a), we would note that the better practice may be for an attorney, and an interpreter if applicable, to discuss the waiver with a defendant outside of court, and that a defendant thereafter sign the waiver form during the proceeding in open court. We make clear, however, that Rule 23(a) does not mandate this procedure. It is our holding that a written waiver signed prior to the start of a bench trial satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a).', '- 11 - the rights relinquished in exercising a waiver.” Id. at 497. The trial justice ultimately denied the defendant’s request to waive a jury trial, basing her decision on the defendant’s apparent misunderstanding of appellate procedure, his psychiatric history, the public interest in protecting the defendant from waiving a fundamental right, and the public interest in an insanity defense. Id. On certiorari, this Court held that the record revealed that the defendant understood the difference between bench and jury trials and had “articulately responded to all questions, and only in the last exchange did [the defendant] indicate a misunderstanding of appellate procedure.” Id. Further, we held that the trial justice erred in considering “any factors other than whether [the] defendant’s decision is made in a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary manner.” Id.', 'Here, we note that, during the colloquy, defendant responded affirmatively to the trial justice’s inquiries as to whether defendant had spoken with his attorney, whether his attorney had answered any questions defendant had about the process, and whether defendant understood what he was doing. Finally, we highlight that defendant answered, “No” when the trial justice asked him, “You are not confused at all?” Relying on Moran, we are confident that, in the matter before us, the trial justice’s colloquy with defendant, in open court, provided adequate information for the trial justice to determine that defendant’s waiver was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, without delving into the specifics of defendant’s level of education, language capabilities, or criminal history.', 'The defendant also avers that the trial justice’s colloquy with defendant—explaining the differences between a jury trial and a bench trial—and his responses to the judge’s inquiries lacked certain essential factors. Specifically, citing to United States v. Martin, 704 F.2d 267 (6th Cir. 1983), and Ciummei v. Commonwealth, 392 N.E.2d 1186 (Mass. 1979), defendant contends that “most jurisdictions require that such waivers demonstrate at least three elements: that the', '- 12 - accused is informed that his or her jury will be chosen from the members of the community, that their verdict must be unanimous, and that the defendant will be allowed to participate in the selection of the jury panel.” Indeed, federal caselaw suggests that “[a]t a minimum, a defendant should be informed that a jury is composed of 12 members of the community, he may participate in the selection of jurors, the verdict of the jury must be unanimous, and that a judge alone will decide guilt or innocence should he waive his jury trial right.” Martin, 704 F.2d at 274-75.', 'The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court announced a similar suggestion in Ciummei, where the court stated that it did', '“not intend to create a rigid pattern but note that * * * the judge', 'might state that the jury consists of members of the community,', 'that the defendant may participate in their selection, that the', 'verdict of the jury must be unanimous, that they decide guilt or', 'innocence while the judge makes rulings of law in the course of the', 'trial, instructs the jury on the law, and imposes sentence in case of', 'guilt; and that, where a jury is waived, the judge alone decides', 'guilt or innocence in accordance with the facts and the law.”', 'Ciummei, 392 N.E.2d at 1189-90. Further, the court suggested that “[t]he judge should make sure that [a] defendant has conferred with his counsel about the waiver, and that he has not been pressured or cajoled and is not intoxicated or otherwise rendered incapable of rational judgment.” Id. at 1190. In contrast to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, however, we have never proclaimed a bright line rule or even suggestions delineating requirements for a colloquy between a trial justice and a defendant regarding the differences between a jury trial and a non-jury trial.', 'We are satisfied here that the trial justice adequately explained the jury-selection process to the defendant and that the trial justice’s colloquy with the defendant satisfied the requirements of Rule 23(a). The record reflects that the trial justice explained the defendant’s right to have a jury of twelve of his fellow Rhode Island citizens, that a selection process would take place, and that the jurors would make a decision regarding his guilt or innocence. Thereafter, defendant', '- 13 - declared, on the record, his unequivocal desire to waive his right to a jury trial. The trial justice went on to explain his role as the decisionmaker in a bench trial. The defendant responded in the affirmative to the trial justice’s inquiries about whether he was comfortable with a bench trial, whether the defendant had the opportunity to speak with his attorney about waiving his right, and whether his attorney had answered any questions he may have about the process. Finally, the defendant confirmed that he understood what he was doing and that he was not at all confused.

55,"The Rhode Island Industrial-Recreational : Building Authority v. : Capco Endurance, LLC et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court.', 'The plaintiff, The Rhode Island Industrial- Recreational Building Authority (IRBA), appeals from an April 27, 2017 judgment in Providence County Superior Court entering judgment for Feeley & Driscoll, P.C. (Feeley) on all claims by IRBA and reflecting the previous grant of summary judgment in favor of Feeley by that court.1 IRBA avers that the hearing justice erred in holding that Feeley did not owe a duty of care to IRBA as a third-party with respect to what IRBA alleges was a negligently prepared report by Feeley, an accounting firm, on which IRBA posits it relied. Initially, IRBA argues that this Court should adopt the “Restatement Rule” for assessing whether or not a duty exists “between an accountant-auditor and an aggrieved third party * * *.” It proceeds to contend that the hearing justice misapplied the Restatement Rule and thus erred in granting summary judgment in Feeley’s favor.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The instant appeal addresses only the plaintiff’s contentions against defendant Feeley & Driscoll, P.C. The other named defendants are not parties to this appeal.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts in this case are largely undisputed. In setting forth those facts, we draw upon the bench decision of the hearing justice as well as other documents contained in the record. We shall summarize in chronological order the transactions which form the factual basis of this case.', 'Feeley is an accounting firm that prepared audited annual financial statements for Capco Steel, LLC and Capco Endurance, LLC (collectively Capco). The report at issue in this case is the report prepared by Feeley for Capco for the year 2009 (the 2009 Audit Report). It is that report which IRBA contends it relied on and which it further contends was negligently prepared by Feeley.', 'In February of 2010, Webster Bank (Webster) agreed to provide Capco with a twenty million dollar revolving line of credit. As part of that agreement, Webster also agreed to make a six million dollar term loan to Capco by purchasing six million dollars of bonds from the Rhode Island Industrial Facilities Corporation. IRBA agreed to insure those bonds up to the amount of five million dollars. Accordingly, two separate transactions ensued—one for the line of credit and one for the bonds.', 'In March of 2010, the twenty million dollar line of credit involving Capco and Webster closed (the original line of credit transaction). Webster’s “Summary of Committed Terms and Conditions,” which was given to Capco before the closing on that loan, included the requirement that Capco provide the bank over the course of the term of the loan “annual CPA-prepared, audited consolidated financial statements * * *.”', 'In April of 2010, after the original line of credit transaction closed but before the bond transaction involving IRBA closed, Feeley issued the 2009 Audit Report to Capco, wherein it', '-2- indicated that Capco had earned a profit of $552,000 in 2009. Subsequently, on June 15, 2010, the bond transaction closed (the original bond transaction). Significantly, Capco did not provide IRBA with a copy of the 2009 Audit Report either at or before the closing on the original bond transaction, although a copy of the 2009 Audit Report was provided to IRBA sometime thereafter. Given that the basis of IRBA’s case against Feeley is IRBA’s alleged reliance on the purportedly negligently prepared 2009 Audit Report, it is undisputed that we are not concerned in this action with IRBA’s reliance on the 2009 Audit Report with respect to either the original line of credit transaction or the original bond transaction; IRBA could not have relied on a document it did not have.', 'In early 2011, Capco sought to extend its revolving line of credit to twenty-three and a half million dollars for a period of six months (the first “overline” request). In March of 2011, Capco and Webster requested IRBA’s consent to the temporary extension, and IRBA did consent (the first credit increase). At that time, IRBA had been provided with the 2009 Audit Report. IRBA contends that it relied on the 2009 Audit Report in approving the first credit increase. Feeley’s counsel agreed at oral argument before this Court that, for the purpose of the instant appeal, we need be concerned only with IRBA’s alleged reliance on the 2009 Audit Report with respect to the first credit increase; it is that transaction, and only that transaction, that is at issue in this case. Specifically, we must determine whether or not Feeley owed a duty of care to IRBA with respect to IRBA’s alleged reliance on the 2009 Audit Report in consenting to the first credit increase.', 'In June of 2011, Capco’s relationship with Feeley had been terminated, and Capco eventually hired a different auditing firm. IRBA contends that the auditing firm that succeeded Feeley indicated that the 2009 Audit Report was erroneous and that Capco had actually lost', '-3- approximately one and a half million dollars in 2009. Feeley does not concede that the 2009 Audit Report was erroneous or negligently prepared.', 'In August of 2011, a request was again made to IRBA to consent to a further extension of Capco’s line of credit to over twenty-eight million dollars (the second “overline” request), and IRBA was also asked to subordinate its security interest to that of Webster. IRBA agreed to both requests (the second credit increase).', 'Ultimately, in March of 2012, Capco failed to make required payments on the bonds, thus triggering IRBA’s obligation as the insurer of five million dollars worth of the bonds.', 'On May 1, 2013, IRBA filed the instant action against Capco, Feeley, and numerous other defendants.', 'For the purposes of the instant appeal, we are concerned with IRBA’s allegations of negligence only as they relate to Feeley.', 'In August of 2015, Feeley moved for summary judgment. In a January 15, 2016 order, the hearing justice granted the parties additional time for discovery until February 29, 2016, and he permitted Feeley to file a revised motion for summary judgment after February 29, 2016. In accordance with that order, on October 20, 2016, Feeley renewed its motion for summary judgment, which was predicated on its contention that it did not owe a duty to IRBA with respect to the 2009 Audit Report.', 'On March 3, 2017, the hearing justice rendered a bench decision granting Feeley’s renewed motion for summary judgment. The hearing justice limited his decision to addressing the issue of whether or not Feeley owed a duty to IRBA as a matter of law. The hearing justice acknowledged that this Court had not as of then opined on what test should be applied to determine whether or not a duty exists between an accountant/auditor and a third party (i.e., a person or entity that was not at the relevant point in time a client of the accountant/auditor).', '-4- After referencing the three different tests employed by various other courts, the hearing justice chose to apply the one which he characterized as “the Restatement approach” (the Restatement rule), determining that it “struck a proper balance * * *.” The hearing justice detailed the Restatement rule as follows:', '“The Restatement (Second) of Torts § 522 limits an accountant’s', 'liability for negligently prepared financial statements to loss', 'incurred:', '“(a) [B]y the person or one of a limited group of persons for', 'whose benefit and guidance acts to supply the', 'information * * * and', '“(b) [T]hrough reliance upon it in a transaction that he intends', 'the information to influence * * * or in a substantially similar', 'transaction.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The hearing justice then concluded that the first credit increase and the second credit increase were “non-substantially similar” to the original bond transaction.2 He noted that it was the original bond transaction that Feeley “might have known of when it issued the 2009 audited financials.” Thus, he then held that, under the Restatement rule, Feeley owed no duty to IRBA.', 'On April 10, 2017, an order entered granting Feeley’s renewed motion for summary judgment. Subsequently, on April 27, 2017, judgment entered in Feeley’s favor on all of IRBA’s claims against it. IRBA filed a timely notice of appeal. 2', 'We note that IRBA points to the fact that the hearing justice referenced both credit increases in making his determination as to substantial similarity pursuant to the Restatement rule, whereas, as IRBA notes, the second credit increase is not and was not at issue with respect to IRBA’s negligence claim against Feeley. Even accepting IRBA’s contention, that fact, in and of itself, does not constitute reversible error since we may affirm on grounds other than those relied upon by the hearing justice. See Miller v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 111 A.3d 332, 339 (R.I. 2015) (“[I]n reviewing the trial justice’s legal determinations, this Court has a prerogative to affirm a determination of a trial justice on grounds different from those enunciated in his or her decision[,] as well as a prerogative to overturn such a determination on different grounds.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '-5-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'A grant of a motion for summary judgment will be reviewed by this Court in a de novo manner.

Restivo Monacelli LLP, 189 A.3d 539, 546 (R.I. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Wells v.

Bettencourt, 162 A.3d 630, 635 (R.I. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, we are confronted in the instant case with a question only as to the duty of care, and we have distinguished the duty prong of the negligence analysis, holding that whether or not a duty of care exists in any given case is a question of law to be addressed on a “case-by-case basis.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted); see Martin v. Marciano, 871 A.2d 911, 915 (R.I. 2005) (“A legal duty is a question of law that the court alone is authorized to determine.”); see also Wyso v. Full Moon Tide, LLC, 78 A.3d 747, 750 (R.I. 2013). For that reason, the question of duty is amenable to a determination on summary judgment. “If the court finds that no duty exists, the trier of fact has nothing to consider and a motion for summary judgment must be granted.” Correia, 162 A.3d at 635 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'We begin by addressing what rule should be applied to determine whether a duty of care existed in this case.', 'A', 'The Restatement Rule', 'In our opinion in Bowen Court Associates v.

Bus. L.J. 171, 176-80 (Winter 2000).', 'The hearing justice applied the Restatement rule in the instant case, and both parties agree that the Restatement rule was correctly chosen by the hearing justice as the best analytical approach. After careful consideration of the three different standards relied upon by other courts, we are in wholehearted agreement with the hearing justice and the parties as to the preferability of the Restatement rule.', 'The near-privity test “limits an accountant’s liability exposure to those with whom the accountant is in privity or in a relationship sufficiently approaching privity.” Nycal Corp. v. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, 688 N.E.2d 1368, 1370 (Mass. 1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Ultramares Corp. v. Touche, 174 N.E. 441, 445, 446 (N.Y. 1931). The near- privity rule provides for considerably narrower circumstances wherein an accountant/auditor would be potentially liable to a third party for negligence.', 'But, in our judgment, those circumstances are too narrow and would not provide an opportunity for recovery by a third party that the accountant/auditor knew was going to rely on his or her work product in a particular', '-8- transaction. See Raritan River Steel Co. v. Cherry, Bekaert & Holland, 367 S.E.2d 609, 615 (N.C. 1988) (stating that the near-privity rule was “unduly restrictive”).', 'On the other hand, under the reasonable foreseeability rule, “an accountant may be held liable to any person whom the accountant could reasonably have foreseen would obtain and rely on the accountant’s opinion, including known and unknown investors.”', 'Nycal Corp., 688 N.E.2d at 1370. That test would create expansive liability for accountants/auditors and is not reflective of the reality that, once an accountant/auditor provides a document to his or her client, the accountant/auditor typically does not have complete control over the further dissemination of the document. Id.; see also Raritan River Steel Co., 367 S.E.2d at 615. What is more, the reasonable foreseeability rule has been “generally disfavored” by other jurisdictions. Nycal Corp., 688 N.E.2d at 1370.', 'In our opinion, the Restatement rule is the most sensible middle-of-the-road approach to the question of the extent of potential liability to third parties to which an accountant/auditor should be exposed for alleged negligence on his or her part. The Restatement rule is set forth in the Restatement (Second) Torts § 552 at 126-27 (1977), as follows:', '“(1) One who, in the course of his business, profession or', 'employment, or in any other transaction in which he has a', 'pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the guidance of', 'others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for', 'pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the', 'information, if he fails to exercise reasonable care or competence', 'in obtaining or communicating the information.', '“(2) * * * the liability stated in Subsection (1) is limited to loss', 'suffered', '“(a) by the person or one of a limited group of persons for', 'whose benefit and guidance he intends to supply the information or', 'knows that the recipient intends to supply it; and', '-9-', '“(b) through reliance upon it in a transaction that he', 'intends the information to influence or knows that the recipient so', 'intends or in a substantially similar transaction.”3 (Emphasis', 'added.) The Restatement rule “limits an accountant’s liability for negligent misrepresentation to those third parties who the accountant actually knows will receive the information, and then, only for transactions that are the same as, or substantially similar to, the ones which the accountant actually knows will be influenced by the supplied information.” North American Specialty Insurance Co. v. Lapalme, 258 F.3d 35, 40 (1st Cir. 2001). We are in agreement in this regard with the following language in a significant opinion of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts:', '“[T]he Restatement test properly balances the indeterminate', 'liability of the foreseeability test and the restrictiveness of the near-', 'privity rule. Section 552 recognizes commercial realities by', 'avoiding both unlimited and uncertain liability for economic losses', 'in cases of professional mistake and exoneration of the auditor in', 'situations where it clearly intended to undertake the responsibility', 'of influencing particular business transactions involving third', 'persons.” Nycal Corp., 688 N.E.2d at 1372 (internal quotation', 'marks omitted); see also Raritan River Steel Co., 367 S.E.2d at', '617. In our considered judgment, the Restatement rule strikes the appropriate balance between the open-ended nature of the reasonable foreseeability rule and the overly constrained near-privity rule. See Raritan River Steel Co., 367 S.E.2d at 617 (“[The Restatement rule] balances, more so than the other standards, the need to hold accountants to a standard that accounts for their contemporary role in the financial world with the need to protect them from liability that unreasonably exceeds the bounds of their real undertaking.”); see also Bily v. Arthur Young & 3', 'We expressly note that, by adopting the Restatement rule, we are not thereby adopting or expressing agreement with every comment and/or illustration that accompanies the published text of the rule—except when we explicitly do so.', '- 10 - Co., 834 P.2d 745, 769 (Cal. 1992). Accordingly, we adopt the moderate approach provided for in the Restatement rule. We shall next proceed to apply the Restatement rule to the issues raised by IRBA on appeal.', 'B', 'IRBA’s Contentions on Appeal', 'In addressing IRBA’s contentions on appeal, we wish to be absolutely clear as to exactly what is the question before us. The issue is whether or not, under the Restatement rule, when Feeley produced the 2009 Audit Report, it owed a duty to IRBA with respect to IRBA’s use of that report in assessing and approving the first credit increase.', 'IRBA represents on appeal that it is undisputed that, pursuant to the language contained in § (2)(a) of the Restatement rule, IRBA qualifies as a “person or one of a limited group of persons for whose benefit and guidance” Feeley intended to supply the 2009 Audit Report. Restatement (Second) Torts § 552 at 126-27 (1977).', 'IRBA thus restricts the focus of its appellate argument to the language contained in § (2)(b) of the Restatement rule.', 'As such, it frames the issue on appeal as being the question of whether or not IRBA relied on the 2009 Audit Report “in a transaction that [Feeley] intend[ed] the information to influence or [knew] that [Capco] so intend[ed] or in a substantially similar transaction.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)', 'Specifically, with respect to satisfying that standard, IRBA posits that: (1) the hearing justice “erroneously overlooked IRBA’s claim that, because [Feeley] knew and intended that the 2009 audit report would be used by IRBA in making decisions during the term of the Transaction [at issue], [Feeley] may be held liable to IRBA;” (2) the hearing justice “erroneously concluded that [Feeley] had no duty to IRBA under * * * the Restatement Rule based on his finding that the', '- 11 - [original line of credit and bond transactions] and the [first credit increase] were not ‘substantially similar;’” and (3) the hearing justice “erroneously overlooked IRBA’s claim that [Feeley] owed a duty to IRBA because [Feeley], intending to influence the [first credit increase], authorized Capco to supply information contained in the 2009 audit report for that purpose.” We shall address each of IRBA’s three contentions in turn.', '1. The Alleged Expected Use of the 2009 Audit Report during the “[T]erm of the', 'Transaction”', 'IRBA’s first contention on appeal is that the Restatement rule is satisfied in this case because Feeley “knew and intended that the 2009 audit report would be used by IRBA in making decisions during the term of the Transaction,” the latter five words referring to the duration of the original line of credit and bond transactions. IRBA stresses the “wide-ranging” business relationship between Feeley and Capco, and it asserts that “it is reasonable to infer that [Feeley] knew when it issued the 2009 audit report that, by requiring Capco to provide Webster and IRBA with the most recent and annual audited financial statements during the term of the Transaction, Webster and IRBA would be relying on Capco’s audited financial statements (including the 2009 audit report) during the Transaction for the purpose of making business decisions concerning their respective interests in the Transaction.”', 'In our opinion, IRBA’s contention is unavailing. IRBA is, in essence, requesting that we apply the reasonable foreseeability rule in this case, which rule we have now rejected. See Part III.A, supra. It was certainly reasonably foreseeable that IRBA might rely on the 2009 Audit Report for another transaction at some point during the life of the original line of credit and bond transactions. However, that is in our judgment not the proper standard to be applied in a case such as this one. Under the Restatement rule, we are concerned with whether the 2009 Audit Report was relied upon in a transaction which Feeley, at the time it released the report,', '- 12 - “intend[ed]” the information to influence or “kn[e]w[ ]” the recipient so intended. Restatement (Second) Torts § 552 at 127 (1977); see also Bily, 834 P.2d at 770 (“If * * * the [accountant/auditor] ‘merely knows of the ever-present possibility of repetition to anyone, and the possibility of action in reliance upon [the information provided] on the part of anyone to whom it may be repeated[,]’ the [accountant/auditor] bears no legal responsibility.”) (quoting Restatement (Second) Torts § 552 cmt. h (1977)). Indeed, the Restatement rule “limits an accountant’s liability for negligent misrepresentation to * * * transactions that are the same as, or substantially similar to, the ones which the accountant actually knows will be influenced by the supplied information.” Lapalme, 258 F.3d at 40 (emphasis added). What is more, “[t]he accountant’s knowledge is to be measured at the moment [a report was] published, not by the foreseeable path of harm envisioned by [litigants] years following an unfortunate business decision.” Nycal Corp., 688 N.E.2d at 1372-73 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'It is undisputed that IRBA, Capco, and Webster did not know, at the time when they closed on the twenty million dollar line of credit and on the bond transaction, that Capco would request a credit increase about a year in the future. How can Feeley possibly have intended, at the time it issued the 2009 Audit Report, that that report would influence a transaction that none of the parties knew was going to take place? See Lapalme, 258 F.3d at 40. That would have constituted pure speculation on Feeley’s part.', 'We unhesitatingly decline to expose an accountant/auditor to the broad scope of potential liability that IRBA’s argument in this regard would create. See Kohala Agriculture v. Deloitte & Touche, 949 P.2d 141, 160-61 (Haw. Ct. App. 1997) (addressing the reasonable foreseeability rule and the Restatement rule and stating that “[t]he foreseeable class of persons who can be adversely affected by reliance upon a lawyer or accountant’s advice or opinion can be so large as to make liability to third parties a ruinous', '- 13 - and catastrophic kind, a burden that cannot reasonably be imposed on the lawyer or the accountant except for fraud or other intentional misconduct”) (quoting Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts § 107 at 747 (5th ed. 1984)); cf. Ultramares, 174 N.E. at 444 (stating, in adopting the near-privity rule, that to do otherwise “may expose accountants to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class”). What is more, the broad nature of the general business relationship between Feeley and Capco on which IRBA so heavily relies does not alter our analysis in this case.', 'In summation, we have expressly adopted the Restatement rule to determine whether a duty exists between an accountant/auditor and a third party in the context of a negligence claim. It is clear that IRBA’s argument focusing on what it characterizes as “the term of the [t]ransaction” simply does not fit within the parameters of that rule. Accordingly, we reject that contention.', '2. The Allegedly Substantially Similar Nature of the First Credit Increase Transaction', 'to the Original Line of Credit and Bond Transactions', 'IRBA avers before this Court that Feeley owed it “a duty under the Restatement Rule’s ‘substantially similar’ transaction provision.”', 'It contends that the first credit increase was substantially similar to the original line of credit and bond transactions because: (1) there was no change in Feeley’s risk exposure due to the fact that the amount of IRBA’s insurance commitment remained at five million dollars; (2) the parties remained the same; (3) the first credit increase was only a short, temporary modification; and (4) the 17.5 percent increase in Capco’s line of credit was “minor.”', 'In addressing IRBA’s contention, we begin by looking to the Restatement rule which provides that recovery in an instance such as the one which is presented in this case is “limited to loss suffered * * * through reliance upon [an audit report] in a transaction that [the', '- 14 - accountant/auditor] intends the information to influence or knows that the recipient so intends or in a substantially similar transaction.”', 'Restatement (Second) Torts § 552 at 127 (1977). Accordingly, it is our role, as we review the hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment in a de novo manner, to discern whether there is evidence tending to show a genuine issue of material fact relative to whether or not the first credit increase was substantially similar to the original line of credit and bond transactions.', 'In reviewing the issue of whether or not the transactions at issue in this case were substantially similar, we have been enlightened by the opinion of Judge Bruce Selya writing for the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Lapalme, 258 F.3d at 40-45. In that unanimous opinion, in the course of affirming the grant of summary judgment for the defendants (an accounting firm and one of its principals), the court discussed at length how one should comprehend the concept of “substantially similar transactions.” Lapalme, 258 F.3d at 40, 41. The court observed that the substantial similarity question is “fact-sensitive and requires case-by- case development.” Id. at 41. It noted that transactions are substantially similar when the “‘essential character’—the amount and terms of the credit—has not changed.” Id. The First Circuit in Lapalme proceeded to state, in the course of discussing the issue of substantial similarity, the following:', '“[I]f the amount of the anticipated loan varies slightly, the', 'ensuing transaction nonetheless will remain substantially similar;', 'slight variances do not affect a transaction’s essential', 'character. * * * If, however, after the accountant’s report is', 'delivered the corporation seeks and receives a much larger loan,', 'the transactions will no longer be substantially similar and the', 'accountant will not be liable to the bank for a careless', 'misstatement. * * *', '“In the last analysis, [t]he question [is] one of the extent of', 'the departure that the maker of the representation understands is to', 'be expected. * * * Minor deviations are to be anticipated in', 'complex business transactions, and such deviations ordinarily do', '- 15 -', 'not allow the [auditor] to escape liability to a known third party.”', 'Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'After setting forth the just-quoted general normative principles, the First Circuit in Lapalme then articulated a two-step analysis to guide the resolution of the substantial similarity analysis. Id. First, the Restatement rule “implicitly recognizes that the risk perceived by the accountant at the time of the engagement cabins the extent of the duty that he owes to known third parties.” Id. The First Circuit went on to state that, with respect to the first step of the substantial similarity analysis, “an inquiring court initially must consider, from the [accountant/auditor’s] standpoint, what risks he reasonably perceived he was undertaking when he delivered the challenged report or financial statement.” Id. In the second step of the analysis, “the court must undertake an objective comparison between the transaction of which the accountant had actual knowledge and the transaction that in fact occurred.” Id. The First Circuit stated that such a comparison “cannot be hypertechnical, but, rather, must be conducted in light of [t]he ordinary practices and attitudes of the business world.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In addressing the two-step analysis so helpfully articulated in Lapalme, it is clear that the hearing justice was correct in concluding that IRBA had failed to establish that the first credit increase was a substantially similar transaction to the original line of credit and bond transactions. With respect to the first step in the analytical process, the record indicates that Feeley, in producing the 2009 Audit Report, would have reasonably perceived that it was undertaking a risk that IRBA would rely on the 2009 Audit Report in the bond transaction; the risk involved to IRBA in that transaction was the fact that it was assuming potential liability in the amount of five million dollars. In contrast, there is no basis in the record for concluding that Feeley could have reasonably perceived a risk that IRBA would thereafter agree to extend the', '- 16 - line of credit, even temporarily. While it is true that the monetary amount of IRBA’s risk as an insurer was not affected by the first credit increase, it is clear that increasing the line of credit increased the risk that IRBA would be called upon to make payment on the insured bonds (which appears to have been the reason why IRBA was called upon to approve the first credit increase). IRBA has failed to show that the essential character of the transactions had not materially changed between the original line of credit and bond transactions and the first credit increase. See id.; see also Horton v. Portsmouth Police Department, 22 A.3d 1115, 1122, 1123 (R.I. 2011) (“[W]here the facts suggest only one reasonable inference, the [motion] justice may properly treat the question as a matter of law.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Step two in the Lapalme analysis requires the making of an objective comparison between the first credit increase on the one hand and the original line of credit and bond transactions on the other hand. We note that “the imposition of liability for negligence should not be defeated by modest variances that the [accountant/auditor], given the way in which business transactions typically develop, reasonably could have anticipated.” Lapalme, 258 F.3d at 44; see also Restatement (Second) Torts § 552 cmt. j at 137 (1977) (“There may be many minor differences that do not affect the essential character of the transaction. The question may be one of the extent of the departure that the maker of the representation understands is to be expected.”). However, IRBA has not succeeded in demonstrating that the variances in this case were not more than modest. It is true that the transactions in this case all involved a line of credit and the same three parties—viz., Capco, Webster, and IRBA—but “[s]imply because transactions are of the same general nature (e.g., ‘bonds’) is not enough to render them substantially similar for purposes of the Restatement rule.” Lapalme, 258 F.3d at 44. These transactions took place nearly a year apart, and they involved a three and a half million dollar', '- 17 - credit increase for Capco.', 'While IRBA characterizes such an increase as “minor” under Lapalme, it is self-evident that a 17.5 percent increase in the credit amount does not qualify as “minor.”', 'Accordingly, in our judgment, after an extensive review of the record and the applicable legal precedent, we can perceive no basis whatsoever for holding that the hearing justice erred in concluding that the first credit increase was not substantially similar, under the Restatement rule, to the original line of credit and bond transactions. Thus, IRBA’s contention to the contrary has utterly failed to persuade us.', '3. Feeley’s Alleged “Authorization” of the Use of the 2009 Audit Report for the First', 'Credit Increase Request', 'IRBA further contends on appeal that “[t]he motion justice erroneously overlooked IRBA’s claim that [Feeley] owed a duty to IRBA because [Feeley], intending to influence the [first credit increase], authorized Capco to supply information contained in the 2009 audit report for that purpose.” In other words, IRBA posits that, even if the first credit increase is viewed as a separate and not substantially similar transaction, a duty of care was nevertheless owed to IRBA because Feeley had “authorized Capco to supply information contained in the 2009 audit report to the parties to the [first credit increase], knowing that it would be used to influence [the first credit increase transaction].”', 'IRBA avers that the record reveals that Capco shared its request for the first credit increase with Feeley before submitting that request to Webster and IRBA and that Capco included in that request information from the 2009 Audit Report. IRBA states in its brief before this Court that Capco was required to provide a copy of the request for the first credit increase to Feeley in advance of submitting it to Webster and IRBA because of the terms of the', '- 18 - “Professional Services Agreement” between Feeley and Capco.', 'That agreement reads in pertinent part as follows:', '“If our report on the financial statements being audited is to be', 'published in any manner or if you intend to make reference to', '[Feeley] in a publication of any type, you agree to submit proofs of', 'the publication to us for review prior to such publication and', 'cooperate with us in our performance of any additional audit', 'procedures we deem necessary in the circumstances, the nature and', 'extent of which will be at our sole discretion.” IRBA then argues that the just-quoted language and other record evidence “provide[ ] support for the liability-inducing inference and conclusion that [Feeley] authorized Capco to use the information contained in the 2009 audit report for the purpose of persuading Webster and IRBA to agree to Capco’s * * * request [for the first credit increase].”', 'We are once again unconvinced by IRBA’s argument, even viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to it as the non-moving party. See Newstone Development, LLC, 140 A.3d at 103.', 'While we have taken into account the language in the “Professional Services Agreement” and the fact that Feeley was provided by Capco with an advance copy of the request for the first credit increase, those facts do not provide a basis for the conclusion that there was an “authorization” by Feeley for Capco to use 2009 Audit Report data in its request for the first credit increase. Indeed, even if one accepted that every fact being represented by IRBA in its brief before this Court in support of this argument is accurate,4 Feeley’s mere failure to notice that information from the 2009 Audit Report was contained in Capco’s request for the first credit increase and/or to specifically object to the use of that information by Capco is not convincing. 4', 'For the sake of accuracy, we would note that, as Feeley correctly points out in its brief before this Court, only minimal information from the 2009 Audit Report was actually included in Capco’s request for the first credit increase; and, it is not clear from the record whether or not IRBA relied on that minimal information in authorizing the first credit increase.', '- 19 - IRBA has not exhibited why such a chain of events even remotely rises to a level of “authorization” that should lead to Feeley being exposed to possible liability.5', 'We note that IRBA relies on the case of Reisman v. KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, 787 N.E.2d 1060 (Mass. App. Ct. 2003).', 'In the course of holding that a claim for negligent misrepresentation could be maintained by a third party against the auditor in that case, the court emphasized the facts that the auditor “actively participated in the transaction at issue,” had a “history of actively participating in such transactions,” and had signed a written “statement consenting to the incorporation in [a form for the Securities and Exchange Commission] of its earlier audited financial statements.” Reisman, 787 N.E.2d at 1076, 1077. However, the facts of the instant case are readily distinguishable from those in Reisman since Feeley did not actively participate in the first credit increase transaction, and the record contains no written consent to the use of the information in the 2009 Audit Report.', 'Morever, the Restatement rule focuses on what Feeley knew at the time it produced the report, not on what it may have had knowledge of at some later date. See Nycal Corp., 688 N.E.2d at 1372-73. We would also emphasize the point that, as other courts have recognized, once a report is given to a client, the accountant/auditor may in actuality have little to no control over to whom that client actually chooses to disseminate the report. See Raritan River Steel Co., 367 S.E.2d at 616 (“Auditors * * * have no control over the distribution of their reports, and hence lack control over their exposure to liability.”); see also Nycal Corp., 688 N.E.2d at 1370. 5', 'We need not and do not decide at this time the broader question of whether or not an accountant/auditor could be liable to a third party with respect to a negligently produced report when the accountant/auditor authorized the use of the report in a transaction of which it was not aware at the time the report was produced; we need not address that question because we conclude that the facts of this case fail to establish that there was an authorization. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n.4 (R.I. 2009) (noting “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”).', '- 20 - It should further be noted that the “Professional Services Agreement” upon which IRBA relies in support of its “authorization” argument in this case speaks only to the publication of any “report [by Feeley] on the financial statements being audited;” it certainly does not contain any sweeping statement with respect to Capco’s being required to seek Feeley’s approval for any possible future use of such a report.', 'Accordingly, in our opinion, IRBA’s contention that Feeley owed it a duty of care in this case because Feeley “authorized” the use of the 2009 Audit Report to support the request for the first credit increase is unavailing.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'We have carefully reviewed the record, and we have given due consideration to the well- presented arguments of the parties. In the final analysis, however, when the Restatement rule is applied to the case before us, it is our unhesitating judgment that the hearing justice did not err in holding that Feeley did not owe a duty of care to IRBA. For that reason, IRBA’s negligence claim against Feeley cannot proceed, and summary judgment in Feeley’s favor was appropriately granted.', 'Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

56,Richard P. Sullivan : v. : Coventry Municipal Employees’ : Retirement Plan et al.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The plaintiff, Richard P. Sullivan (plaintiff), appeals from a final judgment in favor of the defendants following a Kent County Superior Court hearing justice’s grant of the defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and the hearing justice’s alternative grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants. On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the hearing justice erred in determining that the court lacked subject- matter jurisdiction over his claim, and he further contends that the hearing justice erred in alternatively granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court regarding its lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Furthermore, we reinstate and grant the plaintiff’s previously-denied petition for writ of certiorari (No. 2015-58-M.P.), consolidate that matter with the present appeal (No. 2016- 73-Appeal.), and affirm the decision of the plan administrator denying the plaintiff pension benefits.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This matter arises from a dispute regarding plaintiff’s request for and defendants’ subsequent denial of pension benefits. The relevant facts are as follows. From February 1986', '-1- through December 2008, plaintiff held a variety of part-time positions with the Town of Coventry (the town), including probate judge, assistant solicitor, town moderator, and town manager. Over that time, three different plans governing the town employees’ rights to pension benefits were in effect: (1) the 1977 Annuity Plan; (2) the 1997 Plan restatement; and (3) the 2008 Plan restatement (collectively, the plan). In June 2011, after his employment with the town had ended, plaintiff submitted a request for a pension from the town.', 'After the plan administrator—an entity comprised of members of the Coventry Town Council (the plan administrator)—apparently delayed in responding to plaintiff’s pension request, plaintiff, on October 4, 2012, filed a complaint for breach of contract as well as seeking a declaratory judgment against the defendant, Coventry Municipal Employees’ Retirement Plan, in Kent County Superior Court. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint five days later that added the town’s finance director as a defendant. On February 26, 2013, plaintiff filed his second amended complaint, naming as additional defendants individuals in their capacities as members of the town council sitting as the plan administrator, along with the original defendants (collectively, defendants).1', 'The plaintiff’s second amended complaint alleged one count for breach of contract, for which he sought specific performance and damages, and one count seeking a declaration of the parties’ rights, status, and obligations under the plan.', 'In December 2013, defendants moved to dismiss plaintiff’s second amended complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. At a hearing on the motion, the hearing justice opined that review of a quasi-judicial hearing and action by a town council is properly made by way of a 1', 'Specifically, plaintiff, in his second amended complaint, named the following individuals as defendants: Ted Przybyla, as finance director/treasurer of the town; and Gary P. Cote, Karen M. Carlson, Kerry L. McGee, Gregory Laboissonniere, and Thaddeus Jendzejec, as town council members acting as the plan administrator. We note that, because time has passed, several individuals have left those positions, and their successors have been substituted as defendants.', '-2- petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, but she explained that “it is unclear from the record whether or not the plaintiff was given a hearing with respect to the application for benefits.” Accordingly, the hearing justice determined that plaintiff was entitled to due process before his pension claim could be addressed in court, and she denied defendants’ motion to dismiss.2', 'The defendants moved for summary judgment on November 6, 2014. The next month, the hearing justice reserved decision on that motion and remanded the case to the town council for a hearing on plaintiff’s pension application. The hearing justice further ordered that “[t]he matter must be heard and decided by the Town Council within sixty (60) days, up to and including February 6, 2015[,]” noting that the “case remains pending in the Superior Court and this Superior Court retains jurisdiction[.]” The hearing justice also scheduled a status conference for February 26, 2015. On January 15, 2015, the plan administrator conducted a hearing during which it heard testimony and received evidence pertaining to plaintiff’s request for a pension under the plan. On January 31, 2015, after considering the documentary evidence and testimony and interpreting the terms of the plan, the plan administrator voted unanimously “to deny Mr. Sullivan’s request for pension benefits and directed the Town solicitor to draft a written decision in support of its denial.”', 'Thereafter, plaintiff petitioned this Court to issue a common law writ of certiorari to review the plan administrator’s decision to deny his request for pension benefits. We denied plaintiff’s petition “without prejudice, however, to the petitioner’s right to prosecute his Superior 2', 'Aside from the denial of defendants’ motion to dismiss, the other pertinent motions and hearings were heard and conducted by the same Superior Court justice.', '-3- Court action against the respondents * * * to a conclusion.”3 After the parties returned to Superior Court for reconsideration of plaintiff’s original prayers, defendants filed a motion: (1) to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction; (2) for summary judgment as to all counts of plaintiff’s complaint; or (3) to affirm the plan administrator’s decision on the administrative record and without trial.', 'In a written decision, the hearing justice determined that the Superior Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over plaintiff’s claims, reasoning that the proper recourse rests in this Court. The hearing justice went on, however, to decide that, even if the Superior Court had subject-matter jurisdiction over plaintiff’s claims, the municipal defendants were entitled to summary judgment because the plan administrator’s decision was not arbitrary and capricious. Judgment entered on February 10, 2016, dismissing the action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Additionally, the judgment provides that, “[a]ssuming that the Superior Court had subject-matter jurisdiction, because plaintiff failed to establish any genuine issues of material fact relating to the validity of the decision of the Town Council, defendants are awarded judgment as a matter of law as to plaintiff’s second amended complaint.” The plaintiff timely appealed to this Court.4 3', 'Importantly, pursuant to Article I, Rule 13(e) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, “[a] denial of a petition, without more, is not an adjudication on the merits and has no precedential effect, and such action is to be taken as being without prejudice to a further application to this Court or any court for the relief sought.” Therefore, we wish to make clear that our denial of plaintiff’s petition for certiorari was in no way intended to convey our belief one way or the other regarding the Superior Court’s jurisdiction over the matter. 4', 'The plaintiff filed his notice of appeal on February 9, 2016. As we have previously held, “in cases in which an appeal has been prematurely filed, [we] will ‘treat the appeal as if it had been timely filed after judgment was entered.’” Arnold Road Realty Associates, LLC v. Tiogue Fire District, 873 A.2d 119, 125 n.4 (R.I. 2005) (quoting United Lending Corp. v. City of Providence, 827 A.2d 626, 631 n.9 (R.I. 2003)).', '-4-', 'On appeal, plaintiff contends that the hearing justice erred in granting defendants’ motion to dismiss because G.L. 1956 § 8-2-13 confers jurisdiction on the Superior Court over his claims for breach of contract and specific performance, and G.L. 1956 §§ 9-30-1 and 9-30-2 confer jurisdiction upon the court over the declaratory-judgment claim. The plaintiff cites to our decision in Retirement Board of Employees’ Retirement System of City of Providence v. Corrente, 111 A.3d 301 (R.I. 2015), to support his position. Moreover, plaintiff argues that the hearing justice erred in alternatively granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment; according to plaintiff, the hearing justice employed an improper standard of review.', 'To the contrary, defendants take the position that the hearing justice properly determined that the Superior Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over this matter because the plan administrator operates in a quasi-judicial capacity in deciding matters involving pension-benefit eligibility. Therefore, defendants argue, the proper avenue of review of those decisions is through a writ of certiorari to this Court.', 'Moreover, defendants contend that, even if the Superior Court did have subject-matter jurisdiction to review the plan administrator’s decision denying pension benefits, that decision was not arbitrary and capricious, and as such the hearing justice did not err in alternatively granting summary judgment in favor of defendants.', 'II', 'Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject-Matter Jurisdiction', 'A', 'Standard of Review', '“We have previously held that ‘a challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction questions the very power of the court to hear the case.’” Corrente, 111 A.3d at 305 (brackets omitted) (quoting In re New England Gas Co., 842 A.2d 545, 553 (R.I. 2004)). “Subject-matter jurisdiction ‘may', '-5- not be waived by any party and may be raised at any time in the proceedings.’” Id.

(quoting In re New England Gas Co., 842 A.2d at 553).', 'B', 'Discussion', 'The first issue before this Court is whether the Superior Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to consider what is essentially plaintiff’s appeal of the plan administrator’s decision denying his request for pension benefits. Our focus is whether a party must seek review of a town council’s quasi-judicial act through this Court by way of a writ of certiorari, or whether it may be reviewed under the general jurisdiction or declaratory-judgment jurisdiction of the Superior Court.', 'As we have routinely explained, “the Superior Court ‘is a court of general equitable jurisdiction; although its jurisdiction is not limitless, the Superior Court possesses, as a matter of fundamental judicial power, the jurisdiction to hear and confront the merits of any case wherein the power of determination has not been specifically conferred upon another tribunal.’” Corrente, 111 A.3d at 306 (deletion omitted) (quoting La Petite Auberge, Inc. v. Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, 419 A.2d 274, 279 (R.I. 1980)).', 'Consequently, plaintiff endeavors to classify his case as an action in equity, which he argues would allow him to shield his claim from dismissal for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. We disagree with plaintiff’s characterization of his claims and with his assertion that the above- discussed statutes provide the Superior Court with subject-matter jurisdiction. The plaintiff’s underlying claims, when originally filed in Superior Court in 2012, sought specific performance', '-6- for payments to him under the plan and a declaration as to the parties’ rights and obligations under the plan. However, after the plan administrator denied plaintiff pension benefits, and after we denied plaintiff’s petition for certiorari, plaintiff’s claim in Superior Court was essentially an appeal of the plan administrator’s decision.', 'Accordingly, plaintiff is now seeking review of the plan administrator’s decision, made in its quasi-judicial role. We have clearly explained that “the proper procedure to gain review of a quasi-judicial action of a town council, except where a right of appeal is specifically provided by statute, is by a writ of certiorari to this [C]ourt.” Eastern Scrap Services, Inc. v. Harty, 115 R.I. 260, 262, 341 A.2d 718, 719 (1975). Pursuant to the plan, the plan administrator’s', '“discretionary authority includes, but is not limited to, the', 'authority to make any and all factual determinations and interpret', 'all terms and provisions of the [p]lan documents relevant to the', 'issue under consideration. The exercise of authority will be', 'binding upon all persons; will be given deference in all courts of', 'law to the greatest extent allowed under law; and will not be', 'overturned or set aside by any court of law unless found to be', 'arbitrary and capricious or made in bad faith.”', 'Armed with the discretion to make any and all factual determinations and to interpret the terms of the plan, we opine that it is indisputable that the plan administrator was acting in a quasi-judicial fashion when it made a determination concerning plaintiff’s eligibility for pension benefits. See Ims v. Town of Portsmouth, 32 A.3d 914, 929 (R.I. 2011) (explaining that “the term ‘quasi-judicial’ suggests that an administrative body will be making a determination that will have an impact on a party’s rights, that it will conduct a hearing, consider evidence, and reach a decision relative to the issues raised in the complaint”).', 'In determining that the proper avenue for entertaining such an appeal is by way of a writ of certiorari, the hearing justice in the present case cited to Scolardi v. City of Providence, 751 A.2d 754 (R.I. 2000). In Scolardi, the retirement board for the City of Providence approved an', '-7- accidental disability retirement pension for the plaintiff. Scolardi, 751 A.2d at 754. The next day, the city solicitor drafted a letter to the city controller asserting that the evidence did not support the board’s decision and further prohibiting the approval of benefits for the plaintiff. Id. at 754-55. Thereafter, when the plaintiff was not paid pursuant to the board’s decision, he filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and a writ of mandamus requiring the city to begin payments. Id. at 755. Upon review, the trial justice determined that the plaintiff was not entitled to benefits; the plaintiff appealed. Id. This Court held on appeal that “[t]he trial justice was without authority to conduct the de novo review” of the board’s decision. Id. at 756. The Court further explained that “[i]n the absence of specific statutory delineation of a particular forum for relief, a party must resort to this Court by way of common law certiorari.” Id.', 'It is further our opinion that plaintiff’s reliance on Corrente is misplaced. Unlike the case now before us, in Corrente, a statute did delineate a particular forum of relief other than by way of common law certiorari. Corrente, 111 A.3d at 305. There, while the matter was pending before this Court, the General Assembly adopted G.L. 1956 § 36-10.1-5, which granted the Superior Court subject-matter jurisdiction to review dishonorable-service-based pension- revocation cases. Id. This Court held that the Superior Court, while it did not have jurisdiction when the case was first adjudicated in that court, had been vested with subject-matter jurisdiction under the newly-enacted statute, and therefore the court had the power to review the retirement board’s decision. Id. at 309.', 'As was the case in Corrente, however, we wish to make clear that “[w]e do not deny that the Superior Court has previously adjudicated municipal pension disputes pursuant to its equity jurisdiction; however, we are unaware of any such case that was not brought by an aggrieved', '-8- plaintiff seeking a traditional equitable remedy or declaratory relief.” Corrente, 111 A.3d at 307; see also Trice v.

Fitzgerald, 106 R.I. 650, 651-52, 262 A.2d 625, 626 (1970) (city police officer challenging the amount of his pension award following retirement pursuant to statutory scheme).', 'In each of the above-cited cases, the plaintiffs were essentially asking for an adjustment of benefits that the respective board had already approved. Here, however, plaintiff asks this Court to make a determination about his overall entitlement to benefits. As we clarified in Corrente, “it was not the classification of ‘municipal pension disputes’ that vested the Superior Court with jurisdiction in these cases. Rather, these were cases brought by plaintiffs seeking known equitable remedies; the actions merely happened to have in common that each dispute involved an employee’s rights regarding his or her pension benefits.” Corrente, 111 A.3d at 307. Accordingly, we find these cases to be both factually and procedurally distinguishable from the case at bar.', 'For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the hearing justice granting defendants’ motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Because we hold that the hearing justice lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to decide the case in Superior Court, we will not review the hearing justice’s decision on defendants’ alternative motion for summary judgment.', '-9-', 'III', 'Review on Certiorari of the Plan Administrator’s Decision', 'Pursuant to what we indicated at oral argument, we now reinstate and grant plaintiff’s original petition for a writ of certiorari—originally denied without prejudice by this Court on June 12, 2015—and proceed to review the plan administrator’s decision denying plaintiff pension benefits.5', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court “review[s] a pension administrator’s interpretation of a pension plan that is governed by federal law under an arbitrary-and-capricious standard—provided the plan accords the administrator discretionary authority to determine benefit-related questions; if not, the court should apply a de novo standard of review.”6 Goncalves v.

The Plan', 'Administrator’s decisions upon all matters within the scope of its', 'authority shall be final.” It is clear, then, that the language of the plan specifically provides that the plan administrator has the authority to interpret and make decisions concerning the plan, to the extent allowed by law. Therefore, we next consider whether the plan administrator’s interpretation of the plan was arbitrary and capricious.', 'The plaintiff argues that the plan administrator’s decision was arbitrary and capricious because it was not supported by substantial evidence and because the plan administrator failed to apply the plain and ordinary meaning of the plan’s terms. Moreover, plaintiff avers that the plan administrator exhibited bias and bad faith in the discussions among the members on the record. The plaintiff points out that the plan administrator’s decision repeatedly refers to the fact that “no', '- 11 - probate judge, assistant probate judge, assistant solicitor, or town manager has previously requested a pension under the [P]lan”; plaintiff avers that this is not evidence on which a rational decision can be made. The plaintiff highlights that there was no evidence before the plan administrator to show that any other town employee had served the town for over twenty-two years, as did plaintiff. Additionally, plaintiff argues that he was classified as an administrative employee during his tenure with the town and therefore qualified for pension benefits. The plaintiff relies on a 2008 letter from a legal consultant, who opined that town solicitors and assistant town solicitors were qualified to participate in the plan. Finally, plaintiff alleges that “[h]e received a regular paycheck, with federal payroll tax, social security and Medicare deductions, like any other employee of the town, with a W-2 tax form annually” and that other part-time employees received pension benefits.', 'The defendants contend, however, that the plan administrator’s decision was rational, logical, and supported by substantial evidence.', 'The defendants highlight that the plan administrator considered several of the above-discussed factors in reaching its conclusion. Furthermore, they argue that plaintiff “mistakenly assumed that the [legal consultant’s] opinion was dispositive of his claim to pension benefits” when, in fact, the plan administrator has the broad discretionary power to interpret the plan and pension-benefit eligibility thereunder. The defendants also aver that plaintiff’s contention that the plan administrator erred when it neglected to strictly construe the ambiguous term “administrative employee” against the drafter is without merit because the plan specifically vests the plan administrator with the discretion to construe and interpret the plan’s terms.', 'The plan administrator’s decision begins by listing a brief chronology of plaintiff’s work history with the town, indicating that plaintiff “served the Town in multiple, sometimes', '- 12 - overlapping, capacities during the course of his 22-year tenure with the Town.” The decision further acknowledges that “there were different pension plans in effect at different points in time during his tenure.” The decision cites our opinion in JCM, LLC v. Town of Cumberland Zoning Board of Review, 889 A.2d 169 (R.I. 2005), and notes that the plan administrator “was cognizant of the Rhode Island Supreme Court’s teaching that a ‘municipal board, when acting in a quasi- judicial capacity, must set forth in its decision findings of fact and reasons for the actions taken’ and that ‘factual findings cannot be merely conclusional, and the application of the legal principles must be something more than the recital of a litany[.]’” (Quoting JCM, LLC, 889 A.2d at 176-77.)', 'Additionally, the decision provides that, “[t]o the plan administrator’s knowledge, [plaintiff’s] request raises an issue of first impression under the Plan[.]”', 'The plan administrator’s decision considers the language of the 1997 and 2008 restatements, which establish the definitions of an “eligible employee,” and analyzes whether plaintiff qualified as such. Further, the decision notes that “it was the plan administrator’s informed judgment, and was found as fact, that [plaintiff] was * * * not a participant under the 1977 Plan because the positions of probate judge, assistant probate judge, and assistant solicitor have never been * * * positions the holders of which were eligible to participate in the Plan.” The decision explains that the plan administrator relied on the historical context of the town to determine that plaintiff’s positions were never understood to qualify him as a municipal employee. Notably, the plan administrator did recognize that “in the abstract and ignoring any historical context, the term ‘[m]unicipal employee’ could be interpreted as including the probate judge, acting probate judge, and assistant solicitor.”', '- 13 -', 'Moreover, the decision considers the testimony adduced at the hearing. The decision refers to the then town manager’s testimony that the “Town records reveal[ed] that no assistant town solicitor, town solicitor, municipal court judge, or probate judge has ever participated in or applied for a pension.” The decision also refers to the deposition testimony of Cheryl Wilcox, who held the position of secretary to the town manager since 2002, throughout the tenure of five different town managers. The decision explains that Ms. Wilcox testified that she was the clerical “point person” for the plan and that plaintiff “was not on the running Plan-participation list which identifies every Town employee who is eligible for a pension and to which new Town employees are added when they are hired.”', 'Finally, the decision relies on Ms. Wilcox’s testimony that plaintiff was not on that list when she began her service as secretary.', 'Additionally, the plan administrator’s decision considers plaintiff’s own testimony. Specifically, the decision refers to plaintiff’s statements where he testified: “I never knew we had a pension until I saw [the legal opinion] letter” sometime after October 2008. He also testified: “I never thought we were eligible.” Moreover, plaintiff testified that he did not contribute to the pension from February 1986 through December 2008 because he “had no idea there was a pension involved.”', 'The decision also relies on what the plan administrator deemed “the negative implications of certain actions of the Town Council.” In its decision, the plan administrator explains that the plan had been underfunded for a number of years and one reason may have been a lack of required employee contributions. Moreover, the decision explains that, beginning in the mid- 1990s, certain union-member employees were required to contribute to their pension, but administrative employees were not. Then, in 2007, the town council adopted a resolution providing that full-time, permanent employees hired after 2007 would be required to contribute a', '- 14 - certain part of their gross wages toward the cost of the plan. Based on the town council’s adoption of this resolution, along with a 2010 resolution with additional new requirements requiring contributions by employees, the decision reasons that “if the persons holding the positions of probate judge, acting probate judge, or assistant solicitor participated in the Plan, one would have expected that those persons would also have been required to contribute since the obvious purpose of the resolutions was to increase Plan contributions.”', 'The decision goes on to explain that the positions of probate judge, acting probate judge, and assistant solicitor are not full-time positions. In reaching that conclusion, the decision notes the limited number of days per month devoted to the position of probate judge, the lack of minimum-hour requirements for the assistant solicitor position, and plaintiff’s ability to continue to privately practice law in addition to performing his duties as assistant solicitor.7 For these reasons, the decision concludes that the exclusion of these positions from contribution requirements of the plan “was neither oversight nor special indulgence, but was rather an indication that the probate judge, acting probate judge, and assistant solicitors were not considered as participants under the Plan and thus need not have been taken into account.”', 'Finally, the decision addresses plaintiff’s post-hearing arguments. First, the decision discusses the letter from the legal consultant. In that letter, the legal consultant opined that it appeared that the town solicitor and the assistant town solicitors would qualify to participate in the plan because, he believed, they were “eligible employees” under the plan. The decision explains that the plan administrator did consider the legal consultant’s letter, “but was ultimately unpersuaded by the rationale presented in the * * * opinion, which was essentially that the 7', 'The plan administrator did not go into detail regarding plaintiff’s brief tenure as town manager because plaintiff did not serve in the position long enough to have earned any pension benefits, regardless of the interpretation of the plans.', '- 15 - Town’s Charter does indicate indirectly who are the Town’s Administrative Employees who fall within the definition of ‘Eligible Employee’ who are the Active Participants of the Plan.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)', 'The decision then addresses and dismisses plaintiff’s argument that the plan administrator must strictly construe the ambiguity in the phrase “administrative employee” against the drafter. The plan administrator reviewed the caselaw plaintiff cited and found it to be irrelevant. Moreover, the plan administrator “determined that it would be a breach of its fiduciary duties for it to blithely determine that because the phrase ‘administrative employee’ is undefined and ambiguous that it must be interpreted—by the virtue of its ambiguity—to provide [plaintiff] with a pension.” Finally, the decision finds as fact that the positions described as “administrative employees” under the plan differ from those held by plaintiff because those positions require full-time commitments to the town. Moreover, the decision notes that “unlike ‘administrative employees,’ probate judges, acting probate judges and assistant solicitors do not have set working hours, do not participate in any Town-provided health coverage, do not get holiday pay or overtime, and do not have vacation, sick or any other leave.”', '“Use of the arbitrary and capricious standard means that reviewing courts will uphold administrative decisions interpreting the plan as long as the administrative interpreters have acted within their authority to make such decisions and their decisions were rational, logical, and supported by substantial evidence.” Goncalves, 818 A.2d at 682-83. “Substantial evidence means evidence reasonably sufficient to support a conclusion.” Id. at 683 (emphasis in original) (deletion omitted) (quoting Doyle v.

This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on December 5, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The plaintiff, John Broccoli (plaintiff or Broccoli), a pro se litigant, appeals from the Superior Court’s entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, attorney Walter Manning (Manning or defendant). After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and after reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 12, 2013, a mortgage broker named Richard Dion (Dion) contacted defendant and asked if he would assist plaintiff in obtaining a modification on his mortgage payments and try to stop a foreclosure sale that was scheduled to occur on March 15, 2013, for property located at 1483 Mineral Spring Avenue, North Providence, Rhode Island (the property). The defendant informed Dion that it was “highly unlikely” anything could be done “at such a late stage in the', '-1- foreclosure proceedings[,]” but he agreed to contact the mortgage company on plaintiff’s behalf. That same day, at defendant’s request, Dion obtained a signed “Authorization Form” executed by plaintiff at Manning Law Offices’ satellite office. The form authorized Manning Law Offices to act as plaintiff’s designated agent to discuss options with Bay View Loan Servicing (Bay View); according to plaintiff, “[t]he objective was to secure a more practical loan arrangement[.]” Specifically, the authorization form allowed Bay View “to work out the terms of [a] payment agreement with [defendant] and to cause to deliver requested documents to [defendant] that concerns a request for payment assistance.” In addition, the authorization form stipulated that Bay View was to “immediately cease direct contact with [plaintiff] regarding [his] account” and required that all contact related to plaintiff’s account be referred to defendant. Armed with the authorization, defendant contacted Bay View, only to discover that plaintiff was not the owner of the property. Bay View declined to speak to defendant in any detail because he did not have authorization from the true property owner and borrower, which was an entity named Brocco Development Corporation (Brocco).1 Three days later, on March 15, 2013, the property was sold at a public foreclosure sale.', 'More than three years later, on July 1, 2016, plaintiff filed a complaint, pro se, in the Superior Court against defendant alleging breach of contract and fraud, and sought over 1', 'The facts in the complaint allege, albeit vaguely, that Brocco Development Corporation owned the property located at 1483 Mineral Spring Avenue and leased all, or a portion of, the property to Spardello’s Clothiers, a now-defunct men’s clothing store, with which plaintiff was affiliated in some capacity. In addition, although not alleged in the complaint or provided for in the discovery responses filed with the court, at a hearing on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, discussed in more detail infra, plaintiff’s attorney clarified that plaintiff was the sole shareholder of Brocco Development Corporation.', '-2- $875,000 in damages.2 The defendant, also acting pro se, filed an answer in which he denied the allegations and asserted several affirmative defenses, including lack of standing, insufficient service of process, and failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. On March 24, 2017, plaintiff moved for summary judgment and argued, in essence, that defendant breached his fiduciary duty owed to plaintiff. The defendant filed an objection and a cross-motion for summary judgment, in which he proffered four arguments in opposition to summary judgment and in support of his cross-motion. Specifically, defendant argued that: (1) any claim against defendant would arise from a claim for legal malpractice, which was barred by the three-year statute of limitations for such claims; (2) plaintiff lacked standing to assert a cause of action against defendant because plaintiff was not the owner or the mortgagor of the property; (3) there was no attorney-client relationship between plaintiff and defendant; and (4) plaintiff could not establish any damages.', 'A hearing on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment was held on October 11, 2017.3 The parties agreed to pass plaintiff’s motion and address only defendant’s motion for summary judgment.4 After hearing argument from the parties, the hearing justice granted 2', 'The plaintiff also filed a complaint against defendant with this Court’s Disciplinary Counsel; however, on April 15, 2016, that complaint was dismissed. 3', 'Although plaintiff filed his complaint pro se, he was represented by counsel at the hearing on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment. 4', 'We pause to note that plaintiff seems to have filed two motions for summary judgment—the first motion was filed on July 1, 2016, and was attached to the complaint; the second motion for summary judgment was filed on March 24, 2017. The first motion for summary judgment that was attached to the complaint was the operative pleading at the hearing, with no mention of the second. Counsel for plaintiff stipulated that plaintiff had “filed a motion for summary judgment along with his * * * initial pleading” and that it was “too early for him to do that” because the pleadings “had not been all filed at that time.” The plaintiff’s counsel proceeded to claim that he was not prepared to argue plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and the motion was passed.', '-3- summary judgment in favor of defendant.5 In doing so, the hearing justice stated that it was difficult “to suggest this was anything other than a relationship against a professional defendant” in light of the fact that “the complaint itself states that the defendant committed fraud as an attorney and utilized his skill to the detriment of the plaintiff.”', 'The hearing justice thus concluded that the complaint was “subject to the three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice contained within * * * [§] 9-1-14.3.” The hearing justice next considered when that statutory period began to run and concluded, based upon plaintiff’s answers to defendant’s requests for admission, that plaintiff “knew the moment the foreclosure took place about the alleged negligence[,]” and therefore plaintiff “did not bring this cause of action in a timely fashion[.]” The plaintiff appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that this Court reviews a hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment de novo.

Conversely, “if the record evinces a 5', 'The plaintiff’s complaint also alleged that defendant, or defendant’s law firm, participated in a “scam” by allegedly purchasing the property at the foreclosure sale. When questioned by the hearing justice about this allegation, defendant stated, several times, that he “Never, ever, ever owned the property.” However, after further prompting, defendant eventually conceded that he was “in the business of lending money on real estate ventures” and “lent money on this project, but [he] never owned the property.” Instead, defendant stated that he, along with other individuals, “liened the property for a loan [he] gave someone[.]” The hearing justice expressed her concern about this transaction and stated, “Something doesn’t sit right with me about the fact that you would finance a project when you had previously been asked to assist with preventing the foreclosure.” Nevertheless, she proceeded to rule in favor of defendant.

Lovett, Schefrin and Harnett, 862 A.2d 778, 783 (R.I. 2004).', 'Discussion', 'We note at the outset that plaintiff has not provided this Court with any meaningful discussion of the issues on appeal as required by Article I, Rule 16(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, which provides: “Errors not claimed, questions not raised and points not made ordinarily will be treated as waived and not be considered by the Court.” In particular, plaintiff has failed to articulate how the hearing justice erred in granting defendant’s motion for summary judgment. This Court generally deems an issue waived “when a party simply states an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof.” A. Salvati Masonry Inc. v. Andreozzi, 151 A.3d 745, 750 (R.I. 2017) (brackets and deletion omitted) (quoting In re Jake G., 126 A.3d 450, 458 (R.I. 2015)). “A mere passing reference to an argument, * * * without meaningful elaboration, will not suffice to merit appellate review.” State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n.19 (R.I. 2007); see Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n.1 (R.I. 2002) (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”). Consequently, plaintiff’s arguments are waived under this Court’s raise-or-waive rule for failure to meaningfully develop or discuss what error was committed on the part of the hearing justice in this case.', 'Nonetheless, our review of the record convinces us that the hearing justice did not err in granting defendant’s motion for summary judgment. “General Laws 1956 § 9-1-14.3 sets forth a', '-5- three-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice claims.” Behroozi v. Kirshenbaum, 128 A.3d 869, 872 (R.I. 2016). Section 9-1-14.3 provides, in relevant part, that:', '“Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 9-1-13 and 9-1-14, an action', 'for legal malpractice shall be commenced within three (3) years of', 'the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the action;', 'provided, however, that:', '“* * *', '“(2) In respect to those injuries due to acts of legal malpractice', 'which could not in the exercise of reasonable diligence be', 'discoverable at the time of the occurrence of the incident which', 'gave rise to the action, suit shall be commenced within three (3)', 'years of the time that the act or acts of legal malpractice should, in', 'the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been discovered.” Although plaintiff contends that a ten-year statute of limitations should apply to this “breach of contract with fraud” claim, his contention is belied by the pleadings. The plaintiff’s complaint alleges that defendant, as “an attorney, utilized his skills at eviction, while aware of his responsibility to labor on the behalf of [p]laintiff,” and had “breach[ed] his * * * responsibilities, as contractor, for [p]laintiff, officer of the Court, State of Rhode Island, and knowingly disregarding” Rhode Island statutes. We are hard-pressed to conclude that a “breach of contract with fraud” claim that centers on a defendant-attorney’s attempt to obtain a mortgage- modification agreement on behalf of a plaintiff is anything but a legal malpractice claim that arose from a professional relationship, subject to the three-year statute of limitations set forth in § 9-1-14.3.', 'Moreover, plaintiff’s contention that his “breach of contract with fraud” claim should be subject to a ten-year statute of limitations is meritless as the record is devoid of any evidence that a contract, express or implied, existed between the parties. This Court has previously declared that a valid contract requires “competent parties, subject matter, a legal consideration, mutuality of agreement, and mutuality of obligation.” DeAngelis v. DeAngelis, 923 A.2d 1274, 1279 (R.I.', '-6- 2007) (quoting Rhode Island Five v. Medical Associates of Bristol County, Inc., 668 A.2d 1250, 1253 (R.I. 1996)). Assuming, arguendo, that plaintiff has established that there are competent parties, as set forth on the “Authorization Form,” plaintiff nevertheless has failed to establish the remaining elements—namely, consideration, subject matter, and mutuality of agreement and obligation. Accordingly, plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that his claim against defendant should be subject to a ten-year statute of limitations for an action in contract or that the hearing justice erred in applying a three-year statute of limitations in this case.', 'Finally, it is our opinion that the hearing justice was correct in concluding that the statutory period for the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant began to run in March 2013. The discovery-rule exception, codified in § 9-1-14.3(2), “requires only that the plaintiff be aware of facts that would place a reasonable person on notice that a potential claim exists.” Sharkey v. Prescott, 19 A.3d 62, 66 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Canavan, 862 A.2d at 784). “The discovery rule does not require perfect crystallization of the nature and extent of the injury suffered or a clear- cut anchoring to the allegedly negligent conduct of a defendant.” Fogarty v. Palumbo, 163 A.3d 526, 534 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Bustamante v. Oshiro, 64 A.3d 1200, 1207 (R.I. 2013)). Rather, a legal-malpractice plaintiff is afforded three years to commence suit from “the time that the act or acts of the malpractice should, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been discovered.” Section 9-1-14.1(2). In the case at bar, the plaintiff concedes that he knew the moment the foreclosure took place that the defendant breached any alleged duty owed to the plaintiff. Specifically, the defendant’s requests for admission sought an admission of the truth of the following factual statement: “It is the allegation of the Plaintiff that on the foreclosure date Plaintiff knew Defendant committed negligence.” The plaintiff admitted the following in his answer to that request: “Absolutely I assert with each question you ask.” We therefore conclude', '-7- that the hearing justice correctly granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment after concluding that the plaintiff’s complaint, filed on July 1, 2016, was barred by the statute of limitations, which ran on March 15, 2016.', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed and the record may be remanded thereto.', 'Justice Flaherty did not participate.', '-8- STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'John Broccoli v.

Maria Silva also expressly acknowledged that they have not applied to DEM to alter that portion.', 'Mrs. Silva testified that she learned that Carole Tanguay (the eventual grantor to the Lavertys) then owned the property from which the pipe carried water downhill onto the Silva property. She added that, on June 24, 2009, the attorney representing her and her husband sent a certified letter to Carole Tanguay “notif[ying] her of the pipe that was projecting from her property onto [the Silva property] * * * and ask[ing] her to take the necessary steps to correct it * * *.” Mrs. Silva testified that she later “happened to drive by [Carole Tanguay’s property]” and, at that time, she “saw a for sale sign.” She added that, when she and her husband learned that defendants were “the new owners” of the uphill property, the same attorney sent the Lavertys a letter on September 29, 2009, enclosing therewith the above-referenced June 24, 2009 letter.', '2. The Testimony of Carole Tanguay', 'Carole Tanguay, the previous owner of what became the Laverty property, was shown by plaintiffs’ counsel recent photographs of the Silva property, and she said that she recognized the area but that she “never saw this much water” and that there was substantially more water depicted in the photographs than she had ever observed. She also acknowledged her signature on a certified letter regarding the water discharge issue that plaintiffs’ counsel had sent to her in June of 2009, but she added that she did not remember receiving the letter or signing for it.', '3. The Testimony of Brandon Faneuf', 'Brandon Faneuf, an expert called by the Silvas who described himself as a “[w]etlands scientist,” testified that he first took a view of the Silva property in April of 2013 and did so again on one later occasion. It was his opinion that there were several indicators of the presence of a wetland, including an “impounded area,” which he defined as being “[a]n area where water', '5 is standing.” He further explained that such an area “doesn’t so much have observable flow as it’s just standing” and has “wetland plants” that indicate “a hydrophytic condition, which means that more likely than not there is water near the surface * * *.” When asked to describe “the flow of the water” onto the Silva property, he said: “The water starts at the pipe we’ve been talking about. It flows downhill into the impounded area * * *.”', 'Mr. Faneuf opined that “[t]he discharge of water from the subject pipe exacerbates the amount of water entering the Silvas’ property;” and he added that, “[i]f there was no pipe present discharging water, that area would be dryer.” When asked by the trial justice if he could determine to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty how much wetter the portion of the Silva property at issue was because of the flow from the pipe, Mr. Faneuf said: “It all depends * * *. I’ll say from my professional opinion is that during springtime and after the snow melts, rain events, there can be significant amounts of water flowing into that area enough to exceed the limits of the impoundment area * * *.” Mr. Faneuf responded affirmatively when asked on cross-examination: “So you have indicated that there’s a preexisting wetlands on the Silvas’ property, correct?” The following exchange then ensued:', '“[COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANTS:]', 'And it’s your opinion', 'that, at least your affidavit indicates, that the preexisting – that the', 'pipe exacerbates that condition; is that right?', '“[MR. FANEUF:]', 'Yes.', '“[COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANTS:]', 'But * * * basically', 'what your affidavit says is you cannot tell the extent to which the', 'preexisting wetland is exacerbated by the discharge of water from', 'the pipe; is that right?', '“[MR. FANEUF:]', 'That is right, and what I read here in the', 'affidavit is that * * * ‘this underground pipe is certainly emitting', 'and delivering additional water onto the Silva property although', 'I’m unable to quantify to what degree * * *.’ I’m unable to', '6', 'quantify in terms of volume. That’s not my training, that’s not my', 'background.', '“[COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANTS:]', 'Fair enough.', 'And', 'you haven’t determined whether the wetland has expanded', 'laterally as a result of the discharge of water onto the property, is', 'that right?', '“[MR. FANEUF:]', 'Correct.” Mr. Faneuf further stated: “I have not determined whether or not the wetland has extended laterally in width.” As indicated above, when the trial justice inquired of Mr. Faneuf whether the wetland area on the Silva property was expanding because of the flow from the pipe, he responded: “I’m unable to quantify in terms of volume. That’s not my training, that’s not my background.” He further testified:', '“The inherent problem with that is the pipe has been there for', 'much longer than when I first arrived on the scene in 2013. So for', 'me to definitively tell you what the lateral extent of change was is', 'very difficult, but I just wasn’t around to see the preexisting', 'condition. So it makes it very difficult on my part to give you, say,', 'five feet, ten feet. It’s very difficult to say. All I can say is that', 'when you add water to an existing system, it can extend the lateral', 'extent of the impounded water.”', '4. The Testimony of Norman Beretta', 'The plaintiffs also called as an expert one Norman Beretta, a real estate appraiser. He testified that he had viewed the Silva property “[p]robably four times, at least.” Mr. Beretta testified that he was asked to look at a portion of the land that was “27,000 square feet.” He opined that the fair market value of that portion was “$75,000,” under the assumption that that portion of land was buildable.', 'However, he further testified that he later performed an “addendum appraisal” and that he did so “under the assumption that [that portion of the property] is rendered unbuildable by the discharge of water from the pipe that exists on the lot * * *.” He responded affirmatively when plaintiffs’ counsel asked: “[U]nder the buildable – your so-called', '7 buildable lot situation, then you have this property having a value of $75,000, and under the application of the diminution in value facts, then you have it having a value of $8,000?” He also testified that, if one took out that portion of the lot (which he believed had been rendered unbuildable because of the impact of the flow from the pipe), “you still end up with – it would be a legal lot.”', 'B', 'The Defendants’ Witnesses', '1. The Testimony of Shawn and Jessica Laverty', 'Shawn and Jessica Laverty testified that they purchased their property in August of 2009 from Carole Tanguay, that the pipe had been installed on their property before they purchased it, that DEM had approved the pipe before it was installed, and that they had made no changes to the pipe. Shawn Laverty testified that they first became aware of the pipe in September of 2009, upon receipt of the letter from plaintiffs’ attorney. Jessica Laverty testified that she had not seen the letter about the pipe that plaintiffs’ attorney sent to Carole Tanguay before Carole Tanguay sold the property to the Lavertys.', '2. The Testimony of Janet Tanguay', 'Janet Tanguay testified that she formerly owned and lived at the property which is now the Silva property and which she said is at the bottom of a hill. Mrs. Tanguay testified that there had always been water problems on the portion of the property that is at issue in this case. She additionally testified that, before she sold the property to plaintiffs in 2005, they had come to inspect the property.', 'Mrs. Tanguay agreed that she “might have” told a real estate agent involved in the transaction that there were wetlands on the property.', '8', '3. The Testimony of Robert Tanguay', 'Robert Tanguay7 testified that since 1947 he has lived at 160 Roland Street (a site distinct from the properties at issue), which is “two house lots up” from the Laverty property. He testified that Gerard Tanguay (his brother) was the prior owner of both the Laverty property and the Silva property, and he said that Richard Tanguay was his nephew. He additionally testified that he was present when Richard was constructing the house on what would eventually become the Laverty property. He testified that Richard installed the pipe because DEM had “made him put that pipe in” due to the fact that, as a result of his elevating his land during the construction, “a neighbor * * * was getting flooded.” He further testified that the pipe was installed in order to manage the surface water on what is now the Laverty property.', 'Robert Tanguay stated that there had been water on what is now the Silva property “[f]orever.” He further testified that, during his childhood, there had been sufficient water accumulation on said property that one could “skate in the winter, when I was a kid, on that little pond in there.” He recalled: “Gerry’s pond we used to call it.” When asked if, before the installation of the pipe in 1987, he had referred to the area in question as a “pond,” he responded: “Oh, definitely, yes.” He continued: “It’s wetlands. It always was.” He also testified that he had seen an accumulation of water on that area being as extensive as it was depicted in the photographs shown to other witnesses. Robert Tanguay also testified that, while there are times of the year when the area is “somewhat” dry, even then it is “still muddy.” 7', 'Robert and James Tanguay (father and son respectively) were dismissed without prejudice from this action during the trial, having originally been named by defendants as third- party defendants.', '9', '4. The Testimony of Scott Rabideau', 'The defendants called as an expert witness one Scott Rabideau, who testified that his “expertise has always been as a wetland biologist, a wildlife biologist, or a coastal biologist and a permitting specialist.” Mr. Rabideau testified that he had at an earlier time been engaged by plaintiffs and that he has been to the Silva property at least six times. He also acknowledged that DEM has never officially determined that there is any wetland on the Silva property. He testified that, in order to determine whether a wetland is present on property, experts look to “whether or not the area is inundated or saturated with surface or groundwater and whether or not the area has a prevalence of wetland indicator plant species.” He stated that “[i]t would not be uncommon for a wetland to be dry.” He said that, to qualify as a wetland, the ground “needs to be only saturated so the groundwater is at or near the surface and there never has to be standing water in certain wetlands.”', 'Mr. Rabideau testified that he had reviewed aerial photographs of the Silva property, which were “dated 1939, 1951, 1972, 1981, 1988, 1997, 2003, 2008 and 2011.” He stated that examining aerial photographs to “provide a historic perspective” constitutes a “normal part of any evaluation of a freshwater wetland.” He testified to the following as his opinion:', '“[T]here is a freshwater wetland on [the Silva property]. It is a', 'freshwater wetland that is less than three acres in size. It is', 'regulated by the Department of Environmental Management, and', 'based on a review of the historic aerial photographs, it hasn’t', 'changed in terms of its lateral size over the course of 1972 to', '2011.” Mr. Rabideau responded affirmatively when asked: “So is it your opinion that there was a wetland in existence before the pipe was installed at [the Laverty property]?” He likewise responded affirmatively when asked: “And if that pipe is removed, will there continue to be a wetland on [the Silva property]?” He continued:', '10', '“[T]here’s going to be a change in the duration and frequency of', 'flooding. * * *', '“If that pipe is eliminated, capped, that flow is going to back up.', '* * * [I]t’s going to pop out of that catch basin and it’s still going', 'to run down to this wetland across the property. It’s still going to', 'get to that wetland. So the duration is going to take longer to fill', 'up but you’re still going to get the same amount of water. The', 'groundwater is going to discharge and travel downhill to that', 'wetland.”', 'Mr. Rabideau testified that a landowner can alter (i.e., build on top of) a wetland, but he added that such a landowner must apply to DEM before beginning that process. When asked about the Silva property specifically and whether, in his opinion, DEM would likely grant a permit to build on the portion of the land that is allegedly impacted by the water from the pipe, he stated: “[A] home could be constructed in those areas and you would never have to fill the flooded area.” He testified that, because there is a second pipe that drains the water from the wetland on the Silva property, which second pipe is equal in size and downhill from the pipe that runs from the Laverty property, “there is a sufficient pitch across the property so that the water, to make it simple, flows downhill through the property and out to the pipe. * * * [s]o it allows the water to get out off the site.”', 'C', 'The Trial Justice’s Decision', 'After the three-day bench trial and after the submission of post-trial memoranda,8 on November 30, 2016, the trial justice issued a bench decision that was favorable to defendants. He summarized the essence of his decision as follows: 8', 'During the course of the trial, the trial justice had allowed plaintiffs to amend the complaint (which originally alleged liability only under a negligence theory) to include a count alleging nuisance.', '11', '“The fatal flaw in plaintiffs’ claim is that they failed to prove harm.', 'The evidence is insufficient to establish that plaintiffs’ property is', 'any worse off because of the installation of the pipe in question.', 'The only evidence that plaintiffs provided regarding the effect of', 'the installation of the catch basin and drainage pipe was from Mr.', 'Faneuf.” (Emphasis added.) In addition, with respect to the testimony of Mr. Faneuf, the trial justice stated:', '“He did testify that[,] in his opinion, the property was wetter after', 'the pipe was installed but he could not quantify how much wetter.', '* * * He could not quantify how much the pipe increased the', 'wetland.

Otherwise, how else', 'could he possibly conclude that the property is wetter. If he can’t', 'say how much wetter the property is, then he can’t know the', 'condition of the property prior to the installation of the pipe.

His testimony was', 'consistent with historical facts provided by the witnesses,', 'especially Robert Tanguay, who had lived in the area since 1947.”', '(Emphasis added.) In clear and cogent language, the trial justice then expressly held as follows:', 'In the course of his comprehensive and cogent bench decision, the trial justice stated that he did “not believe that the negligence theory is applicable to the facts and circumstances of this case.” In view of our holding (see infra) that plaintiffs’ case is fatally flawed under both a negligence theory and a nuisance theory, we need not and therefore do not pass upon the just quoted statement of the trial justice.

59,William Felkner : v. : Rhode Island College et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The principles of academic freedom often find uneasy passage in the halls of academia.1 In this appeal, the plaintiff, William Felkner, describes himself as a “conservative libertarian.” He chose, nevertheless, to matriculate in the Master of Social Work program at Rhode Island College’s School of Social Work, which, he claims, has a distinct sociopolitical ideology. A clash of values was inevitable. In 2007, Felkner filed an action against Rhode Island College and various college officials (collectively defendants),2 alleging they had violated his constitutional rights to freedom of expression and equal protection. In 2013, Felkner amended his complaint to include claims for conspiracy to violate his civil rights and a violation of his procedural due process rights.

Felkner asked if the SSW would consider showing the movie FahrenHYPE 9/11, a conservative rebuttal to Fahrenheit 9/11. According to Felkner, Professor Ryczek responded that the SSW has a mission dedicated to social and economic justice and suggested that “anyone who consistently holds antithetical views to those that are espoused by the profession might ask themselves whether social work is the profession for them.” Felkner also wrote an email to Professor Daniel 3', 'We wish to thank the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, the National Association of Scholars, and the Cato Institute for their amici curiae brief. 4', 'The plaintiff’s first amended complaint was the operative complaint at the time of defendants’ renewed motion for summary judgment, but this pleading was not verified by Felkner.

In response to Felkner’s email, Professor Weisman expressed that the SSW was “not committed to balanced presentations” and that, “[f]or the most part, Republican ideology is oppositional to the [social work] profession’s fundamental values.” Ultimately, however, Professor Weisman presented FahrenHYPE 9/11 to the same classes that saw Fahrenheit 9/11.', 'As part of “Policy and Organizing I,” students were assigned a group project in which they were to debate a social welfare issue and write a policy paper promoting the group’s position. According to Felkner, the students could choose from a list of issues provided by Professor Ryczek, all of which involved, in Felkner’s words, “a leftist position on social welfare issues.” Professor Ryczek also informed the class that each student would participate in a class debate and then lobby for their selected issue before the Rhode Island General Assembly in the next semester’s “Policy and Organizing II” class. Felkner joined a class group advocating for passage of Senate Bill 525 (SB 525), which he described as an amendment to “a temporary cash assistance program for Rhode Islanders having a difficult time making ends meet.”', 'Thereafter, however, Felkner asked Professor Ryczek for permission to argue against SB 525 in the class debate after he concluded that “SB 525 did not actually help people get off welfare with higher-paying jobs * * *.” According to Felkner, Professor Ryczek denied this request, explaining that RIC “is a perspective school and we teach that perspective” and “if you are going to lobby on [SB 525], you’re going to lobby in our perspective.” Nevertheless, Felkner wrote his policy paper from a perspective opposing the passage of SB 525 and contrary to—in Felkner’s words—Professor Ryzcek’s “professed support of a comprehensive welfare state.” At his deposition, Professor Ryczek testified that he typically gives a group grade for the group work. However, after members of Felkner’s group told Professor Ryzcek that Felkner “was not', '-3- participating in the group as expected[,]” Professor Ryczek agreed to “disaggregate” Felkner’s grade from the group grade. Professor Ryczek further stated that he had never disaggregated a student’s grade before, nor had he ever given a grade lower than an “A minus” or “B plus” for the group class debate. Felkner received a failing grade on both his written assignment and classroom debate because he had not followed the directives of the assignment. Professor Ryczek then offered Felkner an opportunity to rewrite his paper. Ultimately, Professor Ryczek gave Felkner a C plus as his final course grade. Felkner appealed the failing grades for the paper and debate to the Academic Standing Committee (ASC) for the SSW.', 'On January 20, 2005, the ASC held a hearing on Felkner’s appeal. According to Felkner, he was denied the opportunity to question Professor Ryczek at the hearing because Professor Ryczek left the room immediately following his testimony. Because Felkner believed that Professor Ryczek had given inaccurate testimony at the ASC hearing regarding conversations between them, Felkner announced that he would henceforth record all of his conversations with RIC professors. The next day, the ASC denied Felkner’s appeal of his grades.', 'Felkner further appealed the matter to the chair of the Master of Social Work (MSW) program, Dr. Lenore Olsen, and then to the dean of the SSW, defendant Carol Bennett-Speight. In both appeals, the decision of the ASC was upheld. Felkner also contacted the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) about his alleged mistreatment. In a letter to RIC’s then- President, defendant John Nazarian, dated January 28, 2005, FIRE noted that, in “[t]he case of Bill Felkner[,]” RIC should “reconsider and withdraw its unconstitutional policies.”', 'On February 15, 2005, Nazarian replied that no RIC student had been punished for failing to espouse a certain political belief.', '-4-', 'At the close of the Fall semester, Professor Ryczek wrote to Dr. Olsen, informing her that he would not teach the “Policy and Organizing II” class the next semester because, as an adjunct faculty member, dealing with Felkner required too much of his time. Consequently, Felkner was transferred to a section of the course taught by full-time Professor Roberta Pearlmutter. The plaintiff’s relations with Professor Pearlmutter, however, were no more salubrious than they had been with Professor Ryczek.', 'One assignment in “Policy and Organizing II” required students to complete a group project approved by Professor Pearlmutter. Felkner proposed to Professor Pearlmutter that he be allowed to form a group with students from other colleges to lobby RIC for an Academic Bill of Rights. Professor Pearlmutter rejected Felkner’s proposal, noting that it did not have a direct impact on the “poor and oppressed” and did not advance “social justice.” Professor Pearlmutter also rejected Felkner’s request to lobby in favor of the then-governor’s welfare-reform proposal for the project.', 'Next, Felkner suggested that he be allowed to work on a project lobbying for the defeat of SB 525 in the General Assembly. Professor Pearlmutter told Felkner that she would penalize his grade on the project if he did not work on it with classmates from his “Policy and Organizing II” class. Felkner had difficulty recruiting group members because his fellow students had already formed groups to promote policies that were contrary to his “conscience.” Because of the “hostility towards his beliefs[,]” Felkner worked on his project with a group comprising himself and two individuals from outside of RIC.6 Some of his conversations with Professor Pearlmutter took place through the exchange of emails. One conversation about Felkner’s proposed projects was in person; Felkner audio-recorded the conversation without Professor 6', 'Felkner formed a group with a Brown University student and “a local radio personality[.]”', '-5- Pearlmutter’s knowledge and later posted a rough transcript of the conversation to a website he had created to expose what he characterized as the “liberal bias” at RIC.', 'During one of Professor Pearlmutter’s classes, the students were permitted to discuss their concerns about Felkner’s postings on his website related to the “Policy and Organizing II” class. According to Professor Pearlmutter, she was approached by several students who were concerned that the confidentiality of class discussions was being compromised by Felkner when he posted about those discussions on his website. She maintained that students in the class asked that Felkner discuss any issues he had with the class during classroom discussions rather than on his website. Felkner, however, asserted that his conservative views were “assail[ed]” and that Professor Pearlmutter allowed other students to “assault” his views without allowing him the opportunity to respond.', 'According to Felkner, “[t]he unmistakable message Defendant Pearlmutter communicated through the discussion was that only liberal/progressive ideas can help the poor and advance the cause of social justice.”', 'Professor Pearlmutter eventually filed a complaint with the ASC, asserting that Felkner had committed unethical and unprofessional conduct in violation of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) Code of Ethics. On April 27, 2005, the ASC held a hearing on Professor Pearlmutter’s complaint. Thereafter, the ASC issued a written decision, through its chair Dr. Diane Martell, in which it found that Felkner’s deceptive conduct in recording his conversation with Professor Pearlmutter violated one of the three sections of the Code of Ethics alleged by Professor Pearlmutter in her complaint. The ASC recommended to the chair of the MSW program that Felkner “declare immediately, in writing, that [he] will henceforth refrain from any deceptive audio or video copying of conversations with social work colleagues and refrain from any audio or video copying without express permission from them.” The ASC', '-6- further recommended that Felkner be dismissed from the MSW program if he was unwilling to execute such a declaration. In a letter to Dean Bennett-Speight, dated May 11, 2005, Felkner stated that he would refrain from making audio or video recordings of his conversations with his SSW colleagues unless he first obtained their consent to record.', 'At the end of Felkner’s first year in the MSW program, he met with his adviser and chose the Social Work Organizing and Policy (SWOP) concentration for completion of the degree. As a MSW student, Felkner was required to complete a field placement and an integrative project in order to fulfill the MSW program requirements. For Felkner’s field placement and integrative project, he secured an internship in then-Governor Donald L. Carcieri’s office, working on welfare-reform legislation.', 'Felkner alleged that Professor Ryczek, as director of field placements, rejected Felkner’s placement because it would not advance the concentration’s objectives of promoting progressive social change.', 'Felkner claimed that Professor Ryczek advised him that the SWOP-concentration objectives required him to advocate for liberal, progressive policies, and that he suggested Felkner’s views might make him better suited to another academic discipline, such as political science. The MSW department chair, Dr. Olsen, supported Professor Ryczek’s position by indicating that Felkner might consider pursuing other concentrations if he was not able to work on the academic objectives of the SWOP concentration.', 'On June 9, 2005, Felkner met with Dean Bennett-Speight about his challenges with Professor Ryczek and Dr. Olsen, claiming they were discriminating against him because of his conservative views. Thereafter, Dean Bennett-Speight assigned Professor S. Scott Mueller, also a defendant in this case, as Felkner’s field placement supervisor. Professor Mueller also initially rejected Felkner’s proposed field placement and integrative project, but eventually RIC approved', '-7- the field placement in the Governor’s office. According to Felkner, Professor Mueller refused to approve Felkner’s proposed integrative project on welfare reform because it was a “toxic” subject. Consequently, Felkner “reluctantly conceded to work on healthcare reform for his [integrative project].” Felkner further asserted that working on healthcare reform put him at a disadvantage relative to other SSW students because he was unable to use his field placement research for his integrative project.', 'Felkner proceeded to work on his integrative project in the fall of 2006 and most of 2007. On November 26, 2007, Felkner requested an extension of time to complete his integrative project. In January 2008, Dean Bennett-Speight granted Felkner an extension until May 11, 2009, to complete his degree requirements.', 'The extension was conditioned upon Felkner submitting a portion of the project by April 15, 2008, a condition with which he did not comply. On March 17, 2008, Felkner requested an additional six-week extension; but both Dean Bennett- Speight and Professor Pearlmutter denied his request.', 'In December 2007, amid his integrative project extension requests, Felkner filed the instant action in Providence County Superior Court alleging that defendants’ conduct toward him during his enrollment in the MSW program violated his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Specifically, Felkner’s initial verified complaint included claims for: deprivation of his right to freedom of expression “on issues of political concern” (count one) in part by placing “unconstitutional conditions on [his] continuance in the [MSW] program” (count four); violation of his right to freedom of expression by retaliating against him for “expressing his political beliefs and for publicly criticizing [RIC’s] liberal biases” (count two) and by compelling him to “express ideas * * * contrary to his political beliefs” (count three); and violation of his right to equal protection (count five).', 'The defendants answered and filed a motion for summary', '-8- judgment, which a hearing justice denied after finding the case to be “extremely fact intensive and not susceptible to disposition by summary proceedings.”', 'On December 3, 2013, Felkner filed an amended complaint, adding two counts. One new claim alleged that defendants had violated his procedural due process rights by the way in which they conducted the ASC hearings related to the complaints involving Felkner (count six). The other new claim alleged that defendants had engaged in a conspiracy to violate his civil rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) (count seven). For all of the alleged constitutional violations contained in the amended complaint, Felkner asserted that he was entitled to damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988 as well as the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act (RICRA), including punitive damages. Felkner also sought an order expunging the ASC hearings from his academic file, an extension of time for him to complete his MSW degree, injunctive relief restraining enforcement of RIC’s speech code,7 and attorney’s fees.', 'The defendants sought to strike plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages after receiving a request for interrogatories seeking the individual defendants’ personal financial details.8 After conducting a hearing pursuant to Palmisano v. Toth, 624 A.2d 314 (R.I. 1993), the hearing justice struck plaintiff’s claim for punitive damages, finding that defendants’ conduct toward Felkner had not “rise[n] to the level of recklessness or callous indifference” to his constitutional rights and that, therefore, he had not established a prima facie case for punitive damages.', 'In March 2015, defendants filed a renewed motion for summary judgment on all of plaintiff’s claims, arguing in part that defendants were protected from civil liability, if any, by the doctrine of qualified immunity. In Felkner’s objection to the motion, he asserted that the law 7', 'Felkner later relinquished any claim with respect to RIC’s speech code. 8', 'Specifically, defendants filed a “Motion for Protective Order, or, in the Alternative, Motion to Strike Plaintiff’s Claim for Punitive Damages and Assign Matter for Evidentiary Hearing.”', '-9- of the case doctrine barred the renewed motion for summary judgment because the first motion for summary judgment had been denied and defendants had previously raised the issue of qualified immunity, although the hearing justice had not yet reached the issue or made any rulings thereon. He also argued that, if the renewed motion were to be considered, there were several issues of disputed facts that would preclude the entry of summary judgment against him.', 'The hearing justice disagreed with Felkner’s objections, concluding in a written decision that the law of the case doctrine did not prevent her from deciding defendants’ second motion for summary judgment because the record had significantly expanded during the several years of discovery that had taken place between the filing of the two dispositive motions. The hearing justice also concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The hearing justice did not substantively address the issue of qualified immunity, concluding this issue was moot based upon her conclusion that none of defendants’ actions had violated Felkner’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Final judgment entered in favor of defendants in November 2015, and Felkner timely filed a notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'Felkner is raising four main issues before this Court. The first is whether the law of the case doctrine should have precluded the hearing justice from considering defendants’ renewed motion for summary judgment. The second is whether genuine issues of material fact should have precluded the entry of summary judgment for each of Felkner’s federal constitutional claims. The third issue is whether the doctrine of qualified immunity protects the individually', '- 10 - named defendants from potential liability. The fourth issue is whether Felkner demonstrated a prima facie case for punitive damages. We take each issue in turn.', 'A', 'Law of the Case Doctrine', 'We first briefly address whether the law of the case doctrine should have precluded the hearing justice’s consideration of defendants’ renewed motion for summary judgment. Felkner argues that the hearing justice erred in considering the renewed motion because she relied upon the same affidavits as those relied on by the first hearing justice who presided over—and denied—defendants’ first motion for summary judgment. Felkner also argues that the expanded record reinforced the factual issues, rather than eliminating them.', '“The law of the case doctrine provides that, after a judge has decided an interlocutory matter in a pending suit, a second judge, confronted at a later stage of the suit with the same question in the identical manner, should refrain from disturbing the first ruling.” Quillen v.

The hearing justice acknowledged that defendants had submitted the same documents in support of their renewed motion, but that the parties had conducted significant discovery and the record had also been expanded by new exhibits.

In the intervening seven years, the parties produced additional discovery—the hearing justice referred to “ten depositions and thousands of pages of documents” in her written decision on the renewed motion for summary judgment—and Felkner amended his complaint to add claims for conspiracy and violation of procedural due process. Because the record before the hearing justice had indeed been expanded since the denial of defendants’ initial motion for summary judgment, we are of the opinion that she was acting well within her discretionary authority in entertaining and deciding the renewed motion for summary judgment.

In that regard, we need go no further than the affidavit of Richard Gelles, Ph.D., submitted in support of Felkner’s opposition to defendants’ motion for summary judgment.', 'At the time of his affidavit, Dr. Gelles was the Dean of the School of Social Policy & Practice at the University of Pennsylvania and a former member of the faculty at the University of Rhode Island. After reviewing the allegations in Felkner’s verified complaint, Dr. Gelles attested that, if Felkner’s claims were true, the alleged conduct by defendants was “contrary to the concepts of academic freedom and constitute a substantial departure from the norms of academic debate and scholarship that should prevail at colleges and universities, as well as in programs and/or schools offering the Masters of Social Work degree[.]”', 'Specifically, in his affidavit, Dr. Gelles referenced Felkner’s allegations that: (1) Professor Ryczek sent an email to Felkner stating that the social work profession has “a mission 14', 'Hazelwood School District v.

For the most part, Republican ideology is oppositional to the profession’s fundamental values”; (3) Felkner’s statement that Professor Pearlmutter “led a fifty-minute in- class discussion assailing Mr. Felkner’s conservative views” and allowed other students to “assault [his] views without allowing him to respond”; and (4) the fact that Felkner was prevented “from working on a welfare reform project with the Governor’s office because” it was contrary to “the political perspective of the project.”', 'In conducting our de novo review, we are mindful that neither “students [n]or teachers shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate[,]” but that such rights must be “applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment[.]” Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506. Accordingly, educational institutions are granted wide latitude to establish their curricula and “further [their] legitimate curricular objectives.” Ward v. Polite, 667 F.3d 727, 733 (6th Cir. 2012) (discussing Hazelwood). So, too, must teachers be given “broad discretion to give grades” and “in limiting speech when they are engaged in administering the curriculum.” Settle v. Dickson County School Board, 53 F.3d 152, 156 (6th Cir. 1995) (citing Tinker, 393 U.S. at 512-14). Moreover, “[s]o long as the teacher limits speech or grades speech in the classroom in the name of learning and not as a pretext for punishing the student for her race, gender, economic class, religion or political persuasion, the federal courts should not interfere.” Id. at 155; see Ward, 667 F.3d at 734 (“[T]he First Amendment does not permit educators to invoke curriculum ‘as a pretext for punishing a student * * *.’”) (alteration', '- 17 - omitted) (quoting Settle, 53 F.3d at 155). Courts “should show great respect for the faculty’s professional judgment. Plainly, they may not override it unless it is such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the person or committee responsible did not actually exercise professional judgment.” Regents of University of Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 225 (1985) (footnote omitted).', 'In light of these principles, we are of the opinion that Felkner’s freedom of speech claims deserve to go to a jury. The record in this case is voluminous and replete with disputed facts. Resolving all such facts in the light most favorable to Felkner, the issue is whether he has made tenable claims that defendants have violated his constitutional rights to free speech and expression. We believe that he has. Felkner describes himself as a “conservative libertarian” and was no doubt a challenging student with a political agenda as robust as the agenda he ascribes to defendants. Given the broad discretion afforded to educational institutions, he may have a difficult road ahead of him. Nevertheless, he has raised genuine issues of material fact concerning whether the actions of defendants are “reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns” or merely a pretext for punishing him for his conservative views. See Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 273. “Although we do not second-guess the pedagogical wisdom or efficacy of an educator’s goal, we would be abdicating our judicial duty if we failed to investigate whether the educational goal or pedagogical concern was pretextual.” Axson-Flynn v. Johnson, 356 F.3d 1277, 1292-93 (10th Cir. 2004) (emphases and footnote omitted). The fact that a student may be required to debate a topic from a perspective that is contrary to his or her own views may well be reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns. That relationship is far more tenuous, however, when the student is told that he or she must then lobby for that position in a public', '- 18 - forum or that his or her viewpoint is not welcome in the classroom because it is contrary to the majority viewpoint of the students and faculty.', 'There is ample evidence in the record which, if found credible by a factfinder, suggests that the MSW program had a strong predisposition toward so-called “progressive” social values. Viewing, as we must, the evidence most generously to Felkner, we are of the opinion that, in light of his avowedly conservative bent, genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether defendants’ justifications for their actions were truly pedagogical or whether they were pretextual. See Axson-Flynn, 356 F.3d at 1292-93. The subjective motivation of defendants is subject to conflicting interpretations; the duty of a trial justice, and this Court, in considering a motion for summary judgment “is not to resolve disputed factual issues but only to find them.” Pound Hill Corporation, Inc. v. Perl, 668 A.2d 1260, 1264 (R.I. 1996). We find several here. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment as to count one and remand to the Superior Court for trial or other disposition.', '3', 'Retaliation', 'Felkner’s second claim alleges that defendants “engaged in actions that are retaliatory and have therefore deprived [him] of his clearly established free speech rights * * *.” Felkner specifically alleges that the following conduct was retaliatory: “penalizing his grades, filing ethics charges against him, delaying his graduation, and denying him the opportunity to work on welfare reform in the Governor’s office, among other things[.]” In his objection to defendants’ renewed motion for summary judgment, Felkner expands on his enumerated list to include “[r]equiring him to stop taping classes and conversations with instructors; * * * [c]omplaining about a website he had created about the political bias he was experiencing; * * * [o]rganizing or', '- 19 - supporting verbal attacks on him against his views; * * * [t]hreatening to dismiss him from the program; * * * [a]ttempting to require him to lobby the General Assembly in support of political positions he opposed;” and “[n]ot permitting him to complete his degree requirements.”', 'To establish a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must prove that (1) he “engaged in constitutionally protected conduct” and (2) “this conduct was a substantial or motivating factor for the adverse” action taken against him. McCue v. Bradstreet, 807 F.3d 334, 338 (1st Cir. 2015) (quoting Padilla-García v. Rodríguez, 212 F.3d 69, 74 (1st Cir. 2000)).', 'We begin by examining one of the alleged acts of retaliation. Felkner alleges that defendants impermissibly retaliated against him for exercising his constitutional right to record his classes and discussions with faculty. According to Felkner, he began recording conversations with faculty because “he believed that Ryczek had lied to the ASC about their conversations.” Felkner also tape-recorded his classes. He would then post a rough transcript of some of these conversations on his personal website. Felkner further asserts that Professor Pearlmutter led a fifty-minute in-class discussion assailing his conservative views and the postings on his website. According to Felkner, Professor Ryzcek also allowed other students to criticize Felkner’s views without allowing him to respond. In addition, Professor Pearlmutter filed a complaint with the ASC claiming that Felkner’s recordings violated the NASW Code of Ethics. Felkner argues that these actions by defendants were in retaliation against him because he had exercised his constitutional right to free speech.', 'It is well settled that citizens may record government officials in the exercise of their official duties. Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78, 82 (1st Cir. 2011). “The act of making an audio or audiovisual recording is necessarily included within the First Amendment’s guarantee of speech and press rights as a corollary of the right to disseminate the resulting recording.” American Civil', '- 20 - Liberties Union of Illinois v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 595 (7th Cir. 2012). The right to make an audiovisual recording is not absolute, however; “[i]t may be subject to reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions.” Glik, 655 F.3d at 84. Thus, acknowledging that the right to record is an activity protected by the First Amendment, we proceed to examine the activity in the context of an educational institution.', 'In this regard, we find Tinker to be instructive. Tinker involved the right of high school students to wear black armbands in protest of the war in Vietnam. Tinker, 393 U.S. at 504. Recognizing the First Amendment rights of the students, the Supreme Court held that speech could be restricted in an educational setting under two circumstances: if the speech “might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption of or material interference with school activities,” or if the speech “colli[des] with the rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone.” Id. at 508, 514.', 'As the hearing justice noted in her decision in the present case, “several students expressed their discomfort with Felkner’s publication and editorializing of class discussions and activities, which they had previously believed were held in confidence.” Clearly, the privacy rights “of other students to be secure and to be let alone” were implicated by Felkner’s recordings. Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508. Felkner alleges that Professor Pearlmutter retaliated against his exercise of his First Amendment rights by filing a complaint against him with the ASC. The ASC found that Felkner had “failed to adhere to academic standards of the School when [he] deceptively audio-taped a conversation with Dr. Pearlmutter in violation of Section 4.04 of the NASW Code of Ethics.” The recommendation of the ASC was that the SSW department chair, Dr. Olsen, request Felkner “to declare immediately, in writing, that [he] will henceforth refrain', '- 21 - from any deceptive audio or video copying of conversations with social work colleagues and refrain from any audio or video copying without express permission from them.”', 'Under the Tinker standard, it is apparent that Felkner’s recordings “might reasonably have led school authorities to forecast substantial disruption” and “collid[e] with the rights of other students to be secure and to be let alone.” Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508, 514. Moreover, as the hearing justice noted, “Felkner was not disciplined for the actual act of recording; rather, he was prohibited from engaging in deceptive behavior by making surreptitious recordings of his colleagues.”', 'He was required to obtain permission before recording any conversations, a condition that is seemingly reasonable in the context of higher learning and academic freedom. We conclude, therefore, that Felkner has failed to provide evidence of a disputed issue of material fact demonstrating that any defendant interfered with or retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment rights with respect to his recording activities.', 'With respect to Felkner’s other claims of retaliatory conduct, as discussed above, genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether Felkner’s activities were protected by the First Amendment. If Felkner is able to clear that first hurdle, clearly factual issues abound with respect to whether his conduct was a “substantial or motivating factor for the adverse” actions allegedly taken against him by defendants. McCue, 807 F.3d at 338 (quoting Padilla-García, 212 F.3d at 74). He may rely on circumstantial evidence to prove this second prong of his retaliation claim. Lewis v. City of Boston, 321 F.3d 207, 219 (1st Cir. 2003) (stating that, in cases where parties’ motivations are at issue, the “so-called smoking gun[,]” or direct evidence, is not required). Examples of actions that can give rise to an inference of the required causal nexus include: temporal proximity between the speech and the adverse action; ongoing actions of antagonism; inconsistent justifications for an adverse action; and any evidence of conduct', '- 22 - between the time of the speech and the adverse action from which the totality of the circumstances can give rise to a reasonable inference that the adverse action was taken in response to the speech. Id.; Farrell v. Planters Lifesavers Company, 206 F.3d 271, 280-81 (3d Cir. 2000).', 'Accordingly, we affirm the judgment as to count two with respect to Felkner’s claim that defendants retaliated against him for exercising his First Amendment right to record classroom discussions and his conversations with faculty members. We also hold, however, that defendants are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Felkner’s remaining claims of retaliatory actions because there are genuine issues of material fact regarding whether defendants retaliated against Felkner for expressing his political beliefs.', '4', 'Compelled Speech', 'Felkner also alleges that defendants violated his right to freedom of speech and expression by “compell[ing] [him] to express ideas that are contrary to his political beliefs.” Before us, Felkner argues that he has made a prima facie claim for compelled speech in violation of his First Amendment rights, but he does not specify the speech he claims was compelled. The hearing justice focused on Felkner’s allegations that Professor Ryczek compelled him to espouse a political viewpoint contrary to his own when Felkner was not permitted to switch sides of a project topic.', 'We start off by noting that, on summary judgment, the issue is not whether a litigant has established a prima facie claim to his stated cause of action, but rather, whether he has demonstrated the presence of genuine issues of material fact to be resolved by a factfinder. We also note that, to the extent Felkner alleges that a requirement of the “Policy and Organizing”', '- 23 - course curriculum was to lobby the General Assembly, the issue is moot. There is no dispute that, although Professor Ryczek initially told Felkner he would be required to lobby from a perspective contrary to his own views, Felkner never was compelled to lobby or testify at a public hearing. The question, therefore, is more appropriately whether the “speech” required by his class assignments, integrative project, and other educational activities were reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns or, as Felkner contends, either an impermissible form of compelled speech or a “pre-text[] for political discrimination.” See Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 273. As we have previously indicated, based on our de novo review and in the context of this case, this inquiry is more amenable to resolution by a factfinder than to summary judgment. We therefore vacate the entry of summary judgment on count three of Felkner’s amended complaint.', '5', 'Unconstitutional Conditions', 'In count four, Felkner invokes the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, under which the government “may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests—especially, his interest in freedom of speech.” Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972).', 'Felkner argues that “[d]efendants’ actions placed unconstitutional conditions upon [him] and attempted to compel him to change his political beliefs as a condition of obtaining his master’s degree.”', '“The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions bars government from', 'arbitrarily conditioning the grant of a benefit on the surrender of a', 'constitutional right, regardless of the fact that the government', 'appropriately might have refused to grant the benefit at all. * * *', '“Not all conditions are prohibited, however; if a condition is', 'germane—that is, if the condition is sufficiently related to the', 'benefit—then it may validly be imposed. In the final analysis, the', 'legitimacy of a governmental proposal depends on the degree of', 'relatedness between the condition on a benefit and the reasons why', '- 24 -', 'government may withhold the benefit altogether.” National', 'Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 747 (1st Cir.', '1995) (internal citations omitted). For the reasons we have stated above, including a record rife with disputed, material facts, we conclude that count four is not amenable to summary disposition, and we therefore vacate the entry of summary judgment on Felkner’s unconstitutional conditions claim.', '6', 'Equal Protection', 'In count five, Felkner alleges that defendants “treated [him] differently than similarly situated graduate students[,]” discriminated against him, and violated his right to equal protection under the law by “denigrating [his] beliefs, penalizing his grades, trumping up ethics charges against him, delaying his graduation, and denying him the opportunity to work on welfare reform in the Governor’s Office[,]” actions that were allegedly taken in retaliation for exercising the right to express himself as he wished. The hearing justice focused her analysis on the grading process and result in the “Policy and Organizing I” course and concluded that Felkner, as a class of one, had not demonstrated he was treated differently from similarly-situated students because the undisputed facts showed Professor Ryczek had not previously disaggregated a group grade or needed to ask for another faculty member’s input during the grading process.', 'Before us, Felkner argues that the hearing justice ignored evidence that other students with conservative sociopolitical viewpoints similar to his were affected by defendants’ intolerance of conservative ideologies. Felkner points to emails with classmates demonstrating that they either did not speak up in class or did speak up about their personal views and ideologies but not with the same resulting poor grades and consequences as Felkner.', '- 25 -', '“The Equal Protection Clause requires states to treat alike all persons similarly situated.”15 Toledo v. Sánchez, 454 F.3d 24, 33 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982)). “Unless state action burdens a suspect class or impinges upon a fundamental right, we review equal protection claims for a rational relationship between the disparity of treatment and a legitimate government purpose.” Id. (citing Heller v. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319 (1993)). Because Felkner is not alleging discrimination based on his membership in a suspect class and because education is not a fundamental right under the United States Constitution, see San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 35 (1973), he must ultimately demonstrate that defendants’ conduct was “irrational and not motivated by any conceivable legitimate reason.” Toledo, 454 F.3d at 33. In our opinion, Felkner has failed to demonstrate any disputed fact regarding whether defendants’ actions toward him were “irrational and not motivated by any conceivable legitimate reason.” Id.', 'The hearing justice considered Felkner as a “class of one.” The United States Supreme Court has recognized that a plaintiff can prevail on a claim that he “has been irrationally singled out as a so-called ‘class of one’” rather than as a member of a larger “identifiable group” because the Equal Protection Clause is fundamentally concerned about arbitrary government classification. Engquist v. Oregon Department of Agriculture, 553 U.S. 591, 601, 602 (2008). In Engquist, the Supreme Court discussed the case of Village of Willowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562 (2000) (per curiam), in which a property owner had been properly considered a class of one when she pursued a claim for an equal protection violation after her municipality conditioned approval for a connection to reach a municipal water supply on the grant of a larger easement 15', 'The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that: “No State shall * * * deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”', '- 26 - than that required for other similarly situated property owners. Id. at 601-02; see Olech, 528 U.S. at 563.', 'The Supreme Court cautioned in Engquist, however, against undermining the discretionary decisionmaking inherent in some contexts by mistaking an exercise of discretion for an act of discrimination simply because one person has been treated differently from others who are similarly situated. Id. at 603. Indeed, the Supreme Court held in that case that the class- of-one theory was not cognizable in the public employment context, id. at 605, and the First Circuit Court of Appeals has extended that reasoning limiting the application of the class-of-one theory to other arenas. See, e.g., Caesars Massachusetts Management Company, LLC v. Crosby, 778 F.3d 327, 336 (1st Cir. 2015) (recognizing Engquist and declining to apply the class-of-one theory to the context of licensure for operating a casino).', 'Similar to the context of employment, the educational realm is replete with discretionary decisions. Individual professors have the necessary authority to evaluate their students’ work and to assign a grade for their students’ performances on the assignments required for successful course and degree program completion. Administrators have the authority to set the academic requirements for completing specific degree programs. In our opinion, the class-of-one theory is not applicable to Felkner’s equal protection claim arising out of his educational experience for the same reasons discussed by the Supreme Court when it declared that the theory was not applicable to an equal protection claim arising out of an employment experience. See Engquist, 553 U.S. at 605 (“To treat employees differently is not to classify them in a way that raises equal protection concerns. Rather, it is simply to exercise the broad discretion that typically characterizes the employer-employee relationship.”). Moreover, Felkner himself has neither relied on the class-of-one theory nor suggested that we consider his equal protection claim pursuant to this framework.', '- 27 -', 'Notably, the First Circuit’s jurisprudence on equal protection claims in the context of postsecondary education clearly focuses on whether a defendant’s actions have been different toward plaintiffs compared to other students and whether the disparate treatment has been rationally related to a legitimate purpose. For example, a student teacher’s equal protection claim against his university and the city in which he had been engaged in a student-teaching practicum was summarily dismissed because the plaintiff had “failed to show that others, similarly situated, were treated differently.” Hennessy v. City of Melrose, 194 F.3d 237, 244 (1st Cir. 1999). In Toledo, the First Circuit also affirmed the dismissal of an equal protection claim because a university student who had claimed a disability by virtue of a mental illness had failed to allege that the university’s refusal to acquiesce to his demands for class scheduling and course assignment changes to accommodate his disability was a result of irrational prejudice, and the university’s decisions were obviously rationally related to its academic mission and budgetary constraints. Toledo, 454 F.3d at 29, 33-34.', 'Felkner asserts that some of his peers who held similar sociopolitical ideologies also did not speak up in class to share these views. The email exchanges with these students that Felkner provided as support for his argument do not show that defendants treated students with conservative ideologies differently than they treated students with liberal ideologies; instead, the emails simply provide evidence to support Felkner’s claim that some other students felt that their sociological and political opinions should not be shared with the other students and faculty in the MSW program. This assertion is clearly more relevant to Felkner’s claims based on freedom of expression than to claims based on equal protection violations.', 'Felkner also relies on a mosaic of allegations about the various professors and administrators whose actions against him—he claims—tend to show a pattern of disparate', '- 28 - treatment due to his political affiliation. As litigants are apt to do, Felkner cherry-picks from the myriad written communications between him and fellow students, as well as between him and RIC professors and administrators, in his attempt to demonstrate that defendants’ actions were motivated by their disagreement with his political ideology. Our review of the record of this case, however, shows that the academic actions taken with respect to Felkner were, ultimately, to enforce the required components of the MSW degree at RIC. Felkner focuses on Professor Ryczek disaggregating his grade and giving him a failing grade when he refused to complete an assignment as instructed, various professors and administrators enforcing the requirement that Felkner complete both a field placement and an integrative project as a prerequisite to obtaining the MSW degree, and administrators denying Felkner a further extension of time in which to complete the integrative project after he failed to respond to the SSW’s offer for completing the project long after the previous deadlines set for him. In our view, these are actions that involve “discretionary decisionmaking” that do not implicate equal protection concerns. Engquist, 553 U.S. at 603.', 'Accordingly, we affirm summary judgment with respect to count five.', '7', 'Procedural Due Process', 'In count six, Felkner alleges that defendants violated his procedural due process rights in several different ways related to the ASC hearings. The hearing justice concluded that Felkner had been provided with sufficient opportunity to challenge the complaints against him as well as to address his own complaints before the ASC, and that the ASC carefully decided the outcome of each complaint filed with it related to Felkner. On appeal, Felkner argues that he was not provided with sufficient process. The defendants, for their part, argue that Felkner received the', '- 29 - notice and opportunity to which he was entitled and that the ASC process was not deficient in any way.', 'The United States Supreme Court has recognized a “legitimate entitlement to a public education as a property interest * * * protected by the Due Process Clause[,] which may not be taken away for misconduct without adherence to the minimum procedures required by that Clause,” Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 574 (1975), namely, “notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case,” id. at 579 (quoting Mullane v. Central Hanover Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 313 (1950)).', '“The authority possessed by the State to prescribe and enforce', 'standards of conduct in its schools, although concededly very', 'broad, must be exercised consistently with constitutional', 'safeguards. * * *', '“The Due Process Clause also forbids arbitrary deprivations of', 'liberty. ‘Where a person’s good name, reputation, honor, or', 'integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to', 'him,’ the minimal requirements of the Clause must be satisfied.”', 'Id. at 574 (quoting Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 437', '(1971)). “Due process, which may be said to mean fair procedure, is not a fixed or rigid concept, but, rather, is a flexible standard which varies depending upon the nature of the interest affected, and the circumstances of the deprivation.” Gorman v. University of Rhode Island, 837 F.2d 7, 12 (1st Cir. 1988) (citing Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334 (1976); Morrisey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481 (1972)). The span of procedural protections required to ensure fairness to students, aside from the right to notice and hearing, is uncertain, and must be determined on a case-by- case basis by balancing the competing interests in each case. Id. at 13. The First Circuit in Gorman explained that we must balance the “paramount” interest students hold “in completing their education, as well as avoiding unfair or mistaken exclusion from the educational', '- 30 - environment, and the accompanying stigma” against the promotion and protection of educational institutions. Id. at 14.', 'At a minimum, a student is entitled to know “what he is accused of doing and what the basis of the accusation is.” Goss, 419 U.S. at 582. In the context of a student disciplinary action, the Supreme Court has specifically “stop[ped] short of construing the Due Process Clause to require * * * that hearings in connection with short suspensions must afford the student the opportunity to secure counsel, to confront and cross-examine witnesses supporting the charge, or to call his own witnesses to verify his version of the incident.” Id. at 583; see also Gorman, 837 F.2d at 12 (concluding that disciplinary actions taken against students implicate students’ liberty and property interest in education and, therefore, require due process).', 'Although it is not entirely clear to us that Felkner’s hearing before the ASC was disciplinary in nature, we shall assume that it was, thereby implicating his liberty and property interests. Before us, Felkner alleges six specific violations of his procedural due process rights:', '“(1) to adequate notice of Pearlmutter’s complaint by not', 'informing him of the critical ‘assumption’ upon which the ASC', 'would base its decision, i.e., that he had been told that tape-', 'recording faculty and students was ‘unethical’; (2) to counsel for', 'the hearings; (3) by engaging in ex parte communications; (4) by', 'denying him the right to question his accusers at all the hearings;', '(5) by depriving him of a record for a meaningful appeal[;] and (6)', 'by providing him with meaningless appeals that consisted only of', '‘rubber-stamping’ the ASC’s decision.” We discuss Felkner’s contentions seriatim.', 'We start with the adequacy of Felkner’s notice of Professor Pearlmutter’s complaint to the ASC. Felkner received a letter advising him of Professor Pearlmutter’s complaint and the date of the hearing. Professor Pearlmutter’s complaint and other materials were enclosed with this notice. A review of these materials shows that Felkner was undisputably told the basis for', '- 31 - the complaint against him, see Goss, 419 U.S. at 582, and Felkner has not provided any material to the contrary. The fact that the notice did not include an express statement of permitted and unpermitted behavior by SSW students does not lead to a violation of Felkner’s due process rights regarding his entitlement to notice prior to the ASC hearing.', 'Second, Felkner claims he was deprived of his right to have counsel at the ASC hearing. He does not direct us, however, to any authority establishing a right to counsel in similar academic circumstances. Indeed, “the weight of authority is against representation by counsel at disciplinary hearings, unless the student is also facing criminal charges stemming from the incident in question.” Gorman, 837 F.2d at 16.', 'Third, Felkner’s challenge regarding “ex parte communications”—referring to the deposition of Diane Martell, Ph.D., chair of the ASC, in which she testified that Dean Bennett- Speight asked Dr. Martell to assure her that Felkner would be treated fairly and that all the policies and practices would be followed—fares no better.', 'It is difficult to see how this particular communication might compromise Dr. Martell’s impartiality, and Felkner has not demonstrated a factual issue to be resolved by a jury.', 'Fourth, we address Felkner’s claim that he was denied the opportunity to question his “accusers” at the ASC hearing. Although the MSW Academic and Field Manual expressly provides a student at an ASC hearing with “the right to question all participants on pertinent matters[,]” the failure to adhere to that policy is not necessarily of constitutional magnitude because Felkner did not have a constitutional right to confront and cross-examine Professor Ryczek as his accuser. See Goss, 419 U.S. at 583. Moreover, Felkner has not shown any material, disputed facts for a factfinder to resolve on this point.', '- 32 -', 'Lastly, as to Felkner’s assertion about a “meaningless appeal” resulting from the absence of a formal record of the ASC hearings and alleged “rubberstamp” of the ASC’s decisions, we note that courts have held that due process does not mandate that a student be afforded an opportunity to appeal from an adverse decision at a disciplinary proceeding. See Flaim v. Medical College of Ohio, 418 F.3d 629, 642 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Smith on Behalf of Smith v. Severn, 129 F.3d 419, 428-29 (7th Cir. 1996); Winnick v. Manning, 460 F.2d 545, 549 n.5 (2d Cir. 1972)). While a record of an academic disciplinary proceeding is desirable and may be required by individual educational institutions as part of the process provided, see Gorman, 837 F.2d at 15, 16, Felkner has not demonstrated any disputed, material facts to resolve regarding whether the process here was constitutionally insufficient.', 'In summary, Felkner has failed to establish any factual disputes with respect to his procedural due process claims and has also failed to establish that defendants are not entitled to judgment as a matter of law on these claims. The undisputed facts and persuasive federal law lead us to hold that Felkner received adequate notice and opportunity to be heard before the ASC. We therefore affirm the judgment with respect to count six.', '8', 'Conspiracy', 'Felkner alleges that defendants conspired to deny him his constitutional rights to freedom of speech and due process “on account of his political beliefs” in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3). The hearing justice concluded Felkner had not alleged “a racial or class-based animus as motivation for the alleged conspiracy” as required by federal law and, as a result, defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Felkner’s conspiracy claim. On appeal, Felkner argues that a conspiracy to “deprive [him] of his constitutional rights and drive him out of the', '- 33 - MSW program” could reasonably be inferred by the evidence presented in Superior Court that: (1) members of the faculty discussed Felkner on several occasions16; (2) Professor Ryczek kept notes about Felkner and had other faculty members review a paper on which he was going to give Felkner a bad grade; and (3) Professor Mueller testified in his deposition that the ASC had not found that Felkner violated the NASW Code of Ethics but Dr. Martell stated that the ASC unanimously found Felkner had violated the code because the ASC tried to reach a consensus.', 'Felkner’s argument, however, misses the mark entirely.', 'To prove a claim under § 1985(3),17 a plaintiff must demonstrate:', '“(1) a conspiracy, (2) a conspiratorial purpose to deprive a person', 'or class of persons, directly or indirectly, of the equal protection of', 'the laws or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws, (3)', 'an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy, and (4) either (a) an', 'injury to person or property, or (b) a deprivation of a', 'constitutionally protected right or privilege.” Aulson v.

Breckenridge, 403', 'U.S. 88, 102 (1971)). We have previously acknowledged that a valid claim pursuant to § 1985(3) must include an allegation “that a conspiracy was not only established to deprive the claimant of the equal protection and privileges or immunities of the law but also was predicated upon a racial or suspect class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus.” Salisbury v. Stone, 518 A.2d 1355, 1361 (R.I. 1986) (citing United Brotherhood of Carpenters & Joiners of America v. Scott, 463 U.S. 825, 828-29 (1983)) (holding that the plaintiff failed to state a claim when he did not allege his dismissal from employment was “the act of a conspiracy motivated by racial or class-based animus”); see also Hennessy, 194 F.3d 237, 244 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that a student teacher’s conspiracy claim against his undergraduate school and field-placement teaching school “founder[ed]” because he had “made no showing that the defendants’ conduct originated in an invidiously discriminatory class-based animus”). The First Circuit is clear “that a class is cognizable for purposes of § 1985(3)’s class-based animus requirement only when it is comprised of a distinctive and identifiable group.” Aulson, 83 F.3d at 5. The First Circuit has declined an opportunity to extend the protection against conspiracy to classes based on political affiliation, holding “that § 1985(3) provides no remedy for animus on the basis of political beliefs.” Pérez-Sánchez v. Public Building Authority, 531 F.3d 104, 108, 109 (1st Cir. 2008) (acknowledging the Sixth Circuit’s opinion in Cameron v. Brock, 473 F.2d 608 (6th Cir. 1973), that supporters of a political candidate are a clearly defined class entitled to protection under § 1985(3) but also collecting other federal circuit court cases holding that political affiliation is not a class entitled to protection).', 'Felkner’s conspiracy claim is based entirely on the cause of action created by § 1985(3), yet he has not alleged that the deprivation of his constitutional rights stemmed from an', '- 35 - “invidiously discriminatory animus” directed at a class entitled to protection under this statute. See Aulson, 83 F.3d at 3; Salisbury, 518 A.2d at 1361; see also Diva’s Inc. v. City of Bangor, 411 F.3d 30, 39 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding appellants failed to state a claim for conspiracy pursuant to § 1985(3) and any presumed class inferred from the facts would be “at best, a vague and amorphous grouping of individuals” and therefore insufficient for stating class-based animus) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law on Felkner’s conspiracy claim and we therefore affirm the judgment as to count seven.', 'C', 'Qualified Immunity', 'In defendants’ renewed motion for summary judgment, they argued that the doctrine of qualified immunity barred Felkner’s claims against them. After the hearing justice determined that defendants were entitled to summary judgment on all of Felkner’s claims, she declined to consider defendants’ argument that they were qualifiedly immune from the claims. Instead, she found this issue to be moot. In a cursory manner before us, Felkner asserts that two of the individually named defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity.', 'Felkner also acknowledges that the hearing justice did not address this issue. The defendants, for their part, have asked us—if we vacate the judgment the hearing justice entered in their favor—to conclude that qualified immunity bars Felkner’s claims against them. The defendants argue that, even if their actions are deemed to have violated any of Felkner’s constitutional rights, none of the violations were against clearly established constitutional rights, thereby entitling the individual defendants to qualified immunity.', 'While defendants have presented their qualified immunity arguments to the trial court on three separate occasions, there is no dispute that a hearing justice has yet to substantively', '- 36 - consider these arguments. We have held that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment in defendants’ favor on several of Felkner’s claims, but we decline defendants’ invitation to consider or decide whether the potential violations of Felkner’s constitutional rights were violations of clearly established rights because we generally do not opine on legal issues that have not been explored and analyzed in the first instance by the trial court. See Pontarelli v. Rhode Island Board Council on Elementary and Secondary Education, 151 A.3d 301, 307 n.5 (R.I. 2016); State v. Gaylor, 971 A.2d 611, 614-15 (R.I. 2009). Part of the Superior Court’s task on remand will be, therefore, to consider whether any of the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity, should defendants continue to press this argument.', 'D', 'Punitive Damages', 'Felkner also asserts that the hearing justice erred when she granted defendants’ motion to strike his demand for punitive damages. As previously recounted, Felkner sought punitive damages for defendants’ alleged infringement of his right to exercise freedom of speech and for delaying his completion of the MSW degree program.', 'In response to a request for interrogatories seeking the individual defendants’ personal financial details, defendants moved to strike Felkner’s claim for punitive damages. After conducting a Palmisano hearing, the hearing justice found that defendants’ conduct toward Felkner had not “rise[n] to the level of recklessness or callous indifference” to his constitutional rights and therefore concluded that he had not established the required prima facie case for punitive damages. Felkner argues that he did establish a prima facie case for punitive damages because the record demonstrates that defendants, by their actions, were either recklessly or callously indifferent to his constitutional', '- 37 - rights. The defendants, not surprisingly, argue that the hearing justice did not err in her decision to grant their motion to strike Felkner’s punitive damages claim.', 'We must first determine what standard applies to our review of this issue. Felkner seems to suggest we should review this issue de novo, applying the summary judgment framework in which we view the undisputed facts in the light most favorable to him. The defendants suggest we reverse the hearing justice’s ruling only if we hold that her findings of fact and ultimate decision to strike the punitive damages claim were clearly erroneous. “Palmisano established a procedure whereby a plaintiff must make a prima facie showing at an evidentiary hearing that a viable claim exists for an award of punitive damages before discovery of defendant’s financial worth may be undertaken.” Castellucci v. Battista, 847 A.2d 243, 247 (R.I. 2004) (footnote omitted). Our caselaw is clear that the trial justice determines, as a matter of law, “[w]hether a party seeking punitive damages has met the high standard imposed on such an award[.]” Palmisano, 624 A.2d at 318; see also Castellucci, 847 A.2d at 248; Simeone v. Charron, 762 A.2d 442, 444 (R.I. 2000). “Such findings on questions of law are reviewed de novo by this Court.” Simeone, 762 A.2d at 444. Accordingly, we proceed with a de novo review of this issue.', 'Punitive damages are available in an action brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 “when the defendant’s conduct is shown to be motivated by evil motive or intent, or when it involves reckless or callous indifference to the federally protected rights of others.” Kolstad v. American Dental Association, 527 U.S. 526, 536 (1999) (quoting Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 56 (1983)). In order to recover punitive damages under Rhode Island law, a plaintiff must present “evidence of such willfulness, recklessness or wickedness, on the part of the party at fault, as amounts to criminality, which for the good of society and warning to the individual, ought to be punished.” Palmisano, 624 A.2d at 318 (alteration omitted) (quoting Sherman v. McDermott, 114 R.I. 107,', '- 38 - 109, 329 A.2d 195, 196 (1974)). Also, “there must be a showing that the defendant acted with malice or in bad faith.” Id. This standard “is rigorous and will be satisfied only in instances wherein a defendant’s conduct requires deterrence and punishment over and above that provided in an award of compensatory damages.” Id. (citing Davet v. Maccarone, 973 F.2d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 1992)). We have previously commented that “[a]n award of punitive damages is considered an extraordinary sanction and is disfavored in the law, but it will be permitted if awarded with great caution and within narrow limits.” Id.', 'In Felkner’s objection to the defendants’ motion to strike his claim for punitive damages, he provided dozens of pages of allegations against both individually named defendants and unnamed individuals he alleges acted as coconspirators. After reviewing these allegations, the hearing justice’s decision on the motion, and Felkner’s arguments before this Court, it is evident that, despite the sheer volume of allegations, the substance of his claims against each individual does not reveal either “evil motive or intent” on their part or their “reckless or callous indifference” to his federal constitutional rights. Kolstad, 527 U.S. at 536 (quoting Smith, 461 U.S. at 56). The hearing justice made an exhaustive and meticulous review of the abundant exhibits before she concluded that Felkner had not met his burden to demonstrate a prima facie case for punitive damages. Based upon our de novo review of the record, we agree with the hearing justice. Accordingly, we affirm the order granting the defendants’ motion to strike Felkner’s claim for punitive damages.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court with respect to counts one, three, and four. We affirm the judgment with respect to counts five, six, and', '- 39 - seven. As to count two, we affirm the judgment as it relates to Felkner’s claim that the defendants retaliated against him for his audio recordings, and we vacate the judgment in all other respects. We also affirm the order striking Felkner’s claim for punitive damages. We remand this case to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.', 'Justice Robinson, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

Rev. 537 (1947).', '- 41 - reasoning by the hearing justice in her meticulous and point-by-point rejection of Mr. Felkner’s objection to defendants’ so well-crafted and convincing motion for summary judgment. At the end of the day, it is my unwavering conclusion that no aspect of this case needs to be remanded for a trial. In my judgment, the case was correctly disposed of at the nisi prius level pursuant to the established procedures and criteria under Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'While it is true that students and teachers do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,” Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 393 U.S. 503, 506 (1969), it is equally true that “constitutional rights of students in public school are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.” Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 682 (1986). Indeed, the Supreme Court has stated that, “[w]hen judges are asked to review the substance of a genuinely academic decision, * * * they should show great respect for the faculty’s professional judgment” and “may not override it unless it is such a substantial departure from accepted academic norms as to demonstrate that the person or committee responsible did not actually exercise professional judgment.” Regents of University of Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 225 (1985). It is my considered and precedent-supported belief that, except in perhaps the most truly exceptional circumstances (which do not even remotely exist in the instant case), a court is not “suited to evaluate the substance of the multitude of academic decisions * * *—decisions that require an expert evaluation of cumulative information and [are] not readily adapted to the procedural tools of judicial or administrative decisionmaking.” Id. at 226 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'As such, I must express my fervent dissent from those portions of the majority opinion which reverse the hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment in this case—i.e., those portions', '- 42 - which take issue with the hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment as to Counts One through Four of Mr. Felkner’s first amended complaint.3 I now proceed to address the reasons for my disagreement with the majority concerning these four counts.', 'Count One of Mr. Felkner’s first amended complaint alleged that he was deprived of his right to freedom of expression4 “on issues of political concern.” Count Two contended that he was retaliated against for his public criticism of Rhode Island College (RIC). Count Three averred that Mr. Felkner was unconstitutionally compelled “to express ideas that are contrary to his political beliefs.” Lastly, Count Four posited that defendants’ actions placed unconstitutional conditions on Mr. Felkner with respect to his obtaining the master’s degree. In addressing these four counts, I deem it more expedient to proceed, as the hearing justice did in this case, by looking at each act which Mr. Felkner contends was a violation of his constitutional rights as set forth in the first four counts in the first amended complaint.', 'I begin by noting that I am in agreement with the majority with respect to identifying the principles of law that are pertinent to this case. It is certainly the case, as the majority states, that the First Amendment protects an individual “who chooses to speak” as well as the right of an individual to decide what not to say, Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc., 515 U.S. 557, 573 (1995); and it is also true that “constitutional freedom is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.” Tinker, 393 U.S. at 512 (internal quotation marks omitted). What is more, I also find applicable the decision of the United States Supreme Court in Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260 (1988), 3', 'I note that the majority does uphold summary judgment on Count Two, but it does so only with respect to Mr. Felkner’s alleged right to record his classes and his discussions with members of the faculty. 4', 'For the purposes of this dissenting opinion, I do not suggest that there is any material difference between the term “freedom of expression” and the term “freedom of speech.”', '- 43 - to the effect that “educators do not offend the First Amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.” Hazelwood School District, 484 U.S. at 273; see also Brown v. Li, 308 F.3d 939, 951-52 (9th Cir. 2002) (addressing the Hazelwood School District standard and stating that it “balances a university’s interest in academic freedom and a student’s First Amendment rights [since] [i]t does not immunize the university altogether from First Amendment challenges but, at the same time, appropriately defers to the university’s expertise in defining academic standards and teaching students to meet them”).', 'With respect to Count Two, I also do not take issue with the majority that, to prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim, Mr. Felkner must show that he “engaged in constitutionally protected conduct” and that such “conduct was a substantial or motivating factor” for any adverse action which was taken against him. McCue v. Bradstreet, 807 F.3d 334, 338 (1st Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). And I am in agreement that he was free to rely on circumstantial evidence in an attempt to prove his retaliation claim. Lewis v. City of Boston, 321 F.3d 207, 219 (1st Cir. 2003). Lastly, with respect to Count Four, I am in agreement that “[t]he doctrine of unconstitutional conditions bars government from arbitrarily conditioning the grant of a benefit on the surrender of a constitutional right, regardless of the fact that the government appropriately might have refused to grant the benefit at all.” National Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 747 (1st Cir. 1995). Nonetheless, a condition that is “sufficiently related to the benefit” may “validly be imposed.” Id.', 'Where I part company with the majority is in its determination that genuine issues of material fact remain with respect to the alleged deprivation of Mr. Felkner’s First Amendment', '- 44 - rights.', 'I endorse wholeheartedly the hearing justice’s decision to the contrary. I find her discussion of Mr. Felkner’s free speech claims to be an exemplary piece of legal scholarship and absolutely correct. As such, I will not restate that analysis but rather briefly address why I arrive at the same conclusions as the hearing justice.', 'Initially, I note that I am in agreement with the hearing justice that, “[w]ith respect to the alleged violations of free speech, the Court first must determine whether the speech in question was protected under the First Amendment as a matter of law.” In Adler v. Lincoln Housing Authority, 544 A.2d 576 (R.I. 1988), this Court opined that “[t]he inquiry into the protected status of speech is one of law, not fact.” Adler, 544 A.2d at 581 (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has expressly stated that “[t]he only real question, under Hazelwood,” as to “whether the actions of the school officials were reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns * * * is a question of law.” Poling v. Murphy, 872 F.2d 757, 762 (6th Cir. 1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, in my considered opinion, the question of whether or not Mr. Felkner’s speech was protected under the First Amendment is a question of law.', 'Mr. Felkner first alleges that Professor James Ryczek, in part one of the “Policy and Organizing” class, violated his free speech rights when he provided an approved list of topics concerning which students were to lobby, which topics Mr. Felkner alleges represented a “leftist position.” Mr. Felkner further complains that he was not permitted to switch topics and that he was given a failing grade when he wrote his paper from an opposite perspective. In my view, the hearing justice did not err in concluding that the record reflected the fact that Mr. Felkner chose a topic for a paper and debate, wanted to switch sides late in the course—and then, ignoring the professor’s pedagogically appropriate refusal to let him do so, wrote the paper and participated in', '- 45 - the group debate from a perspective opposite to that assigned. It is certainly a legitimate pedagogical purpose for a professor to require a student to write a paper or participate in a debate from a viewpoint that may conflict with that student’s personal views; learning to understand and cogently articulate a viewpoint that is not one’s own is without question a legitimate pedagogical purpose.', 'See Hazelwood School District, 484 U.S. at 273; C.N. v. Ridgewood Board of Education, 430 F.3d 159, 187 (3d Cir. 2005) (“First Amendment jurisprudence recognizes that the educational process itself may sometimes require a state actor to force a student to speak when the student would rather refrain. A student may also be forced to speak or write on a particular topic even though the student might prefer a different topic.”); Brown, 308 F.3d at 953 (“[A] teacher may require a student to write a paper from a particular viewpoint, even if it is a view-point [sic] with which the student disagrees, so long as the requirement serves a legitimate pedagogical purpose.”); see also Board of Regents of University of Wisconsin System v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217, 242-43 (2000) (Souter, J., concurring) (stating that, in a university setting, “students are inevitably required to support the expression of personally offensive viewpoints in ways that cannot be thought constitutionally objectionable unless one is prepared to deny the University its choice over what to teach”); 2 Rodney A. Smolla, Smolla and Nimmer on Freedom of Speech § 17:1.50 at 17-8 to 17-10 (2018) (“Schools routinely require students to express a viewpoint that is not their own in order to teach the students to think critically.”).', 'Taking into account the just-cited legal authorities, Mr. Felkner was justifiably given a failing grade.', 'See Brown, 308 F.3d at 949 (“[T]he First Amendment does not require an educator to change the assignment to suit the student’s opinion or to approve the work of a student that, in his or her judgment, fails to meet a legitimate academic standard.”). What is more, the hearing justice pointed out that Professor Ryczek, quite generously, even gave Mr.', '- 46 - Felkner the opportunity to resubmit the assignment, but Mr. Felkner opted not to do so. Thus, in my judgment, the hearing justice certainly did not err in concluding that Mr. Felkner’s free speech rights were not violated by the series of events that transpired in this case. Nor did she err in concluding that Mr. Felkner’s free speech rights were also not violated when his appeal of his failing grade was eventually denied. In the just-described context, Mr. Felkner was not engaging in protected speech. See Adler, 544 A.2d at 581.', 'Mr. Felkner also puts great weight on the fact that, in part two of his “Policy and Organizing” class, he was required to participate in a lobbying assignment concerning a topic with which he did not agree. As the majority notes, this issue is utterly moot given that Mr. Felkner was never required to actually lobby anyone with respect to a viewpoint that he did not share. This complaint on Mr. Felkner’s part is completely devoid of any merit. So too is his contention with respect to Professor Roberta Pearlmutter’s initial statement that she would reduce his grade on the lobbying assignment if he formed his own group with students who were not fellow students in the “Policy and Organizing” class. As the hearing justice noted, Mr. Felkner was in fact eventually allowed to form his own group. Therefore, I perceive no error in the hearing justice’s conclusion that Mr. Felkner’s free speech rights were not violated in this regard.', 'The same is likewise true of Mr. Felkner’s contention that he was not permitted to engage in the field placement that he chose or to work on the topic of welfare reform for his integrative project. Once again, I am in agreement with the hearing justice that it is clear from the record that Mr. Felkner was ultimately permitted to do the field placement he chose and to work on welfare reform for his integrative project. Therefore, these claims also have no merit. See, e.g., Beauregard v. Gouin, 66 A.3d 489, 494 (R.I. 2013) (stating that a “[c]omplete failure of proof', '- 47 - concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party’s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial”).', 'Moreover, with respect to the delay resulting from Mr. Felkner’s seeking approval of the field placement and integrative project topic that he wanted, the hearing justice pointed out that he was given an extension of time within which to complete his integrative project. As the hearing justice noted, Dean Carol Bennett-Speight granted Mr. Felkner an extension to complete his degree requirements on the condition that he submit his problem statement and methodology to his advisor by a certain date and submit a plan outlining how he would finish the project by a certain date.', 'Dean Bennett-Speight expressly required Mr. Felkner to acknowledge his understanding and acceptance of these conditions. The hearing justice is correct that the record reflects that Mr. Felkner inexplicably failed to do so. After he had been given ample time to comply with the just-referenced condition precedent, Professor Pearlmutter informed him that he was no longer considered to be a student in the social work program at RIC. In my opinion, it could be convincingly contended that Mr. Felkner’s complete and bewildering failure to take advantage of the proffered extension is nearly determinative of this entire case. Mr. Felkner was given the opportunity to finish his integrative project as a stepping stone towards being granted a master’s degree, and he did not make even the minimal effort of informing RIC as to whether or not he was accepting the extension and its conditions. Therefore, in my opinion, it was through the fault of no one but himself that Mr. Felkner did not ultimately obtain a master’s degree.', 'With respect particularly to Mr. Felkner’s retaliation claim, the hearing justice did not err in concluding that, as to the just-discussed occurrences, Mr. Felkner was unable to show that he was engaged in constitutionally protected speech; that being the case, any retaliation claim must fail. See McCue, 807 F.3d at 338. Mr. Felkner further alleges, in regard to his retaliation claim,', '- 48 - that Professor Pearlmutter penalized him with respect to his grade in her class due to the fact that he worked with students who were not fellow students in his class. However, grading is a function of the often somewhat subjective assessment criteria of a particular professor, and this Court is not in a position to second-guess such a decision. See Board of Curators of University of Missouri v. Horowitz, 435 U.S. 78, 90 (1978) (stating that “the decision of an individual professor as to the proper grade for a student in his [or her] course * * * requires an expert evaluation of cumulative information and is not readily adapted to the procedural tools of judicial * * * decisionmaking”); see also Settle v. Dickson County School Board, 53 F.3d 152, 156 (6th Cir. 1995) (“Teachers * * * must be given broad discretion to give grades and conduct class discussion based on the content of speech.”).', 'Mr. Felkner next posited in his first amended complaint that he was retaliated against for his conservative views when Professor Pearlmutter “led a fifty-minute in-class discussion assailing Mr. Felkner’s conservative views” and “allowed other students to assault Mr. Felkner’s views without allowing him to respond.” In my judgment, the hearing justice was absolutely correct when she held that this simply is not an adverse action. See McCue, 807 F.3d at 338-39. As such, Mr. Felkner’s retaliation claim in this regard also must fail. I would echo the hearing justice’s perceptive statement that Mr. Felkner “seems to consider free speech a one-way street.” I believe that that assessment is also applicable to Mr. Felkner’s complaint about various e-mail communications he had with RIC professors wherein they stressed the progressive nature of the School of Social Work. Mr. Felkner’s free speech rights were not violated simply because professors at RIC disagreed with him politically and were vocal about their own views.', 'I also note that, even accepting as true the contents of the affidavit of Dr. Richard Gelles, on which the majority so heavily relies, I can perceive nothing in this case on which to base a', '- 49 - legal conclusion that defendants’ actions were not reasonably related to any legitimate pedagogical purpose but rather were pretextual. See Hazelwood School District, 484 U.S. at 273; Axson-Flynn v. Johnson, 356 F.3d 1277, 1292-93 (10th Cir. 2004). Even if the master’s in social work program did have, as the majority puts it, a “strong predisposition toward so-called ‘progressive’ social values,” expressing those values and allowing class discussion on those values rather than fostering a more conservative perspective certainly did not violate Mr. Felkner’s constitutional rights. See Brown, 308 F.3d at 951 (“[T]he curriculum of a public educational institution is one means by which the institution itself expresses its policy, a policy with which others do not have a constitutional right to interfere.”). While Mr. Felkner was required to argue against his personal viewpoint in class, it is important to remember that he was ultimately not required to lobby for any viewpoint with which he did not agree. Moreover, I consider it absolutely crucial to analyzing this case to remain mindful of the fact that Mr. Felkner was offered the opportunity to avail himself of an extension of the time within which he must have completed his degree requirements, but he opted not to comply with the quite minimal prerequisites that he had to meet before the extension would become operative.', 'Accordingly, it is abundantly clear to me that, as a matter of law, Mr. Felkner was not engaging in protected speech (Count One); did not suffer an adverse retaliation for said speech (Count Two); was not compelled to speak (Count Three); and did not have unconstitutional conditions imposed on him as a requirement for receiving his master’s degree (Count Four). Therefore, in my opinion, summary judgment in defendants’ favor was appropriate as to all of the first four counts.', '“[I]ndependence of thought and frankness of expression occupy a high place on our scale of values, or ought to, but so too do discipline, courtesy, and respect for authority. Judgments on', '- 50 - how best to balance such values may well vary from school to school.” Poling, 872 F.2d at 762. The courts have no place passing judgment on such academic decisions. It is my very definite view that plaintiff’s complaints about the slings and arrows that he purports to have encountered while pursuing a graduate degree at RIC have no place in our courts.', 'With sincere respect for the earnestly held and well-articulated views of the majority, I find it regrettable that this litigation will now continue in the trial court—albeit in a substantially reduced form. It seems to me that that trial will be what the Supreme Court of Iowa once metaphorically described as “a play which is not worth the candle.” Van Gorder v. Sherman, 46 N.W. 1087, 1088 (Iowa 1890). In my view, “[i]t is time for this litigation to end.” Arena v. City of Providence, 919 A.2d 379, 396 (R.I. 2007); see also Northern Trust Co. v. Zoning Board of Review of Westerly, 899 A.2d 517, 520 (R.I. 2006) (mem.); Gunn v. Union Railroad Co., 27 R.I. 320, 337, 62 A. 118, 125 (1905).', 'For the reasons set forth herein, I must record my respectful but especially vigorous dissent to the portions of the majority’s opinion which reverse the hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants.', 'Justice Indeglia, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I wholeheartedly concur with most of the majority’s well-written opinion, including most of its holding with respect to Felkner’s due process claims. However, I must respectfully dissent with regard to its due process analysis in two respects, which I believe may have affected Felkner’s right to a “meaningful appeal.”', '- 51 -', 'Due Process', 'In the college setting, the amount of process that is due to a student depends upon the circumstances surrounding the hearing. Hennessy v. City of Melrose, 194 F.3d 237, 250 (1st Cir. 1999). The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has stated that “[a] hearing—or the offer of one—usually is necessary when a school takes serious disciplinary action against a student. By contrast, academic sanctions customarily are left to academic channels and do not require a hearing as a matter of constitutional right.” Id. (emphasis in original) (citation omitted). Additionally, that court similarly stated, in an earlier case, that “the procedures due to a student include[] notice, an explanation of the case against the student, and ‘an opportunity to present his [or her] side of the story.’” Gorman v. University of Rhode Island, 837 F.2d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 581 (1975)). Here, the ASC’s hearing on plaintiff’s failing grade would clearly be considered academic because it concerned Felkner’s scholastic performance and, so, little process was constitutionally required in those proceedings. On the other hand, in the second hearing, because Felkner faced a possible expulsion from RIC’s MSW program for allegedly and deceptively recording his teachers and fellow pupils—a penalty born from an issue with his professional ethics—more process was required from the ASC in the disciplinary hearing, despite the ASC’s contention that this hearing was also academic.', 'However, no one has contended—and neither do I—that the ASC failed to give plaintiff a hearing in either case. Instead, I take issue with the alleged deprivation of certain procedures within those hearings. The United States Supreme Court, in Goss, noted that more substantial disciplinary proceedings that subject a student to greater sanctions than short suspensions may require more formal hearing procedures. See Goss, 419 U.S. at 584. The Goss Court noted that, in more serious cases, the school “may * * * summon the accuser, permit cross-examination, and', '- 52 - allow the student to present his own witnesses. In more difficult cases, [the disciplinarian] may permit counsel.” Id.', 'In Gorman, the First Circuit held that a student’s due process rights were not violated in disciplinary proceedings where the school did not permit him to have an attorney present, cross- examine witnesses, or record the hearings. Gorman, 837 F.2d at 15-16. Determining the specific procedures to which the student was entitled, the court balanced the student’s right to his or her education with the school’s needs to conserve limited resources in adjudicating such disciplinary matters. Id. at 14-15. The court found that the hearings were recorded through a written account by a university representative, which “clearly constituted a sufficient record of the proceedings.” Id. at 16. Furthermore, relying on caselaw from other circuits, the court held that counsel was not constitutionally required at disciplinary proceedings, so long as the student was not facing any criminal charges. Id. Additionally, the court acknowledged that a student has no right to cross-examination in school disciplinary proceedings. Id.', 'While Felkner faced potential dismissal for his alleged deceptive recording of classes, he did not face any criminal charges in conjunction with the matter. He received notice of the complaints against him and he was afforded hearings, followed by an appeal. At the hearing, Felkner was not permitted to use an attorney, nor was he allowed to cross-examine defendants. However, I agree with the majority that none of these deprivations indicate that his due process rights were violated. See Gorman, 837 F.2d at 16. Where I differ from the majority is that I believe Felkner has created a genuine issue of material fact in his due process claim with respect to an alleged lack of: (1) a record of the disciplinary proceedings; and (2) written findings of fact from the ASC.', '- 53 -', 'In her decision granting summary judgment in favor of defendants with respect to Felkner’s due process claim, the motion justice did not address the issue of whether the ASC should have created a record of the disciplinary hearing, nor did she address the adequacy of any written decision. Instead, the motion justice focused solely on the issue of Felkner’s inability to cross-examine the witnesses against him.', 'On Felkner’s right to effectuate a meaningful appeal, the majority states that, “[w]hile a record of an academic disciplinary proceeding is desirable and may be required by individual educational institutions as part of the process provided * * * Felkner has not demonstrated any disputed, material facts to resolve regarding whether the process here was constitutionally insufficient.” I respectfully disagree with this conclusion.', 'A', 'Record of the Proceedings', 'My first concern here is the fact that the ASC did not keep a record of the proceedings. Although due process does not require that a student be allowed to record a disciplinary hearing, the First Circuit has noted that “several courts have required some form of record.” Gorman, 837 F.2d at 15. Alternatively, the Sixth Circuit has stated that “[w]hile due process may not impose upon the university the requirement to produce a record in all cases, fundamental fairness counsels that if the university will not provide some sort of record, it ought to permit the accused to record the proceedings if desired.” Flaim v. Medical College of Ohio, 418 F.3d 629, 636 (6th Cir. 2005) (citing Gorman, 837 F.2d at 15-16). Ironically, the very basis for the disciplinary hearing, of which there is allegedly no record, was Felkner’s recording of his professors and fellow students.', '- 54 -', 'In Gorman, the First Circuit determined that due process did not require the school to allow the plaintiff to record the hearing because the school had internal policies for keeping records of disciplinary proceedings and did, in fact, keep a record of the plaintiff’s hearing in that case. Gorman, 837 F.2d at 15-16. Here, unlike the school in Gorman, Felkner alleges that the ASC did not provide any kind of record for the disciplinary proceedings. See id. As this Court has recognized, it is unlikely that there can be a meaningful review of, or appeals from, any determination by an administrative body without some form of record. Cf. Champlin’s Realty Associates v. Tikoian, 989 A.2d 427, 448 (R.I. 2010) (“If the record before the agency does not support the agency action, if the agency has not considered all relevant factors, or if the reviewing court simply cannot evaluate the challenged agency action on the basis of the record before it, the proper course, except in rare circumstances, is to remand to the agency for additional investigation or explanation.”) (quoting Florida Power & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985)). Therefore, without a record of the ASC hearing, I believe there exists a genuine issue of material fact, making summary judgment inappropriate.1', 'B', 'Written Findings', 'My second concern is that the ASC did not adequately describe the basis for its decision in the letter that it sent to Felkner.2 The Sixth Circuit has held that “[a]n accused individual is 1', 'Although Felkner later agreed that he would not tape any more conversations, this was only in response to the ultimatum set forth in the decision letter from the ASC. 2', 'The letter states, in pertinent part:', '“Pursuant to the academic policies of the School of Social Work,', 'the Academic Standing Committee conducted a hearing, April 27,', 'on the allegations of Dr. Pearlmutter that you failed to adhere to', 'the academic standards of the School by engaging in behavior that', '- 55 - generally not entitled to a statement of reasons for a decision against them, at least where the reasons for the decision are obvious.” Flaim, 418 F.3d at 636 (emphasis added). However, that court also stated that it “recognize[d] there may be some proceedings where written findings of fact would be required[,]” because the cost to a school to issue such findings is minimal. See id. at 642.', 'In Flaim, the court held that, under the circumstances presented in that case, due process did not require the disciplinary committee to issue written findings of fact in light of the fact that the board expelled the plaintiff for a felony drug conviction, an obvious violation of the school’s “zero-tolerance policy” regarding drugs. Flaim, 418 F.3d at 633, 642. Here, I believe that there is at least an issue of material fact as to whether the ASC’s written decision was adequate in light of the fact that one member of the committee doubted whether there was any ethical basis to', 'violated the National Association of Social Workers (NASW)', 'Code of Ethics.', '“After consideration of all of the evidence, including your', 'testimony, the Committee determined that you failed to adhere to', 'academic standards of the School when you deceptively audio-', 'taped a conversation with Dr. Pearlmutter in violation of Section', '4.04 of the NASW Code of Ethics.

Thus, there is some question as to whether the basis of the ASC’s decision was obvious. See id. at 636.', 'Furthermore, the lack of written findings may well have affected the meaningfulness of any appeal and, thus, Felkner’s due process rights, stymying him from presenting cogent reasons for appeal, because Felkner might not have been able to prepare a proper response; nor would those responsible for hearing such appeal be able to conduct a proper review of his case without such findings. In the administrative setting, this Court generally requires “an ample decisional demonstration of the grounds upon which an ultimate conclusion is predicated[,]” to “facilitat[e] judicial review, avoid[] judicial usurpation of administrative functions, assur[e] more careful administrative consideration, help[] parties plan their cases for rehearings and judicial review, and keep[] agencies within their jurisdiction.” Hooper v.

Although the defendants may still ultimately prevail on this issue, I believe that Felkner at least presented a genuine issue of material fact with regard to whether the ASC was required to create some form of record in the disciplinary proceedings. Additionally, I would hold that there was a material dispute as to the sufficiency of the written decision. The cost of both of these procedures was slight when compared to the danger of an erroneous deprivation of Felkner’s right to receive an education.

The plaintiff in this wrongful death action, Dawn M. Parrillo, Administratrix of the Estate of Daniel Santos (Parrillo or plaintiff), appeals from the entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Shea Gregg, M.D. A justice of the Superior Court dismissed the action against Dr. Gregg because the statutory period for filing a wrongful death action had expired. After thoroughly reviewing the record and after carefully considering the arguments of the parties, we affirm the entry of summary judgment.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In the early hours of Friday, February 17, 2012, Daniel Santos was returning home from an event celebrating his boss’s birthday when he lost control of his vehicle and collided with a utility pole. Mr. Santos was transported to Rhode Island Hospital, where he was admitted to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit with multiple injuries, including six fractured ribs and other injuries to his right knee and right foot. Over the next three days, Santos’s condition stabilized, and he even showed some signs of improvement. That improvement caused the medical staff to move', '-1- Mr. Santos to the medical floor for further monitoring and treatment. There, he expressed his eagerness to go home.', 'Optimism proved to be fleeting, however, and Mr. Santos’s condition soon took a drastic turn for the worse. On February 21, Mr. Santos developed chest pain, and x-rays revealed that excess fluid had accumulated around his left lung. Mr. Santos was quickly transferred back to the Trauma Intensive Care Unit, where a chest tube was inserted and antibiotics were administered. That evening Mr. Santos suffered two cardiac arrests, but he regained vital signs after two minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). He was then sedated in an effort to improve oxygenation and ventilation. Unfortunately, however, Mr. Santos’s condition continued to deteriorate.', 'On the morning of February 22, his family made the difficult decision to withdraw treatment. Mr. Santos was pronounced dead later that morning.', 'On May 17, 2012, Dawn Parrillo, Mr. Santos’s domestic partner and the administratrix of his estate, requested his medical records from Rhode Island Hospital because she believed that the records might reveal evidence of negligent treatment. 1 The hospital delivered those records three months later, on August 23, 2012.', 'On January 9, 2014, nearly two years after Mr. Santos died and nearly a year and a half after she received his medical records, Parrillo filed a complaint against the hospital, as well as Charles Adams, M.D. and Whitney Young, M.D., two physicians who had been involved in Mr. Santos’s care, alleging negligent treatment leading to the wrongful death of Mr. Santos. 2 Parrillo filed a first amended complaint on February 20, 2014, which was nearly identical to the original 1', 'Parrillo contends that she and Mr. Santos held themselves out as husband and wife, although they were never formally married. Because this action was brought in the name of Santos’s estate, and because Ms. Parrillo is the administratrix of the estate, her relationship with Mr. Santos is irrelevant to this appeal. 2', 'Although Parrillo’s original complaint is dated December 12, 2013, it was docketed on January 9, 2014.', '-2- complaint, except that it omitted the allegations against Dr. Young.', 'In February 2015, three years after Mr. Santos’s death, Parrillo first propounded requests for production of documents and interrogatories upon both Rhode Island Hospital and Dr. Adams. Relevant to this appeal, the interrogatories to Rhode Island Hospital requested that the hospital provide the name, address, and a description of “each and every person known to you to have treated the Plaintiff [sic] while inpatient at the Rhode Island Hospital from the time of his admission through to the time of his death on February 22, 2012.” The hospital responded with a boilerplate objection that the interrogatory sought privileged information and that it was “ambiguous, overly broad and unduly burdensome.” Nevertheless, the hospital stated further that “[w]ithout waiving this objection, Plaintiff is referred to the medical records[.]”', 'In November 2015, Parrillo propounded additional interrogatories upon Rhode Island Hospital, asking the hospital to “identify by name(s), address(es) and date(s) of care and treatment of all physicians, including the attending physicians responsible for the medical treatment and care rendered to Mr. Santos from the date of his admission to the Rhode Island Hospital on February 17, 2012, through February 22, 2012.” The hospital also objected to this interrogatory, again claiming that it was “overly broad, irrelevant and burdensome[,]” but again, without waiving that objection, referred Parrillo to Mr. Santos’s “Rhode Island Hospital chart.” Parrillo did not file a motion to compel more responsive answers.', 'Nevertheless, Rhode Island Hospital agreed to provide the names of the attending physicians during Mr. Santos’s hospital stay, and, on February 3, 2016, the hospital sent Parrillo’s attorney an email identifying, for the first time, Dr. Gregg as the attending physician in', '-3- the Trauma Intensive Care Unit on February 20, 2012. 3 Armed with this information, on April 1, 2016, Parrillo moved for leave to amend her complaint a second time. That motion was granted on May 9, 2016. The second amended complaint added several new defendants, including Dr. Gregg.', 'Dr. Gregg filed a motion for summary judgment on May 23, 2016, claiming that the statute of limitations for wrongful death had expired before he had been added as a defendant. The Superior Court agreed, the motion was granted, and judgment was entered soon thereafter in favor of Dr. Gregg. Parrillo timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews a decision granting summary judgment de novo. DeLong v. Rhode Island Sports Center, Inc., 182 A.3d 1129, 1134 (R.I. 2018).

We answer that it is not.', 'In Rhode Island, actions seeking recovery for a wrongful death must be commenced within three years of the date of death, except in situations where the wrongful death is alleged to have been “caused by any wrongful act, neglect or default which is not known at the time of death[.]” Section 10-7-2. In those circumstances, the statute of limitations may be tolled and the action may be considered timely if “commenced within three years of the discovery of the wrongful act, neglect or default or within three years of when, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the wrongful conduct should have been discovered.” Pari v. Corwin, 620 A.2d 86, 87 (R.I. 1993); see § 10-7-2. Significantly, “the Wrongful Death Act’s focus [is] on the act that caused the death rather than the actors[.]” O’Connell v. Walmsley, 156 A.3d 422, 428 (R.I. 2017) (emphases added) (internal parentheses omitted).', 'It is significant that Parrillo did not name Dr. Gregg as a defendant in this wrongful death action until she filed her second amended complaint in April 2016, more than four years after Mr. Santos’s death. 4 She argues, however, that the statute of limitations set forth in § 10-7-2 should be tolled because she could not, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have discovered the “wrongful act, neglect or default” of Dr. Gregg until February 2016, when he was finally 4', 'The hearing justice determined that Parrillo’s second amended complaint did not relate back to her original filing because there was no evidence that Dr. Gregg was aware that there was a possible claim against him or that he knew that, but for a mistake, he would have been named as a party to the suit. See Super. R. Civ. P. 15(c). Parrillo does not appeal this aspect of the hearing justice’s decision.', '-5- identified by counsel for Rhode Island Hospital as an attending physician during what is claimed to be a critical portion of Mr. Santos’s fateful stay at Rhode Island Hospital. We do not agree.', 'A', 'The Wrongful Act, Not the Wrongful Actor', 'Because it appears to us that Parrillo incorrectly interprets the arc of § 10-7-2, we begin our analysis with an examination of the text of the statute as well as our previous interpretations of it. As we have set forth supra, the fulcrum of the discovery rule in § 10-7-2 is “the act that caused the death rather than the actors[.]” O’Connell, 156 A.3d at 428 (emphases added) (internal parentheses omitted). We therefore have no hesitation in concluding that Parrillo’s focus on the identification of Dr. Gregg as a potential tortfeasor is misdirected. This is so because Parrillo’s knowledge of the wrongful conduct began the running of the statute of limitations, not her belief that Dr. Gregg may have been the actor responsible for that conduct.', 'Section 10-7-2 reads, in pertinent part:', '“Except as otherwise provided, every action brought pursuant to', 'this chapter shall be commenced within three (3) years after the', 'death of the person. With respect to any death caused by any', 'wrongful act, neglect or default which is not known at the time of', 'death, the action shall be commenced within three (3) years of the', 'time that the wrongful act, neglect or default is discovered or, in', 'the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have been discovered.” Importantly, it is clear from a reading of the text of the statute that it is a potential plaintiff’s knowledge of the “wrongful act, neglect or default” that triggers the statute of limitations. Notably absent from the text of the statute is any mention of a potential plaintiff’s knowledge of the identity of the alleged tortfeasor.', 'Moreover, the date the plaintiff discovered the allegedly wrongful conduct has always been our lodestar when determining whether or not the statutory period for filing a wrongful', '-6- death suit has expired. For example, in Ashey v. Kupchan, 618 A.2d 1268 (R.I. 1993), the plaintiffs argued that, although they suspected at the time of their son’s death that his demise had been caused by medical malpractice, it was not until they obtained an expert opinion on the matter, almost a year after the death, that their suspicions were confirmed. Ashey, 618 A.2d at 1269. The plaintiffs thus argued that § 10-7-2 should be tolled until the date the plaintiffs received that expert opinion. Id. We disagreed, reasoning that the operative date was not when the plaintiffs “tracked down an expert to confirm their suspicions[.]” Id. Instead, we held that “Section 10-7-2 states that the discovery date is the date that the plaintiffs knew or should have known of the ‘wrongful act’ that is the basis of their lawsuit.” Id. Because the plaintiffs were aware of the wrongful conduct shortly after their son’s death but waited more than three years to file suit, § 10-7-2 time barred their claim. Id. at 1270.', 'Similarly, in Pari, the plaintiffs were “almost immediately aware” that delays in referring their minor child to surgery had contributed to the child’s death, but they nevertheless waited more than four years to file a wrongful death claim. Pari, 620 A.2d at 86-87. We held that the tolling provision in § 10-7-2 was unavailable in these circumstances, and that the plaintiffs had “simply failed to file their wrongful-death action within the proper time.” Id. at 87.', 'In Benner v. J.H. Lynch & Sons, Inc., 641 A.2d 332 (R.I. 1994), the plaintiff’s husband was killed when his vehicle struck a guardrail and a parked truck near a highway construction site. Benner, 641 A.2d at 333. More than three years later, the plaintiff brought a wrongful death claim against the Rhode Island Department of Transportation and two private contractors that had been working on the construction site for negligently designing and maintaining the site’s safety features. Id. at 333-34. To determine whether the plaintiff’s claim was time barred by § 10-7-2, we were tasked with determining the date on which the plaintiff should have', '-7- discovered the wrongful conduct that caused her husband’s death—the date of her husband’s accident or the date an expert opined on the sufficiency of the highway safety features. Id. at 334. We held that, with respect to automobile accidents, the cause of action accrues at the time of the accident because that is the date upon which a plaintiff is put on notice that the decedent’s injuries could have been caused by tortious conduct. Id. at 336. We explained that:', '“This doctrine is based upon the fact that the traumatic event is', 'immediately apparent to the participants or their legal', 'representatives. * * * Without question, [a potential plaintiff] must', 'carry out both factual and legal investigations of varying durations.', '* * * This does not mean that the statute of limitations will be', 'tolled until the investigation is complete. Such a doctrine would', 'render the statute of limitations meaningless and ineffective.” Id.', 'In all these cases, the critical factor in our analysis has been the date when the plaintiff became aware that the decedent’s death could have been caused by wrongful conduct, and thus when “the wrongful act, neglect or default [was] discovered or, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, should have been discovered.” 5 Section 10-7-2.', 'Parrillo argues that our decision in O’Sullivan v. Rhode Island Hospital, 874 A.2d 179 5', 'We have also adhered to this principle when considering the discovery rule in other contexts. For example, in product liability suits, we have held that “the discovery rule concerns the discovery that one has suffered an injury, not the discovery of the identity of the party allegedly responsible for causing the injury.” Renaud v. Sigma-Aldrich Corporation, 662 A.2d 711, 715 (R.I. 1995) (examining personal injury claim governed by statute of limitations in G.L. 1956 § 9-1-14). Similarly, we have held that the tolling provision for a claim of medical malpractice in § 9-1-14.1 “assists a plaintiff who is unable in the exercise of reasonable diligence to discover an injury due to medical malpractice[,]” but is unavailable when a plaintiff knows of the injury and “merely claims that she did not know the identity of the medical doctor who might have treated [the injured person].” Grossi v. Miriam Hospital, 689 A.2d 403, 404 (R.I. 1997). However, we have treated cases founded on drug-products liability more liberally in the context of the tolling of an applicable statute of limitation. See Anthony v. Abbott Laboratories, 490 A.2d 43, 46 (R.I. 1985) (“[I]n a drug product-liability action where the manifestation of an injury, the cause of that injury, and the person’s knowledge of the wrongdoing by the manufacturer occur at different points in time, the running of the statute of limitations would begin when the person discovers, or with reasonable diligence should have discovered, the wrongful conduct of the manufacturer.”).', '-8- (R.I. 2005), stands in contrast to this longstanding rule. We do not agree, and conclude that her reading of O’Sullivan is fundamentally flawed.', 'In O’Sullivan, the plaintiff’s wife was brought by ambulance to Newport Hospital complaining of nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, and persistent fever. O’Sullivan, 874 A.2d at 181. At the hospital, Mrs. O’Sullivan was rehydrated with a saline solution and promptly discharged. Id. The next day, she was again transported by ambulance to Newport Hospital with worsening symptoms, and was again rehydrated and again discharged. Id. Two days after that, she was brought to Newport Hospital for a third time; she was finally admitted as a patient and diagnosed with severe bilateral pneumonia and severe neutropenia, a condition that caused her to be more susceptible to bacterial infections. Id. She was soon transferred to Rhode Island Hospital, where she died after spending three weeks in that hospital’s intensive care unit. Id.', 'The plaintiff received his wife’s medical records roughly three months after her death on March 1, 1999. O’Sullivan, 874 A.2d at 181. Later that year, the plaintiff filed a wrongful death action against a number of defendants affiliated with Newport Hospital. Id. The plaintiff waited until June 2002, however, to file a wrongful death claim against defendants associated with Rhode Island Hospital. Id. Importantly, the claims against the Rhode Island Hospital defendants were filed more than three years after the decedent’s death, but less than three years after the plaintiff received his wife’s medical records. Id. At issue, therefore, was whether the statute of limitations in § 10-7-2 began to run on the date of Mrs. O’Sullivan’s death or on the date on which the plaintiff received her medical records. Id. at 183.', 'We began our analysis in O’Sullivan by “unhesitatingly” rejecting the argument that the “fact of death always triggers the running of the wrongful death statute of limitations” when death is allegedly caused by medical errors. O’Sullivan, 874 A.2d at 184 (emphasis in original).', '-9- Unlike automobile accidents, in which “the traumatic event is immediately apparent to the participants or their legal representatives[,]” Benner, 641 A.2d at 336, the plaintiff in O’Sullivan “had no knowledge or reason to know of possible tortious acts” at Rhode Island Hospital, considering that the decedent had been transferred to Rhode Island Hospital only after “multiple fruitless trips to Newport Hospital” with increasingly worsening symptoms. Id. at 184, 185 (first emphasis added; second emphasis in original).', 'We believed that those “fruitless trips” were such dominant “red flags” that it was “not at all illogical” for the plaintiff to focus at the outset on the conduct of the Newport Hospital actors when first filing his wrongful death claim. O’Sullivan, 874 A.2d at 187. Indeed, we held that “[t]here was no reason for plaintiff initially to believe that he should inquire beyond the local hospital to which Mrs. O’Sullivan had thrice been transported.” Id. It was not until the plaintiff received the decedent’s medical records that he had any reason to suspect that other tortious conduct, at Rhode Island Hospital, might have contributed to his wife’s death. Id.', 'We concluded, therefore, that “any alleged wrongful act on the part of the Rhode Island Hospital defendants was not known to plaintiff at the time of Mrs. O’Sullivan’s death” and that the plaintiff’s receipt of his late wife’s medical records triggered the statute of limitations as to Rhode Island Hospital because it was those medical records that first suggested that tortious conduct might have occurred there. 6 O’Sullivan, 874 A.2d at 187-88 (emphasis added). We held that “when virtually all available evidence indicates that the tort (if any) in all likelihood was caused by one particular entity or person, the plaintiff is not obliged to beat the bushes at the 6', 'We did note, however, that the facts before us in O’Sullivan v. Rhode Island Hospital, 874 A.2d 179 (R.I. 2005), were “highly unusual” and that “[i]n the usual situation, the plaintiff would be aware of the wrong (or the reasonably suspected wrong) at or immediately following the death and would know at that time which defendants should be named.” O’Sullivan, 874 A.2d at 180, 187. Those unusual circumstances are not before us in this case.', '- 10 - first conceivable opportunity in an attempt to locate yet more possible tortfeasors.” Id.', 'Contrary to Parrillo’s contention in this case, our holding in O’Sullivan did not adopt a rule whereby the statute of limitations in § 10-7-2 would be tolled until a plaintiff learns of the identity of the allegedly negligent party. 7', 'O’Sullivan was instead a rather straightforward application of our longstanding interpretation of § 10-7-2—namely, that “the statute of limitations is automatically tolled when the ‘wrongful act, neglect or default’ ‘is not known at the time of death’ and it is the actual (or imputed) discovery of the ‘wrongful act, neglect or default’ that triggers the running of the statute.” O’Sullivan, 874 A.2d at 186 (emphasis omitted).', 'B', 'Application', 'Having completed our review of the caselaw and having confirmed that “it is the actual (or imputed) discovery of the ‘wrongful act, neglect or default’ that triggers the running of the statute” of limitations in § 10-7-2, O’Sullivan, 874 A.2d at 186 (emphasis omitted), we now turn our attention to the facts before us to determine when Parrillo “knew or should have known of the ‘wrongful act’ that is the basis of [her] lawsuit.” Ashey, 618 A.2d at 1269.', 'The alleged wrongful acts that form the basis of Parrillo’s claim against Dr. Gregg can be found in her second amended complaint and are as follows: Dr. Gregg (1) “failed to recognize signs of infection”; (2) “failed to begin a regimen of antibiotics”; (3) “fail[ed] to order a chest CT”; (4) did “not us[e] CT Angio or D-Dimer to rule out pulmonary embolism, or acute 7', 'Parrillo’s confusion may be attributable to our discussion in O’Sullivan of the West Virginia case Gaither v. City Hospital, Inc., 487 S.E.2d 901 (W. Va. 1997). In that case, the highest court of West Virginia ruled that that state’s statute of limitations on medical malpractice actions would not begin to run until a plaintiff knew of the injury sustained, the identity of the allegedly negligent party, and the causal relationship between the two. See Gaither, 487 S.E.2d at 909. However, while we noted that our decision in O’Sullivan was “guided” by Gaither, we did not adopt that case’s rule as our own, nor do we do so now. See O’Sullivan, 874 A.2d at 188-89.', '- 11 - infection”; (5) “failed to recognize and act upon clinical signs of infection”; (6) “failed to provide a reasonable degree of care”; and (7) “fail[ed] to properly and timely diagnose Santos’s deteriorating health, infection and general condition[.]”', 'In our opinion, this conduct was discoverable, at the latest, on August 23, 2012—the date on which Parrillo obtained Mr. Santos’s medical records. 8 See Meyette v. Leach, 651 A.2d 1229, 1229 (R.I. 1994) (mem.) (“[W]e are of the opinion that the alleged negligence was neither latent nor undiscoverable if plaintiff had exercised reasonable diligence at the time of his wife’s death. All of the records, including the x- rays, were available to plaintiff and his counsel.”). Indeed, the conduct that Parrillo attributes to Dr. Gregg in the second amended complaint is in fact the very same conduct, pled almost word for word, that was alleged against the other defendants in Parrillo’s original complaint.', 'It cannot be gainsaid, therefore, that Parrillo knew what conduct she believed caused Mr. Santos’s death within the three-year statutory period set by § 10-7-2. When she was deposed, Parrillo acknowledged that she had suspected shortly after Mr. Santos’s death that his death had been caused by malpractice, and it was that suspicion that drove her to request his medical records from Rhode Island Hospital. She simply failed to name all of the potentially responsible parties, including Dr. Gregg, before the three-year statutory period for filing a wrongful death claim had expired. It is our conclusion, therefore, that Parrillo’s wrongful death claim against 8', 'We note that the hearing justice believed the statute of limitations was tolled until Parrillo received Mr. Santos’s medical records on August 23, 2012. However, as we observed in O’Sullivan and reiterate above in footnote six, “[i]n the usual situation, the plaintiff would be aware of the wrong (or the reasonably suspected wrong) at or immediately following the death and would know at that time which defendants should be named.” O’Sullivan, 874 A.2d at 187. Nonetheless, because Parrillo did not name Dr. Gregg as a defendant until more than three years after both Mr. Santos’s death and Parrillo’s receipt of the medical records, we need not, and do not, express an opinion as to whether the statute of limitations began running on the date of Mr. Santos’s death or on the date that Parrillo received Mr. Santos’s medical records.', '- 12 - Dr. Gregg is time barred. 9', 'In the face of a looming statute of limitations, plaintiffs are not devoid of options when they do not know the identity of all parties responsible for tortious conduct that they believe caused an injury. Mechanisms are available outside of § 10-7-2 that may preserve a claim while a plaintiff’s investigation is ongoing. For example, G.L. 1956 § 9-5-20 allows plaintiffs to “toll an applicable statute of limitations against a known but then unidentifiable defendant * * * by designating that unidentified defendant by means of a fictitious name, such as John Doe.” Grossi v. Miriam Hospital, 689 A.2d 403, 404 (R.I. 1997); see § 9-5-20. It is true that, as Parrillo argues, she was in no way required to employ John Doe defendants or to make use of the rules of civil procedure to compel more responsive answers to the discovery requests that she maintains were answered in an opaque, confusing, and incomplete manner. Unfortunately, however, because Parrillo did not avail herself of these mechanisms, she was unprepared when the statutory period for filing a wrongful death claim against Dr. Gregg expired. Rhode Island’s statute of limitations on wrongful death claims cannot be circumvented to accommodate Parrillo’s failure to make use of the tools available to her.', 'Our holding today underscores the importance of promptly and assiduously investigating 9', 'Parrillo also briefly, and without citing any caselaw, contends that Rhode Island Hospital’s answers to interrogatories were so unclear that they amounted to intentional obfuscation of Dr. Gregg’s role in Mr. Santos’s medical care. Parrillo cites to G.L. 1956 § 9-1-20, which, she contends, tolls the statute of limitations if the defendant acted in any way to conceal the existence of a cause of action. See § 9-1-20. Assuming, without deciding, that this bare bones argument was sufficiently developed in Parrillo’s brief, we nonetheless observe that § 9-1-20 applies only where “the party asserting the statute-of-limitations defense attempted by fraud or misrepresentation to conceal the existence of the cause of action.” Renaud, 662 A.2d at 714 (internal punctuation omitted). It is not sufficient to allege that one defendant has acted to conceal a cause of action against another defendant. See id. Parrillo takes issue only with the discovery provided by Rhode Island Hospital, and does not allege any obfuscation on the part of Dr. Gregg, the party asserting the statute of limitations defense. Therefore, even though we agree with Parrillo that Rhode Island Hospital’s interrogatory answers were not particularly transparent, we nonetheless conclude that § 9-1-20 is inapplicable to this case.', '- 13 - the facts of one’s claim. Despite obtaining Mr. Santos’s medical records within months of his death, Parrillo did not file a wrongful death suit until January 2014 and did not even begin the process of discovery until February 2015—almost three years to the day after Mr. Santos’s death. While a plaintiff’s reasonable diligence is not a prerequisite to tolling under § 10-7-2, as it is for other statutes of limitations, such as that for medical malpractice, see O’Sullivan, 874 A.2d at 185-86, plaintiffs must nevertheless “investigate diligently who may or may not have had any exposure to liability during treatment” lest the statute of limitations expire before they have filed claims against all of the responsible parties. Dionne v. Baute, 589 A.2d 833, 835 (R.I. 1991). As we said in Benner, “[w]ithout question, [a potential plaintiff] must carry out both factual and legal investigations of varying durations. * * * This does not mean that the statute of limitations will be tolled until the investigation is complete. Such a doctrine would render the statute of limitations meaningless and ineffective.” Benner, 641 A.2d at 336.', 'It is possible that, had she diligently investigated her claim and timely named Dr. Gregg as a defendant, Parrillo could have maintained a viable wrongful death action against him. Nevertheless, as the United States Supreme Court has said: “It goes without saying that statutes of limitations often make it impossible to enforce what were otherwise perfectly valid claims. But that is their very purpose, and they remain as ubiquitous as the statutory rights or other rights to which they are attached or are applicable.” United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.S. 111, 125 (1979); see Benner, 641 A.2d at 338; see also Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 180-81 (R.I. 2008).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the entry of summary judgment.

61,Colleen MacTavish-Thurber : v. : Timothy Gauvin. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The plaintiff, Colleen MacTavish-Thurber, 1 appeals a Family Court order denying a miscellaneous petition filed pursuant to G.L. 1956 §§ 15-5-24.1 and 15-5-24.3 for grandparent visitation with two children of her daughter, who is deceased, and the defendant, Timothy Gauvin. This case came before this Court for oral argument on January 17, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed on behalf of the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court. 1', 'Although the Family Court’s decision lists the plaintiff’s first name as Stacy, the lower court file and the statements filed with this Court refer to her as Colleen. Additionally, throughout this opinion, we use pseudonyms to identify the two minor children to protect their privacy.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiff is the maternal grandmother of two minor children: Danielle, who was born in May 2006, and Adam, who was born in September 2007. The defendant is the biological father of both children, and he was previously married to plaintiff’s daughter. The defendant testified that there had been a filing for divorce and he had full custody of the children. However, in December 2010, before the divorce became final, the mother of Danielle and Adam died after she was shot by law enforcement during the course of a bank robbery in Florida.', 'In April 2015, plaintiff filed a miscellaneous petition in the Providence County Family Court in which she sought grandparent visitation with her grandchildren, Danielle and Adam. Specifically, her petition averred that for more than thirty days she had made repeated attempts to see her grandchildren, but that defendant had refused her visitation requests. The plaintiff further claimed that, without court intervention, she would not be able to visit her grandchildren and that defendant’s refusal to allow her to visit with them was unreasonable. She alleged that it was in the best interests of the grandchildren to allow her to visit with them and that she was a fit and proper person to exercise visitation rights.', 'The petition eventually was heard before a justice of the Family Court, and plaintiff, defendant, and defendant’s current wife, Sarah Gauvin, all testified. The plaintiff testified that, in September 2010, her daughter separated from defendant, her husband, and left the marital domicile. Because defendant was left with the couple’s two children, and due to his work schedule, plaintiff agreed to care for Danielle and Adam on the weekends. 2 2', 'The plaintiff testified that, from September 2010 to February 2011, the children would also have dinner at her house during the week when defendant was working.', '-2-', 'Danielle and Adam were informed of their mother’s death in February 2011, when they were just four and three years old, respectively. According to plaintiff, she and defendant agreed to tell Danielle and Adam that their mother had passed away as a result of a motor vehicle accident because “the children were too young at that time to understand and take on that she was shot in the head and died on the street in Florida.” She testified that, as soon as defendant informed her that the children had been told of their mother’s death, she dedicated a tree in her backyard to her deceased daughter and sprinkled her daughter’s ashes on the tree at a time when Danielle and Adam were present.', 'The plaintiff further testified that, beginning in 2012, she was spending less time with Danielle and Adam, and her time with her grandchildren diminished even more when defendant and his current wife, Sarah Gauvin, married. According to plaintiff, she did not have a good relationship with defendant’s new wife, and she felt that “there was always resistance.”', 'The plaintiff testified that in 2015 she saw Danielle and Adam in January, February, and March, but that the March 2015 visit was the last time she saw them. 3 According to plaintiff, defendant contacted her in March 2015 to set up a meeting to discuss behavioral issues that the children were experiencing, but the meeting never occurred.', 'The plaintiff also testified that, in March and April 2015, she tried to contact defendant so that she might see the children, but that defendant failed to return her messages. She said that she would leave two to three—and she admitted maybe one time, four—messages per day, two to three times per week. She also testified that her husband may have once left a voicemail message for defendant around 6:00 am. The plaintiff reported that she received one response 3', 'Introduced as evidence during the petition hearing were photographs of the children at plaintiff’s house, taken during the January 2015 visit. In the photos, plaintiff contends that the children appear to be cheerful and content.', '-3- from defendant, informing her that the children did not want to speak to her, but she nonetheless continued to leave voice and text messages.', 'The plaintiff testified that she had no idea why defendant had become angry with her. She further testified that she believed it would be possible to rekindle a relationship with defendant, but that first she had to be reintroduced to the children. She acknowledged that defendant is a good and fit parent for Danielle and Adam.', 'The defendant was next to testify. He said that, although plaintiff never babysat the children before their mother’s death, she “had [his] side” during the divorce and she put the best interests of the children over her own daughter’s interest. The defendant also testified that he waited until February 2011 to inform the children of their mother’s passing. He said that his decision in that regard was founded on the fact that the incident resulting in his former wife’s death occurred just before Christmas, and he “wanted to make sure that [he] had a period of time that [he] could spend with them” when he was not working and they were not in school or daycare. 4 The defendant testified that plaintiff wanted to inform Danielle and Adam of their mother’s death immediately, but that eventually she agreed with his reasoning. Eventually, however, defendant told the children the truth about how their mother had been killed because he “didn’t want them thinking that their mother was this fictitious great person that their grandmother was saying she was.” The defendant also testified that, at some point, plaintiff had invited him to participate in the sprinkling of her daughter’s ashes on the tree in her backyard with the children, but that he did not go because he was working at that time.', 'In July or August 2012, defendant began his relationship with the woman who would become Mrs. Gauvin. The couple began living together in November 2012, and they eventually 4', 'The plaintiff testified that defendant did not believe the children needed counseling at the time that they were informed of their mother’s death.', '-4- married in August 2013. 5 The defendant testified that plaintiff started spending less time with the children around this time because he and Mrs. Gauvin worked opposite schedules so one of them would always be at home to take care of the children. 6', 'The defendant further testified that, at some point, Danielle and Adam were having behavioral issues at school and at home, and that those issues “always occurred after visits with their grandparents.” As a result, Adam began seeing a counselor at school, starting in November 2014, in an effort to address his issues. The defendant also described that, after visiting with plaintiff, the children “would come home with huge bags under their eyes” signaling a lack of sleep, and that sometimes they would come home sick with symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.', 'Starting in 2014, defendant allowed the children to decide whether or not they wished to visit, not only with plaintiff, but also with his own mother and Mrs. Gauvin’s parents. 7 After the March 2015 visit with plaintiff, defendant testified that Adam came home “balling [sic] his eyes out” because plaintiff had shown their mother’s ashes to the children that day. Adam told his father that the display of the ashes frightened him. Adam also described to his father what the ashes looked like and how he, Danielle, and plaintiff had sorted through his mother’s belongings.', 'Furthermore, in that same month, Adam needed to see the school nurse and a physician because he had a pulse rate of 200 beats per minute. Even though Adam had had a history of an elevated heartbeat as an infant, he had not exhibited such symptoms for several years. 5', 'The couple also had a child together, who was just over a year old at the time of the hearing on plaintiff’s petition. 6', 'The defendant testified that his own mother would also care for Danielle and Adam on alternate weekends before his remarriage; he said that his own mother’s time with the children had also diminished since his remarriage. 7', 'There was testimony presented to the Family Court that defendant also allowed the children to decide whether they wanted to attend church and that the children had gone to church with Mrs. Gauvin.', '-5- Additionally, defendant testified that, after the March 2015 visit, Adam would wake up afraid that plaintiff was “coming to get him in the middle of the night[,]” that he feared being shown the ashes, and that he repeatedly heard a song from a music box that once belonged to his mother.', 'According to defendant, he never had a discussion with plaintiff that gave her permission to show the children their mother’s ashes on that day, and displaying their mother’s ashes to the children was the “final nail” after several disagreements and arguments about what the children should and should not be doing while they were at plaintiff’s home. 8', 'According to defendant, since the March 2015 visit, he prevented plaintiff from visiting with Danielle and Adam because they did not wish to see her. The defendant testified that he believed that showing the mother’s ashes to Adam was “incredibly inappropriate” and that it had been mentally damaging to Adam. The defendant also said that, after the last visit, he was barraged with phone calls and voicemail messages from plaintiff and her husband and that he had contacted the police because he considered the phone calls to be a form of harassment. Since that point, defendant testified, the phone calls had ceased.', 'In stark contrast to plaintiff’s testimony, defendant testified that he believed that the children should not visit with plaintiff again. He said that Adam’s behavior had improved “insanely” since the cessation of visitation, that there were rarely any issues at home or school, that his grades were “phenomenal,” that his teacher gave great progress reports, and that both children were on a regular routine with homework and their sleep. The defendant also conveyed that Adam stopped seeing the school counselor in June 2015, a few months after the visits with plaintiff came to an end. 8', 'The defendant also testified that he was not solely relying on his children’s descriptions with respect to “what was lacking at [plaintiff’s] house[,]” but had spoken to plaintiff about these incidents as well.', '-6-', 'Mrs. Gauvin was the last to testify. She said that she noticed a change in the children’s behavior at “the very end of 2012, beginning of 2013[,]” and that Adam in particular would have behavioral issues when they would return home from plaintiff’s house. She further testified that the children had never showcased those behaviors before that time. Moreover, after the last visit with plaintiff, Mrs. Gauvin testified, the children had not demonstrated any behavioral issues.', 'A report from a Family Court investigator was accepted into the record. The investigator had interviewed plaintiff, her husband, defendant, Danielle, and Adam. He also reviewed several documents, including reports from Adam’s visits with the school counselor and his cardiac physician, a police report from a minor incident between the parties, school communications, and information concerning the death of the children’s mother.', 'Ultimately, the investigator recommended that Danielle and Adam should have no further visitation with plaintiff, basing his conclusion “directly on the interviews of the children expressing that they disliked visiting with their grandmother as well as with respect to the reports from the school social worker as well as the wishes of their [f]ather.” The investigator observed that “the children have suffered enough stress with the loss of their mother and that they are happy and healthy with their father and step[]mother.”', 'The Family Court investigator also addressed the report authored by Adam’s school counselor. In that report, the school counselor said that she started seeing Adam in November 2014 after a behavioral incident that had occurred at the school playground. She also noted that she had spoken with Adam’s parents and they had informed her of his “frequent meltdowns[.]” Specifically, she recounted how, in April 2015, Mrs. Gauvin told her about a recent visit that Adam had had with his maternal grandmother when he was shown his mother’s ashes and the negative impact it had had on both children. The school counselor also reported that when she', '-7- discussed that visit with Adam “he appeared to be upset as evidenced by a change in his facial expressions and a decrease in his level of engagement[.]” She confirmed that Adam’s visits with plaintiff were affecting the boy negatively, and she also reported that Adam was afraid that plaintiff could “come over and take him” while he was at home or at school. The school counselor recommended that any future visits with Adam and plaintiff be supervised by the parents and be in a neutral location. She made this recommendation contingent, however, on plaintiff “stopping all of the harassing type behavior that has reportedly been taking place.”', 'After the hearing, the hearing justice rendered a written decision in November 2016. Upon considering the testimony of plaintiff, defendant, and Mrs. Gauvin, as well as the evidence presented at the hearing and the Family Court investigator’s report, the court found that plaintiff had satisfied her burden under § 15-5-24.3 of showing that she had made repeated attempts to visit the children for thirty days prior to the time she filed her petition. Also, the hearing justice concluded that plaintiff had proven there was no other way under the present circumstances that she would be able to visit the children without court intervention. However, the court also found that plaintiff was not a fit and proper person to have visitation rights with Danielle and Adam, that plaintiff had failed to prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that defendant’s decision to refuse visitation was unreasonable, and that it was in the children’s best interest not to visit with plaintiff. The plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal to this Court. 9 9', 'We note that, initially, no final judgment was entered in the Family Court. Following the prebriefing conference, this Court remanded the case to the Family Court for entry of final judgment in accordance with Rule 58(a) of the Family Court Rules of Domestic Procedure. On remand, an order entered in the Family Court in May 2018, which denied plaintiff’s petition for grandparent visitation. The papers were then returned to this Court in October 2018.', '-8-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In cases on review for grandparent visitation, we consider the “traditional presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her child.” Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 69 (2000). “[T]he decision whether such an intergenerational relationship would be beneficial in any specific case is for the parent to make in the first instance.” Id. at 70. “[I]f a fit parent’s decision of the kind at issue here becomes subject to judicial review, the court must accord at least some special weight to the parent’s own determination.” Id. We review a hearing justice’s decision whether to award grandparent visitation under an abuse-of-discretion standard. See Puleo v. Forgue, 634 A.2d 857, 858 (R.I. 1993). 10 Moreover, “the findings of a [hearing] justice will not be disturbed on appeal unless the [hearing] justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, plaintiff argues that the Family Court’s decision contradicts the evidence presented at the hearing because many of the facts that the hearing justice purportedly erred in evaluating “were actually the result of [defendant] sharing his opinion and [were of] no independent evaluation or recommendation regarding the children.”', 'She contends that she proved, by clear and convincing evidence, that defendant’s decision to deny her grandparent 10', 'We note that the United States Supreme Court in Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), recognized that Rhode Island’s statute governing grandparent visitation was in compliance with its holding. See Troxel, 530 U.S. at 70 (citing G.L. 1956 § 15-5-24.3(a)(2)(v)). For that reason, the mere fact that Puleo v. Forgue, 634 A.2d 857 (R.I. 1993)—a case where this Court reviewed a grandparent visitation decision under § 15-5-24.3—was decided before Troxel is of no moment and correctly provides our standard of review here.', '-9- visitation was unreasonable. She also argues that she presented evidence that she was a fit and proper person to have visitation.', 'Section 15-5-24.1 states that the Family Court “may, upon miscellaneous petition of a grandparent whose child is deceased, grant reasonable visitation rights of the * * * grandchildren to the grandparent, whether or not any divorce or custody proceedings were ever commenced, and may issue all necessary orders to enforce visitation rights.” 11 Furthermore, § 15-5-24.3 states, in pertinent part:', '“(a)(1) The family court, upon miscellaneous petition of a', 'grandparent for visitation rights with the petitioner’s grandchild,', 'and upon notice to both parents of the child, and after a hearing on', 'the petition, may grant reasonable rights of visitation of the', 'grandchild to the petitioner.', '“(2) The court, in order to grant the petitioner reasonable rights of', 'visitation, must find and set forth in writing the following findings', 'of fact:', '“(i) That it is in the best interest of the grandchild as determined on', 'a case-by-case basis that the petitioner is granted visitation rights', 'with the grandchild.', '***', '“(ii) That the petitioner is a fit and proper person to have visitation', 'rights with the grandchild;', '“(iii) That the petitioner has repeatedly attempted to visit his or her', 'grandchild during the thirty (30) days immediately preceding the', 'date the petition was filed and was not allowed to visit the', 'grandchild during the thirty-day (30) period as a direct result of the', 'actions of either, or both, parents of the grandchild; 11', 'In addition to §§ 15-5-24.1 and 15-5-24.3, plaintiff also alleges that she filed her petition pursuant to § 15-5-24.2. That statute is titled “Visitation rights of grandparents whose child is denied or has failed to exercise rights” and allows the Family Court, upon petition by a grandparent, to grant reasonable visitation rights to that grandparent during “any divorce proceeding” when the grandchild is a child of the marriage. Here, the petition was not filed during a divorce proceeding. For this reason, we note that § 15-5-24.2 is inapplicable to the case before us, and that plaintiff’s petition was properly filed under §§ 15-5-24.1 and 15-5-24.3.', '- 10 -', '“(iv) That there is no other way the petitioner is able to visit his or', 'her grandchild without court intervention; and', '“(v) That the petitioner, by clear and convincing evidence, has', 'successfully rebutted the presumption that the parent’s decision to', 'refuse the grandparent visitation with the grandchild was', 'reasonable.” 12 We have held, in citing with approval to the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Troxel, that “a party who seeks visitation with a child must ‘overcome the otherwise applicable presumption in favor of honoring a fit custodial parent’s determination not to allow such visitation.’” Resendes v. Brown, 966 A.2d 1249, 1254 (R.I. 2009) (alteration omitted) (quoting Rubano v. DiCenzo, 759 A.2d 959, 968 (R.I. 2000)); see also Keenan v.

See P.L. 2017, ch. 222, § 1; P.L. 2017, ch. 334, § 1.

Here, plaintiff admitted in her testimony below—and there was no evidence presented to the contrary—that defendant is a fit custodial parent. 13 Therefore, plaintiff had the burden of proving, “by clear and convincing evidence, [that she] has successfully rebutted the presumption that [defendant’s] decision to refuse the grandparent visitation with [Danielle and Adam] was reasonable.” See § 15-5-24.3(2)(v) (emphasis added).', 'We are satisfied that the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in denying plaintiff’s petition for grandparent visitation.', 'In his eight-page written decision, the hearing justice reviewed the testimony of all three witnesses as well as the report by the Family Court investigator. He observed that the investigator’s report concluded that the children had no interest in visiting with plaintiff, and he also considered the investigator’s observation that, in the hearing justice’s words, the children “are happy and healthy with their father and stepmother” as well as the investigator’s recommendation that “[p]laintiff have no further visitation with the children in this matter.” 13', 'The plaintiff testified as follows before the Family Court at the hearing on her petition for grandparent visitation:', '“Q Is this a true statement: You have no doubt that [defendant]', 'desires a good life for his children?', '“A Yes.', '“Q Is it fair to say that his greatest strength has been his concern', 'for the children’s welfare and his ability to financially support', 'them sufficiently over the years; is that a fair statement?', '“A Yes.”', '- 12 -', 'Moreover, the hearing justice considered defendant’s testimony concerning the detrimental impact that the visits with plaintiff had had on the children and the fact that neither he nor the children wished to continue visits with plaintiff at that time. 14 He also recounted, from the testimony by defendant and Mrs. Gauvin, how the children’s behavior, performance in school, and health had improved since the visits with plaintiff had come to an end. These findings, when combined with the presumption that defendant, as a fit parent, was acting in Danielle and Adam’s best interest, leads us to conclude that the hearing justice was correct when he denied grandparent visitation rights. See Keenan, 792 A.2d at 50; Puleo, 634 A.2d at 858. The plaintiff has not offered any compelling legal argument as to why this Court should hold otherwise. It is our opinion, therefore, that the hearing justice was well within his discretion when he denied plaintiff’s petition for grandparent visitation with Danielle and Adam.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court.

62,Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary : Education et al. v. : Hellenic Society Paideia – Rhode Island : Chapter.,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. We are called upon to decide whether the terms of a ground lease agreement between the plaintiffs, the University of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education, and the defendant, Hellenic Society Paideia – Rhode Island Chapter, require the parties to arbitrate all disputes arising from their lease agreement, or merely a subset of those disputes. The defendant appeals from orders of the Superior Court denying its Motion to Stay Litigation in Favor of Arbitration pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-3-3. These consolidated appeals came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed on behalf of the parties, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the order of the Superior Court and remand the case to the Superior Court for entry of an order staying litigation pending arbitration proceedings.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2005, the University of Rhode Island and the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education 1 agreed to lease a parcel of land on the Kingston campus of the University of Rhode Island to the Hellenic Society Paideia – Rhode Island Chapter (the Society or defendant) for the purpose of building and maintaining a Center for Hellenic Studies, which also was to house the Hellenic Studies Program at the University and the University of Rhode Island Center for Humanities. The initial term of the Lease was for ninety-nine years following completion of the building, and the Lease gave defendant the option to extend the initial Lease term for four additional ninety-nine year terms. 2', 'Although excavation was completed and a foundation was laid, construction of the building was halted in 2012 and, for reasons outside the scope of this appeal, construction was never recommenced. In November 2012, plaintiffs sent a Notice of Default and Termination of Ground Lease to the Society, advising it of plaintiffs’ intent to terminate the Lease because construction had not been completed within thirty months of the commencement of construction, as required by the Lease. In June 2013, plaintiffs sent another letter to the Society, demanding that defendant restore the property to its former condition. 1', 'The Rhode Island Council on Postsecondary Education is the statutory successor to the Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education and is a public corporation that holds “legal title (in trust for the state) to all property, real and personal,” owned by and/or under control of the University of Rhode Island and other public colleges in the state.', 'General Laws 1956 § 16-59-1(a), as amended by P.L. 2014, ch. 145, art. 20, § 5. 2', 'At oral argument, defense counsel posited that the agreement at issue is in fact not a lease, as the document, titled “Ground Lease Agreement,” refers to itself, but is in substance a long-term joint venture agreement. Any difference between these characterizations is irrelevant to the outcome of this appeal, and, therefore, we need not decide between them. In the interest of clarity, and for the purpose of this opinion only, we adopt the language of the agreement and refer to it as “the Lease.”', '-2-', 'After years of back and forth between the parties, plaintiffs brought a petition in the Superior Court to appoint a special master to resolve the issues between the parties in relation to the failed project. Plaintiffs soon thereafter filed a first amended complaint seeking, inter alia, a declaratory judgment that defendant was in breach of the Lease. The amended complaint also sought an order directing defendant to restore the premises to its former condition or, in the alternative, to require defendant to reimburse plaintiffs for doing so themselves. While the case was in its early stages, defendant moved for a stay of litigation pursuant to § 10-3-3, arguing that Section 14.3 of the Lease, entitled “Conciliation; Arbitration,” required that all disputes be resolved by arbitration. The hearing justice ruled, for reasons discussed in more detail below, that the language of that provision did not mandate arbitration in this case, and consequently he denied defendant’s motion for a stay of the litigation. The hearing justice later reaffirmed that ruling after defendant moved for reconsideration of the order denying the motion for a stay. 3', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the hearing justice erred when he found that the Lease’s arbitration clause applied only to disputes that do not involve an alleged breach of the Lease.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The issue of whether a dispute is arbitrable is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo.” Town of Johnston v.

Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 866 A.2d 1241, 1247 (R.I. 2005).

Amaral, 460 A.2d 7, 10 (R.I. 1983)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Appeal as of Right', 'Before reaching the merits, we must first grapple with plaintiffs’ contention that defendant’s appeal is not properly before us.', 'The defendant’s motion for a stay of litigation was brought pursuant to § 10-3-3, which requires a hearing justice to order a stay of litigation “upon being satisfied that the issue involved in the suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration[.]” Direct appeals may be taken “upon the entry of any final order provided in § 10-3-3[.]” Section 10-3-19. The plaintiffs argue, however,', '-4- that orders denying a motion to stay litigation, although brought pursuant to § 10-3-3, deny by their very nature the existence of an issue “referable to arbitration” and that, in the absence of an arbitrable issue, the Arbitration Act as a whole, including § 10-3-19, simply does not apply. Thus, plaintiffs submit, an order denying a motion to stay litigation pending arbitration is not final and is reviewable only by writ of certiorari.', 'Significantly, § 10-3-19 provides that “[a]ny party aggrieved by any ruling or order” as authorized in chapter 3 of title 10 of the General Laws “may obtain review as in any civil action, and upon the entry of any final order provided in § 10-3-3 * * * he or she may appeal to the supreme court as provided for appeals in civil actions[.]” By specifying that “any party” may bring a direct appeal if aggrieved by “any ruling” authorized by chapter 3 of title 10, the General Assembly clearly intended to permit direct appeals from orders both granting and denying motions to stay brought pursuant to § 10-3-3. Section 10-3-19 (emphasis added); see Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of New England, Inc. v. Gelati, 865 A.2d 1028, 1037 (R.I. 2004) (“When the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, we must enforce the statute as written by giving the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meaning.”). We conclude that a party who has sought a stay on the basis of an arbitrable issue is certainly aggrieved by an order denying the existence of such an issue and that such an order is final in nature. Therefore, it is our opinion that a party aggrieved by an order denying a motion to stay litigation brought pursuant to § 10-3-3 may appeal as of right from that order, pursuant to § 10-3-19. 4 4', 'This holding is consonant with our decision in Newman v. Valleywood Associates, Inc., 874 A.2d 1286 (R.I. 2005), in which we “view[ed] the denial of defendant’s petition to arbitrate as the equivalent of an order denying a motion to stay litigation under [G.L. 1956] § 10-3-3” and held that such an appeal was “properly before us pursuant to § 10-3-19.” Newman, 874 A.2d at 1288.', '-5-', 'B', 'The Arbitrable Issue', 'We turn now to the meat of the issue—whether the parties “agree[d] to arbitration in clear and unequivocal language[.]” Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 866 A.2d at 1247. The defendant argues that the parties explicitly agreed to refer any dispute arising from an alleged breach of the Lease to arbitration, and defendant relies in support of this argument on a provision entitled “Conciliation; Arbitration.”', 'The relevant language is as follows:', '“14.3', 'Conciliation; Arbitration.', '“14.3.1', 'Conciliation In the event of any controversy, claim', 'or dispute arising out of or relating to this Lease or with respect to', 'any breach hereof, the parties shall seek to resolve the matter', 'amicably through mutual discussions * * *.', '“14.3.2', 'Arbitration - If the parties fail to resolve any such', 'controversy, claim or dispute by amicable arrangement and', 'compromise within the thirty (30) day period immediately', 'following the date of the notice initiating such discussions referred', 'to in subsection (a) [sic] above * * * the aggrieved party shall', 'submit the controversy, claim or dispute to arbitration * * *.”', '1', 'The Arbitration Clause', 'The underpinning of the hearing justice’s bench decision was what he referred to as “a conspicuous difference” between the language of the conciliation clause in Section 14.3.1 and that of the arbitration clause in Section 14.3.2. He pointed out that the conciliation clause referred to “any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Lease or with respect to any breach hereof[.]” He noted that, on the other hand, the arbitration clause omits the', '-6- language “with respect to any breach hereof.” The consequence of this difference, he ruled, was a limitation in the scope of the arbitration clause. In other words, the hearing justice reasoned that, because the arbitration clause omitted the words “with respect to any breach hereof,” the parties did not intend to arbitrate issues involving a breach of the Lease.', 'To reach this conclusion, the hearing justice applied the canon of construction known as the “specific-over-general” rule.', 'That canon applies when two statutory or contractual provisions cannot be reasonably construed to avoid a conflict between them. See Park v. Ford Motor Company, 844 A.2d 687, 694 (R.I. 2004); see also Capital Ventures International v. Republic of Argentina, 652 F.3d 266, 271 (2d Cir. 2011) (applying canon to conflicting contractual provisions). “When, however, the two provisions are irreconcilable and cannot both be given effect, the specific [provision] prevails and is to be construed as an exception to the more general [provision].” Park, 844 A.2d at 694. The hearing justice believed that the absence of the words “with respect to any breach hereof” in the arbitration clause created a conflict with the conciliation clause, and, applying the specific-over-general rule, he ruled that “in order for there to be arbitration, there had to be [a] controversy, claim, or dispute other than a breach of the [Lease]” because only the conciliation clause specifically referred to incidents of breach.', 'We review the Lease de novo to determine whether the parties’ dispute is arbitrable. Rhode Island Council 94, 159 A.3d at 85. In our opinion, the conciliation and arbitration provisions cannot be read separately when conducting an analysis because, as we explain above, “[i]n ascertaining what the intent is we must look at the instrument as a whole and not at some detached portion thereof.” Hill, 106 R.I. at 47, 256 A.2d at 15. This is true especially when the contract provisions are so closely linked by their appearance together, one after the other, in Section 14.3 “Conciliation; Arbitration.” Their proximity to one another in the same section of', '-7- the Lease leads us to the inevitable conclusion that the two provisions “are associated with and take color from each other[.]” Industrial National Bank v. Sefsick, 92 R.I. 93, 100, 166 A.2d 417, 421 (1961). For the reasons expanded upon below, when Section 14.3 “Conciliation; Arbitration” is read as a whole, as it must be, it is apparent that the conciliation and arbitration provisions create a seamless two-step dispute resolution process, rather than two mutually exclusive processes pertaining to separate issues.', 'Consequently, we do not agree with the analysis of the hearing justice. This is so because the two contractual clauses can reasonably be construed so as to avoid conflict with one another, thus making the specific-over-general rule inapplicable. Park, 844 A.2d at 694. We will not apply the canon to create a conflict.', 'The conciliation clause, Section 14.3.1, requires the parties to attempt an amicable resolution of “any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Lease or with respect to any breach hereof[.]” The Lease describes the contemplated conciliation process as “mutual discussions to be initiated by written notice by the aggrieved party to the other party[,]” which “may be conducted over the telephone, or at a meeting, or meetings, held at the principal offices of Landlord or Tenant or at such other location as the parties may agree.” In short, the conciliation clause does no more than obligate the parties to engage in frank and good faith discussions in an effort to hash out their differences before resorting to a third party to resolve them.', 'However, should those amicable discussions fail to resolve the “controversy, claim or dispute,” the Lease provides the next step in the very next subsection. Section 14.3.2, the arbitration clause, begins with the following dependent clause:', '“If the parties fail to resolve any such controversy, claim or dispute', 'by amicable arrangement and compromise within the thirty (30)', '-8-', 'day period immediately following the date of the notice initiating', 'such discussions referred to in subsection (a) [sic] above * * *.”', 'The use of the word “such” in that dependent clause clearly refers back to the immediately preceding conciliation clause. The word “such” is an adjective defined by Black’s Law Dictionary as “That or those; having just been mentioned.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1661 (10th ed. 2014). In line with that definition, “[t]he word ‘such,’ when used in a contract or statute, must, in order to be intelligible, refer to some antecedent, and will generally be construed to refer to the last antecedent in the context[.]” American Smelting and Refining Company v. Stettenheim, 164 N.Y.S. 253, 256 (N.Y. App. Div. 1917).', 'Accordingly, the phrase “such controversy, claim or dispute” in the arbitration clause must refer to some antecedent. As this is the first appearance of the phrase “controversy, claim or dispute” in Section 14.3.2, we must cast our eyes to the preceding Section 14.3.1 to find that antecedent, and the only one we find is “any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Lease or with respect to any breach hereof[.]” 5', 'Therefore, we are driven to the conclusion that, by using the adjective “such” in the arbitration clause to describe “controversy, claim or dispute,” the drafters of the Lease intended the arbitration clause to be read in conjunction with the immediately preceding conciliation clause, and the two are not irreconcilable. Read as a whole, Section 14.3 provides that any “controversy, claim or dispute,” including claims of alleged breaches of the Lease, are to be 5', 'Even if the two clauses contemplated separate dispute resolution processes, the use of the word “such” to refer to the controversies, claims, or disputes in the conciliation clause also incorporates the modifying phrase “arising out of or relating to this Lease or with respect to any breach hereof” into the arbitration clause. Thus, the scopes of the conciliation and arbitration clauses are identical and, therefore, even if a conflict existed, the specific-over-general rule would be of little help in resolving a conflict between the two clauses.', '-9- arbitrated pursuant to Section 14.3.2, provided that the parties have attempted, and failed, to resolve those disputes through amicable mutual discussions, as contemplated in Section 14.3.1.', '2', 'Landlord’s Reservation of Rights and Remedies', 'The plaintiffs also argue that the arbitration clause is neither “exclusive, nor mandatory, nor ‘clearly written and expressed’” because Article X of the Lease provides for specific remedies in the event of several defined “Events of Default.” Specifically, Section 10.2, entitled “Remedies,” contains the following language:', '“10.2.1 Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Landlord', 'may terminate this Lease upon thirty (30) days written notice to', 'Tenant and, in addition to any right or remedy set forth herein,', 'shall have all rights and remedies allowed at law or in equity or by', 'statute or otherwise.” The plaintiffs argue that, even if the arbitration clause in Section 14.3.2 provides for arbitration in the case of a breach of the Lease, the language in Section 10.2.1 gives them an additional, or alternative, option of pursuing litigation at their election.', 'To support their argument, plaintiffs rely on our decision in AVCORR Management, LLC, where the Central Falls Detention Facility Corporation disputed claims for certain fees allegedly owed for administrative services that had been performed by AVCORR. AVCORR Management, LLC, 41 A.3d at 1009. The Detention Facility argued that “only some, but not all, of the fees were subject to binding arbitration” pursuant to the parties’ agreement. Id. at 1008. The only imputation of arbitration in that agreement said, in Section (a), that: “The parties shall attempt to resolve any dispute over [AVCORR’s] invoice through negotiation; however, either party may demand binding arbitration to resolve said disputes.” Id. at 1009. It is true that elsewhere in the agreement, in language similar to that of the Lease in this case, the parties agreed that “the non-', '- 10 - defaulting party shall have the right to pursue any right or remedy it may have available to it at law or in equity[.]” Id. Of the utmost importance to our decision in that case, however, was that the parties had specifically “consented to the jurisdiction of Rhode Island courts ‘relative to any dispute arising out of [the] [a]greement[.]’”', 'Id. at 1012.', 'We held that those additional provisions evinced the parties’ intent to litigate all disputes except those specifically mentioned in Section (a) of the parties’ agreement. Id.', 'In our opinion, AVCORR is distinguishable from the case before us now. Although it is true that we held in AVCORR that the parties’ intent to arbitrate only a subset of issues was “further elucidated” by language reserving rights and remedies, we did so only in the context of the agreement’s remarkably limited arbitration language and the parties’ explicit consent to the jurisdiction of Rhode Island courts with regard to any disputes arising from the agreement. AVCORR Management, LLC, 41 A.3d at 1012. The Lease in this case has no such language. Moreover, when considering general arbitration clauses, other jurisdictions have held that a reservation of rights and remedies clause does no more than furnish an arbitrator with the full spectrum of remedies allowed at law.', 'For example, in Robert Bosch Corp. v. ASC Inc., 195 Fed. App’x. 503 (6th Cir. 2006), the Sixth Circuit held that a reservation of rights and remedies in certain purchase orders had no effect on the arbitration provision in the price quotes. Robert Bosch Corp., 195 Fed. App’x. at 507. In that case, Bosch provided price quotes for certain automobile parts to ASC. Id. at 504. The quotes incorporated Bosch’s standard terms and conditions, including an arbitration clause that required binding arbitration of “[a]ll disputes between the parties arising out of or related to this agreement or the breach, alleged breach or interpretation thereof[.]” Id. at 507. In response to the quote, ASC sent Bosch several purchase orders containing the following language: “All', '- 11 - rights and remedies are reserved to ASC in this Order and they shall be considered to be cumulative and in addition to all other rights or further remedies as provided by law or equity that is not specifically covered or mentioned in these conditions.” Id. at 504, 507. After concluding that the additional terms in ASC’s purchase orders were included in the parties’ agreement under Michigan’s codification of U.C.C. § 2-207, the Sixth Circuit said:', '“We believe that ‘rights and remedies’ does not cover the right to', 'judicial fora. * * * We read ‘rights and remedies’ as it is', 'objectively understood to refer to those privileges and claims for', 'redress governing the relationship of the parties ‘by virtue of the', 'contract’s provisions.’ Thus, ‘rights’ refers to those privileges that', 'are concomitant to the duties the parties owe under the contract,', 'and ‘remedies’ refers to redress for a breach of those rights.” Id. at', '507 (citations omitted).', 'Similarly, in Dixon v. Perry & Slesnick, P.C., 914 N.E.2d 97 (Mass. App. Ct. 2009), the Massachusetts Appeals Court held that a reservation of rights clause did not render a separate arbitration provision ambiguous and unenforceable. Dixon, 914 N.E.2d at 103. The clause at issue read: “All rights and remedies of each Party under this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to all other rights and remedies which may be available to that Party from time to time, whether under any other agreement, at law, or in equity.” Id. The court held that the reservation of rights and remedies clause acknowledged the possibility that the parties might wish to pursue non-contract causes of action in addition to those arising out of their agreement, but did not “exempt these claims from the arbitration clause.”', 'Id.; see also Dlorah, Inc. v. KLE Construction, LLC, 2017 WL 3034259, at *6, *7 (D.S.D. 2017) (agreeing with the defendant’s argument that cumulative remedies provision “merely reserves all rights and remedies, whether in law or equity, which may be pursued if negotiations fail” and “does not speak to the method of dispute resolution”); Laughton v. CGI Technologies and Solutions, Inc., 602 F. Supp. 2d 262, 265 (D. Mass. 2009) (“The correct reading of the Arbitration and Cumulative Remedies', '- 12 - provisions is that arbitration is mandatory, but ‘the arbitrator is not limited to awarding certain remedies but rather may award all remedies provided for at law.’”) (quoting Morse v. Sir Speedy, Inc., 1997 WL 724434, at *2 (D. Mass. 1997)).', 'We believe these cases to be persuasive, given the language used in this type of provision.', 'In the case before us, Section 10.2.1 of the Lease simply reserves “rights and remedies.” Examining the actual words used, we conclude that, like the cases cited above, the reservation of “rights and remedies” does little more than empower an arbitrator to award the full measure of remedies allowed at law.', 'The word “remedies” refers only to the redress available for plaintiffs’ grievance, whether that be damages at law or an equitable remedy, such as specific performance. It does not refer to the forum for achieving that redress. See Robert Bosch Corp., 195 Fed. App’x. at 507. On the other hand, the word “rights” conceivably could be construed to include the methods of achieving redress, if the word had appeared alone and divorced from the word “remedies.” However, the word “rights” was not used by itself in the Lease, but rather it appeared in conjunction with the word “remedies” within a section of the Lease entitled “Remedies.” We can only conclude that, at least in this context, the word “‘rights’ refers to those privileges that are concomitant to the duties the parties owe under the contract[.]” Id.', 'Taken together, it is our opinion that the phrase “rights and remedies” in the Lease refers only to the redress available to a party aggrieved by the breach of his rights under the agreement; it does not refer to the forum for achieving that redress. See Robert Bosch Corp., 195 Fed. App’x. at 507. In other words, Section 10.2, “Remedies,” provides only that “the arbitrator is not', '- 13 - limited to awarding certain remedies but rather may award all remedies provided for at law.” 6 Laughton, 602 F. Supp. 2d at 265 (quoting Morse, 1997 WL 724434, at *2). In any event, even if Section 10.2 did cast a sliver of doubt on the parties’ intent to arbitrate their disputes—and we do not believe that it does—this Court has faithfully followed the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court in “resolving any doubt in favor of arbitration.” School Committee of Town of North Kingstown, 808 A.2d at 1078 (quoting Brown, 460 A.2d at 10); see United Steelworkers of America v. Enterprise Wheel and Car Corp., 363 U.S. 593, 596 (1960); United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior and Gulf Navigation Company, 363 U.S. 574, 582 (1960); United Steelworkers of America v. American Manufacturing Company, 363 U.S. 564, 567-68 (1960).', '3', 'Conciliation', 'Having deduced the parties’ intent to refer “any controversy, claim or dispute” to arbitration in the event their efforts to amicably resolve those disagreements through conciliation have failed, the germane question becomes whether the parties did in fact pursue conciliation as required by Section 14.3.1 of the Lease.

Here, again, the parties used the phrase “right or remedy” to refer to the redress available, not the method of achieving that redress. Of particular note is that Section 14.3.2 specifies that arbitration is to be conducted in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Those rules provide arbitrators with the authority to order equitable remedies, including, but not limited to, specific performance.

Although it is true that this Court adheres to “a policy in favor of resolving any doubt in favor of arbitration[,]” School Committee of the Town of North Kingstown v. Crouch, 808 A.2d 1074, 1078 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Brown v. Amaral, 460 A.2d 7, 10 (R.I. 1983)), it is also true that “[a]rbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.” Id. (quoting AT&T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of America, 475 U.S. 643, 648 (1986)). In considering the Lease at issue in this case in its entirety, as we must, I believe that the parties intended to exclude from the arbitration clause disputes relating to an alleged breach of the agreement. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.', 'As the majority notes, Section 14.3.1 of the Lease provides a mechanism for the conciliation of “any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Lease or with respect to any breach hereof[.]” Section 14.3.2 follows with a requirement that “[i]f the parties fail to resolve any such controversy, claim or dispute by amicable arrangement[,]” then “the aggrieved party shall submit the controversy, claim or dispute to arbitration * * *.”', '- 15 -', 'What are we to make, however, of the conspicuous absence from the latter clause of the language “or with respect to any breach hereof[?]” The majority posits that the word “such” in Section 14.3.2 is sufficient to bring the entire antecedent phrase “any controversy, claim or dispute arising out of or relating to this Lease with respect to any breach hereof” under this umbrella of the arbitration clause—a perfectly reasonable proposition, I should think, were it not for other provisions of the Lease.', 'Article X of the Lease spells out a number of occurrences that “shall constitute an event of default” and provides remedies for such defaults. Significantly, Section 10.1.3 designates as an event of default: “Tenant shall have abandoned the Building or Premises[,]” and Section 10.1.6 designates as an event of default: “Tenant shall fail to commence construction of the Building within twelve (12) months of the date hereof or shall fail to complete the building within thirty (30) months after commencing construction of the same.” The dispute at the heart of plaintiff’s complaint in the present case is defendant’s alleged failure to complete construction of the building within thirty months and its abandonment of the partially completed structure. In the event of default, Section 10.2.1 allows plaintiff to terminate the Lease upon thirty days written notice to defendant and, “in addition to any right or remedy set forth [in the Lease],” plaintiff “shall have all rights and remedies allowed at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise.”', 'In my opinion, the sweeping language of this provision, reserving to the plaintiff all rights and remedies at law or in equity, is broad enough to encompass recourse to the courts in the event of a default or breach of the Lease. It convinces me that the parties did not explicitly agree to arbitrate issues related to the defendant’s breach of contract. “[A] duty to arbitrate a dispute arises only when a party agrees to arbitration in clear and unequivocal language; and,', '- 16 - even then, the party is only obligated to arbitrate issues that it explicitly agreed to arbitrate.” Weeks v. 735 Putnam Pike Operations, LLC, 85 A.3d 1147, 1152 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State Department of Corrections v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 866 A.2d 1241, 1247 (R.I. 2005)). On the contrary, the Lease provides in Section 10.2.1 that the plaintiff “shall have all rights and remedies allowed at law or in equity[,]” specifically, in Sections 10.1.3 and 10.1.6, in the event that the defendant abandons the premises and/or fails to complete construction within thirty months.', 'I believe the hearing justice was correct to deny the defendant’s motion to stay litigation in favor of arbitration.

63,Thomas Shannahan et al. : v. : Charles D. Moreau et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. In this action, which involves various allegations against Charles D. Moreau (Moreau), the former mayor of the City of Central Falls, the plaintiffs, Thomas Shannahan (Shannahan), Thomas Wilson (Wilson), Donald D. Twohig (Donald D.), and the Estate of Donald P. Twohig (Donald P.) (collectively plaintiffs),1 appeal from the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, The Rhode Island Interlocal Risk Management Trust (the Trust).2', 'This matter came before the Court on January 15, 2019, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Because two of the plaintiffs in this case are named “Donald Twohig,” we will refer to each by their first name and middle initial. No disrespect is intended. 2', 'Pursuant to a consent order entered in 2013, Moreau was dismissed from this case. Additionally, pursuant to that order, the insurer for the City of Central Falls, The Rhode Island Interlocal Risk Management Trust, was substituted as a party defendant for the city. The Trust is the only remaining defendant in this case.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Today we close the book on what was a sad and scandal-plagued chapter in the history of the City of Central Falls (the city or Central Falls). The facts of this litigation, which has persisted for over fifteen years, are as follows. In 2003, Moreau ran as a candidate for mayor of Central Falls against the then-incumbent mayor, Lee Matthews (Matthews).', 'During his campaign, Moreau stated several times that, should he win, he would seek to remove Wilson from Wilson’s position as the chief of the Central Falls Police Department.3 Moreau also became aware that plaintiffs had, in one form or another, supported Matthews’ re-election efforts.4 Eventually, the campaign culminated in a victory for Moreau in November 2003, and he was sworn in as the mayor of the city on January 5, 2004. Prior to Moreau taking office, however, in December 2003, in response to Moreau’s previous threats, Wilson filed for injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island (the District Court) to prevent Moreau from removing him from his position. See Wilson v. Moreau, 440 F. Supp. 2d 81, 86 (D.R.I. 2006). In a stipulation entered in that case on December 19, 2003, the parties agreed that “the [District Court] case would be held in abeyance for 120 days, at which point the case would be dismissed without prejudice if Moreau had not taken any adverse employment action against Wilson during that time period.” Id. 3', 'Wilson, who was appointed to the position of chief of police by Matthews in 2003, was the former deputy chief of police in the City of Warwick. In the October 30, 2003 edition of The Pawtucket Times, Moreau was quoted as stating: “Chief Wilson is a great guy, but I’d replace him and it wouldn’t be hard because he’s working without a contract”; “We need to address the problems better”; and “[Wilson] leaves every day at 4 p.m. and heads home to Warwick, so while people are being beat up on Broad and Dexter streets at night, he’s on the couch. Why was he even hired?” Wilson v. Moreau, 440 F. Supp. 2d 81, 86 (D.R.I. 2006). 4', 'Plaintiffs also claim that Moreau requested Shannahan’s support during the campaign and that Shannahan refused.', '-2-', 'During the first few months of his troubled tenure, Moreau’s relationship with Wilson was tense. See Wilson, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 86. On several occasions, Moreau, in his capacity as the city public safety director, called meetings with Wilson’s subordinates without including Wilson. Id.', 'In March 2004, Moreau suspended Wilson, without pay, for insubordination, publicly citing Wilson’s abuse of vacation and leave time as the rationale for such suspension. Id. at 87. Moreau was quoted in several newspapers at the time regarding this incident, faulting Wilson for attending out-of-state conferences in Kansas and Connecticut without permission from the city.5 Id. at 86-87. Later, Moreau ordered Wilson to bring his city-owned vehicle to city hall because Moreau wanted to trade vehicles with him. Id. at 87. Upon Wilson’s arrival, Moreau took possession of Wilson’s car and told Wilson that his replacement car was not yet ready. Id. Wilson eventually received another vehicle—“a rusted old car.” Id.', 'While in office, Moreau also engaged in public spats with Shannahan, Donald P., and Donald D. See Wilson, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 87-88. Shannahan and Donald D. were city employees working at the Adams Library in Central Falls,6 as a librarian and a systems administrator, respectively; Donald P. was not an employee of the city, but he worked at the library as an independent contractor. Id. at 87, 88. In January 2004, the city stopped all payments to Donald P. for seven weeks, due to his purported failure to obtain the proper registration card and insurance. Id. at 87. Donald P. alleges that Moreau had also placed a padlock on a shed near the library where Donald P. had kept his work tools.7 Around that same time, without informing Wilson, Moreau ordered a police investigation into the larceny of certain blank checks from Donald P.’s home in Smithfield, Rhode Island, despite the fact that the Smithfield police had 5', 'Wilson claimed that he had obtained approval from the Moreau administration to attend these conferences. 6', 'The Adams Library is a privately owned building that is staffed by city employees. 7', 'This alleged act forms the basis of Donald P.’s conversion claim in Count VII of the complaint.', '-3- already concluded that Donald P. was the victim of that crime. Id. at 88. Moreau also publicly questioned the library’s payment of nearly $400,000 to Donald P. for non-bid work over a six- year period, and Moreau was quoted in the April 22, 2004 edition of The Pawtucket Times as stating: “Tom Shannahan has done a great job, but it appears the purchasing procedure has been circumvented. We’re bringing that to light. Policies have to be followed.” Id. at 87, 112.', 'On April 12, 2004, citing the poor treatment of his staff under the Moreau administration, Shannahan announced that he would be stepping down from his position as librarian of the Adams Library at the end of that month. Wilson, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 88. Then, on April 20, 2004, acting on a tip from a former mayor of Central Falls that Matthews had run his campaign out of the Adams Library, Moreau ordered the police department to conduct a search of the library. Id. During this search, the police focused their efforts on Donald D.’s computer, even going so far as to delve into his personal email account.8 Id. When Shannahan contacted Wilson to find out what was going on, Wilson replied that he had not been informed of the raid. Id. at 89. For his part, Wilson, as chief of police, sought a determination from the Rhode Island Department of the Attorney General regarding whether the raid was legal. Id. After being informed that there was no basis for a criminal investigation and finding no evidence of criminality, and despite orders from Moreau to the contrary, Wilson declined to pursue the library investigation further. Id.', 'Eventually, in early May 2004, Moreau sent a letter to Wilson explaining that Moreau was considering removing Wilson from his position as chief of police because of Wilson’s failure to investigate alleged violations of the city charter at the Adams Library. Wilson, 440 F. 8', 'In an article that ran in The Pawtucket Times on April 22, 2004, Moreau stated that the police had found materials supporting Matthews on the computer and that Moreau’s legal team was conducting an investigation into the matter. The article read, in part: “[Detective] Brayall, Moreau said, pulled three documents from [Donald D.’s] files in [Donald D.’s] computer, all of them letters written for the Matthews campaign. Several hours later, those files were gone from the computer, Moreau said.”', '-4- Supp. 2d at 89. In response, Wilson obtained a temporary restraining order from the District Court to delay any action in this regard, which led Moreau to suspend Wilson, with pay, for an indefinite period of time.9 Id. at 89-90. On May 12, 2004, Wilson resigned in light of his ongoing contentious relationship with Moreau. Id. at 90.', 'On May 24, 2004, Wilson amended his complaint in the District Court to include Shannahan, Donald P., and Donald D. as plaintiffs. Wilson, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 90.', 'The complaint alleged twelve counts, including constitutional claims for violations of the right to substantive and procedural due process and to equal protection, violations of the Charter of the City of Central Falls, and claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Id. at 90, 92, 93, 101, 108-09, 110, 111. The plaintiffs also brought Rhode Island state law claims for defamation, invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and computer trespass. Id. at 111. After the grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants on several counts, only two federal claims brought by Donald P. and Donald D., as well as the state law claim for computer trespass by Donald D., survived. Id. at 117. However, the remaining federal claims were then resolved in favor of the defendants at or after trial. Wilson v. Moreau, 492 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 2007). Because the federal claims by Wilson and Shannahan did not withstand summary judgment review, the District Court declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over their claims brought under state law, dismissing them without prejudice. Wilson, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 111-12. The District Court judgment became final after the First Circuit heard and denied plaintiffs’ appeal on June 29, 2007. Wilson, 492 F.3d at 54. 9', 'The city had also scheduled a pre-termination hearing for Wilson, which did not take place; a hearing in the District Court was scheduled on a preliminary injunction, but Wilson resigned and that hearing was canceled. Wilson, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 90.', '-5-', 'After the dust had settled following the resolution of the federal case, plaintiffs filed the instant action in Providence County Superior Court on October 26, 2007. The complaint, which was subsequently amended, alleged seven causes of action against Moreau and the city under Rhode Island state law: defamation (Count I); invasion of privacy based on false light and public disclosure of private facts (Count II); intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress (Count III); intentional interference with contract/economic advantage (Count IV); invasion of privacy based on intrusion upon privacy and seclusion (Count V); civil conspiracy (Count VI); and conversion (Count VII).10', 'The city filed for bankruptcy in 2011, and a state-appointed receiver was designated to oversee the city’s finances. Later, in September 2013, the Superior Court entered a consent order dismissing Moreau as a party defendant and substituting the Trust as defendant on behalf of the city, leaving “the City of Central Falls, through [t]he Trust as a substituted Defendant * * * the only remaining Defendant in the action[.]” The consent order also stated that the Trust would retain “all defenses that would have been available to the [city], both statutorily and otherwise[.]”', 'On February 26, 2016, the Trust filed two motions for summary judgment, one pertaining to the old claims, while the other focused on the new claims.11 In opposition to the motions, plaintiffs submitted fourteen volumes of depositions, along with a memorandum of law in 10', 'The parties refer to the first three counts (for defamation, invasion of privacy, and intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress) as “the old claims” because they had first been brought in federal court in 2004. In the instant case, these claims were brought solely by Wilson and Shannahan, as Donald P. and Donald D. had these causes of action fully adjudicated in federal court. For ease of reference, we will similarly refer herein to Counts I through III collectively as “the old claims.” Counts IV, V, and VI (for interference with contract, invasion of privacy and conspiracy) were brought by all plaintiffs. Count VII (for conversion) was brought exclusively by Donald P. The parties refer to Counts IV through VII, collectively, as “the new claims” because these claims were not brought in federal court. For ease of reference, we will similarly refer to Counts IV through VII collectively as “the new claims.” 11', 'The Trust explained that this was done in order to aid the hearing justice in managing the numerous claims involved.', '-6- support of their opposition.', 'A hearing on the summary-judgment motions was held on December 1, 2016. The Trust first argued that the new claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata or, in the alternative, that they were barred by the statute of limitations for tort actions against cities and towns contained in G.L. 1956 § 9-1-25.12 The Trust asserted that it had not waived the statute of limitations defense because the Trust had raised the defense in its answers to both the original and amended complaints in Superior Court and had pressed the statute of limitations issue prior to trial.', 'With regard to the old claims, the Trust first averred in support of summary judgment that plaintiffs had not put forth any admissible evidence that Moreau had committed the alleged torts within the scope of his employment with the city. The Trust further contended that these acts, as alleged by plaintiffs, were born out of a “personal political vendetta” propagated by Moreau and therefore could not be imputed to the city. Turning to plaintiffs’ claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress, the Trust argued that plaintiffs did not fall into either of the two classes of persons who may maintain a cause of action for that tort. On the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the Trust averred that plaintiffs had failed to prove that Moreau’s conduct was extreme and outrageous. The Trust next asserted that the defamation claims failed as a matter of law because: (1) plaintiffs failed to submit admissible evidence in support of the 12', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-1-25 provides:', '“When a claimant is given the right to sue the state of Rhode', 'Island, any political subdivision of the state, or any city or town by', 'a special act of the general assembly, or in cases involving actions', 'or claims in tort against the state or any political subdivision', 'thereof or any city or town, the action shall be instituted within', 'three (3) years from the effective date of the special act, or within', 'three (3) years of the accrual of any claim of tort. Failure to', 'institute suit within the three (3) year period shall constitute a bar', 'to the bringing of the legal action.”', '-7- claims; (2) the statements were not false or defamatory; (3) some of the statements were made before Moreau was inaugurated; (4) plaintiffs were public figures; and (5) Moreau was entitled to absolute and qualified privilege.', 'The plaintiffs replied, in opposition to summary judgment, that the Trust’s statute-of- limitations and res judicata arguments should have been litigated at an earlier time, and that summary judgment was not appropriate at that moment. While being peppered with questions from the hearing justice, plaintiffs proclaimed that the statute-of-limitations defense had been waived because, even though the limitations defense had been included in defendants’ answers to plaintiffs’ original and amended complaints, the city had not pressed the defense during the entirety of the case.13 The plaintiffs then claimed that, even if not required by the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, the Trust should have included an undisputed statement of facts with its motions for summary judgment. The hearing justice replied, stating that it was plaintiffs’ burden to show an issue of material fact and that all that plaintiffs had offered was “a stack of depositions about two-feet high with a memo that said because this case is so complicated, summary judgment should not issue.” The plaintiffs replied that the depositions of Moreau and the newspaper articles, as a whole, created issues of material fact; but, when pressed, they could not recite which portions of those documents supported their claims.14 Furthermore, plaintiffs claimed that Moreau’s statements and actions were made in the course of his employment because, as mayor, he set the policy of the city. In conclusion, plaintiffs requested that the court 13', 'The plaintiffs’ attorney admitted that the new claims “stand on a weaker legal foundation than the first ones” with regard to the statute of limitations. 14', 'The plaintiffs’ counsel also seemed to concede at the hearing that the newspaper articles that plaintiffs had submitted in support of their opposition to the Trust’s motions for summary judgment were precluded under the hearsay rule.', '-8- look at the totality of the evidence to find that genuine issues of material fact existed as to their claims.', 'The hearing justice issued a bench decision on August 1, 2017.15 The hearing justice first noted that plaintiffs had simply offered a blanket objection to the motions for summary judgment, in which they stated generally that there were genuine issues of material fact that should prevent the entry of summary judgment. The hearing justice found at the outset that plaintiffs’ lack of objection alone provided a basis for her to grant summary judgment, but she nevertheless reviewed the substance of the motions. In doing so, she went on to decide each of plaintiffs’ claims individually. The hearing justice determined that the new claims of Donald P. and Donald D. in Counts IV through VII were barred by res judicata because the federal courts had fully adjudicated the claims by those plaintiffs, and the new claims could have been brought by Donald P. and Donald D. in the federal case but were not. However, she decided that the claims brought by Wilson and Shannahan were not barred by res judicata, because the District Court had dismissed their claims without prejudice.', 'The hearing justice next turned to the Trust’s statute-of-limitations argument. She stated that the old claims of Wilson and Shannahan were timely because the statute of limitations was tolled during the pendency of the District Court litigation. Nevertheless, the hearing justice noted that there was no tolling for their new claims, Counts IV through VI. Next, the hearing justice reviewed the new claims and determined that the last actionable event (Donald D.’s termination) occurred on August 10, 2004, and that, therefore, the statute of limitations under § 9-1-25 had run on August 10, 2007. She concluded that, because they had not filed their action 15', 'While it appears from a review of the dockets in this case that a transcript of the August 1, 2017 bench decision was not filed in the Superior Court or in this Court, a copy was appended to plaintiffs’ brief.', '-9- until October 26, 2007, the new claims by Wilson and Shannahan were barred by the statute of limitations.', 'The hearing justice indicated that the discovery materials that plaintiffs had provided demonstrated that Moreau may have been acting within the scope of his employment with the city. Even though the hearing justice noted that it was plaintiffs’ obligation to draw the hearing justice’s attention to specific evidence to counter the Trust’s motions for summary judgment, she performed an exhaustive review of the fifty-one newspaper articles, as well as a cable television program transcript, that plaintiffs had submitted along with their memorandum in support of their objection to the motions for summary judgment. She found that twelve of the articles referred to statements that Moreau had made before his inauguration, all of which therefore could not be imputed to the city. The hearing justice concluded, after looking at the alleged defamatory statements that occurred during Moreau’s tenure as mayor that, as a matter of law, none qualified as being defamatory. She also reasoned that Moreau had qualified immunity when he made those statements because they were all regarding matters of public concern. The hearing justice noted that plaintiffs had failed to meet their burden of establishing that Moreau had acted with malice, which was a requirement to overcoming the qualified privilege that Moreau enjoyed. Because she determined that none of Moreau’s statements could be construed as defamatory, the hearing justice granted the Trust’s summary-judgment motion as to Count I.', 'The hearing justice likewise granted summary judgment as to Count II because plaintiffs had not demonstrated a material issue of fact as to how Moreau had placed them in a false light. The hearing justice further decided that summary judgment was also appropriate as to Count III. She found that the claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress was unavailing because Wilson and Shannahan were not within the two classes of persons who may maintain an action', '- 10 - for that tort under Rhode Island law. Furthermore, the hearing justice reasoned that Wilson and Shannahan could not recover on a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress because they had not proven that Moreau’s conduct went beyond the bounds of conduct tolerated in a civilized society and also because plaintiffs had not alleged physical injury.', 'On September 6, 2017, an order entered granting summary judgment in favor of the Trust on all counts, and final judgment entered in favor of the Trust. The plaintiffs timely appealed to this Court on September 25, 2017.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“A motion for summary judgment ‘is designed to decide in an expeditious fashion cases presenting groundless claims.’” Hexagon Holdings, Inc. v. Carlisle Syntec Incorporated, 199 A.3d 1034, 1038 (R.I. 2019) (deletion omitted) (quoting Gallo v. National Nursing Homes, Inc., 106 R.I. 485, 487, 261 A.2d 19, 21 (1970)). “When we review a hearing justice’s grant of a motion for summary judgment, we conduct our analysis de novo.” Id. “If we determine that ‘there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law,’ then we will affirm the grant of the motion.” Id.

State, 81 A.3d 1106, 1109 (R.I. 2014)). “However, once the moving party establishes ‘the absence of a material factual issue, the party opposing the motion has an affirmative duty to establish either by affidavit or by other means the material issue of fact to be decided.’” Id. (quoting Grissom v. Pawtucket Trust Co., 559 A.2d 1065, 1066 (R.I. 1989)). “The party opposing the motion cannot establish a genuine', '- 11 - issue of fact merely by resting on denials in its pleadings. Id. Rather, the opposing party must ‘respond with specific facts that would constitute a genuine issue for trial.’” Id. (quoting Volino v. General Dynamics, 539 A.2d 531, 533 (R.I. 1988)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'In their papers to this Court, plaintiffs aver that “there are numerous facts alleged and denied by the Trust which demand adjudication[,]” but they do not direct our attention to what those facts might be. The plaintiffs’ first and overriding contention for overturning the hearing justice’s decision is their assertion that the complexity of this case precluded consideration of the Trust’s motions for summary judgment. While we agree that this case does display a certain level of complexity—with four plaintiffs and twenty-two claims—we find this argument to be without merit.', 'In Kirshenbaum v. Fidelity Federal Bank, F.S.B., 941 A.2d 213 (R.I. 2008), we held that “[the] plaintiff’s contention that summary judgment was inappropriate because the facts are ‘ridiculously convoluted’ is utterly devoid of merit.” Kirshenbaum, 941 A.2d at 218 (footnote omitted). There, we explained that', '“[t]he very nature of our judicial system requires courts to confront', 'cases that touch on virtually every aspect of our society; and, in so', 'doing, judges often must deal with extremely difficult and intricate', 'factual questions. There is no necessary correlation between the', '‘convoluted’ nature vel non of a case’s factual background and the', 'appropriateness of disposition pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior', 'Court Rules of Civil Procedure. It is the duty of the courts, when', 'presented with a motion for summary judgment, to determine', 'whether or not material issues of fact remain to be resolved, and, if', 'not, whether judgment should be granted as a matter of law. As a', 'perusal of decided cases reveals, that duty can be (and often is)', 'carried out even when the factual background is ‘convoluted.’” Id.', '(internal citations omitted).', '- 12 - Accordingly, we hold that the complex nature of the case at bar alone did not preclude the hearing justice from considering the Trust’s summary-judgment motions.', 'Next, plaintiffs argue that the hearing justice erred in rendering a decision while biased. This argument is similarly without merit because plaintiffs “neither moved for recusal nor raised the alleged issue of bias on the record * * *.” Huntley v. State, 109 A.3d 869, 874 (R.I. 2015). Thus, under this Court’s well-settled raise-or-waive rule, we deem this argument waived.16 See id.', 'A', 'The New Claims', '1', 'Res Judicata', 'We now address plaintiffs’ contention that summary judgment was not appropriately granted in this case. We deal first with the preclusive effect of the District Court judgment in Wilson with respect to plaintiffs’ new claims in Counts IV through VII.17 Under Rhode Island law, claim preclusion, or res judicata, “serves as a bar to a second cause of action where there exist: (1) identity of parties; (2) identity of issues; and (3) finality of judgment in an earlier action.” Goodrow v. Bank of America, N.A., 184 A.3d 1121, 1126 (R.I. 2018) (quoting Torrado Architects v. Rhode Island Department of Human Services, 102 A.3d 655, 658 (R.I. 2014)). 16', 'In any event, we are satisfied that the hearing justice was not at all biased in rendering her decision. At worst, the hearing justice was frustrated at counsel’s inability to point to specific evidence in the record to support the denial of the motions for summary judgment. However, the hearing justice clearly scoured the record to find triable issues of fact to aid plaintiffs—as evidenced by her thorough decision, which spanned forty-two transcript pages. 17', 'Although plaintiffs’ counsel seemed to concede at oral argument before this Court that res judicata barred the new claims of Donald P. and Donald D., we shall nonetheless conduct our own review to give their claims in Counts IV through VII due consideration.', '- 13 -', 'First, “[d]etermining whether there is ‘identity of parties’ requires resolving ‘whether the parties to this second action are identical to or in privity with the parties involved in the prior action.’” Reynolds v. First NLC Financial Services, LLC, 81 A.3d 1111, 1115 (R.I. 2014) (alteration omitted) (quoting E.W. Audet & Sons, Inc. v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Co. of Newark, New Jersey, 635 A.2d 1181, 1186 (R.I. 1994)). “Privity exists where there is ‘a commonality of interests’ such that one party adequately represents the other’s interests.” Huntley v. State, 63 A.3d 526, 531 (R.I. 2013) (alteration omitted) (quoting Lennon v. Dacomed Corp., 901 A.2d 582, 591 (R.I. 2006)). Here, all four plaintiffs were involved in the federal case; therefore it is clear that there is identity of parties on the plaintiffs’ side. Additionally, while the Trust was not involved in the federal case, the Trust is in privity with the city, which was a party to the federal case, because, as the city’s insurer, the Trust is directly representing the interests of the city. Also, pursuant to the consent order entered in the Superior Court, the Trust has retained all defenses that the city would have had in the instant matter. Therefore, the first requirement for the application of res judicata, identity of the parties, is satisfied here.', 'Second, “[t]his Court has adopted the transactional rule governing the preclusive effect of the doctrine of res judicata.” Goodrow, 184 A.3d at 1127 (deletion omitted) (quoting Bossian v. Anderson, 991 A.2d 1025, 1027 (R.I. 2010)). “The transactional rule provides that all claims arising from the same transaction or series of transactions which could have properly been raised in a previous litigation are barred from a later action.” Id. (quoting Bossian, 991 A.2d at 1027). “What constitutes a transaction or a series of connected transactions is to be determined pragmatically, giving weight to such considerations as whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties’ expectations.” Id. (deletion omitted) (quoting Town of', '- 14 - Warren v. Bristol Warren Regional School District, 159 A.3d 1029, 1036 (R.I. 2017)). Here, it is clear that the new claims arose out of the same set of facts that plaintiffs relied upon when they brought the old claims in federal court—namely, Moreau’s actions during the first few months of his tenure as the mayor of Central Falls. Therefore the second requirement for res judicata, identity of the issues, is satisfied here.', '“Finally, the application of res judicata requires that there be finality of judgment in the earlier action.” Goodrow, 184 A.3d at 1128 (quoting Reynolds, 81 A.3d at 1116). Because all of the claims of Donald P. and Donald D. in the federal court resulted in a final judgment—either through the grant of a motion for summary judgment or a jury verdict in favor of the city—the third and final requirement for the application of res judicata, finality of judgment, is satisfied as to Donald P. and Donald D. Accordingly, we agree with the hearing justice’s determination that the new claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata as to Donald P. and Donald D. and that summary judgment was therefore appropriately granted as to their claims in Counts IV through VII.', 'Likewise, we agree with the hearing justice’s determination that res judicata does not bar the new claims in Counts IV through VI by Wilson and Shannahan. Although “a dismissal, with prejudice, constitutes a final judgment on the merits[,]” Goodrow, 184 A.3d at 1128 (alteration omitted), a dismissal, without prejudice, does not. In the federal court action, the District Court declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the state claims by Wilson and Shannahan because their federal claims had been disposed of by the grant of a motion for summary judgment before trial. Wilson, 440 F. Supp. 2d at 111. As the District Court stated, its dismissal of the state-law claims was without prejudice. Id. at 112. Therefore, we hold that the doctrine of res judicata does not bar the new claims by Wilson and Shannahan.', '- 15 -', '2', 'Statute of Limitations', 'Although the new claims by Wilson and Shannahan are not barred by the application of res judicata, they were not timely made. In her bench decision, the hearing justice applied § 9-1-25, which provides for a three-year statute of limitations for claims sounding in tort against a city or town in Rhode Island, to the new claims.

Burke-Wells also referenced prior projects that Rocchio had performed for the WSA, which involved conflicts regarding change orders and increased project costs above Rocchio’s original bid on those projects. In her deposition, Burke-Wells testified that her recommendation to the board was based on “[m]ainly performance and [her] concern * * * with some attention to detail, but that was not the ultimate reason.

According to the meeting minutes, Burke-Wells “concurred” and further added that “the EPA forms are important as well, and (failure to submit) disqualifies the bidder.” Another board member moved to award the contract to DiGregorio and explained that his recommendation was “based entirely on the submission of qualifying documents” and that, if the board was “going to have qualifications for bid submittal, WSA should abide by those qualifications.” The board then unanimously approved the motion to award the contract to DiGregorio.', 'On August 29, 2016, Rocchio filed the instant action in Providence County Superior Court, asserting claims against Pare for interference with prospective contractual relations (Count I); negligence (Count II); and breach of contractual obligations due to Rocchio as a third- party beneficiary of the contract between the WSA and Pare (Count III).4 Pare ultimately moved for summary judgment on all counts, arguing that the project award to DiGregorio was based on the recommendation of Burke-Wells and the vote of the WSA board. Pare maintained that it did not act in a way as to intentionally interfere with Rocchio’s prospective contractual relations, pointing out that it had no interest whatsoever in which company was ultimately awarded the bid. Pare further averred that Rocchio could not produce evidence demonstrating that Pare’s recommendation to Burke-Wells was the proximate cause of the rejection of Rocchio’s bid by the WSA, and it further argued that the economic loss doctrine barred Rocchio’s claim.

The Court answered in the affirmative and concluded that the general contractor had “directly and reasonably relied” on the site engineer’s performance and that the site engineer had a duty to the general contractor to “render its services professionally.” Id. at 1303.', 'In so holding, the Court “join[ed] ‘an emerging majority of', '-8- jurisdictions [which] have taken the position that a contractor can maintain a negligence action against an architect without direct privity of contract between the parties.’” Id.

Burman, Inc., 658 A.2d at 517 (holding that the plaintiff-purchaser of property “was neither known to nor identifiable to [the] defendant contractor” and that “[t]heir individual relationships with the original owner were wholly independent of each other * * * [so t]here was no foreseeable harm to a subsequent owner”). Here, a determination that Pare owed a duty to Rocchio under the circumstances present in this case would effectively be a determination that all engineers contracted by project owners owe a duty to all general contractors that could possibly submit a bid on any given request for proposal.

65,Sean Gannon : v. : City of Pawtucket. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Sean Gannon appeals from orders of the Superior Court relating to his motion to vacate an arbitration award issued in connection with the termination of his employment as a firefighter with the City of Pawtucket. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on November 27, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed on behalf of the parties, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Gannon was hired as a firefighter by the city in late April or early May 2013, and soon thereafter completed his training at the fire training academy. By virtue of his employment with the city as a firefighter, he became a member of the International Association of Firefighters,', '-1- Local 1261 (the union), and thus became subject to the terms and conditions enumerated in the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in effect between the city and the union. That agreement specifies that the union is the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for uniformed employees of the Fire Division of the Pawtucket Department of Public Safety, with the sole exception of the fire chief.', 'Gannon alleges that, in November 2013, the city terminated his employment without cause.', 'The union subsequently filed a grievance against the city, challenging Gannon’s termination, and the matter eventually proceeded to arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association in accordance with the procedure set forth in the CBA. After several days of hearings, the arbitrator rendered a decision on March 2, 2016, finding in favor of the city. On May 13, 2016, Gannon, in his personal and individual capacity, timely filed a motion in the Superior Court seeking to vacate the arbitration award.', 'The city moved to dismiss Gannon’s motion pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that Gannon lacked standing to challenge an arbitration award arising from a case to which he had not been a party. Before a hearing on the motion could be held, however, Gannon filed a motion on August 25, 2016 to involuntarily join the union as a necessary party under Rule 19 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. 1 The 1', 'Rule 19 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in relevant part, that:', '“A person who is subject to service of process shall be joined as a', 'party in the action if:', '“(1) In the person’s absence complete relief cannot be accorded', 'among those already parties; or', '“(2) The person claims an interest relating to the subject of the', 'action and is so situated that the disposition of the action in the', 'person’s absence may:', '-2- union objected to the joinder, arguing that Gannon could not compel the union to represent him in an action that the union had deemed to be futile. The union also expressed its apprehension about the risk of exposure to an award of attorneys’ fees, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 28-9-18(c), should a petition to vacate the award be unsuccessful. 2', 'After considering the arguments presented by the parties, the hearing justice denied Gannon’s motion to join the union as a party under Rule 19.', 'However, on September 22, 2016, the very day that the city’s motion to dismiss was to be heard, Gannon notified the court that he had reached an agreement with the union whereby the union would voluntarily join the case, notwithstanding its prior objections to joinder under Rule 19. In light of this development, the hearing justice passed the city’s motion to dismiss to allow time for the union to enter the case.', 'On February 17, 2017, Gannon moved to amend his pleading in an effort to substitute the union as a party under Rule 15 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'The city objected and renewed its motion to dismiss. The hearing justice, for reasons discussed infra, denied Gannon’s motion to substitute and granted the city’s motion to dismiss. The order memorializing those decisions was entered on June 20, 2017, and the city soon filed a motion for', '“(A) As a practical matter impair or impede the person’s ability', 'to protect that interest; or', '“(B) Leave any of the persons already parties subject to a', 'substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise', 'inconsistent obligations by reason of the person’s claimed', 'interest.” 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 28-9-18(c) provides: “If the motion to vacate, modify, or correct an arbitrator’s award is denied, the moving party shall pay the costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees of the prevailing party.”', '-3- costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, pursuant to § 28-9-18(c), which the hearing justice granted. Gannon then filed this timely appeal. 3', 'Before this Court, Gannon challenges the denial of his motion to substitute the union as the proper plaintiff, the grant of the city’s motion to dismiss Gannon’s motion to vacate the arbitration award, and the grant of the city’s motion for attorneys’ fees.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“The sole function of a motion to dismiss is to test the sufficiency of the complaint.” Narragansett Electric Company v.

Sollitto, 788 A.2d 455, 456 (R.I. 2002)). “In passing on a Rule 12(b) dismissal, this Court applies the same standard as the trial justice.” Id. at 278. “We thus are confined to the four corners of the complaint and must assume all the allegations are true, resolving any doubts in [the] plaintiff’s favor.” Id. “A motion to dismiss may be granted only ‘if it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that a plaintiff would not be entitled to relief under any conceivable set of facts.’” Id.

First, we must determine whether Gannon had standing to challenge an arbitration award to which he was a grievant, but not a party.', 'Second, we must decide, if he did not have standing, whether 3', 'Gannon appealed separately from the June 20, 2017 order granting the city’s motion to dismiss and denying Gannon’s motion to amend and the August 11, 2017 order granting the city’s motion for attorneys’ fees. The two appeals have been consolidated for the purpose of this review.', '-4- substituting the union in place of Gannon as the plaintiff, months after the statutory period for challenging the award had passed, should, under Rule 15, relate back to Gannon’s original timely motion and thus resuscitate the motion to vacate the arbitration award. We address these questions in turn before we determine the issue of attorneys’ fees.', 'A', 'Standing', 'We first address Gannon’s argument that the hearing justice erred by granting the city’s motion to dismiss his motion to vacate the arbitration award because, he contends, although the union represented his interest in the arbitration proceedings, he was the true party-in-interest in that it was his termination by the city that was at issue. When Gannon’s employment was terminated, the union, as his sole and exclusive bargaining agent, took up his grievance in arbitration proceedings with the city. After the arbitrator found in favor of the city, the union concluded, based on its assessment of the strength of the case, that a motion to vacate the award would be futile. Obviously dissatisfied with that decision, Gannon brought his own motion in Superior Court.', 'The Fire Fighters Arbitration Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 28, provides firefighters such as Gannon with “the right to bargain collectively with their respective cities or towns and be represented by a labor organization in the collective bargaining as to wages, rates of pay, hours, working conditions, and all other terms and conditions of employment.” Section 28-9.1-4. Importantly, § 28-9.1-5 makes the firefighters’ union “the sole and exclusive bargaining agent for all of the members of the city or town fire department[.]” Section 28-9.1-5. Therefore, as the hearing justice noted, although it was Gannon’s termination that was at issue in the arbitration proceedings, “it was the Union that participated in that arbitration, it was the Union that was the', '-5- party to it, and it was the Union * * * that had the right to bring this instant petition” to vacate the arbitration award.', 'In DiGuilio v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 819 A.2d 1271 (R.I. 2003), we adopted the federal rule that “without a showing that the union breached its duty of fair representation, the employee does not have any standing to contest the merits of his contract claim against the employer in court.” DiGuilio, 819 A.2d at 1273, 1274; see Hines v. Anchor Motor Freight, Inc., 424 U.S. 554, 570-71 (1976); Early v. Eastern Transfer, 699 F.2d 552, 555 (1st Cir. 1983); Harris v. Chemical Leaman Tank Lines, Inc., 437 F.2d 167, 171 (5th Cir. 1971) (per curiam). Such a showing, we have since noted, “acts as a narrow exception to the finality of a grievance decision, as governed by the collective bargaining agreement, and gives the plaintiff the right to contest his or her termination in court.” Nugent v. State Public Defender’s Office, 184 A.3d 703, 707-08 (R.I. 2018).', 'Just last term, in Nugent, we applied this rule in the context of a union member’s challenge, in her individual capacity, to an adverse arbitration award issued pursuant to a grievance brought on her behalf by her union. Nugent, 184 A.3d at 707. In that case, an employee of the Public Defender’s Office alleged that she had been improperly terminated after allegations surfaced that she had attempted to gain access to documents kept by her office in relation to the ongoing defense of an individual accused of murdering the employee’s nephew. Id. at 705. Responding to her termination, her union filed a grievance claiming the employee had been terminated without just cause. Id. The matter eventually proceeded to arbitration, after which the arbitrator found in favor of the employer. Id. Dissatisfied with this outcome, the employee, in her individual capacity, brought an action in Superior Court in an attempt to vacate', '-6- the arbitrator’s decision and reinstate her previous employment. 4 Id. We held, inter alia, that the employee had “failed to show that the union had ‘breached its duty of fair representation[,]’ and the hearing justice correctly determined that [the employee] lacked standing to challenge the arbitration decision in court.” Id. at 708 (quoting DiGuilio, 819 A.2d at 1273).', 'The posture of the case before us now is strikingly similar. As in Nugent, Gannon’s union representative, in accordance with a collective bargaining agreement with the city, challenged Gannon’s termination in arbitration proceedings. When those proceedings resulted in a decision in favor of the city, the union exercised its discretion and decided that it would not seek judicial relief by filing a motion to vacate the award. 5 Gannon nevertheless pressed ahead with his own motion. Our holdings in DiGuilio and Nugent, however, make it clear that Gannon lacked standing to do so in the absence of “a showing that the union breached its duty of fair representation[.]” Nugent, 184 A.3d at 707 (quoting DiGuilio, 819 A.2d at 1273). Gannon has made no such claim; consequently, it is our opinion that he had no individual standing to bring a motion to vacate the arbitrator’s award. 4', 'The employee in Nugent v. State Public Defender’s Office, 184 A.3d 703 (R.I. 2018), also filed a second complaint in Superior Court seeking compensatory damages and other relief based upon a claim of employment discrimination. Nugent, 184 A.3d at 706. The main thrust of our decision in that case was that the discrimination claim was not barred on the grounds of res judicata by the previous denial of the employee’s “appeal” from the arbitration award. Id. at 708. 5', 'As we said in DiGuilio v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 819 A.2d 1271 (R.I. 2003), “[a] union has no duty to arbitrate a meritless grievance, and ‘must balance and consider the legitimate interests of all its members.’” DiGuilio, 819 A.2d at 1273 (quoting Ayala v. Union de Tronquistas de Puerto Rico, Local 901, 913 F. Supp. 74, 79 (D.P.R. 1995)). It follows that a union similarly has no duty to bring what it believes to be a meritless motion to vacate an adverse arbitration award.', '-7-', 'B', 'The Motion to Amend', 'Perhaps recognizing his precarious position with respect to standing, Gannon twice attempted to add the union as a plaintiff, employing Rule 19 in a motion for joinder on August 25, 2016, and, when that was unsuccessful, Rule 15 in a motion to amend to substitute a party on February 17, 2017. Unfortunately for Gannon, these efforts cannot bear fruit. The arbitration award was issued on March 2, 2016. Therefore, to be timely, the parties to the arbitration had until June 2, 2016, a statutory period of three months, to file a motion to vacate the award. See § 28-9-21. To be sure, Gannon’s May 13, 2016 motion to vacate the award was timely, but it was fatally flawed because he lacked standing. The material question, then, is whether Gannon should be able to overcome this infirmity by amending his motion to vacate and substitute the union as movant by employing Rule 15 to relate that amendment back to the date of his original filing and thus avoid dismissal for lack of timeliness. We hold that he cannot.', 'Rule 15 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure allows a party to move the court for leave to amend its pleading. The rule makes it clear that “leave shall be freely given when justice so requires.” Super. R. Civ. P. 15(a). That said, “a number of reasons—such as undue delay, bad faith, undue prejudice to the opposing party, or, most relevant to this case, futility of the amendment—may nonetheless warrant the denial of a motion to amend.” IDC Properties, Inc. v. Goat Island South Condominium Association, Inc., 128 A.3d 383, 393 (R.I. 2015). Ultimately, the decision as to whether to allow a party to amend its pleadings rests within the discretion of the court, and leave may be denied if the amendment would be futile. Id.; see also Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962); Lomastro v. Iacovelli, 56 A.3d 92, 95 (R.I. 2012).', '-8-', 'An amendment changing or adding a plaintiff relates back to the date of the original pleading if: (1) the amendment “arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading”; (2) the defendant(s) received notice of the changed or added plaintiff such that the defendant(s) “would not be prejudiced in maintaining a defense on the merits”; and (3) the defendant(s) “[k]new or should have known that but for a mistake the action would have been brought by * * * the plaintiff * * * to be added.” Super. R. Civ. P. 15(c) (emphasis added).', 'Nothing in the record before us remotely suggests that the union’s initial decision to forego bringing an action to vacate the arbitration award was a “mistake.” Moreover, there is nothing in the record that would demonstrate that the city was aware, or should have been aware, that the failure to include the union was born of mistake. Indeed, the union declined twice to press Gannon’s cause—first when it decided not to challenge the award in Superior Court, prompting Gannon to do so himself, and later when it expressly, and forcefully, objected to Gannon’s efforts to bring it into the case. More than eleven months passed after the arbitration award was issued, and eight months went by after the statutory period of three months had long expired, before the union agreed to support Gannon’s effort to substitute the union as a plaintiff in his Rule 15 motion to amend. As the hearing justice insightfully noted: “There was nothing to suggest to the City that it was a mistake that the Union wasn’t brought in. * * * What it really amounts to is, for whatever reason, a change of heart on the Union’s position.” We agree.', 'As a result, we have no hesitation in concluding that a “change of heart” is insufficient to meet the requirements of Rule 15(c). It is our firm opinion that the hearing justice acted completely within her discretion when she denied Gannon’s motion to amend.', '-9-', 'Because Gannon did not have standing to bring this action in his individual capacity, and because the hearing justice properly denied the motion to substitute the union, it follows that the hearing justice was correct when she granted the city’s motion to dismiss Gannon’s motion to vacate the arbitration award.', 'C', 'Attorneys’ Fees', 'Finally, we address the city’s motion for attorneys’ fees. Section 28-9-18(c) provides that: “If the motion to vacate, modify, or correct an arbitrator’s award is denied, the moving party shall pay the costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees of the prevailing party.” In our view, this language leaves no room for debate—Gannon is responsible to pay the city’s reasonable attorneys’ fees.', 'Gannon contends that, because the hearing justice never reached the merits of his argument in support of vacating the arbitration award, the action was not “denied” but was instead “dismissed on procedural and jurisdictional grounds.” This averment amounts to a vacuous distinction without a difference and one that does not merit further reflection. The city’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss was granted, and Gannon’s motion to vacate the arbitrator’s award was therefore denied.', 'Gannon’s alternative argument that, because we hold that he was not a party to the arbitration proceeding he could not have been a “moving party” for the purpose of § 28-9-18(c), also lacks merit. Gannon, in his individual capacity, brought the motion to vacate the arbitration award that is currently before this Court. He was thus the “moving party.” Under the clear and unambiguous language of § 28-9-18(c), he must, therefore, “pay the costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees of the prevailing party” incurred while defending this claim.', '- 10 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.

On June 19, 2007, the defendant, Michael D’Amico, pled nolo contendere to charges brought in P1-2006-2054A and P2-2006-1662A, which included two counts of first degree robbery, one count of conspiracy, and three counts of felony assault. He was sentenced to ten years to serve for the conspiracy charge and twenty years for each robbery and assault charge, with ten years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation. All sentences were to run concurrently. 1 D’Amico now seeks review of two Superior Court judgments, entered in 2012, adjudging him to be a violator of his probation. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on November 27, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed on behalf of the parties, we conclude that cause 1', 'It appears from the record that D’Amico was released from prison in September 2011, although the basis for his release, whether on parole or at the expiration of his sentence, remains unclear.', '-1- has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgments of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Around 11:30 on the morning of November 23, 2011, Khurshid Siddiq and Edwin Cowgen were enjoying a smoke break outside a 7-Eleven convenience store on Charles Street in Providence. Siddiq, the franchisee and manager of the store, and Cowgen, a 7-Eleven “field consultant,” noticed a man wearing sweatpants and a hooded sweatshirt enter the 7-Eleven and grab a drink from the cooler. The man’s hood was pulled tightly about his face, leaving only the area between his eyebrows and upper lip visible. Siddiq later testified that, despite the man’s garb, he could see that the man had a “light moustache” and “sunken eyes.” Siddiq testified that, from inside the store, the man pointed at them and gestured for them to come inside. They did so, believing that the man was a customer. To their chagrin, however, the hooded man was not in the store to make a purchase, and he soon proclaimed his intentions with the blunt, straightforward announcement: “This is a robbery.”', 'Cowgen immediately stepped aside and told the robber that he was not an employee of the establishment. The man displayed what Siddiq and Cowgen both believed to be a handgun and demanded all the cash in the register, roughly $400, as well as some cigars and cigarettes. During the encounter, a customer approached the counter to make a purchase, but was rebuffed by the hooded character, who, according to Cowgen, told the customer, “turn the f around or I’ll rob you old man.” All told, the robbery lasted between two and four minutes, and it was recorded in its entirety from several angles by the store’s surveillance cameras.', '-2-', 'Eventually, the cowled figure concluded the heist, and Siddiq watched him on a video camera as he walked away from the store. As soon as the robber left the premises, Cowgen “hit the panic button” to call the police. When the police arrived, Cowgen and Siddiq provided statements to the responding officers, and Cowgen gave police a basic description of the culprit.', 'The Providence police officers circulated an email throughout the department containing a photograph of the unknown robber, that had been harvested from surveillance video at the 7- Eleven.', 'After two officers suggested that the hooded figure in the photograph might be D’Amico, police responded to his residence, which was, coincidentally, but a short distance from the crime scene.', 'In January 2012, the state filed a Rule 32(f) violation report in the Superior Court, alleging that D’Amico had violated the terms and conditions of his probation in the two underlying criminal cases by robbing the 7-Eleven convenience store two months earlier. 2 A two-day violation hearing was held in May 2012, at which both Siddiq and Cowgen testified for the state. Also, D’Amico presented testimony by a Providence police detective who investigated the robbery.', 'Siddiq testified that, sometime after the robbery occurred, Providence police showed him a photographic array consisting of pictures of six different individuals.', 'A photograph of D’Amico was included in the array. Siddiq said that, after he examined the photographs one by one, he circled the photograph of D’Amico, signed his name, and wrote “This is the guy who has robbed us.” He also testified that he had seen the hooded man in the store on one or two prior occasions. Siddiq also identified D’Amico, from the witness stand, as the man who had held up the store.

When asked whether Cowgen recognized D’Amico as he appeared in the courtroom, Cowgen testified that he did not. According to Cowgen, 7-Eleven employees are instructed that “you’re not suppose[d] to look into a robber’s eyes because that’s an indication that you’re being confrontational.”', 'The state also introduced several exhibits for the hearing justice’s consideration, including the six-photograph array presented to Siddiq, video surveillance that captured the robbery as it happened, and two still photographs taken from video surveillance recordings—one of the hooded robber’s body and face in profile and another of his partially obscured facial features as he faced the camera.', 'The hearing justice credited Siddiq’s identification and further opined that the photograph of the robber’s face was a “dead ringer” for D’Amico.', 'He concluded: “I have no question in my mind that the [s]tate has proved its case that Mr. D’Amico has clearly violated his terms and conditions of his suspended/probationary sentence[.]” Accordingly, the hearing justice removed the suspended portion of the sentences previously imposed for D’Amico’s 2007 conspiracy,', '-4- assault, and robbery convictions, and ordered that he serve ten years’ incarceration on the previously imposed concurrent sentences.', 'D’Amico did not appeal from the resulting judgments of conviction and commitment. Five years later, however, D’Amico filed petitions for the issuance of writs of certiorari with this Court, claiming that his attorney had failed to inform him that he had a right to appeal the violation hearing.

We afford great deference to the hearing justice’s adjudication of a probation violation, and our review of such an adjudication “is restricted to considering ‘whether the hearing justice acted arbitrarily or capriciously in finding a violation.’” Gromkiewicz, 43 A.3d at 48 (quoting State v. Seamans, 935 A.2d 618, 621 (R.I. 2007)). “Challenges to a trial justice’s credibility determinations typically are unavailing in this Court because the assessment of witness credibility ‘in a probation violation hearing is a function of the', '-5- [trial] justice, not this Court.’” State v.

Significantly, a 2016 amendment to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure increased the state’s burden of proof such that it must now establish “by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant breached a condition of the defendant’s probation or deferred sentence or failed to keep the peace or remain on good behavior.” Super. R. Crim. P. 32(f). However, even with that change, the state’s burden of proof in a probation violation hearing remains “far less exacting” than that required for a conviction in a criminal trial.

In accordance with that amendment, the state is now required to establish “by a fair preponderance of the evidence” that a probationer has violated the terms and conditions of his probation. Super. R. Crim. P. 32(f). D’Amico argues that his case should be remanded for a new probation violation hearing under the new standard because, he avers, his “violation appeal was still pending” at the time the amendment was enacted “because it had not been properly made[,]” and, therefore, “[t]he judgment below was, and still is, not final.”', 'We do not agree.

Nevertheless, “[i]t is the duty of the hearing justice to weigh the relevant, material evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” Jackson, 966 A.2d at 1229. In this case, the hearing justice heard the testimony of Siddiq and Cowgen and compared pictures of the robber to D’Amico’s visage as he appeared in the courtroom.

67,State : v. : Jody Johnson. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Jody Johnson, was found guilty by a jury of first-degree robbery, conspiracy to commit first-degree robbery, and assault with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling house with intent to commit robbery. We granted his petition for writ of certiorari requesting direct review of his convictions.1 He argues that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for new trial because, according to the defendant, the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On April 10, 2015, defendant was charged by indictment with one count of conspiracy to commit first-degree robbery, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6; one count of first-degree 1', 'The defendant did not file a timely notice of appeal.', '-1- robbery, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a); and one count of assault with a firearm in a dwelling house with intent to commit robbery, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-4.2', 'The defendant was tried before a jury over four consecutive days in January 2017 in the Providence County Superior Court. The state presented testimony from two individuals: the complaining witness, Mary Celletti, and a Providence police detective, Matthew Cute, who responded to Celletti’s home and was subsequently involved in the investigation.', 'Mary Celletti testified that, on the evening of January 28, 2014, she was home alone and getting ready to watch “the presidential address” when she realized, either through a knock at the door or a ring of the doorbell, that someone was outside and wanted to come in. Before opening the door, Celletti asked who was outside and heard “I’m locked out of the house” from an unfamiliar voice who also told her his mother was not at home. Celletti “opened the door a crack” and saw a boy around the age of ten or eleven standing there. She asked him if he wanted to use her phone and opened the door to allow him to enter. After he walked into her house, she tried to close the door but the door pushed back open and a “tall, muscular man” with black skin, a dark blue jacket, a hood, a scarf, and glasses appeared in the doorway and asked her what she was doing with his son. As she answered that she thought the boy was locked out of his house and she was allowing him to use her phone, the man pulled out a gun with a “dirty silver barrel” and brown handle and pointed it at her face. Celletti observed that the man’s glasses were dark gray with Scotch tape on one side holding the arm to the front frame of the lenses. The man 2', 'The defendant was also charged with contributing to the delinquency of a minor, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-9-4, but the state dismissed this charge pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure after trial when it realized—during the sentencing phase of the case—that, pursuant to § 11-9-9, the Family Court has exclusive jurisdiction over charges brought under § 11-9-4.', '-2- instructed Celletti to go sit down, and she sat down on her bed, located in an open alcove adjacent to the kitchen.', 'Celletti testified that the man asked her who else lived in her home; when she replied that her son lived there but was at his girlfriend’s house that evening, the man asked where the son’s bedroom was located and said that he was there to collect money the son owed him. The man then took off his scarf and his jacket, hung the jacket on the back of a kitchen chair, and pulled down the hood of his sweatshirt, uncovering his head. He made a phone call and Celletti heard a third person enter her house from the same door through which the boy and the man had come. The man handed the gun to the boy and instructed him to sit in a chair across from Celletti. The boy held the gun on her while the man disappeared from view and spoke with the third person who had entered her home. Celletti testified that she never saw the third person’s face, but that she concluded this person was female from the timbre of the voice. Celletti described the third person as tall and thin, wearing a red hoodie, with the hood up for the entire duration of the incident.', 'Celletti testified that she engaged the boy in conversation and told him about herself “to humanize [her]self with [him]” and to try to find out who he was. She learned his name and the name of his school. When the boy wanted a drink, Celletti gave him a can of Diet Coke. She asked him if he had ever held a gun before and if he thought they were going to kill her.', 'Celletti testified that she saw her son’s mattress and boxspring being lifted up as well as things in her bedroom torn up; she also heard her computer being moved, her pocketbook being dumped out, her television being turned off, unplugged, and carried out, as well as the movement of other televisions in her home. Celletti also stated that the people who entered her home left with bags from her basement, her cell phone, her home phone, bottles of red wine, coin', '-3- collections, CDs and DVDs, her son’s wedding band, and cash, among other things. Before the group of intruders left, the man took the gun from the boy, used a bra from Celletti’s dirty clothes hamper to wipe the gun off, and, on his way out the door, said: “If you call the cops, I’m coming back.”', 'A few moments later, Celletti saw the man’s jacket on the back of her kitchen chair, called out to him, and gave the jacket to him. After realizing that both her cell phone and her home phone had been taken, she found an old cell phone with just enough battery charge to make a call to her daughter and screamed that she had just been “robbed at gunpoint.” Her daughter soon arrived at the house, which shortly thereafter was “swamped with police from Johnston and Providence.”', 'Both Celletti and Det. Cute testified that, a few days after the incident, the detective brought a yearbook from the boy’s school over to Celletti’s house and Celletti was able to identify the boy who had been in her house the night of the incident. Both witnesses also testified that, two weeks after the incident, Det. Cute brought over a photo array which included defendant’s photo, but Celletti was unable to identify any of the men in the photographs as the man who had entered her home on January 28.', 'Some months after being shown the photo array, Celletti called the Attorney General’s office to inquire about the legal proceedings involving the boy. After a brief conversation—the substance of which is not on the record—she used her daughter’s laptop computer to search Facebook for the name “Jodi Johnson.” Celletti thought this might have been the name of the third person in her house on January 28 whom she had not seen but had assumed was a woman based on the voice. After scrolling through the various Jodi Johnsons who came up in the Facebook search results, she looked at photos for different spellings of “Jodi.” She testified that,', '-4- “all of a sudden [she] saw a picture that was very familiar to [her], but it wasn’t a female, it was a male.” Celletti testified that, based on the eyes and the large head, “he looked like the man who came into [her] house with a gun.” Celletti clicked on the photo, which brought her to that man’s Facebook profile page. Celletti scrolled through several photos of this “Jody Johnson,” including one in which he was wearing glasses with tape on the corner. When Celletti saw that picture, she was “a hundred percent” certain this photo was of the man who had entered her house on January 28. Celletti called Det. Cute, who testified that he went to her house, watched her repeat the search sequence she had performed on Facebook, and, using his own cell phone camera, took photos of the images on her computer screen. Celletti identified defendant as the man who entered her home and pointed a gun at her face.', 'At the close of the state’s evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the assault charge, arguing that insufficient evidence had been produced that a firearm was used during the incident. The trial justice denied the motion. The defendant renewed his motion prior to the delivery of the jury instructions and closing arguments; the trial justice reserved his decision. The jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts. In March 2017, the trial justice denied defendant’s renewed motion for judgment of acquittal and motion for new trial, in which defendant argued that the jury’s verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence and Celletti’s testimony.', 'The trial justice imposed a sentence of twenty-five years’ imprisonment with twelve years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation, on defendant’s first-degree robbery conviction and on defendant’s assault-with-a-firearm conviction.', 'With respect to defendant’s conspiracy conviction, the trial justice initially sentenced him to twenty years’ imprisonment with ten years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation, but corrected the sentence sua', '-5- sponte a month later because this sentence exceeded the statutory maximum. Accordingly, he modified the sentence to ten years’ imprisonment with ten years to serve. Each sentence runs concurrently with the sentences for the other convictions. Final judgment entered on May 30, 2017. The defendant filed a notice of appeal before the trial justice entered a final judgment of conviction, but did not file another notice of appeal after the trial justice corrected the sentence imposed for the conspiracy conviction. We granted defendant’s petition for writ of certiorari asking this Court for direct review of his convictions.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'The defendant appeals only from the trial justice’s denial of his motion for new trial. As we have oft repeated, “[w]hen a trial justice is presented with a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, he or she acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Gomez, 116 A.3d 216, 223 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Storey, 102 A.3d 641, 646 (R.I. 2014)). “[T]he trial justice must consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, then independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and also ultimately determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. (quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 646). “If, after conducting this independent review, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Id. (quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 646). “Only when the trial justice does not agree with the jury’s verdict, [must he or she] embark on a fourth analytical step.” Id.

(quoting Storey, 102 A.3d at 647).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice was clearly wrong when he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial because, according to defendant, the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Specifically, he asserts that Celletti’s testimony identifying him as the perpetrator should have been given little weight and that the weight of the evidence does not indicate that an operable firearm was used during the incident. We begin our discussion by acknowledging that the trial justice applied the correct standard for assessing the motion for new trial and articulated sufficient grounds for denying the motion; his decision is therefore entitled to great weight and deference pursuant to our well established standard of review. See Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223.', 'With respect to Celletti’s in-court identification of defendant as the perpetrator, defendant argues that little weight should have been given to this testimony because she had not been able to identify him from a photo array a couple of weeks after the incident despite her testimony that she had spent several minutes looking at his face while he was in her house. The defendant also argues that none of the Facebook photos of him wearing glasses shows tape at the corner, which directly contradicts the emphasis he claims Celletti placed on her ability to identify him on', '-7- Facebook as the perpetrator based on the Scotch tape at the corner of his glasses. In addition, defendant argues that Celletti more likely identified defendant as the perpetrator because a representative from the Attorney General’s office told her the name of a suspect, she went looking for a photo of the person with that name, and then adjusted her recollection of his physical description once she found the photos.', 'In the trial justice’s decision denying defendant’s motion for new trial, he concluded that Celletti’s testimony was consistent and that the few discrepancies—drawn out during cross- examination—between her initial statements to the police, her grand jury testimony, and her trial testimony “did not diminish the weight or significance of [her] testimony.” Our review of the testimony reveals that, as Celletti scrolled through the Facebook profiles listed from her search for “Jodi Johnson,” she came across a photo of a face that was “very familiar” to her “[b]ecause he looked like the man who came into [her] house with a gun.” She opened his profile and looked through other photos; when she saw the photo of him wearing glasses with “the shadow of the tape on the side of the glasses,” she “knew a hundred percent that was him.” While it had apparently been suggested to Celletti that an individual by the name of “Jodi Johnson” was thought to be involved in the incident, the name merely provided a starting point for Celletti’s Facebook search. Indeed, she testified that, when she started her search, she was looking for a female.', 'As the state points out, the Facebook search for “Jodi Johnson” yielded many profiles and photos that Celletti scrolled through before seeing one with a familiar face; the search did not result in a single photo that Celletti concluded was a photo of her perpetrator. Moreover, at trial, Celletti emphasized that her in-court identification of defendant was based on “his height, how big he is, his eyes.” Deferring to the trial justice’s front-and-center position to evaluate the facts', '-8- and to judge credibility, considering his clear articulation of his conclusion that Celletti’s testimony was consistent and credible, and absent any indication that he overlooked or misconceived the evidence, we agree with the trial justice’s assessment of the weight to which Celletti’s testimony was entitled and perceive no error on his part. See Gomez, 116 A.3d at 223.', 'The defendant also specifically challenges his convictions for first-degree robbery and assault with a dangerous weapon in a dwelling house with intent to rob on the basis that the guilty verdicts for these counts are against the weight of the evidence that the gun wielded during the incident was operable. He argues that Celletti’s only testimony about the gun was to describe its color and to state that it was pointed at her, and he further argues there was no testimony that she knew the gun was operable or that the intruders indicated the gun was operable. The defendant contends that Celletti’s testimony about her fear at the sight of the gun does not show its operability.', 'The indictment in this case identified the dangerous weapon as a firearm. To prove assault with a dangerous weapon when the dangerous weapon in play is a firearm, it is well settled that the state must prove the defendant possessed an operable gun. State v. Tillery, 922 A.2d 102, 107 (R.I. 2007). The state need not either produce the gun at trial or prove that the gun was loaded during the commission of the crime; the operability of the gun “may be inferred from the actions and statements of the defendant.” Id. at 108. We have had prior opportunities to consider whether the circumstances presented in a variety of cases could lead to a reasonable inference that an operable firearm was used in the commission of an assault. We have held that there was sufficient evidence that an operable gun was used when witnesses consistently described the gun they saw the defendant carrying and testified that the defendant had made a threat to shoot and that they had heard the gun click. Id. We have also held that the jury could', '-9- properly infer a firearm was used when the witnesses testified that they were afraid, when the defendant pointed a gun at—and within inches of—one witness’s chest, and when the defendant threatened to shoot a hole in a nearby mattress. State v. Andrade, 657 A.2d 538, 543 (R.I. 1995) abrogated on other grounds by State v. Jackson, 752 A.2d 5, 9-10 (R.I. 2000). On the other hand, we have also vacated a conviction after holding that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the defendant possessed an operable weapon when the complaining witness was equivocal about whether the defendant had possessed a gun at all during the incident in question. State v. Caba, 887 A.2d 370, 376-77 (R.I. 2005).', 'The case at bar presents testimony that is more akin to the circumstances in Tillery and Andrade than those in Caba. In her testimony at trial, Celletti described the gun as having a dirty silver barrel and brown handle and stated that defendant had pointed the gun at her face when he entered her home. She was clearly afraid the gun would be used to kill her because she asked the boy—who held the gun on her while the others searched her house—whether he thought the others were going to kill her. She also testified that the gun was pointed at her face by the young boy while defendant and the third person removed a variety of electronics and personal items from her home. As the intruders were leaving, Celletti testified that defendant issued a threat: “If you call the cops, I’m coming back.”', 'In his decision denying defendant’s motion for new trial, the trial justice specifically concluded that a gun was used during the incident. He considered the caselaw discussed supra and gave great weight to Celletti’s testimony that she was in fear, as demonstrated by her question to the young boy about whether he thought the others were going to kill her, defendant’s threat to return if she called the police, and the gun pointed at her for the duration of the incident. Unlike the defendant in Caba, Celletti was unequivocal about the presence of the', '- 10 - gun. The unrebutted testimony as to the actions and statements of defendant and his accomplices lead to a reasonable inference that the gun was operable, and defendant has not shown that the trial justice overlooked or misconceived any evidence by so concluding.', 'Overall, the trial justice concluded that Celletti was a credible witness, and he specifically stated that he agreed with the jury’s guilty verdicts on all three counts.', 'After thoroughly reviewing the record, it is apparent that the trial justice explained and supported his reasons for denying the defendant’s motion for new trial.

The plaintiff, Sandy Point Farms, Inc. (SPF or plaintiff), filed a petition for writ of certiorari seeking review of a Superior Court order denying its motion for a protective order concerning the deposition of Lawrence A. Rainey (Rainey). We granted the petition on December 4, 2017.', 'Before this Court, the plaintiff contends that, pursuant to Rule 26(b)(4)(B) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, Rainey, as a nontestifying expert, may not be deposed absent exceptional circumstances. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the order of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This matter arises from a long-simmering dispute between plaintiff and the defendants, Sandy Point Village, LLC; Kurt Poulton (Poulton); and Robert J. Kielbasa (Kielbasa) (collectively SPV or defendants), plaintiff’s neighboring property owners. The plaintiff alleges that it has suffered significant harm as a result of defendants’ construction and maintenance of drains directing surface water, waste, and sediment onto plaintiff’s Portsmouth property (the property). The plaintiff filed this action in 2005 against Sandy Point Village, LLC, alleging trespass and nuisance, and it amended its complaint in 2010 to include a claim for negligence and to add Poulton and Kielbasa as defendants.1 The parties have since spent years conducting discovery.', 'In the course of discovery, plaintiff retained Peter M. Scotti & Associates to produce an appraisal report for the property. Peter Scotti (Scotti) prepared and signed a “Self-Contained Appraisal Report” for Ronald Lepes, President of SPF (Lepes), dated May 15, 2014 (the appraisal report). On May 20, 2014, in response to interrogatories propounded by SPV, plaintiff gave notice of its intent to call Scotti to testify as an expert witness at trial, and it additionally provided a copy of the appraisal report. It was noted in the appraisal report that a second appraiser, Rainey, “provided significant assistance to [Scotti] in the preparation of [the] report.” At his deposition, Scotti confirmed that he had employed Rainey as an independent contractor for over ten years, and that he worked with Rainey on the appraisal of the property, specifically 1', 'On October 7, 2015, defendants filed a third-party complaint against Sandy Point Farms Condominiums, LLC; Sandy Point Farms Condominiums Association; Christopher Harkins; and Harkins Development Company.', '-2- regarding the research as to comparable sales. After learning this information, defendants sought to depose Rainey.', 'On January 20, 2017, plaintiff filed a motion for a protective order concerning Rainey’s proposed deposition, arguing that Rainey was a nontestifying expert, and, thus, defendants could not depose him absent a showing of “exceptional circumstances” pursuant to Rule 26(b)(4)(B). The defendants filed an objection to plaintiff’s motion, contending that, because Rainey “participate[d] in researching all or most of the comparable real estate market values and presumably drafted the analysis here * * * [his] deposition testimony would be relevant * * *.” At the February 6, 2017 hearing on plaintiff’s motion, defendants asserted that they were also seeking to depose Rainey to discover the nature of Rainey’s relationship with Lepes. The defendants argued that this information would be relevant to determine if that relationship should have been disclosed in the appraisal report, pursuant to the Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisers of Property.2', 'At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing justice denied plaintiff’s motion for a protective order. The hearing justice noted, “the general proposition is that experts that aren’t going to testify but have been retained cannot be deposed, but this is a little bit of a blur from your traditional situation * * * which can be done under extraordinary circumstances.” The hearing justice further explained his reasoning for denying plaintiff’s motion, stating:', '“I do not think that this is a clear expert situation that was not hired', 'to provide testimony because it seems as if the information', 'presented by Mr. Rainey was considered by Mr. Scotti in 2', 'At his deposition, Scotti testified that Lepes first contacted Rainey regarding the preparation of an appraisal report, and he remarked, “I think they knew each other.” Scotti acknowledged that the Uniform Standards for Professional Appraisers of Property require that some relationships be disclosed in the written report, but he stated that, according to his understanding of the standards, casual relationships need not be disclosed. When asked about his understanding of the history and nature of the relationship between Lepes and Rainey, Scotti stated, “I have none.”', '-3-', 'formulating his opinion.

Furthermore, plaintiff argues that the hearing justice, in his decision, “fail[ed] to cite any facts that establish such ‘extraordinary circumstances.’”', 'Conversely, defendants argue that the hearing justice did not err because Rainey is not a “nontestifying expert” under Rule 26(b)(4)(B), but instead “is a relevant witness given his level of involvement with the appraisal and the fact that his work formed, at least in substantial part, the basis for Mr. Scotti’s opinions and conclusions.”', 'Rule 26(b)(4) governs discovery procedures related to experts. Rule 26(b)(4) states, in relevant part:', '“(A) A party may through interrogatories require any other party to', 'identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an', 'expert witness at trial, to state the subject matter on which the', 'expert is expected to testify, and to state the substance of the facts', 'and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a', 'summary of the grounds for each opinion.

When interpreting court rules, “it is a fundamental principle of our jurisprudence that ‘[w]hen the language of a rule is clear and unambiguous, this Court must give the words of the rule their plain and ordinary meanings.’” Cashman, 139 A.3d at 382 (alteration in original) (quoting State v. Brown, 88 A.3d 1101, 1110 (R.I. 2014)).', 'We find Rule 26(b)(4)(B) to be clear and unambiguous. Moreover, looking at its plain language, we are of the opinion that Rainey is a nontestifying expert as intended by the rule. Rainey has been “retained or specially employed” as an expert appraiser by plaintiff in anticipation of litigation, albeit through his work as an independent contractor with Peter M. Scotti & Associates. Super. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(B). Furthermore, plaintiff has not given defendants notice of an intent to call Rainey as a witness at trial. Thus, Rule 26(b)(4)(B) is applicable to the discovery issue at bar.', 'We have previously recognized that “Rule 26(b)(4)(B) provides a qualified privilege from discovery for ‘facts known and opinions held’” by a nontestifying expert. Rhode Island Depositors Economic Protection Corporation v. Mapleroot Development Corporation, 715 A.2d 1260, 1263-64 (R.I. 1998). To depose a nontestifying expert pursuant to Rule 26(b)(4)(B), a party must make a “showing of exceptional circumstances under which it is impractica[ble] for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.” 3 Id. at 1261 n.1 (quoting Super. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(B)). It is clear that the hearing justice in the present case failed to make a finding as to whether defendants had demonstrated “exceptional circumstances” or if it would be impracticable for defendants “to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.” Id. (quoting Super. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(4)(B)). Rather, because the 3', 'Rule 26(b)(4)(B) also allows for discovery pursuant to Rule 35(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, providing for the physical and mental examination of persons, which is not applicable in this case.', '-6- hearing justice considered this situation to be outside of “the traditional situation where an expert is retained for just consultation purposes and will not testify[,]” he found it “appropriate to depose [Rainey] to find out the basis” of the information he presented to Scotti. Thus, we are of the opinion that the hearing justice erred in failing to properly apply the Rule 26(b)(4)(B) standard in this case.', 'Furthermore, the record is devoid of a showing of exceptional circumstances on the part of defendants. The defendants contend that they wish to depose Rainey to discover: (1) the basis of his knowledge regarding the portions of the appraisal report for which he researched; and (2) the nature of the relationship between Rainey and Lepes. First, quoting language from an opinion of a federal district court, defendants argue that they are entitled to depose Rainey on the basis that the work he performed “is exclusively within [his] cognizance,” Derrickson v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., No. DKC 95-3296, 1999 WL 1456538, at *8 (D. Md. Mar. 19, 1999), and because “his work formed, at least in substantial part, the basis for [Scotti’s] opinions and conclusions.” It is true that “our discovery rules are liberal and have been construed to ‘promote broad discovery.’” DeCurtis, 152 A.3d at 421 (quoting Henderson v. Newport County Regional Young Men’s Christian Association, 966 A.2d 1242, 1246 (R.I. 2009)). However, to find an exceptional circumstance for this conclusory purpose could broaden the rule significantly. In theory, a party would be able to depose any person who contributed to an expert’s work in any capacity because the basis of knowledge for that work would be exclusively within that person’s awareness. Furthermore, defendants have not demonstrated that it would be impracticable to obtain this information by other means. In his deposition, Scotti stated that he and Rainey both', '-7- worked on the research for the comparable sales. Moreover, Scotti testified that he was the person with the most knowledge about the appraisal report.4', 'Further, defendants assert that they are entitled to depose Rainey to discover the basis of his knowledge because, according to defendants, “the appraisal report was the result of, at a minimum, substantial collaborative work between Mr. Scotti and Mr. Rainey.” The defendants cite to federal district court cases for the proposition that, in addition to the testifying expert, any person who performs a significant amount of work on the expert’s report is subject to a deposition.5 See, e.g., Derrickson, 1999 WL 1456538, at *7-8; Herman v. Marine Midland Bank, 207 F.R.D. 26, 31-32 (W.D.N.Y. 2002) (finding that the defendant was allowed to depose a co- author of the expert’s report because the co-author performed “extensive work” in connection with the report). However, defendants have failed to show how this information cannot be discovered by other means, such as resuming Scotti’s deposition. 4', 'The appraisal report also states that “[n]o one other than the undersigned prepared the analysis, conclusions and opinions concerning real estate that are set forth in this appraisal report.” 5', 'We have held that “where the federal rule and our state rule of procedure are substantially similar, we will look to the federal courts for guidance or interpretation of our own rule.” Crowe Countryside Realty Associates, Co., LLC v. Novare Engineers, Inc., 891 A.2d 838, 840 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Smith v. Johns-Manville Corp., 489 A.2d 336, 339 (R.I. 1985)). Rule 26(b)(4)(B) nearly exactly parrots the language of Rule 26(b)(4)(D) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which states:', '“(D) Expert Employed Only for Trial Preparation. Ordinarily, a', 'party may not, by interrogatories or deposition, discover facts', 'known or opinions held by an expert who has been retained or', 'specially employed by another party in anticipation of litigation or', 'to prepare for trial and who is not expected to be called as a', 'witness at trial. But a party may do so only:', '“(i) as provided in Rule 35(b); or', '“(ii) on showing exceptional circumstances under which it', 'is impracticable for the party to obtain facts or opinions on the', 'same subject by other means.”', '-8-', 'Second, defendants have not demonstrated “exceptional circumstances” as to the other reason set forth as to why they wish to depose Rainey; namely, to gather information about his relationship with Lepes.', 'This information is certainly not within Rainey’s “exclusive cognizance,” and defendants are likely to be able to discover facts regarding this issue through other means, such as interrogatories to plaintiff or by resuming Lepes’s deposition.', 'In sum, the hearing justice failed to properly apply the clear and unambiguous language of Rule 26(b)(4)(B) in ruling on the plaintiff’s motion for a protective order, and the defendants have failed to demonstrate “exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party seeking discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.” Accordingly, we find that the hearing justice erred in denying the plaintiff’s motion for a protective order.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we quash the order of the Superior Court.

69,State : v. : Michael Stokes. :,criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Michael Stokes, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction on three counts of assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2, for which he was sentenced to three concurrent fifteen-year sentences; three counts of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(b)(2), for which he was sentenced to three concurrent twenty- year sentences, which are to run consecutive to the sentences for the assault with a dangerous weapon convictions; and one count of carrying a pistol without a license, in violation of § 11-47- 8(a), for which he was sentenced to a term of five years’ imprisonment, to run concurrently with the sentences for the discharging-a-firearm convictions. The defendant was also sentenced as a habitual offender to twenty-five years, with fifteen years to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation, to run consecutive to the sentences for the discharging-a-firearm convictions. The defendant seeks to have his convictions vacated, and asks this Court to grant him a new trial on the following grounds: (1) the state untimely disclosed the identity of two witnesses who were placed in witness protection; (2) the trial justice erred in admitting into evidence prior inconsistent statements made to the police by one witness; and (3) the trial justice erred in', '-1- denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts', 'In the early hours of October 17, 2015, three people were shot inside El Tiburon, a small Providence sports bar with a few pool tables and a jukebox, located at the intersection of Harold and Valley Streets.', 'Renee Tager was one of the three victims. She testified at trial that she and a friend had arrived sometime between midnight and 12:30 a.m. She was standing by the pool tables near the back door when, “out of nowhere [she] heard a gunshot[,]” then she “heard a series of gunshots.” Tager ran outside and, moments later, realized she had been shot in the leg.', 'The second victim, Dwayne “Fat Cat” Monteiro, testified that he arrived with a friend at El Tiburon around 1:30 a.m. for a nightcap after having had a few drinks at a friend’s house and smoking marijuana. Monteiro testified that, as he was “enjoying [his] drink, some dude walked by [him] and nudged [him] with his shoulder.” Monteiro, who is about six feet tall, testified that the person who bumped into him was a black male about as tall as Monteiro’s shoulders. Shortly thereafter, Monteiro was shot five times.', 'His next memories were of hearing people running and screaming, the presence of an ambulance, and being tended to by a lady.', 'Alize Huntley was the third person shot that night. When she was shot, she was standing by the bar waiting for her friend. In a statement Huntley gave to the police while at the hospital, she said that she felt a burning sensation in her leg, and retreated to the men’s bathroom during the chaos caused by the shooting. At that point, she saw that she was bleeding and spotted a bullet on the bathroom floor.', '-2-', 'Tameisha Haynes was also at El Tiburon that night. At the time of trial, she was thirty- two years old. Haynes, a nursing student, was meeting two friends at El Tiburon to talk through a disagreement her friends were having. When she arrived at around 12:30 a.m., Haynes and her friends first spoke outside El Tiburon, then entered the bar. Inside, people were drinking and chatting—Haynes described it as “a regular bar situation.” Because people were playing loud music at the jukebox, Haynes, her friends, and her ex-boyfriend who was also present, had difficulty hearing each other. Haynes bought a drink from the bar and sat near one of the pool tables with her friends and ex-boyfriend.', 'Haynes first noticed defendant, whom she later identified in court, when defendant bumped into Haynes’s friend, spilling her friend’s drink. Haynes testified that the person was a black male, about her height or a little taller, wearing black Levi jeans and a black top.1', 'Haynes noticed that defendant and another man were having “an exchange of words[.]” She slid down the pool table to avoid any chance of confrontation between the two individuals. Haynes heard defendant say, “Yeah, okay, motherfucker[,]” and saw him walk towards the exit.', 'According to Haynes, defendant then “unleashed the firearm and started shooting.” Haynes saw defendant fire two rounds before she ran to the corner with an ATM and ducked down. After firing about five rounds, defendant exited through the Harold Street exit. As Haynes was leaving, she saw a victim bleeding on the floor. Haynes testified that, as a nursing student, she felt compelled to stop and help him. 1', 'The security video taken from El Tiburon that night depicts different clothing colors for defendant and others than described at trial. Despite Haynes’s testimony that defendant’s jacket was black, the video footage taken from the bar that night showed defendant’s clothing as “red, maroon, or some color in that area.” The video also depicted Haynes’s black sweatshirt as light gray, and a detective’s black jacket appeared “light or powder blue.”', '-3-', 'All three victims gave statements to the police after the shooting, although, in their statements, only one could identify the shooter. Tager spoke to the police about two months after the shooting. Monteiro refused to discuss the incident with the police until just prior to trial, despite their efforts to quickly obtain a statement. Neither Monteiro nor Tager could identify the shooter. Huntley, however, was able to identify defendant as the shooter because she had known him for a few years. Huntley gave a statement to Detective Brian Dyer on October 21, 2015, while she was still in the hospital for treatment of her gunshot wound. In her statement to police, not only did she identify defendant as the shooter, but she also recounted the night’s events. Huntley signed a photograph of defendant at that time and captioned it: “Mike Stokes - saw him let off shots at El Tiburon.”', 'After the shooting, the police could not immediately locate defendant. Eleven days later, defendant was discovered in North Carolina and apprehended.', 'II', 'Travel', 'The defendant was charged with a seven-count criminal information on November 18, 2015, and a four-day jury trial began on February 6, 2017. In addition to Haynes, Tager, Monteiro, and Huntley, the jury heard testimony by a member of the Bureau of Criminal Identification Unit of the Attorney General’s Office, a forensic scientist at the Rhode Island Department of Health, and three members of the Providence police department. The jury rendered a verdict on February 15, 2017, finding defendant guilty of all seven counts. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial after a hearing on February 24, 2017. The defendant was sentenced on April 20, 2017, and he timely filed a notice of appeal.', '-4-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The defendant raises three issues on appeal. He contends that (1) he was prejudiced by a midtrial disclosure of the identity of witnesses who were placed in witness protection, in violation of Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure; (2) the trial justice erred when he allowed Huntley’s statements to the police into evidence as prior inconsistent statements; and (3) the trial justice erred in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. We discuss each in turn.', 'A', 'Rule 16', 'The defendant contends that the state withheld information related to witnesses Haynes’s and Huntley’s involvement in the witness protection program, in violation of Rule 16. The defendant had sought information related to the witness protection program several times before filing his January 30, 2017 Motion for Disclosure of Promises, Rewards, and Inducements—to which the state’s alleged untimely response is at issue here. Soon after defendant’s December 3, 2015 arraignment, defendant’s counsel filed three pretrial motions: a motion for impeachment evidence pursuant to Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972)2; a motion for disclosure of promises, rewards, and inducements; and a motion for disclosure of exculpatory information, which included a specific request for any information related to protective services.

The state’s answer did not address the witness protection program.', 'At a pretrial motion hearing on April 15, 2016, defendant raised the state’s response to his motions with the court. The state told the court there had been no promises, rewards, or inducements; and that, although there were “witness protection issues[,]” the state did not consider witness protection to be a promise, reward, or inducement. Later during the hearing, the trial justice gave the following direction: “If [the state] want[s] to give [defense counsel] * * * some indication * * * that would include whether the witness has been provided with relocation expenses, housing, apartment expenses, per diem * * * [g]ive him sort of a general response. And if [defense counsel] needs more meat on the bones, he will say so.” The record is silent as to whether those details were subsequently disclosed by the state.', 'On October 20, 2016, defendant’s counsel withdrew and, the next day, new counsel filed an entry of appearance. The defendant then filed some general discovery motions, to which the state replied with the answers and documents it had previously provided. On January 30, 2017— a week before trial was scheduled to begin—defendant filed a Motion for Disclosure of Promises, Rewards, and Inducements. The defendant’s counsel, being relatively new to the case, admitted at a pretrial hearing on February 2, 2017 that, although the same motion had likely been filed by prior counsel, it was easier for her to file a new motion than to sort through prior counsel’s files. The state filed its answer on February 10, 2017, in the middle of trial, and indicated that Huntley and Haynes both had been placed in the witness protection program.3 The 3', 'The state’s answer does not indicate the nature or extent to which the state program has provided witness protective services to Huntley and Haynes.', '-6- defendant did not file an objection, request a continuance, or otherwise argue that this response was untimely or prejudicial, and he made no mention of the late filing that day during trial.4', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the state violated Rule 16 when it untimely disclosed that Haynes and Huntley were in the witness protection program and that the late response “denied the defendant the opportunity to present the best defense.”', 'The state argues that defendant waived this argument.', 'Upon review of the trial record, we agree with the state: Defendant’s Rule 16 argument is waived. Under this Court’s well established “raise or waive” rule, a specific objection is required to preserve an issue for appellate review. State v.

Huntley claimed she was given money to stay in a hotel, but had pocketed the cash. After defendant opened the door to questioning about the witness protection service, the state questioned Det. Dyer about whether he had ever discussed witness protection with Huntley.', '-7- alleged discovery violation pursuant to Rule 16 * * * should examine four factors: (1) the reason for the nondisclosure; (2) the prejudice to the other party; (3) whether or not a continuance can rectify any such prejudice; and (4) any other relevant factors.” (quoting State v. Grant, 946 A.2d 818, 828 (R.I. 2008))).5 Accordingly, we are of the opinion that defendant’s Rule 16 argument was not adequately preserved and is therefore not properly before the Court in this appeal.', 'B', 'Prior Inconsistent Statement', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice violated Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence by allowing Huntley’s October 21, 2015 statement to the police into evidence.6 We review the trial justice’s admission of evidence for “clear abuse of discretion.” State v. Matthews, 88 A.3d 375, 383 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. McManus, 990 A.2d 1229, 1234 (R.I. 2010)).', '“It is well established that decisions concerning the admissibility of evidence are within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.” State v. Alves, 183 A.3d 539, 542 (R.I. 2018) (quoting State v. Adams, 161 A.3d 1182, 1194 (R.I. 2017)). “The trial justice will not have abused his or her discretion as long as some grounds supporting his or her decision appear in the record.” Id. (quoting Adams, 161 A.3d at 1194). 5', 'Even if defendant’s Rule 16 argument was preserved for our review, defendant utterly fails to articulate any prejudice defendant suffered by the late disclosure. The defendant argues that he was denied the opportunity to present his best defense, yet declines to explain how counsel might otherwise have argued his case or changed defense strategy. No discussion is provided to the Court as to whether defendant could have avoided conviction by creating reasonable doubt in the minds of one or more jurors had Huntley’s witness protection status been disclosed earlier. 6', 'The defendant also argues that the audiotape of Huntley’s recorded statements was inadmissible under Rule 803(5) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, the recorded recollection exception to the hearsay rule. Because we find Huntley’s prior statements, including the audio recording, admissible as prior inconsistent statements, we need not address this argument.', '-8-', 'At trial, Huntley refused to identify defendant and claimed she did not remember giving a statement to the police. Huntley insisted that, when she gave the statement to the police, she was under the influence of recreational drugs and on prescription medication. Outside the jury’s presence, the trial justice deemed Huntley a hostile witness. The trial justice allowed the state to impeach Huntley by using the transcript of her police statement to show her prior inconsistent statements. Before the jury, the prosecutor read the detective’s October 21, 2015 questions to Huntley, and her answers, and then asked Huntley if she indeed had made those statements. During her testimony, Huntley denied making the statements at times, and, at other times, replied “I may have[.]” Huntley insisted that, when she made those statements, she was so under the influence that she “couldn’t even tell you who [she] was[,]” further evidenced by her self- described “stuttering” on the police recording. The trial justice then allowed the state to impeach Huntley by playing portions of the police statement recording to the jury. Later, the trial justice instructed the jury that a witness’s prior statements may be considered not only to assess a witness’s credibility, but also as substantive evidence.', 'Rule 801(d)(1)(A) provides that a witness’s prior inconsistent statement is not hearsay and thus is admissible if the declarant testifies and “is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement[.]” See State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1160 (R.I. 2009). The “justification” for Rule 801(d)(1)(A), and in particular the cross-examination requirement, is to “put[] the trier-of-fact in as good a position to appraise the reliability of the prior statement as it would be if the prior statement were made under oath.” Rule 801 Advisory Committee’s Notes.', 'Indeed, this Court has held many times that a witness’s prior inconsistent statement is admissible if the witness is available for cross-examination regarding the statement. In State v. Jaiman, 850 A.2d 984 (R.I. 2004), a key witness “suffered a convenient failure of memory,', '-9- declaring over and over again, especially at critical points about details of [a] drive-by shooting, that he had difficulty remembering the events of [that evening].” Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 986. On appeal, the defendant argued that the witness’s prior statement should not have been admitted at trial under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) because his lack of memory left him “functionally unavailable for meaningful cross-examination[.]” Id. at 987. This Court found that, because the witness was subject to cross-examination, the “veracity of [the witness’s] in-court testimony was thoroughly probed and compared with his earlier police statement” and therefore Rule 801(d)(1)(A)’s requirements were satisfied. Id. at 990.', 'Similarly, in McManus, a key witness “professed a total failure of memory about everything concerning the incident, including his discussions with the state police.” McManus, 990 A.2d at 1232. Despite his refusal to admit that the prior statement was accurate, we found that his prior inconsistent statements to the police were admissible under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). Id. at 1236. Through the witness’s testimony at trial and on cross-examination, the “underlying rationale” of Rule 801(d)(1)(A) was fulfilled because the factfinder was able to determine which statement was “worthy of belief.” Id.', 'Again, in Matthews, a key witness “professed a lack of memory regarding almost all of the facts salient to the [crime], including his own signature and the sound of his voice.” Matthews, 88 A.3d at 384. We held that the trial justice properly allowed the prosecutor to question the witness about the details of his police statement and properly admitted into evidence a police recording under Rule 801(d)(1)(A) because the defendant cross-examined the witness and the jury could decide the truthfulness of those statements. Id. Notably, in Matthews, this Court did not treat the admission of the prior inconsistent statements by playing an audio', '- 10 - recording to the jury differently from prior inconsistent statements read into evidence for the jury. Id.', 'The defendant attempts to distinguish the instant case by arguing that Huntley’s lack of memory due to having taken drugs is different from the witnesses in the above cases, who claimed pure failure of memory. The defendant’s distinction, however, is of no import. The “touchstone” of Rule 801(d)(1)(A) is satisfied here:', 'Huntley testified and was subject to vigorous cross-examination concerning the circumstances of her October 21, 2015 statement to police. See Jaiman, 850 A.2d at 988. At trial, Huntley claimed she was “stuttering” and under the influence when she gave her statement, and the trial justice ruled that the jury had a right to hear the recording of her statement and determine for itself which statements were “worthy of belief.” McManus, 990 A.2d at 1236. This reasoning comports with Rule 801(d)(1)(A)’s underlying purpose, which is to “put[] the trier-of-fact in as good a position to appraise the reliability of the prior statement as it would be if the prior statement were made under oath.” Rule 801 Advisory Committee’s Note. Consequently, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion when he allowed the state to question Huntley about the details of her October 21, 2015 statement to the police, nor did the trial justice abuse his discretion when he allowed the recording to be played to the jury.', 'C', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'On February 24, 2017, the trial justice denied defendant’s timely motion for a new trial. Observing that Haynes “unwaveringly and adamantly identified defendant Stokes as the shooter at the El Tiburon club the night of October 17th, 2015[,]” the trial justice found Haynes “very credible, without guile or pretense.” In fact, he found that her testimony, “by itself[,]” was', '- 11 - “sufficient evidence which amply supports the juror’s [sic] verdict in this case.” The trial justice rejected as a “red herring” the video depiction of defendant’s jacket (red), finding that, although the jacket appeared to be a different color from what Haynes testified to (black), the video had distorted the clothing colors depicted. The trial justice also explained that he “listened carefully” to Huntley’s police statement and found that she was “calm” and “sounded perfectly normal” despite Huntley’s insistence at trial that her statement was, in the trial justice’s words, “rife with stuttering and clouded by a diminished mental condition[.]” “There is no question,” the trial justice observed, “that her prior statements to [the police] were the truthful ones.” The trial justice strengthened his reasoning by crediting the testimony of the police officer, who testified that, when he took Huntley’s October 21, 2015 statement, she never displayed any signs of being under the influence. Finally, the trial justice pointed to defendant’s “suspicious presence” in North Carolina after the shooting, and defendant’s conversation from the local jail, which “demonstrated quite clearly that he had fled there in an effort to escape apprehension in Rhode Island.”', 'On appeal, defendant first contends that the trial justice erred in finding Haynes’s testimony credible when weighed against the other witnesses’ inability to identify defendant as the shooter. Second, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in crediting Huntley’s prior inconsistent statement. The state argues that the trial justice appropriately denied defendant’s motion for a new trial and that he provided ample reasons for the denial.', 'Under the “oft-repeated” and “well settled” test this Court applies when reviewing a motion for a new trial, we examine whether the trial justice acted as a “thirteenth juror” and exercised his or her “independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Cerda, 957 A.2d 382, 385 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Bergevine, 942', '- 12 - A.2d 974, 981 (R.I. 2008)). When considering a motion for new trial, the trial justice must undertake a three-step analysis: “(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” State v. Greenslit, 135 A.3d 1192, 1197 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Hie, 93 A.3d 963, 974 (R.I. 2014)). If, after conducting this three-step analysis, “the trial justice concludes that reasonable minds could differ as to the result or if the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury did,” the motion for a new trial should be denied and the verdict should be affirmed. State v. Espinal, 943 A.2d 1052, 1058 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 984 (R.I. 2007)). Conversely, if the trial justice finds that reasonable minds could not differ or does not agree with the jury’s verdict, “then the trial justice must complete a fourth analytical step[.]” Greenslit, 135 A.3d at 1197. The trial justice must “determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.” State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96, 102 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Robat, 49 A.3d 58, 71 (R.I. 2012)); see also Greenslit, 135 A.3d at 1197.', 'A trial justice is “present during all phases of the trial” and, consequently, is “in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” State v. Diaz, 159 A.3d 1053, 1062 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013)). We therefore afford great deference to a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for a new trial “if he or she has articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” Id. (quoting State v. Muralles, 154 A.3d 925, 932 (R.I. 2017)).', 'For that reason, we “will not overturn a trial justice’s determination with regard to such a motion unless we determine that the trial justice committed clear error or that he or she overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence [relating]', '- 13 - to a critical issue in the case.” State v. Silva, 84 A.3d 411, 417 (R.I. 2014) (alteration in original) (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 141 (R.I. 2008)).', 'First, defendant asserts that Haynes’s testimony—the only testimony to directly identify defendant as the person who committed the crimes for which he was charged—was not credible because Haynes identified defendant as wearing a black jacket the night of the shooting and the El Tiburon video footage shows the shooter in a red jacket. In explaining his reason his denial of the motion, the trial justice acknowledged the distorted colors of the video. The trial justice, however, also noted that the colors of other clothing that appeared in the video—not just defendant’s—were clearly distorted for an “inexplicable reason[.]” He pointed to a photo taken that night outside El Tiburon of Det. Dyer wearing a black jacket, which the video depicts as light blue.', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice, notwithstanding the distorted colors, appropriately considered the totality of the evidence—including Haynes’s testimony, Huntley’s prior statements, Monteiro’s testimony, and defendant’s flight to North Carolina—in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Second, defendant asserts that Huntley’s testimony was so problematic that the court should have disregarded everything she said, including her prior inconsistent statement made to the police. According deference to the trial justice’s findings, we hold, however, that the trial justice did not err in crediting Huntley’s prior inconsistent statements to the police despite Huntley’s conflicting testimony at trial. The trial justice noted that Huntley was “sarcastic and extraordinarily rude, to the point of being uncommonly obnoxious,” in an attempt to distance herself from the statement that she had given to the police. Yet, after he heard the recording, the trial justice found Huntley’s recorded statement to be “rather matter-of-fact” and “without hesitation or embellishment[.]” Despite her insistence at trial that she was high when she gave', '- 14 - her statement, the trial justice found that “it was obvious, as it would have been to any casual listener, much less the very attentive jurors in this case, that Ms. Huntley was not at all under the influence of intoxicants of any kind.”', 'Perhaps most significant, the trial justice found that “Haynes’[s] very credible testimony by itself was easily enough evidence upon which to support the verdict.”', 'In light of the “overwhelming” evidence of the defendant’s guilt, the trial justice concluded that “[n]o fair- minded juror could have possibly reached a different result.” Therefore, we are satisfied that the trial justice properly denied the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant, Providence Business Loan Fund, Inc. (PBLF or defendant), appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC (Bayview or plaintiff), following the grant of the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. The defendant argues that the hearing justice erred in granting the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment because, by statute, the defendant holds a valid mortgage on the property on which the defendant commenced foreclosure proceedings. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 2, 1992, Norris Waldron (Waldron) granted a mortgage to PBLF, which was at that time known as “Providence Economic Development Corporation,” with respect to certain real property located in Providence (the property), as security for a loan in the amount of $70,660 (the 1992 mortgage). The 1992 mortgage stated a term of ten years, but it did not specify a maturity date; it was recorded in the Providence land evidence records at Book 2568, Page 50, on June 3, 1992. On December 20, 1996, Waldron entered into a “Modification Agreement” with defendant to reduce the amount of debt to $44,061.75, to be repaid over a period of 108 months, beginning on January 1, 1997 (the modification agreement). The modification agreement was not recorded. On the same day, Waldron and defendant also executed an amendment to the 1992 mortgage (the 1997 amendment), which was recorded on January 3, 1997, in the Providence land evidence records. The 1997 amendment states, in relevant part, that the 1992 mortgage “has been modified, with the consent of mortgagor, by an agreement of even date herewith, to modify the terms and to extend the maturity date of said indebtedness to reduce the amount of the indebtedness which is secured by said mortgage to $44,061.75.”', 'On its face, the 1997 amendment failed to reflect the 108-month term listed in the modification agreement and it did not specify any other term or maturity date.', 'On January 23, 2004, Waldron conveyed the property to Jocelyn Waldron by quitclaim deed. On June 21, 2014, Jocelyn1 granted a mortgage on the property to MERS, as nominee for Equity One, Inc., which was recorded in the Providence land evidence records. Three years later, Jocelyn paid off that debt using the proceeds of a loan from Global Equity Lending, Inc., 1', 'To avoid confusion, we refer to Jocelyn Waldron by her first name; no disrespect is intended.', '-2- which was secured by a mortgage on the property; that mortgage was assigned by Global Equity Lending, Inc. to plaintiff on June 19, 2007, and an assignment of the mortgage and security agreement was recorded in the Providence land evidence records.', 'Jocelyn later conveyed the property to Broad Street, LLC by warranty deed on October 29, 2014.', 'On February 8, 2017, defendant gave notice to Broad Street, LLC of its commencement of foreclosure proceedings on the 1992 mortgage. On March 6, 2017, plaintiff, as a lienholder on the property, filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking a declaration that defendant’s mortgage had been discharged under § 34-26-7, which provides for the expiration of certain mortgages after a stated number of years, and that, therefore, defendant had no right to foreclose on the property.2', 'On May 17, 2017, plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the 1992 mortgage expired and was discharged by statute on June 3, 2007. The plaintiff further argued that, even if the 1997 amendment had properly extended the mortgage, it would have expired in 2011 and was therefore no longer enforceable under the statute. The defendant countered that, because the 1992 mortgage did not state a maturity date on its face, a thirty-five-year lien was created under the statute. Alternatively, defendant argued that the 1997 amendment was valid because it was recorded and, because the 1997 amendment failed to state a term or maturity date, the mortgage was valid for thirty-five years from the date of the 1997 amendment.', 'The hearing justice found the 1997 amendment to be a “non-compliant mortgage extension, which is ineffective under the statute,” and thus she considered the 1992 mortgage to be the operative document. The hearing justice further found, after giving the words of the 2', 'The plaintiff also named Broad Street, LLC as a defendant in its action for declaratory judgment. The plaintiff filed an application for entry of default against Broad Street, LLC with the clerk of the Superior Court, and default was entered on May 31, 2018. Final judgment against Broad Street, LLC was entered on July 9, 2018.', '-3- statute their “plain and ordinary meaning,” that defendant’s mortgage had expired because the 1992 mortgage stated a term of ten years and, because the statute allows for exercise of the power of sale only five years following that term, the mortgage had expired in 2007.

ESS Group, Inc., 184 A.3d 695, 702 (R.I. 2018) (quoting Western Reserve Life Assurance Co. of Ohio v. ADM Associates, LLC, 116 A.3d 794, 798 (R.I. 2015)). Moreover, this Court has held that “[t]he words ‘or’ and ‘and’ are not the equivalent of each other and should not be considered as interchangeable unless reasonably necessary in order to give effect to the intention of the enacting body.” Earle v. Zoning Board of Review of City of Warwick, 96 R.I. 321, 324, 191 A.2d 161, 163 (1963).

The plain language of the statute requires that either a term or maturity date be stated in order to avoid the thirty-five-year validity period, not both. Section 34-26-7. Here, the 1992 mortgage stated a term of ten years, with no maturity date. Thus, based on a reading of', '-6- the plain language of § 34-26-7, the period of validity for the 1992 mortgage ran for the ten-year term, plus five years following expiration of that term—that is, fifteen years from June 3, 1992.3', 'B', 'The 1997 Amendment', 'We next must determine the consequence of the 1997 amendment. In her decision, the hearing justice found the 1997 amendment to be ineffective. The hearing justice stated: “In order to extend the mortgage, all extensions must be recorded * * * in the land evidence records.” She further reasoned that, “while [the] amended mortgage was recorded, and it certainly referenced an agreement that was not [recorded], the failure to record the complete terms of the extension in my mind does in fact make that extension invalid.”', 'It is undisputed that the modification agreement—the only document stating the duration of the extension—was not recorded. Significantly, § 34-26-7 provides that “[t]he period [in which a power of sale may be exercised] shall not be extended by nonresidence nor disability of any person interested in the mortgage or the real estate, or by any partial payment, agreement, extension, acknowledgement, affidavit, or other action not meeting the requirements of this section.” Clearly, one of the requirements of the statute is that “[a]ll extensions, agreements, affidavits and acknowledgements shall be indexed in the land evidence records under the name of the present landowner.” Section 34-26-7.

Thus, we 3', 'We note that in its prebriefing statement, defendant argued that “[t]he lack of maturity date supports a thirty-five (35) year period of validity from June 3, 1992 * * *.” However, at oral argument, defendant changed course, representing to the Court that the 1992 mortgage was valid for only fifteen years under the statute, given that the 1992 mortgage specified a ten-year term.', '-7- agree with the hearing justice that the 1997 amendment failed to extend the term of the 1992 mortgage for the purposes set forth in § 34-26-7.4', 'The defendant next argues that the 1997 amendment extended the mortgage validity period by thirty-five years because, although the 1997 amendment referred to an extended maturity date, the document, on its face, did not contain a term of years or maturity date. This would be true if the parties had discharged the 1992 mortgage and recorded a new mortgage in 1997. Here, however, the clear, unequivocal language of the 1997 amendment tolerates no cause for ambiguity. The parties did not execute a new mortgage; rather, they recorded an amendment to the 1992 mortgage. The instrument itself is entitled “Amendment of Mortgage Recorded in Book 2568 at Page 050.” Significantly, the 1997 amendment provides that “mortgagor hereby agrees that the mortgage dated June 2, 1992 and recorded in the Records of Land Evidence of the City of Providence in Book 2568 at page 050 is hereby modified * * *.”5 4', 'As a result, the 108-month term listed in the unrecorded modification agreement is of no consequence to our analysis. 5', 'The substance of the 1997 amendment reads, in full:', '“Norris Waldron (hereinafter referred to as Mortgagor) on June 2,', '1992 executed a mortgage to Providence Economic Development', 'Corporation to secure Mortgagor’s Promissory Note in the original', 'amount of $71,660.00. The indebtedness secured by said mortgage', 'has been modified, with the consent of mortgagor, by an agreement', 'of even date herewith, to modify the terms and to extend the', 'maturity date of said indebtedness to reduce the amount of the', 'indebtedness which is secured by said mortgage to $44,061.75.', '“For valuable consideration, mortgagor hereby agrees that the', 'mortgage dated June 2, 1992 and recorded in the Records of Land', 'Evidence of the City of Providence in Book 2568 at page 050 is', 'hereby modified as provided in said agreement and all other', 'obligations secured by said mortgage, with all amendments to date,', 'are hereby ratified, confirmed and approved.”', '-8-', 'The fact that the 1997 amendment also referenced the unrecorded modification agreement and stated that the purpose of the modification agreement was “to extend the maturity date of [the] indebtedness” is of no moment. As we explained supra, the purported extension of the mortgage set forth in the modification agreement was ineffective to extend the life of the 1992 mortgage because the modification agreement was not recorded in the land evidence records and therefore did not meet the requirements of § 34-26-7. We thus conclude that the mortgage at issue was valid under the provisions of § 34-26-7 for the ten-year term specified in the 1992 mortgage, plus an additional five years as provided in § 34-26-7. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the mortgage granted to the defendant was discharged by operation of the ancient mortgages statute well before the commencement of foreclosure proceedings in 2017, and therefore summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff was appropriate.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

71,State : v. : Richard L. Paiva. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. The defendant, Richard Paiva, appeals pro se from a September 20, 2017 decision and an April 2, 2018 order of the Providence County Superior Court denying his motion to correct his sentence. He contends on appeal that his sentence was illegal in that it did not comply with the language of the habitual offender statute. See G.L. 1956 § 12-19- 21(b). This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In September of 2010, Mr. Paiva pled nolo contendere to a charge of domestic murder in the first degree and agreed to habitual offender status in exchange for the dismissal of two other counts against him. He was sentenced to life on the domestic murder count. In addition, he was sentenced to a term of fifteen years as a habitual offender, ten years of which sentence were non-parolable', '-1- with five years suspended and five years probation, to be served consecutively to his sentence on the domestic murder count.1', 'On September 6, 2017, Mr. Paiva filed the instant motion to correct his sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. On September 20, 2017, his motion was denied in a bench decision rendered by a justice of the Superior Court, which denial was then reflected in the April 2, 2018 order entered in this case. Mr. Paiva has appealed that denial.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Mr. Paiva argued below and argues before this Court in his “Statement of Case and Summary of Issue” that his plea agreement was “illegal” because “[t]he Habitual offender statute clearly and unambiguously mandates that the court shall announce a parole eligibility date * * *.” He asks this Court to “announc[e] parole eligibility at 1/3 of the 10 year sentence; or in the alternative, to vacate his plea and sentences, in whole.”2 In his “Supplemental Memorandum,” he adds that he “unknowingly entered into a plea agreement, which * * * included an illegal non- parolable ten (10) year sentence.” He asserts in that memorandum that his entire plea should be vacated because his sentence “was the result of a plea agreement, and not a sentence following a conviction after a trial * * *.” 1', 'We note that Mr. Paiva did file a motion for postconviction relief, which was ultimately withdrawn and was dismissed with prejudice by the Superior Court on May 3, 2016. 2', 'Mr. Paiva filed a document before this Court entitled “Statement of Case and Summary of Issue” as well as a document entitled “Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant’s Supplemental Statement of the Case and a Summary of the Issue.” We have considered the contentions made in both of those documents and in his “Supplemental Memorandum.” We add that we decline Mr. Paiva’s invitation in his “Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant’s Supplemental Statement of the Case and a Summary of the Issue” to “clarif[y] * * * the ambiguity of his sentence.”', '-2-', 'III', 'Standard of Review', 'Rule 35 permits a court to “correct an illegal sentence at any time.” It has been “well established that [d]ecisions concerning Rule 35 motions are within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Roberts, 59 A.3d 693, 697 (R.I. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). As such, “[o]ur authority to review a trial justice’s decision on such a motion is extremely limited and should be exercised only when the sentence is without justification * * * and grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). However, this Court has stated that, “[w]hen faced with the interpretation of statutes and court rules upon review of a Rule 35 motion * * * we apply a de novo standard.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Given that Mr. Paiva’s contentions in this case require this Court to interpret § 12-19- 21(b), we shall do so in a de novo manner.', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'Mr. Paiva moved, pursuant to Rule 35, to correct what he contends was an illegal sentence. In this appeal of the denial of that Rule 35 motion, Mr. Paiva specifically calls into question the interpretation of the habitual offender statute—§ 12-19-21(b). The particular statutory language in the habitual offender statute to which Mr. Paiva directs this Court’s attention provides as follows:', '“If it appears by a preponderance of the evidence presented that the', 'defendant is a habitual criminal under this section, he or she shall', 'be sentenced by the court to an additional consecutive term of', 'imprisonment not exceeding twenty-five (25) years; and provided', 'further, that the court shall order the defendant to serve a', 'minimum number of years of the sentence before he or she', 'becomes eligible for parole.” Section 12-19-21(b) (emphasis', 'added).', '-3- In focusing on this statutory provision, we are guided by the following important axiom: “It is a fundamental principle that, when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” State v. Diamante, 83 A.3d 546, 548 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Only when a statute is ambiguous do we “apply the rules of statutory construction and examine the statute in its entirety to determine the intent and purpose of the Legislature.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Upon careful consideration of the statutory language at issue, this Court concludes that that language is clear and unambiguous. The statutory language does not require that a sentencing justice set a particular date when a defendant will be eligible for parole. The statute simply provides that a defendant must serve a minimum number of years (to be determined by the sentencing justice) before being eligible for parole. Mr. Paiva was sentenced under the statute to fifteen years, with ten years thereof being non-parolable. In so doing, the sentencing justice correctly complied with the statute at issue by ordering Mr. Paiva to “serve a minimum number of years of the sentence before he * * * becomes eligible for parole.” Section 12-19-21(b). What is more, even though the statute does not require the sentencing justice to issue a specific parole eligibility date as Mr. Paiva contends, in this case it is in fact clear that the parole eligibility date on Mr. Paiva’s habitual offender sentence is the date on which ten years of that sentence will have been served.', 'Accordingly, we perceive no error on the part of the hearing justice in denying Mr. Paiva’s motion to correct his sentence.', '-4-', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the above-stated reasons, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.

72,"Hexagon Holdings, Inc. : v. : Carlisle Syntec Incorporated et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The plaintiff, Hexagon Holdings, Inc. (Hexagon), appeals from the grant of summary judgment in favor of defendant McKenna Roofing and Construction, Inc. (McKenna). This matter originally appeared before the Court on an order to show cause why the issues in the case should not be summarily decided. In an order dated March 5, 2018, the Court returned the case to the regular calendar for full argument. Hexagon Holdings, Inc. v. Carlisle Syntec Incorporated, 179 A.3d 146, 147 (R.I. 2018) (mem.). In doing so, we “specifically direct[ed] the parties to brief the third-party intended beneficiary issue among such other issues that they consider germane to decide the issue before this Court.” Id. The parties appeared before the Court on October 3, 2018, for oral argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The pertinent facts are as follows. In 2006, Hexagon entered into a contract with A/Z Corporation to construct a new facility at the Quonset Business Park, located in North', '-1- Kingstown, Rhode Island. As general contractor, A/Z Corporation subcontracted the roofing installation to McKenna, authorizing McKenna to install a specific roofing system manufactured by defendant Carlisle Syntec Incorporated (Carlisle). Hexagon alleges that, almost immediately, the new roof began to leak.', 'On October 14, 2015, approximately nine years after first contracting with A/Z Corporation, Hexagon filed a complaint in Washington County Superior Court against Carlisle and McKenna, alleging breach of contract as to both defendants (Count I); breach of express warranty as to Carlisle only (Count II); and breach of the implied warranty to construct in good and workmanlike manner (Count III), misrepresentation (Count IV),1 and negligence (Count V), against both defendants.2 Hexagon alleged that McKenna had improperly installed the roof and sought to recover the cost of replacing it.', 'Hexagon did not assert claims against A/Z Corporation, the general contractor, for reasons Hexagon later described as “judicial efficiency and not choosing to damage a relationship with somebody that [it] had a positive relationship with * * *.” McKenna moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and provided the following as the undisputed statement of facts:', '“The plaintiff entered into a contract with A/Z Construction', '[sic] to act as a general contractor for the construction of its', 'building located at 250 Circuit Drive, North Kingstown, RI in', '2006. * * * Plaintiff alleges that Carlisle supplied a ‘Carlisle', 'Golden Seal Total Roofing System’ to the building. * * *', 'Plaintiff’s Complaint further alleges that Carlisle supplied it with a', 'written warranty concerning the roofing system dated July 15,', '2006. * * * McKenna was a subcontractor on the project, and', 'installed the Carlisle roofing system.', '“Plaintiff alleges that the roofing system failed. * * *', 'Specifically, the plaintiff claims that the roof began leaking in 1', 'McKenna filed a motion to dismiss the misrepresentation claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The motion justice granted the motion and dismissed that claim, without prejudice, and it is not part of this appeal. 2', 'The claims against Carlisle are not at issue in this appeal.', '-2-', '2006. * * * The plaintiff further alleges that the leaks are due to', 'defects in materials and/or installation.”', 'In its memorandum in support of its motion, McKenna argued that Hexagon did not allege viable claims for breach of contract and breach of implied warranty against McKenna because no contract existed between the parties. McKenna further argued that Hexagon failed to specifically plead that Hexagon was an intended beneficiary of the subcontract between McKenna and A/Z Corporation, as required by Rule 8 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In addition, McKenna argued that the economic loss doctrine barred Hexagon from recovering economic damages on the negligence claim in Count V of its complaint.', 'In its opposition to McKenna’s motion for summary judgment, Hexagon accepted McKenna’s undisputed facts in their entirety, and countered that its claims against McKenna for breach of contract and breach of implied warranty were sustainable because third-party intended beneficiaries can maintain a breach-of-contract claim even in the absence of a contract between a plaintiff and a defendant. Hexagon added that this theory did not need to be specifically pled and that, for summary-judgment purposes, it had provided sufficient proof of this third-party intended beneficiary theory by accepting the undisputed facts offered by McKenna. In this regard, we note that Hexagon failed to submit either the general contract between Hexagon and A/Z Corporation or the subcontract between McKenna and A/Z Corporation in its opposition to the motion. Addressing its negligence claim, Hexagon argued that the economic loss doctrine, which bars recovery for pure economic loss in a negligence action, does not apply to this case because no privity of contract existed between Hexagon and McKenna.', 'The hearing on McKenna’s motion for summary judgment was held on November 21, 2016. The motion justice granted the motion, holding that Hexagon was only an incidental beneficiary, as opposed to an intended beneficiary, of the subcontract between McKenna and', '-3- A/Z Corporation. The court reasoned that Hexagon had failed to show that it was directly and unequivocally an intended beneficiary. He held that the economic loss doctrine applied, barring Hexagon’s claim for pure economic loss, because the parties were engaged in a commercial transaction.', 'An order granting McKenna’s motion for summary judgment was entered on December 6, 2016. On December 19, 2016, Hexagon prematurely appealed to this Court.3 Final judgment was entered on December 27, 2016, in favor of McKenna on all counts of Hexagon’s complaint, pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'A motion for summary judgment “is designed to decide in an expeditious fashion cases presenting groundless claims * * *.” Gallo v. National Nursing Homes, Inc., 106 R.I. 485, 487, 261 A.2d 19, 21 (1970). When we review a hearing justice’s grant of a motion for summary judgment, we conduct our analysis de novo. Jessup & Conroy, P.C. v. Seguin, 46 A.3d 835, 838 (R.I. 2012). If we determine that “there exists no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law[,]” then we will affirm the grant of the motion. Sisto v. America Condominium Association, Inc., 68 A.3d 603, 611 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Zanni v. Voccola, 13 A.3d 1068, 1071 (R.I. 2011)). In this endeavor, “[w]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Narragansett Indian Tribe v. State, 81 A.3d 1106, 1109 (R.I. 2014). However, once the moving party establishes “the absence of a material factual issue, the party opposing the motion has an affirmative duty to establish either by affidavit or by other means the material issue of fact to be decided.” Grissom v. Pawtucket Trust Co., 559 A.2d 1065, 3', '“[T]his Court will treat [a] premature appeal as if it had been timely filed.” Terzian v. Lombardi, 180 A.3d 555, 557 n.4 (R.I. 2018).', '-4- 1066 (R.I. 1989). The party opposing the motion cannot establish a genuine issue of fact merely by resting on denials in its pleadings. Volino v. General Dynamics, 539 A.2d 531, 533 (R.I. 1988). Rather, the opposing party must “respond with specific facts that would constitute a genuine issue for trial.” Id.', 'In cases where a party seeks summary judgment on a negligence claim, “[t]he motion justice may treat the issue of negligence as a matter of law only if the facts suggest only one reasonable inference.” Berard v. HCP, Inc., 64 A.3d 1215, 1218 (R.I. 2013) (quoting DeMaio v. Ciccone, 59 A.3d 125, 130 (R.I. 2013)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Contract Claims', 'Hexagon contends that the hearing justice erred in granting summary judgment with respect to Counts I and III of its complaint, which allege breach of contract and breach of implied warranties.', 'The thrust of Hexagon’s argument is that, armed with McKenna’s undisputed statement of facts, a reasonable jury could find that McKenna owed a contractual duty to Hexagon as a third-party beneficiary to the subcontract between A/Z Corporation and McKenna. We are therefore called upon to determine whether the owner of a building may survive summary judgment based on a third-party-beneficiary theory where the only evidence presented was that the subcontractor may have had knowledge of the identity of the property owner, who was the ultimate beneficiary of the work that was performed.', 'We deal first with McKenna’s argument that Hexagon’s third-party beneficiary assertion is not properly before this Court because it was not specifically pled. Rule 8(a) requires a', '-5- complaint to contain: “(1) A short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief; and (2) A demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks.” A viable complaint must “give the opposing party fair and adequate notice of the type of claim being asserted[,]” even if it does not plead the ultimate facts or precise legal theory upon which the claim is based. Berard v. Ryder Student Transportation Services, Inc., 767 A.2d 81, 83-84 (R.I. 2001) (quoting Haley v. Town of Lincoln, 611 A.2d 845, 848 (R.I. 1992)). Here, even though Hexagon did not specifically reference the subcontract between A/Z Corporation and McKenna in its complaint, McKenna was on notice that Hexagon was bringing a claim for breach of contract with respect to this same transaction, even though the ultimate facts upon which Hexagon now relies are different from those set out in its complaint.', 'Further, “[i]t is well settled that ‘[w]hen one party for valuable consideration, engages another by contract to do some act for the benefit of a third party, the latter who would enjoy the benefits, may maintain an action for breach of contract.’” Glassie v. Doucette, 157 A.3d 1092, 1097 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Davis v. New England Pest Control Co., 576 A.2d 1240, 1242 (R.I. 1990)). “If the third party is an intended beneficiary, the law implies privity of contract.” Davis, 576 A.2d at 1242. That is to say, if Hexagon were an intended beneficiary of the subcontract between A/Z Corporation and McKenna, Hexagon could maintain a breach-of-contract cause of action against McKenna. Therefore, the issue of Hexagon’s claim for breach of contract as a third-party beneficiary of the subcontract between A/Z Corporation and McKenna is properly before this Court.', 'Having decided that Hexagon’s third-party beneficiary assertions are properly before us, we turn now to the question of whether its claims for breach of contract and breach of implied warranty may survive McKenna’s motion for summary judgment. “In order to prevail on a', '-6- contract claim as a third-party beneficiary, the claimant must prove that he or she is an intended beneficiary of the contract.” Glassie, 157 A.3d at 1097 (emphasis added).', '“An intended beneficiary of a contract ‘stands in the shoes’ of the promisee.” Id. (quoting Cathay Cathay, Inc. v. Vindalu, LLC, 962 A.2d 740, 746 (R.I. 2009)). Rhode Island courts follow the Restatement (Second) Contracts § 302 (1981) for guidance in distinguishing between intended and incidental beneficiaries of a contract. See Glassie, 157 A.3d at 1097; Cathay Cathay, Inc., 962 A.2d at 745, 746. This section reads:', '“(1) Unless otherwise agreed between promisor and promisee, a', 'beneficiary of a promise is an intended beneficiary if recognition', 'of a right to performance in the beneficiary is appropriate to', 'effectuate the intention of the parties and either', '“(a) the performance of the promise will satisfy an', 'obligation of the promisee to pay money to the beneficiary;', 'or', '“(b) the circumstances indicate that the promisee intends to', 'give the beneficiary the benefit of the promised', 'performance.', '“(2) An incidental beneficiary is a beneficiary who is not an', 'intended beneficiary.”', 'Both parties cite the Restatement (Second) Contracts § 302 at cmt. e., illustration 19 (1981), to justify their respective positions. This illustration provides: “A contracts to erect a building for C. B then contracts with A to supply lumber needed for the building. C is an incidental beneficiary of B’s promise, and B is an incidental beneficiary of C’s promise to pay A for the building.” In such a situation, the owner (C) is an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the general contractor (A) and the subcontractor (B). Incidental beneficiaries are not entitled to bring a claim for breach of contract under the third-party beneficiary doctrine. See Glassie, 157 A.3d at 1097; Restatement (Second) Contracts § 302(2). However, according to the Restatement (Second) Contracts § 302(1)(b), where a subcontractor provides more than mere materials, the owner’s status will change from incidental to intended beneficiary of the', '-7- subcontract, if “the circumstances indicate that [the subcontractor] intends to give [the owner] the benefit of the promised performance.”', 'As we have stated, “[t]he language employed by the parties to a contract is the best expression of their contractual intent, and when that language is ‘clear and unambiguous, words contained therein will be given their usual and ordinary meaning and the parties will be bound by such meaning.’” Cathay Cathay, Inc., 962 A.2d at 746 (quoting Singer v. Singer, 692 A.2d 691, 692 (R.I. 1997) (mem.)). Here, Hexagon has submitted neither the subcontract between A/Z Corporation and McKenna nor the general contract between Hexagon and A/Z Corporation into evidence; neither has it provided any evidence in the form of affidavits, interrogatories, or depositions to prove that the intent of A/Z Corporation and McKenna was to directly benefit Hexagon. While Hexagon proffers that this intent did exist, its only support lies in conjecture. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Hexagon, as we must, its only evidence— from the undisputed facts supplied by McKenna—is that McKenna may have known that Hexagon owned the building.', 'This alone does not create an issue of material fact as to McKenna’s intent under the circumstances to benefit Hexagon apart from its own contract with A/Z Corporation. See Restatement (Second) Contracts § 302(1)(b).', 'Hexagon relies on two opinions by this Court in support of its position. In the first, Davis, we allowed a subsequent purchaser to claim breach of contract as a third-party beneficiary of a termite-inspection contract. Davis, 576 A.2d at 1242. Ruling on “the granting of a motion for a directed verdict” below, “the trial justice found there was evidence on which a jury could say that there was a contractual obligation between [the defendant] and the [plaintiffs].” Id. On appeal, this Court cited to “a substantial body of case law that holds that a pest-exterminating company is liable to a plaintiff who purchases property in reliance upon a false or inaccurate', '-8- wood-infestation report provided to the vendor.” Id. Thus, in that case, privity of contract was created by a clear duty on the part of the inspector to the subsequent purchaser. See id.', 'In Credit Union Central Falls v. Groff, 966 A.2d 1262 (R.I. 2009), we recognized “that the liability of an attorney may extend to third-party beneficiaries of the attorney-client relationship if it is clear that the contracting parties intended to benefit the third party.” Groff, 966 A.2d at 1272. We then quoted an opinion of the Minnesota Supreme Court in holding that intended beneficiary status may be found where the “central purpose[,]” the “end and aim[,]” and the “heart of the contract” at issue were to benefit the third party. Id. at 1273 (quoting McIntosh County Bank v. Dorsey & Whitney, LLP, 745 N.W.2d 538, 547 (Minn. 2008)). On appeal, we affirmed a trial court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff because, under the circumstances, it was clear “that the legal services rendered by [the defendant] on behalf of his borrower-clients were done for the direct purpose of” benefiting the plaintiff lending institution. Id. at 1274 (emphasis added). Under the circumstances, the attorney-defendant clearly knew that the “central purpose” of the work he performed was for the benefit of the third-party lending institution, and, therefore, a contractual duty existed between the two. Id.', 'In both Davis and Groff, it was clear, under the particular circumstances of each case, that the contracting party (the inspection company and the lawyer, respectively) intended to directly benefit the third party (the subsequent purchaser and the lending institution, respectively). However, in the instant case, it is difficult for us to discern the intent of the parties, due to the limited record; we do not know the “central purpose” of the subcontract between A/Z Corporation and McKenna, because that contract is not before us. Furthermore, we know little about other circumstances surrounding the contract between A/Z Corporation and McKenna; we', '-9- certainly do not know enough to find a genuine issue of material fact about McKenna’s intent to benefit Hexagon.', 'The motion justice granted McKenna’s motion for summary judgment on the basis that Hexagon was “an incidental beneficiary as opposed to intended beneficiary.” Looking to the Restatement, he went on to state that, under the circumstances, it “must be clear that the owner of the property was directly and unequivocally the intended benefi[ciary]. So that’s not the case here.” We agree that this is a correct statement of law and that the motion justice appropriately granted summary judgment in favor of McKenna on Hexagon’s claims of breach of contract and breach of implied warranties. See Groff, 966 A.2d at 1274. Although we have stated that “[s]ummary judgment is an extreme remedy that should be applied cautiously[,]” Hill v. National Grid, 11 A.3d 110, 113 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Plainfield Pike Gas & Convenience, LLC v. 1889 Plainfield Pike Realty Corp., 994 A.2d 54, 57 (R.I. 2010)), “[a] party who opposes summary judgment has a duty to establish that a genuine issue of material fact exists and may not rest solely upon allegations and denials in the pleadings.” Urena v. Theta Products, Inc., 899 A.2d 449, 452 (R.I. 2006). We are wary of allowing a party opposing a motion for summary judgment to point only to the moving party’s submissions, without providing anything of its own.', 'It is clear from our review of the record that Hexagon failed to include any discovery from McKenna in its opposition to McKenna’s motion for summary judgment. Furthermore, Hexagon has put forth no evidence, save for a suggestion—supplied by McKenna—that McKenna knew that it was performing work on Hexagon’s building. We are left with a sparse record containing no indication that, at the time A/Z Corporation and McKenna entered into the subcontract, there was a specific intent to benefit Hexagon. As such, we affirm the motion justice’s grant of summary judgment with respect to Counts I and III of Hexagon’s complaint.', '- 10 -', 'B', 'Negligence Claim', 'Next, Hexagon argues that the hearing justice erred in granting summary judgment with respect to Count V, alleging negligence against McKenna. Hexagon avers that, if there were a lack of contractual privity between Hexagon and McKenna, the economic loss doctrine would not bar recovery for purely economic loss due to negligence, even in a commercial transaction. The issue here is whether an owner of a commercial building may circumvent contractual privity with a general contractor by suing the subcontractor to evade application of the economic loss doctrine. We answer this question in the negative.', '“The economic loss doctrine provides that ‘a plaintiff is precluded from recovering purely economic losses in a negligence cause of action.’” Franklin Grove Corp. v. Drexel, 936 A.2d 1272, 1275 (R.I. 2007) (quoting Boston Investment Property # 1 State v. E.W. Burman, Inc., 658 A.2d 515, 517 (R.I. 1995)). “In other words, under this doctrine, a plaintiff may not recover damages under a negligence claim when the plaintiff has suffered no personal injury or property damage.” Id. Where there are damages in the construction context between commercial entities, the economic loss doctrine will bar any tort claims for “purely economic damages.” Id. (quoting E.W.

However, there is no legal requirement that Hexagon had to introduce its own evidence in order to survive McKenna’s motion for summary judgment. See, e.g., Nichola v.

Restatement (Second) Contracts § 302 cmt. e., illustration 19 at 444 (1981). The majority opinion even acknowledges that “according to the Restatement (Second) Contracts § 302(1)(b), where a subcontractor provides more than mere materials, the owner’s status will change from incidental to intended beneficiary of the subcontract, if the circumstances indicate that [the subcontractor] intends to give [the owner] the benefit of the promised performance.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)', 'Here, McKenna did much more than merely provide materials because McKenna actually installed the roof directly on the building itself.

Williams, 154 A.3d at 460 (vacating summary judgment where “the facts suggest more than one reasonable inference”). There is enough evidence here (notably, McKenna’s answer to Hexagon’s complaint and the statement of undisputed facts) to suggest that a jury could find that there was a third-party contractual obligation between Hexagon and McKenna.

73,Kendall Whitaker : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The State of Rhode Island seeks review of a Superior Court judgment that granted Kendall Whitaker’s application for postconviction relief. Before this Court, the state argues that it was error for the hearing justice to determine that trial counsel rendered constitutionally deficient representation when counsel (1) did not request a jury instruction for the aiding-and-abetting charges in line with Rosemond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65 (2014); and (2) did not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence that would support an aiding- and-abetting conviction. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2006, Whitaker was convicted of (1) count one, first degree murder, which merged with count two, first degree robbery, and sentenced to life; (2) count five, assault with a dangerous weapon, and sentenced to fifteen years, with ten years to serve and five years suspended, with probation; (3) count six, carrying a handgun without a license, and sentenced to', '-1- five years; (4) count seven, use of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and sentenced to twenty years to serve; (5) count eight, discharging a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence, and sentenced to life to be served consecutively with the first life sentence; and (6) count nine, committing a crime of violence while armed and having available a firearm, and sentenced to ten years. We affirmed his conviction in State v. Whitaker, 79 A.3d 795 (R.I. 2013), and the facts pertinent to the underlying case are set forth in that opinion. In this opinion, we will discuss only those facts that are relevant to this petition, which was filed by the state after the Superior Court granted Whitaker’s application for postconviction relief.', 'Whitaker was present at the apartment of Tammy Kennedy on the night in 2002 that Joel Jackson was shot and killed. He was accompanied by two friends, Brandon Robinson and Richard Isom. The three men had gathered earlier in the evening at Robinson’s home. When they arrived at Kennedy’s apartment, George Toby—Kennedy’s friend—engaged the three men in conversation, and at some point Whitaker, Robinson, Isom, and Toby all withdrew to the hallway outside the apartment. After engaging in another brief conversation, Toby left the three men in the hallway and returned to the apartment. According to Robinson and Isom, Whitaker stated that he wanted to steal a gold chain that Jackson was wearing.', 'Robinson and Whitaker then re-entered the apartment and a scuffle ensued.', 'Toby testified that he saw Robinson and Jackson struggling and that he entered the fight to separate the men. As he did, he noticed that Robinson was holding a gun, and he grabbed his hand in an effort to control the weapon. Corissa Richardson, who was only thirteen years of age at the time, but sixteen when she testified at trial, had accompanied Jackson to the party and said that she saw Whitaker remove a handgun from his coat pocket and point it in the direction of the melee. Isom, who testified pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the state, also said that Whitaker', '-2- entered the apartment with a firearm on his person, and Robinson, who was also a cooperating witness, said that Whitaker drew his gun after he came back into the apartment. The end result was that Robinson, Jackson, and Toby all received gunshot wounds; Jackson’s was fatal.', 'Robinson further testified at trial that, after Jackson was shot, he took the gold chain and a medallion that Jackson had been wearing. He said that he placed the gold chain in his coat pocket and carried the medallion in his hand. Isom testified that he later removed the gold chain from Robinson’s coat pocket. Whitaker, Robinson, and Isom were eventually arrested and both Robinson and Isom agreed to testify against Whitaker in exchange for charging and sentencing considerations.', 'After Whitaker was convicted, he filed a direct appeal to this Court in which he asserted various claims of error. Relevant to this appeal, Whitaker claimed on direct appeal that there had been insufficient evidence for the jury to convict him under an aiding-and-abetting theory. Whitaker, 79 A.3d at 805. However, we determined that this issue was not properly raised before the trial justice and therefore had been waived. Id. Whitaker also claimed on direct appeal that the aiding-and-abetting instruction that had been provided by the trial justice to the jury was erroneous. Id. at 807. Specifically, Whitaker claimed that “there was insufficient evidence in the record to support an aiding-and-abetting instruction because there [was] no evidence in the record to establish an action consistent with his supposed criminal intent.” Id. However, we held that, based on the testimony of Robinson, Isom, and Richardson, there was sufficient evidence in the record to support an aiding-and-abetting instruction. Id.', 'Nearly one year after we affirmed his conviction, Whitaker filed an application for postconviction relief. In that filing, he claimed that trial counsel had failed to propose jury instructions in line with Rosemond; specifically, that the state should have had to prove that', '-3- Whitaker actively participated in the underlying violent crime with advance knowledge that a confederate would use or carry a gun during the commission of the crime. Whitaker further argued that his trial counsel “failed to raise that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to convict him under an aiding-and-abetting theory because the jury found that there was no conspiracy, and the only evidence that supported aiding and abetting was the same evidence that supported the conspiracy count, on which defendant was acquitted.” 1', 'After a hearing, the hearing justice granted Whitaker’s application, directing that counts one (murder), two (first degree robbery), seven (using a firearm during the commission of a violent crime), eight (discharging a firearm during the commission of a violent crime), and nine (carrying a firearm during the commission of a violent crime) be vacated. In her bench decision, the hearing justice stated that the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Rosemond “should apply in any situation in which the prosecution relies on a theory of aiding and abetting, regardless of whether or not there are additional elements over and above those supporting the predicate offense.” 2 The hearing justice also held that, although the federal aiding-and-abetting statute and the Rhode Island aiding-and-abetting statute were different, Rosemond nonetheless applied to this case. Specifically, she found that “criminal culpability requires knowing and voluntary participation in a crime, as opposed to inadvertent, unplanned, or mistaken enablement of the crime[,]” and that “[t]his necessarily would require the aider and abettor to fully understand his cohort’s intentions beforehand and far enough in advance to opt out of the enterprise.” Additionally, the hearing justice recognized that there was a split of authority across 1', 'Whitaker raised additional arguments in his application, none of which are before us in this review. 2', 'The hearing justice also cited United States v. Encarnación-Ruiz, 787 F.3d 581 (1st Cir. 2015), for the proposition that Rosemond did not limit its application to so-called double-barreled crimes.', '-4- jurisdictions as to whether Rosemond should be given retroactive effect. However, irrespective of Rosemond’s retroactivity, she stated that she had the authority to grant Whitaker’s application for postconviction relief based on ineffective assistance of counsel. It was her opinion that the various aiding-and-abetting instructions she had given at Whitaker’s trial failed to incorporate Rosemond’s holding; namely, that the government had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt “that the defendant actively participated in the underlying * * * violent crime with advance knowledge that a confederate would use or carry a gun during the crime’s commission.” Rosemond, 572 U.S. at 67. She further stated that, had defense counsel objected to her charge, she would have considered Rosemond and instructed the jury differently. She therefore concluded that, because Whitaker’s trial counsel failed to so object, Whitaker had satisfied both prongs of the analysis set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), with respect to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 694.', 'Moreover, the hearing justice remarked that this Court, in the opinion affirming Whitaker’s conviction on direct appeal, “got it wrong when it stated * * * that there was sufficient evidence to instruct the jury on aiding and [a]betting.” Indeed, she offered that she should have been reversed on that claim because there was no proof that Whitaker had advance knowledge of Robinson’s intentions.', 'Accordingly, the hearing justice granted Whitaker’s application as to the aforementioned counts and directed that the judgment of conviction and sentences for those counts be vacated. We granted the state’s petition for writ of certiorari.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1, postconviction relief is a remedy “available to a convicted defendant who contends that his original conviction or sentence violated rights', '-5- afforded to him under the state or federal constitution.” Barros v.

Nonetheless, “when we are called upon to conduct such a de novo review with respect to issues of constitutional dimension, we still accord great deference to a hearing justice’s findings of historical fact and to inferences drawn from those facts.” Id.

State, 24 A.3d 557, 569 (R.I. 2011)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, the state argues that the hearing justice erred when she held that Whitaker’s trial counsel rendered constitutionally deficient representation because he did not request a jury instruction based on Rosemond for the aiding-and-abetting counts. The state also argues that the hearing justice erred when she held that trial counsels’ performance was deficient for failing to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence in support of an aiding-and-abetting theory.', '-6-', 'When examining claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, it is well settled that we will adhere to the requirements set forth in Strickland v. Washington. Navarro, 187 A.3d at 325. “[T]he benchmark issue is whether counsel’s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.” Barros, 180 A.3d at 828 (quoting Young v. State, 877 A.2d 625, 629 (R.I. 2005)).', 'An applicant must satisfy two criteria to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

Specifically, the second prong of Strickland requires the applicant to “demonstrate that the deficient performance was so prejudicial to the defense and the errors were so serious as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.” Barros, 180 A.3d at 829 (quoting Page v. State, 995 A.2d 934, 943 (R.I. 2010)). In other words, the applicant must show that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Id.

Spencer, 447 F.3d 6, 15 (1st Cir. 2006)).', 'A', 'Rosemond’s Applicability', 'The state argues that trial counsel did not render deficient representation by not seeking a Rosemond jury instruction for the aiding-and-abetting charges.', 'The state contends that Rosemond should not be given retroactive effect because (1) the ruling in that case did not come into existence until nine years after the trial in this case, and (2) the Supreme Court of the United States did not specify its retroactivity to cases on collateral review. Moreover, the state posits that Whitaker cannot be entitled to postconviction relief under Rosemond when there is evidence that he brought a weapon to the scene of the crime himself and that he discharged that weapon.', 'In Rosemond, the defendant participated in a “drug deal gone bad” in which either he or one of his confederates fired a weapon. Rosemond, 572 U.S. at 67. As a result of the uncertainty as to who discharged the firearm, the United States charged the defendant with violating 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), which prohibits “us[ing] or carry[ing]” a firearm “during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime[,]” as well as aiding and abetting that offense under 18 U.S.C. § 2. Id. at 68. The defendant was convicted and filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which affirmed his conviction. Id. at 69. In vacating the defendant’s conviction, the Supreme Court, on the defendant’s petition for writ of certiorari, first noted that the federal aiding-and-abetting statute derives from common-law standards for accomplice liability, and that “a person is liable under [18 U.S.C.] § 2 for aiding and abetting a crime if (and only if) he (1) takes an affirmative act in furtherance of that offense, (2) with the intent of facilitating the offense’s commission.” Id. at 70, 71. The Court acknowledged that an', '-8- aider and abettor’s conduct need only facilitate one element of the principal crime. Id. at 74, 75 (“In helping to bring about one part of the offense (whether trafficking drugs or using a gun), [the defendant] necessarily helped to complete the whole. And that ends the analysis as to his conduct.”).', 'However, with respect to proving mens rea, the Supreme Court held that a defendant’s intent must extend to the entire principal offense to be convicted of an aiding-and-abetting crime.

The Supreme Court further stated that, under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), the defendant’s knowledge of the presence of a firearm must be advance knowledge; in other words, “[w]hen an accomplice knows beforehand of a confederate’s design to carry a gun, he can attempt to alter that plan or, if unsuccessful, withdraw from the enterprise; it is deciding instead to go ahead with his role in the venture that shows his intent to aid an armed offense.” Id. at 78 (emphasis in original).', 'We note, however, that Whitaker was convicted not under federal law, but under Rhode Island’s aiding-and-abetting statute for the principal crimes of murder, robbery, and the weapons offenses. General Laws 1956 § 11-1-3 states:', '“Every person who shall aid, assist, abet, counsel, hire, command,', 'or procure another to commit any crime or offense, shall be', 'proceeded against as principal or as an accessory before the fact,', 'according to the nature of the offense committed, and upon', 'conviction shall suffer the like punishment as the principal', 'offender is subject to by this title.”', '-9- To convict a defendant as an aider and abettor under Rhode Island law, “the circumstances must establish that a defendant shared in the criminal intent of the principal [and that there was] a community of unlawful purpose at the time the act [was] committed.” State v. Delestre, 35 A.3d 886, 895 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Gazerro, 420 A.2d 816, 828 (R.I. 1980)). The prosecution must also “present some evidence that a defendant ‘participat[ed] in the criminal act in furtherance of the common design, either before or at the time the criminal act is committed.’” Id.

Diaz, 654 A.2d 1195, 1202 (R.I. 1995)). Under Rhode Island law, “(only) if [the] defendant knowingly and intentionally aided and abetted [the crime] could he be held responsible for the natural, or reasonable, or probable consequences of that act.” Id.; see also State v. Lambert, 705 A.2d 957, 963 (R.I. 1997) (holding that a jury instruction that stated that “[a] person who aids or abets is held responsible for the natural, or reasonable, or probable consequences of any act that he knowingly and intentionally aided or in which he assisted or participated” had “adequately summarized and instructed on the applicable law of Rhode Island on aiding and abetting”).', 'In our opinion, Rosemond plows no new constitutional ground and applies only to 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) and the federal aiding-and-abetting statute. It has no impact on state law. Other states and federal circuit courts are in agreement with this principle. See Hicks v. State, 759 S.E.2d 509, 514-15 n.3 (Ga. 2014) (noting, in a case involving state crimes, that Rosemond “arose under federal law and thus does not control here”); State v.

We addressed the circumstances under which a new rule of law is to be given retroactive application in Pailin v. Vose, 603 A.2d 738 (R.I. 1992). There, we adopted the framework set forth by the Supreme Court of the United States in Sawyer v. Smith, 497 U.S. 227 (1990), Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), and Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314 (1987). Pailin, 603 A.2d at 741. Relevant to this opinion, in Teague, the Supreme Court held that a new rule for the conducting of criminal prosecutions should be given retroactive application to cases on collateral review. Teague, 489 U.S. at 301. Specifically, “[t]he Court held that ‘a case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government.’” Pierce v. Wall, 941 A.2d 189, 195 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Teague, 489 U.S. at 301). “Thus, ‘a case announces a new rule if the result was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant’s conviction became final.’” Id.

The Supreme Court first observed that the federal aiding-and-abetting statute “reflects a centuries-old view of culpability: that a person may be responsible for a crime he has not personally carried out if he helps another to complete its commission.” Id. at 70. It then reviewed “some basics about [the] aiding and abetting law’s intent requirement,” and noted that it had “previously found [the] intent requirement satisfied when a person actively participates in a criminal venture with full knowledge of the circumstances constituting the charged offense.” Id. at 76, 77. The Court then stressed that “[t]he same principle holds here: An active participant in a drug transaction has the intent needed to aid and abet a [18 U.S.C.] § 924(c) violation when he knows that one of his confederates will carry a gun[,]” and it additionally held that the defendant’s knowledge of a firearm must be advance knowledge.

Moreover, an expert testified that the slugs taken from all three of the men who were hit came from a .22 caliber weapon, the same type of weapon that Isom and Robinson testified that Whitaker was carrying at the time. As this Court said in Whitaker’s direct appeal, a jury certainly could have found, and did find, that Whitaker brought a gun to the scene of the crime. See id. at 810. As other jurisdictions have held, Whitaker’s reliance on Rosemond, even if the case was applicable here, would nonetheless be misplaced, because he would have already had advance knowledge that a weapon was going to be used to commit the robbery.

This fact leaves the [PUC] powerless to act on', 'Portsmouth’s requests.”', 'In the PUC’s June 2, 2017 Report and Order in the instant case, the PUC expressed its understanding that, in the 1993 Order, it had held that § 39-2-5(2) required that the public utility propose the discounted rate and that the Division determine “whether the proposal would be just and reasonable, be required to meet the interests of the public, and not be unjustly discriminatory.” The PUC noted that neither prerequisite had been met in the instant case. The PUC proceeded to elaborate on the fact that the Town was contending that the PUC’s decision in the 1993 Order was “flawed” and that there should be no requirement that a rate discount for the Town be proposed by the public utility in the instant case (i.e., A&R Marine). The PUC went on to point out that “the Division had not performed an analysis of whether the rate would fall within the parameters of the statute’s exception to the anti-discrimination provisions [and the Town had not] presented a witness in support of its position through a cost of service study.”', '-5- The PUC concluded its decision with respect to the Town’s request for a discounted ferry rate by stating as follows:', '“In its next general rate filing, A&R Marine shall file a full', 'allocated cost of service study and at that time, may consider', 'whether to propose a special municipal rate. If at that time, [the', 'Town] wishes to seek a municipal rate, it should be prepared to', 'present expert evidence supporting such a proposal.

Since we are confronted with an issue of statutory interpretation in the instant case, our review is de novo.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'The Town contends before this Court that the PUC erred in denying the Town’s request for a discounted ferry rate. It avers that granting such a discount is within the powers of the PUC because the PUC has “inherent and plenary powers over all public utility rate[s] * * *.” (Emphasis in original.)', 'According to the Town, the PUC in the instant case “unlawfully continued with its self-imposed ban on consideration of nondiscriminatory municipal ferry rate discounts (of any kind) unless the ‘regulated’ entity authorizes the [PUC] to consider them.”', '-7- (Emphasis in original.) The Town contends that the statute at issue, § 39-2-5(2), unambiguously permits a public utility to propose a discount for a municipality but does not state that the public utility must be the entity that proposes such a discount. The Town then proceeds to contend that “[r]ecognition of the PUC’s power to establish rates that include discounts for municipalities performing essential governmental services is necessary and vital in order for the [PUC] to carry out properly its mandate under R.I. Gen. Laws § 39-1-1 to supervise and regulate public utilities and protect the public against improper and unreasonable rates.”5', 'In addressing the Town’s contentions, we turn to the statutory scheme at issue. General Laws 1956 § 39-1-1(c) provides as follows with respect to the general powers of the PUC:', '“[T]here is hereby vested in the public utilities commission and the', 'division of public utilities and carriers the exclusive power and', 'authority to supervise, regulate, and make orders governing the', 'conduct of companies offering to the public in intrastate', 'commerce * * * transportation services and water supplies * * *.” 5', 'A&R Marine contended in its filings before this Court that the Town’s request for a discounted ferry rate in the instant case is barred by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel, in view of the fact that the 1993 Order held that § 39-2-5(2) required that the utility propose a discounted rate for a municipality before the PUC could consider the discount.', 'For either the doctrine of res judicata or the doctrine of collateral estoppel to be even arguably applicable as a bar to the relitigation of issues raised by the Town in the instant case, a prerequisite would be that the 1993 case and the instant action be between the same parties or parties in privity with them. See Kenlin Properties, LLC v. City of East Providence, 139 A.3d 491, 497-98 (R.I. 2016) (“[C]ollateral estoppel applies when the case meets three requirements: (1) the parties are the same or in privity with the parties of the previous proceeding; (2) a final judgment on the merits has been entered in the previous proceeding; [and] (3) the issue or issues in question are identical in both proceedings.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); Hall v. State, 60 A.3d 928, 932 (R.I. 2013) (“Res judicata bars the relitigation of any issue that could have been litigated in a prior proceeding, including a direct appeal, that resulted in a final judgment between the same parties, or those in privity with them.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). A&R Marine conceded at oral argument before this Court that the Town was not in fact a party to the 1993 case. Neither A&R Marine nor the PUC has suggested that the Town is in privity with any entity involved in that 1993 case. As such, the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel are inapplicable to this case.', '-8- Chapter 2 of Title 39 of the General Laws then goes on to provide for the duties of utilities and carriers. Included in those duties are provisions prohibiting discrimination by utilities and carriers. See §§ 39-2-2, 39-2-3, and 39-2-4. The Town is seeking a discounted rate in the instant case that would, at first glance, seem impermissible under the anti-discrimination provisions. However, § 39-2-5 provides exceptions to the anti-discrimination provisions, and the Town is contending that the following exception applies in the instant case:', '“With the approval of the division any public utility may give free', 'transportation or service, upon such conditions as the public utility', 'may impose, or grant special rates therefor to the state, to any town', 'or city, or to any water or fire district, and to the officers thereof,', 'for public purposes, and also to any special class or classes of', 'persons, not otherwise referred to in this section, in cases where', 'the same shall seem to the division just and reasonable, or required', 'in the interests of the public, and not unjustly discriminatory.”', 'Section 39-2-5(2). The resolution of this case hangs on the interpretation of that statutory language.', 'It is a venerable principle that, in interpreting a statute, “our ultimate goal is to give effect to the General Assembly’s intent.” DeMarco v. Travelers Insurance Co., 26 A.3d 585, 616 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In that pursuit, we have noted that, “when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, [this Court] must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” State v. LaRoche, 925 A.2d 885, 887 (R.I. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Graff, 17 A.3d 1005, 1010 (R.I. 2011) (“[T]he plain statutory language is the best indicator of legislative intent.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). “Moreover, when we examine an unambiguous statute, there is no room for statutory construction and we must apply the statute as written.” LaRoche, 925 A.2d at 887 (internal quotation marks omitted).', '-9-', 'There are certainly statutory interpretation cases in which a court must engage in what one poet called “the intolerable wrestle [w]ith words and meanings.” T.S. Eliot, Four Quartets, “East Coker” pt. 2. This is not one of those cases. The statute at issue is clear and unambiguous: it states that a public utility “may * * * grant special rates * * * to any town * * *.” Section 39- 2-5(2) (emphasis added). It thus clearly does not give the PUC the power to impose a discounted rate on a public utility; rather, it grants a public utility the power to propose a discounted rate for a town if the public utility chooses to make such a proposal. Due to the fact that A&R Marine did not propose a discounted ferry rate for the Town in the instant case, under the unambiguous terms of the statute, the PUC was without authority to grant such a request from the Town.6 For that reason, we consider the Town’s contentions on appeal to be unavailing.', 'The Town emphasizes the broad authority of the PUC and its implied powers; it points us to numerous occasions on which we have recognized that broad authority as support for its reading of the statutory scheme at issue. See, e.g., Town of East Greenwich v. O’Neil, 617 A.2d 104, 110 (R.I. 1992); Rhode Island Chamber of Commerce Federation v. Burke, 443 A.2d 1236, 1237 (R.I. 1982); Bristol and Warren Gas Co. v. Harsch, 119 R.I. 807, 812, 384 A.2d 298, 300 (1978). However, with respect to the instant case, we simply need go no further than the plain and ordinary meaning of the clear and unambiguous statutory language before us. See LaRoche, 6', 'We note that it is a matter of disagreement among the parties whether or not the PUC actually reached the legal conclusion in the instant case that, in the Town’s words, “a ‘prerequisite’ for PUC consideration of any type of municipal discount is that the regulated entity requesting the [PUC’s] permission to increase rates charged to the public must propose such a discount.” The Town contends that the PUC did reach such a legal conclusion. A&R Marine and the PUC contend that it did not. Having extensively reviewed the Report and Order at issue, we are in agreement with the Town. Even if we agreed with A&R Marine and the PUC, we may affirm on grounds other than those relied upon by the PUC. See Miller v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 111 A.3d 332, 339 (R.I. 2015) (“[I]n reviewing the trial justice’s legal determinations, this Court has a prerogative to affirm a determination of a trial justice on grounds different from those enunciated in his or her decision[,] as well as a prerogative to overturn such a determination on different grounds.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '- 10 - 925 A.2d at 887; see also Graff, 17 A.3d at 1010. According to § 39-2-5(2), it would have been necessary that a discounted ferry rate for the Town be proposed by A&R Marine, and that plainly did not happen. Therefore, the PUC did not err in denying the Town’s request for a discounted rate.', 'It is our conclusion in this case that, before the PUC would have been legally authorized to act upon a discounted ferry rate for the Town, it would have been necessary, pursuant to § 39- 2-5(2), for A&R Marine to propose such a discounted rate; but A&R Marine never made such a proposal. Accordingly, we need delve no further into the other provisions of § 39-2-5(2).', 'Before concluding, we deem it important to note that, just as we hold in the instant case that a discount for a certain class of ratepayers must be proposed by the public utility, so too have we held in the past. In Rhode Island Consumers’ Council v. Smith, 111 R.I. 271, 302 A.2d 757 (1973), the PUC directed that the public utility include “in any new tariff a $1.00 per month discount for certain persons 65 years of age or over.” Smith, 111 R.I. at 301, 302 A.2d at 775. We held that we could find no authority for the PUC’s direction in §§ 39-2-2, 39-2-3, or 39-2-5. Id. at 302, 302 A.2d at 775. And, we further opined as follows:', '“While those sections generally prohibit preferential treatment to', 'utility customers, they do, by way of exception, authorize the', 'division to permit a utility to offer free or reduced rate service to', 'an elderly person. But the authority to grant that limited exception', 'does not carry with it the power to compel a utility to afford a', 'reduced rate to senior citizens. Under the statutes the initiative', 'rests with the utility, and the [PUC] cannot, unless so authorized', 'by the Legislature, compel its exercise.” Id. (internal quotation', 'marks omitted). Moreover, in Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce v. Public Utilities Commission, 121 R.I. 122, 396 A.2d 102 (1979), the PUC mandated that the first 300 kilowatt hours of electricity used per month by residential customers be exempt from the scheduled increases at issue. Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce, 121 R.I. at 126, 396 A.2d at 104. We determined that the PUC', '- 11 - based its determination on statements of “various witnesses who were really seeking a ‘lifeline rate’ which would have been designed for the benefit of elderly or poor residential users,” rather than on a request from the public utility. Id. We then definitively stated that “such a rate could not have been imposed as to elderly customers unless the initiative were taken by [the public utility] rather than the [PUC].” Id. In the instant case, we follow the same logic.', 'Accordingly, for the above-stated reasons, we affirm the Report and Order of the PUC denying the Town’s request for a discounted ferry rate for municipal vehicles and passengers performing essential governmental services.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the June 2, 2017 Report and Order of the Public Utilities Commission.

75,Summit Insurance Company : v. : Eric Stricklett et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. In this declaratory-judgment action, defendants Scott Alves, John Alves, and Cathy Alves (the Alveses) appeal from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Summit Insurance Company (Summit). The parties had sought, as an initial matter, to clarify Summit’s liability for prejudgment interest and damages above the policy limits set forth in Summit’s automobile insurance contract with its insured, defendant Eric Stricklett (Mr. Stricklett), pursuant to Asermely v. Allstate Insurance Company, 728 A.2d 461 (R.I. 1999), and its progeny. After a hearing on this issue, the trial justice issued a written decision, and final judgment was entered against the Alveses.1 The parties appeared before this Court on December 5, 2018, for oral arguments after full briefing of the issues. Upon due consideration of the parties’ arguments, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, albeit for different reasons than those set forth in the trial justice’s decision.2 1', 'Mr. Stricklett was not part of the final judgment and has made no appeal to this Court. 2', 'In so doing, we follow “our precedent of affirm[ing] the orders and judgments of a trial court when * * * there are other valid reasons to support the order or judgment appealed from.” McGovern v.

On April 26, 2002, a car operated by Mr. Stricklett struck and injured Scott Alves, who was eleven years old at the time.3 Scott suffered a fractured tibia and fibula and underwent three surgeries to repair the fractures. At the time of the incident, Mr. Stricklett’s vehicle was insured by Summit under a policy with a $25,000 per person, $50,000 per accident coverage limit.4', 'In December 2002, the Alveses provided Summit with Scott’s medical records. The Alveses alerted Summit that Scott was still undergoing treatment for his injuries and that medical bills from Hasbro Children’s Hospital had not yet been obtained. Shortly thereafter, the Alveses sent Scott’s hospital bills to Summit.5 In March 2003, Summit informed the Alveses that it had investigated the claim and had determined that Mr. Stricklett was not at fault for Scott’s injuries.6 Summit further responded that it would “make no offers on this case.” In a letter dated April 15, 2003, the Alveses’ attorney responded that he disagreed with Summit’s conclusion and that he and his clients were “still in the process of pursuing this claim.”', 'No further communication occurred between the parties for nearly eight years. On February 16, 2011, a new attorney for the Alveses informed Summit by letter that the Alveses 3', 'Because there are multiple defendants named “Alves,” for ease of reference Scott Alves will be referred to herein by his first name.

Souza told police that Scott jumped off the bicycle and ran across Newport Avenue without looking. According to the police report, three additional witnesses confirmed that Scott ran across the street without looking.', '-2- planned to proceed with a lawsuit against Mr. Stricklett.7 The new attorney indicated that he disagreed with the denial of Scott’s claim, and he asked Summit to provide information regarding the policy limits in their contract with Mr. Stricklett. Summit responded on April 6, 2011, requesting that the Alveses contact the insurance company to discuss the claim.8 In a letter dated April 8, 2011, the Alveses responded and requested that Summit provide them with a copy of the entire policy, including all endorsements, offering to forward a package of Scott’s records and bills to Summit. They stated that they would “not be in a position to discuss settlement * * * until [they had] seen the entire policy.”', 'On May 9, 2011, the Alveses sent Scott’s medical records and bills to Summit. Included in the package were hospital bills totaling $59,792.66 and a bill from University Orthopedics for $20,945. In the same letter, the Alveses stated that they were still waiting to receive a copy of the insurance policy. Then, in June 2011, after being informed that Summit could not locate a copy of the insurance policy, the Alveses made a settlement demand of $300,000 to Summit. The Alveses stated that Summit was liable for the policy limit of $25,000, and they added that, because Summit had failed to previously offer its policy limits, the insurer would “undoubtedly be held liable for all interest over and above the policy limit.” They also asserted that, if Summit failed to settle and the case proceeded to trial, it would be “liable for all damages over and above the policy limits in accordance with Asermely * * *.” Summit responded several days later by offering its policy limits, $25,000, on behalf of Mr. Stricklett. However, the Alveses rejected this offer and filed suit against Mr. Stricklett on September 26, 2011, after the parties had exchanged several more letters but were unable to reach a settlement. 7', 'The letter also indicated that Scott would be twenty-one years old on September 27, 2011— when the statute of limitations, which had tolled due to Scott’s infancy, would have run. 8', 'Summit was then known as NLC Insurance Companies. For ease of reference, the insurer will continue to be referred to herein as Summit.', '-3-', 'Subsequently, Summit filed a complaint for declaratory relief, naming Mr. Stricklett and the Alveses as defendants. In that action, Summit requested that the court determine “whether Summit has an obligation to pay any sums beyond its policy limits in connection with the underlying action[.]” Specifically, Summit asked the court to declare that Summit had “no duty to pay interest beyond its policy limits on any judgment in connection with the underlying action” and that it had “no duty to pay the Alves[es] anything beyond its policy limits on any judgment in connection with the underlying action[.]” The Alveses filed a counterclaim for declaratory relief solely against Summit, alleging that Summit was liable for “pre-judgment interest accrued upon all damages” from Scott’s injuries and “for all damages over and above any provable policy limit * * *.”9 Mr. Stricklett submitted an answer to Summit’s complaint, but he only indirectly participated in the litigation that followed.', 'Summit and the Alveses filed cross-motions for summary judgment in the declaratory- judgment action, which were denied after the hearing justice determined that there were genuine issues of material fact concerning what had transpired between the parties in 2003, following the Alveses’ claim.', 'In the meantime, an issue had arisen regarding whether the declaratory- judgment action should be heard and decided before the tort suit went to trial. The Alveses submitted a motion requesting that the declaratory-judgment action be given priority, and the Superior Court granted that motion.10', 'At the declaratory-judgment hearing, the Alveses opened by stating that, under Asermely and its progeny, this Court had created a “duty of good faith and fair dealing” on the part of an 9', 'The Alveses also claimed that Summit should be estopped from asserting that the insurance policy had a liability limit of $25,000 because Summit had not produced the policy. Summit indicated that, although it could not locate the original policy, it had information regarding the terms of the policy and its limits. However, the Alveses did not pursue this argument on appeal. 10', 'The attorney who represented Mr. Stricklett in the personal injury action also argued in favor of the motion to have the declaratory-judgment action resolved first.', '-4- insurance company “that runs to both * * * the first party claimant insured and also to third party claimants.” The Alveses also stated that an assignment was not required to activate the duty, arguing that the facts of both Asermely and DeMarco v. Travelers Insurance Company, 26 A.3d 585 (R.I. 2011), “just so happen[ed]” to involve assignments. Specifically, the Alveses averred that certain language in our opinion in DeMarco evidenced this purported extra-contractual duty of good faith and fair dealing.11 The Alveses noted that, despite the fact that they had not made a settlement demand within the policy limits in the eight years between 2003 and 2011, Asermely created a strict duty on the insurer to proactively engage in settlement discussions. The Alveses stated that bad faith on the part of the insurer is not a required showing, especially where the claimant’s injuries were severe and the policy limits are small in comparison. Moreover, the Alveses cited to our opinion in Kolc v. Maratta, 108 R.I. 623, 278 A.2d 410 (1971), as well as G.L. 1956 § 31-14-3(a) and G.L. 1956 § 31-18-8, arguing that, because there exists a duty to anticipate that minors might dart into the road, Summit should have known that Mr. Stricklett would have been found at least partly at fault for the accident and, therefore, should have offered to settle on his behalf.', 'Summit responded that Asermely and DeMarco were distinguishable from the instant case in that both involved assignments of the insured’s claims against the insurer and an offer from the injured party to the insurance company within the policy limits. Moreover, Summit, citing to our opinion in Auclair v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, 505 A.2d 431 (R.I. 1986), argued that an assignment was specifically necessary for a third party to have standing under Asermely because “[a]ny obligation to deal with settlement offers in good faith runs only 11', 'Although Skaling v. Aetna Insurance Company, 799 A.2d 997 (R.I. 2002), “involved the first party claim of an insured against an insurer rather than a third-party claim as was at issue in Asermely, we indicated that both cases implicated similar policy concerns[.]” DeMarco v. Travelers Insurance Company, 26 A.3d 585, 608 (R.I. 2011).', '-5- * * * to the insured.” Auclair, 505 A.2d at 431. Summit similarly distinguished Skaling v.

Aetna Insurance Company, 799 A.2d 997 (R.I. 2002) (Skaling II), on the basis that those cases involved first-party claims brought by an insured against an insurer, where the insurance company clearly owed a duty to the plaintiff-insured. Summit then averred that its investigation of the claim, which consisted of a review of the police report, was adequate for purposes of fulfilling any duty it might have had to investigate the Alveses’ claim in good faith.', 'One year later, the trial justice issued a written decision granting judgment in favor of Summit.', 'In that decision, the trial justice first interpreted Summit’s insurance policy and determined that the interest provision in that policy did not require that Summit pay interest in excess of the policy limit and that this contract provision did not violate Rhode Island law. Next, the trial justice interpreted the rejected settlement offer statute, G.L. 1956 § 27-7-2.2,12 and decided that the statute did not apply in this case because the Alveses had never made an offer to Summit at or around the policy limits. He then declined to rule on whether the prejudgment interest statute, G.L. 1956 § 9-21-10,13 was applicable in this case, stating that it would have been premature to decide this issue. 12', 'General Laws 1956 § 27-7-2.2 states:', '“In any civil action in which the defendant is covered by liability', 'insurance and in which the plaintiff makes a written offer to the', 'defendant’s insurer to settle the action in an amount equal to or less', 'than the coverage limits on the liability policy in force at the time', 'the action accrues, and the offer is rejected by the defendant’s', 'insurer, then the defendant’s insurer shall be liable for all interest', 'due on the judgment entered by the court even if the payment of', 'the judgment and interest totals a sum in excess of the policy', 'coverage limitation. This written offer shall be presumed to have', 'been rejected if the insurer does not respond in writing within a', 'period of thirty (30) days.” 13', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-21-10(a) states:', '-6-', 'The trial justice then addressed what he characterized as the main issue in the case: Whether Summit owed a duty to its insured, to the Alveses, or to others. First, the trial justice found that there was no evidence to show that Summit failed to properly investigate the Alveses’ claim, failed to engage in settlement discussions, or unreasonably denied their claim. The trial justice cited to Summit’s investigation of the police report of the accident in finding that there was no bad faith on Summit’s part in denying the Alveses’ claim. He also found that this Court’s opinion in Asermely was distinguishable from the present case in several respects. The trial justice pointed out that, because the Alveses were neither Summit’s insureds nor assignees of the rights of Summit’s insureds, they were owed no duty under Asermely. Next, the trial justice emphasized that an insurer owes its insured “unique rights belonging only to insureds.” He observed that insurance companies also owe a duty to their shareholders to pay claims reasonably and to avoid paying fraudulent claims.', 'In a ruling that would seem to contradict his previous analysis, the trial justice concluded that “Summit does owe a duty to the Alves[es] to act in a reasonable manner and in good faith in settling the claim against Mr. Stricklett.” He went on to state that Summit had fulfilled this duty and had acted appropriately under the circumstances. The trial justice declared that Summit is “not required to pay all prejudgment interest that has accrued on the action.”', '“In any civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a decision', 'made for pecuniary damages, there shall be added by the clerk of', 'the court to the amount of damages interest at the rate of twelve', 'percent (12%) per annum thereon from the date the cause of action', 'accrued, which shall be included in the judgment entered therein.', 'Post-judgment interest shall be calculated at the rate of twelve', 'percent (12%) per annum and accrue on both the principal amount', 'of the judgment and the prejudgment interest entered therein. This', 'section shall not apply until entry of judgment or to any contractual', 'obligation where interest is already provided.”', '-7-', 'Final judgment entered against the Alveses on March 13, 2017; and, on March 17, 2017, they timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled that ‘[t]he decision to grant or to deny declaratory relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is purely discretionary.’” State ex rel. Kilmartin v. Rhode Island Troopers Association, 187 A.3d 1090, 1098 (R.I. 2018) (quoting Sullivan v. Chafee, 703 A.2d 748, 751 (R.I. 1997)). “We accord great deference to the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury in a declaratory judgment action.” Id. “However, questions of law are reviewed de novo.” Id. “Accordingly[,] we review a declaratory decree of the Superior Court with an eye to whether the court abused its discretion, misinterpreted the applicable law, overlooked material facts, or otherwise exceeded its authority.” Id. (quoting Sullivan, 703 A.2d at 751).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'In their papers submitted to this Court on appeal, the Alveses aver that the duty of an insurer to affirmatively settle an insurance claim on behalf of its insured, which we established in Asermely and further clarified in its progeny cases, Skaling I, Skaling II, and DeMarco, applies with equal force to third-party claimants in the form of a duty of good faith and fair dealing. Specifically, the Alveses claim that “[w]hen read together Asermely, Skaling II, and DeMarco instruct that a duty of good faith and fair dealing runs from the insurer to the third-party claimant regardless of whether there has been an assignment of the insured’s rights.” Contrary to this contention, however, this Court has never recognized such a duty and has never held that an', '-8- insurer has extracontractual liability to a third-party claimant in addition to a contractual, fiduciary duty to its insured for failing to settle a claim in a timely manner where § 27-7-2.2 was not applicable. Because of the somewhat contradictory holding in the decision below and the misconceptions that the Alveses seem to have regarding our precedent, we find it necessary to clarify these opinions in the instant case.', 'We begin our discussion with Asermely, the first in the line of relevant opinions. In that case, the plaintiff was involved in an automobile accident with a vehicle insured by Allstate Insurance Company under a policy with a $50,000 limit. Asermely, 728 A.2d at 462. After the plaintiff filed suit, the parties were referred to arbitration, after which the arbitrator issued an award in favor of the plaintiff totaling $47,557.37. Id. Although the plaintiff accepted this award, Allstate decided to take its chances at trial and promptly rejected the result of arbitration. Id. After trial, a verdict entered for the plaintiff in the amount of $86,333.57, including interest, which was well above both the policy limit and the arbitrator’s award. Id. Subsequent to the entry of judgment, Allstate attempted to tender the full policy limit by issuing a check for $50,000, noting that the check was in “final settlement” of the entire claim. Id. at 462-63. After the plaintiff refused to endorse this offer, Allstate sent another check for the same amount, this time without the limiting language, and the plaintiff accepted. Id. at 463.', 'The plaintiff in Asermely, having received an assignment of the insured’s claims against Allstate, brought an action directly against Allstate, alleging, inter alia, that Allstate had “disregarded its duty to its insured in bad faith.” Asermely, 728 A.2d at 464. The Superior Court eventually granted summary judgment in favor of Allstate on that count. Id. On appeal, we reversed the grant of summary judgment and took the “opportunity to promulgate a new rule to guide the trial courts in deciding these issues.” Id. We stated: “This Court has held that an', '-9- insurance company has a fiduciary obligation to act in the ‘best interests of its insured in order to protect the insured from excess liability * * * [and to] refrain from acts that demonstrate greater concern for the insurer’s monetary interest than the financial risk attendant to the insured’s situation.” Id. (quoting Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island v. Rhode Island Insurers’ Insolvency Fund, 703 A.2d 1097, 1102 (R.I. 1997)).', 'We further explained this standard, stating that:', '“[I]f it has been afforded reasonable notice and if a plaintiff has', 'made a reasonable written offer to a defendant’s insurer to settle', 'within the policy limits, the insurer is obligated to seriously', 'consider such an offer. If the insurer declines to settle the case', 'within the policy limits, it does so at its peril in the event that a', 'trial results in a judgment that exceeds the policy limits, including', 'interest.” Id. (emphasis added). We clarified that “[t]his fiduciary obligation extends not only to the insurance company’s own insured, but also, as in this case, to a party to whom the insureds have assigned their rights.”14 Id. (emphasis added).', 'Unlike Asermely, Skaling I and Skaling II involved a first-party claim brought by an insured directly against its insurer for the refusal to pay underinsured motorist (UIM) benefits pursuant to the insurance contract involved in those cases. See Skaling II, 799 A.2d at 1001; Skaling I, 742 A.2d at 286. There, the plaintiff-insured was severely injured in the aftermath of a drunken escapade, when he attempted to rescue an individual who had fallen off a narrow wooden railroad trestle bridge upon which the vehicle, in which the individual had been a passenger, was parked. Skaling I, 742 A.2d at 286. The driver of the vehicle had gone to the 14', 'In Asermely v. Allstate Insurance Company, 728 A.2d 461 (R.I. 1999), the plaintiff herself did not benefit from this new rule because we held that the claim was debatable as a matter of law, and we upheld the trial justice’s grant of summary judgment on the count alleging insurer bad faith. Asermely, 728 A.2d at 464. As we have said: “If the claim is ‘fairly debatable,’ there can be no liability in tort.” Id. (quoting Rumford Property and Liability v. Carbone, 590 A.2d 398, 400 (R.I. 1991)).', '- 10 - plaintiff’s house for help and the plaintiff went to the scene; he fell to the ground below after trying to navigate around the vehicle on the bridge during an attempt to find the individual. Id. After the plaintiff brought a claim against the driver’s insurance company, the driver’s insurer paid the plaintiff $25,000, the full policy limit, in settlement of that claim. Id. The plaintiff then sought compensation from his insurer, Aetna, pursuant to an uninsured or underinsured (UM- UIM) provision in his own insurance policy. Id. However, Aetna denied this request outright because it believed that the injuries “did not arise from [the driver’s] ownership, maintenance, or use of his Jeep * * *.” Id.', 'The plaintiff “then filed a complaint in Superior Court seeking a declaration that he was entitled to compensation from Aetna under the UM provision of his insurance policy,[] and also seeking damages for Aetna’s alleged breach of his insurance contract.” Skaling I, 742 A.2d at 286. After trial, a verdict totaling $1,174,500 was rendered against Aetna; however, final judgment was entered in the amount of $300,000, the policy limit, after the trial justice denied the plaintiff’s motion for the addition of prejudgment interest pursuant to § 9-21-10 and § 27-7-2.2. Id. at 286, 287. The plaintiff appealed this denial. On appeal, we held that Aetna was liable for all prejudgment interest pursuant to § 9-21-10, because Aetna had breached its duty to the plaintiff-insured “by refusing to cover the damages within the contractual limits.” Id. at 292.', 'After our opinion in Skaling I, Aetna moved for summary judgment in the Superior Court on an outstanding claim alleging insurer bad faith, arguing “that [the plaintiff’s] claim against the underinsured tortfeasor was a fairly debatable claim, thereby relieving Aetna of any liability for insurer bad faith.”15 Skaling II, 799 A.2d at 1001. The hearing justice granted that motion, and 15', 'We require a plaintiff alleging insurer bad faith to sever this claim from a claim for breach of contract. Skaling II, 799 A.2d at 1002; see Bartlett v. John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., 538 A.2d 997, 1001 (R.I. 1988).', '- 11 - the plaintiff appealed to this Court once again. Id. at 1002. On appeal, we vacated the decision of the hearing justice. Id. at 1000-01. We began our discussion by noting the differences between claims for insurer bad faith in the first-party and third-party contexts, stating:', '“In recent years, this Court has had occasion to address the refusal', 'or negligent failure of an insurance company to make a timely', 'offer of settlement in the context of both third-party claims, in', 'which the insurer is obligated to defend its insured against liability', 'to third-parties, Asermely * * * and in first-party claims, where the', 'insured has made a claim against its own carrier for compensation', 'arising out of injuries received from a UM-UIM driver.” Id. at', '1005 (emphasis added). We highlighted the fact “that the duty of good faith and fair dealing includes an affirmative duty to engage in timely and meaningful settlement negotiations and to make and consider offers of settlement consistent with an insurer’s fiduciary duty to protect its insured from excess liability” in both kinds of cases. Id. at 1005, 1006 (emphasis added).', 'However, this Court was called upon to reconcile this standard with an insurance company’s ability to deny a claim that may be “fairly debatable[.]” Skaling II, 799 A.2d at 1006. We held:', '“Although we decline to abandon the fairly debatable standard and', 'recognize that an insurer is entitled to debate a claim that is fairly', 'debatable, we are not persuaded that an insurer is relieved of its', 'obligations to deal with its insured consistent with its implied in', 'law obligations of good faith and fair dealing simply because the', 'claim is fairly debatable. Accordingly, an intentional failure on the', 'part of the insurer to determine whether there is a lawful basis to', 'deny the claim, standing alone, is bad faith. This can be established', 'by proof that the insurer ‘either intentionally or recklessly failed to', 'properly investigate the claim or to subject the results of the', 'investigation to a cognitive evaluation and review.’” Id. at 1011', '(quoting Thomas v. Principal Financial Group, 566 So. 2d 735,', '744 (Ala. 1990)). In conclusion, we reiterated that “the obligations imposed on insurers doing business in Rhode Island have never changed—‘an insurance company has a fiduciary obligation to act in the best', '- 12 - interests of its insured,’ and not its own pecuniary interest at all times.” Skaling II, 799 A.2d at 1012 (quoting Bolton v. Quincy Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 730 A.2d 1079, 1081 (R.I. 1999)).', 'Finally, in the DeMarco case, we were called upon to decide whether the Asermely rule should be expanded to situations with multiple third-party claimants. DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 605. In that case, an automobile crash led to multiple injuries and resulted in multiple claims against the driver who had caused the crash. Id. at 587. There, the plaintiff made a claim for the full policy limit of $1 million against the driver’s insurer, Travelers, which claim Travelers promptly denied, stating that it could not exhaust the full policy limit on the plaintiff’s claim. Id. at 588, 589. The plaintiff then commenced a personal injury action against Travelers’ insured. Id. at 589-90. Subsequently, Travelers offered, shortly before trial, to split the policy limits between the claimants. Id. at 591. The plaintiff rejected the offer and proceeded to trial for the full amount of his damages. Id. at 595. After trial, a verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiff for a total judgment amount of $2,801,939.07—including prejudgment interest—almost three times the policy limit. Id.', 'Subsequent to the entry of judgment, the plaintiff had executed a general release in favor of the insured in exchange for $550,000 from Travelers and an assignment of the insured’s bad faith claim against Travelers. DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 599, 600. The plaintiff-assignee brought suit, and the motion justice granted summary judgment in the plaintiff’s favor on the two declaratory- judgment counts. Id. at 601, 602. Travelers appealed, advancing two arguments in favor of reversing the grant of summary judgment: (1) the Asermely rule should not apply in the multiple- claimant context; and (2) the general release extinguished any and all claims that the insured had against Travelers, thus rendering the assignment of claims to the plaintiffs meaningless. Id. at 604.', '- 13 -', 'After considering the policy implications of imposing extended liability in cases with multiple third-party claimants, we dealt with Travelers’ first contention, holding that:', '“[W]hen an insurer is faced with multiple claimants with claims', 'that in the aggregate exceed the policy limits, the insurer has a', 'fiduciary duty to engage in timely and meaningful settlement', 'negotiations in a purposeful attempt to bring about settlement of as', 'many claims as is possible, such that the insurer will thereby', 'relieve its insured of as much of the insured’s potential liability as', 'is reasonably possible given the policy limits and the surrounding', 'circumstances.” DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 613-14 (emphasis added). We provided further guidance in the form of specific circumstances that courts should look to in the future when deciding whether an insurer had acted in bad faith in refusing to settle with multiple claimants. Id. at 614. Although this Court agreed that Asermely did apply in the multiple-claimant context, we nonetheless remanded the case on this issue for a determination by the trier of fact. Id. at 614, 615.', 'Regarding Travelers’ second contention, we examined both in-state and out-of-state precedent in deciding whether a release of claims by a plaintiff in favor of an insured extinguished any cause of action that the insured might have against the insurer. DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 620-24. This Court stated that, although the parties had not chosen “the ideal form” of release documents in that case, we would follow those jurisdictions that allowed an assignee to bring a claim against an insurer, even after the insured had been absolved through the execution of a release. Id. at 623-24.', 'We then looked to the intention of the parties in all the contemporaneous documents at issue in DeMarco, holding that “[i]t is clear * * * that the contracting parties sought to make it possible for [the plaintiff] to pursue claims against Travelers, including claims under Asermely and for bad faith.” Id. at 624 (emphasis added). Furthermore, we decided that the risk of collusion between the plaintiff and the insured “was', '- 14 - sufficiently low in the case at bar that upholding the validity of the assignment does not contravene public policy.” Id. at 628.', 'In their papers to this Court, the Alveses rely primarily on certain wording from our opinion in DeMarco to advance their contention that third parties may bring a claim, under Asermely, directly against an insurer, without an assignment: “Although Skaling II involved the first-party claim of an insured against an insurer rather than a third-party claim as was at issue in Asermely, we indicated that both cases implicated similar policy concerns * * *.” DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 608. However, these words should be read in the context of the entire sentence, where the Court went on to emphasize that “even if a claim against an insured is fairly debatable, an insurer ‘is nonetheless obliged to engage in settlement discussions in an effort to relieve the insured from the burden and expense of litigation.’” Id. at 608-09 (emphasis added) (quoting Skaling II, 799 A.2d at 1011).', 'Here, Asermely clearly does not apply to the Alveses’ case, given that no offer within the policy limits was ever made by the Alveses to Summit. See Asermely, 728 A.2d at 464 (“[I]f a plaintiff has made a reasonable written offer to a defendant’s insurer to settle within the policy limits, the insurer is obligated to seriously consider such an offer.”). It should also be abundantly clear from the opinions outlined above that, although the context may change—from third-party claims “in which the insurer is obligated to defend its insured against liability to third-parties,” to “first-party claims, where the insured has made a claim against its own carrier for compensation arising out of injuries received from a UM-UIM driver”—the insurance company’s duty to its insured in the underlying settlement discussions remains constant. Skaling II, 799 A.2d at 1005; see also DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 613-14; Skaling I, 742 A.2d at 292; Asermely, 728 A.2d at 464. While we had cause in DeMarco to expand this duty in cases involving multiple third-party', '- 15 - claimants and where a general release of claims against the insured was negotiated between the plaintiff and the insured, we have never allowed a third party to bring a claim under Asermely without an assignment from the insured.16 See DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 614, 625; see also DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 632 (Flaherty, J. dissenting) (“It is beyond dispute that Travelers owed no duty to DeMarco, a stranger to the insurance contract; and in making any claim against the carrier, DeMarco must stand in the shoes of [the insured].”).', 'As this Court held in Auclair, the relationship between an insurer and a third party is adversarial, “giving rise to no fiduciary obligation on the part of such insurance carrier to the claimant.” Auclair, 505 A.2d at 431. Accordingly, “there is no duty on the part of an insurance carrier for a third party to settle promptly with a claimant.” Id. Therefore, far from aligning with the Alveses’ contentions, our precedent dictates that “[a]ny obligation to deal with settlement offers in good faith runs only to the insured,” id., or, as in Asermely and DeMarco, “to a party to whom the insureds have assigned their rights.” Asermely, 728 A.2d at 464; see DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 624. We had the opportunity to reaffirm our holding in Auclair in both Cianci v. Nationwide Insurance Company, 659 A.2d 662 (R.I. 1995), and Canavan v. Lovett, Schefrin and Harnett, 745 A.2d 173 (R.I. 2000), the second of which we handed down after our opinions in Asermely and Skaling I. Canavan, 745 A.2d at 174-75; Cianci, 659 A.2d at 667. Moreover, as we have discussed, nothing in our opinions in Asermely, Skaling I, Skaling II, or DeMarco can be construed as overruling that precedent.', 'Therefore, because we hold that Summit owed no duty to the Alveses, we determine that the trial justice’s conclusion that “Summit does owe a duty to the Alves[es] to act in a reasonable manner and in good faith in settling the claim against Mr. Stricklett” and “that Summit fulfilled 16', 'By their own admission in their papers submitted to this Court, the Alveses have not received any assignment from Mr. Stricklett at this time.', '- 16 - this duty and acted appropriately” was not correct. We believe that this kind of duty on the part of the insurance company to third parties would expand an insurance company’s potential liability under Asermely too far and essentially announce a new, judicially-created cause of action.', 'Having held that Summit owed no duty to the Alveses, we need not address their contentions that the trial justice erred in finding that Summit had fulfilled its duty in investigating the claim or that he erred in declining to decide the applicability of the prejudgment interest statute, § 9-21-10, and the Skaling I rule regarding prejudgment interest. Additionally, because Mr. Stricklett was not made part of the final judgment in this case, Summit’s liability to Mr. Stricklett, under Asermely or otherwise, may be determined if Mr. Stricklett is found liable to the Alveses in an amount exceeding the policy limit in the underlying tort action. This is all in keeping with our “usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine[.]” Grady v.

For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On April 19, 2013, the complaining witness, Chris (Chris or complainant),1 then a young adult, contacted the police department in Warwick, Rhode Island, to report that defendant, her 1', 'The name of the complainant has been changed to protect her privacy. Likewise, we also use pseudonyms for the complainant’s sister and cousin.', '-1- uncle, had sexually abused her when she was six years old. 2 According to her testimony at trial, Chris was motivated to file a complaint at that time because she “didn’t want anyone else to get hurt.” On September 17, 2014, an indictment was returned, charging defendant with one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.1 and 11- 37-8.2.', 'The conduct giving rise to the indictment occurred during a sleepover at defendant’s home in August 2001.', 'Chris, who was six years old, and her cousin―defendant’s daughter―Kara, who was four years old at the time, were sleeping in Kara’s bed, which was located in defendant’s bedroom. Chris testified that defendant, wearing only a towel around his waist, entered the room, locked the door, and then proceeded to remove Chris’s pants, “lick his fingers and then started touching” her, putting his fingers “[i]n [her] vagina.” When Chris’s aunt Marilyn Colon (Marilyn), defendant’s wife, knocked on the door, defendant stopped, quickly threw a bedsheet over Chris, and opened the door. Chris testified that she pretended to be asleep while defendant was touching her, but that she “was confused” and “didn’t really know what was going on.” Initially, Chris did not tell anyone what happened, and years would pass before she began speaking about the incident, first with her cousins, then her mother, and eventually, to the police.', 'When she was between ten and twelve years old, Chris disclosed the assault to her cousins, Kara and Kara’s sister, but she decided not to tell her mother because she “didn’t want for [her cousins] to lose their dad and for the whole family to just destroy.” According to Chris, the family was very close and defendant was “basically [her] father” when she was growing up. 2', 'The individuals involved in this case are members of defendant’s family: Kara is defendant’s daughter; sisters Chris and Zoe are defendant’s nieces by his marriage to Marilyn Colon; Marilyn Colon’s sister is Chris and Zoe’s mother.', '-2- A few years later, when she was fourteen, Chris confided in her then-boyfriend, Angel Vigo (Vigo), who, unbeknownst to Chris, told a family friend about what Chris had told him. The family friend relayed this information to Chris’s mother, who confronted her daughter; Chris confirmed the allegation. Chris’s mother convened a family meeting to confront Marilyn and defendant with the abuse allegation. Marilyn and defendant denied the accusation, and the families subsequently became estranged. The police were not contacted at that time.', 'Time passed, Kara and Chris eventually reconnected, and Chris learned from Kara that defendant had sexually abused her as well as Chris’s younger sister, Zoe. This information was the catalyst that initiated a chain of events which culminated in this prosecution.', 'Prior to trial, on October 15, 2015, the trial justice heard several motions in limine, including the state’s motion to allow the testimony of Kara and Zoe under Rule 404(b); the state argued that the evidence established defendant’s “common plan or scheme” to molest young female relatives.3 The state also contended that the Rule 404(b) evidence was necessary for the prosecution because the allegations by Zoe and Kara were so inextricably interwoven with the crime alleged and explained the circumstances surrounding Chris’s belated, but eventual, disclosure of the abuse by defendant. Defense counsel countered that the Rule 404(b) evidence was not necessary to satisfy the state’s burden of proof and was unfairly prejudicial. The trial justice granted the state’s motion in limine, but explicitly notified counsel that he would be prepared to revisit the issue at trial and invited defense counsel to renew his objections accordingly. The trial justice noted: 3', 'The defendant also filed a motion in limine seeking to conduct an individual voir dire of Zoe prior to her testifying before the jury. Although the trial justice ruled that an individual voir dire of Zoe was unnecessary, we submit that, in the context of this case, a voir dire of this witness may have been helpful.', '-3-', '“But I want to be very clear, barring that I’m going to grant the', '[s]tate’s motion with a couple of caveats. First of all, you can raise', 'the issue again after the complaining witness testifies. And,', 'number two, depending on what is said on the witness stand, the', '[c]ourt will be willing to review, because once there is evidence in,', 'it may be another determination for the next witness in terms of', 'whether the prejudicial effect is outweighed.” When Kara and Zoe later testified at trial regarding allegations that defendant had also touched them inappropriately, defendant failed to raise any objection.', 'Before Zoe took the stand to testify at trial, the trial justice instructed the jury that the conduct about which the witness would testify was not to be used as propensity evidence and was admissible “for the limited purpose of this defendant’s intent, motive, opportunity, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity with respect to this case, but for no other purpose.”4 Zoe was asked on direct examination by the prosecutor to recall an incident that occurred when she was eight or nine years old, during a New Year’s Eve party at defendant’s house. Zoe testified that she and Kara, who was eleven or twelve years old at the time, were asleep in defendant’s bedroom when defendant entered, pulled down Zoe’s pants, and “started touching [her] private 4', 'The trial justice’s full instruction to the jury stated:', '“Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, again we are back to a witness', 'that may have certain direct testimony in terms of what she saw,', 'heard, or observed with respect to the case that is before you.', 'There also would be a fair amount of evidence, which, again, is not', 'propensity evidence, which is not if you believe it, it does not', 'necessarily mean that this incident occurred.', '“Again, as I told you before, you can consider that evidence for the', 'limited purpose of this defendant’s intent, motive, opportunity,', 'preparation, plan, knowledge, identity with respect to this case, but', 'for no other purpose.', '“Again, I gave you the example of a bank robber very early on.', 'Just because there is other evidence cannot be used for the jury', '[sic] that because someone may have done something or is alleged', 'to have done something before that he absolutely did it in this', 'case.”', '-4- spot.” She testified that, while this was happening, she reached for Kara’s hand and the two held hands. After defendant left, Kara pleaded with Zoe not to say anything. It was not until several years later, when Chris confronted her, that Zoe confirmed the incident. Chris testified that it was this disclosure that prompted her to notify the police, so that no one else could be hurt.', 'Kara, on the other hand, testified that, although she previously had made statements to police indicating that defendant had touched Zoe at the New Year’s Eve party, she recanted those statements to defense counsel on the eve of trial. She admitted that “someone” had gotten into the bed, laid down, and touched Zoe “in a very inappropriate way” that night, but claimed that it was not her father. According to Kara’s testimony, she merely reported what Chris told her had occurred. Kara explained that she initially stated that it was defendant because that was “what [her] cousin had told [her.]” Kara similarly recanted an allegation she had made to police that defendant had molested her when she was five or six years old. On cross-examination, defense counsel asked Kara why she fabricated these stories. She responded, “From what I was told,” and she was subsequently asked, “By whom?” The state objected, and the trial justice sustained the objection but allowed Kara’s response “From what I was told” to remain on the record. Defense counsel later returned to this line of questioning when he asked Kara why she made false allegations against defendant to her physician.', 'Kara began to answer, but the state objected. The trial justice sustained the state’s objection.', 'The state also called Chris’s former boyfriend, Vigo, and asked him to recall what Chris had confessed to him when she was fourteen years old regarding her uncle. The defendant objected, and the state responded by asserting that the statement was admissible as a “prior inconsistent statement” of the complainant. The defendant’s objection was overruled, and Vigo testified that “[t]he confession was she was molested by her uncle.”', '-5-', 'After a five-day jury trial, defendant was found guilty of one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial and sentenced defendant to a term of fifty years in prison, with thirty-five years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation. The defendant timely appealed.', 'Analysis', 'Testimony of Other Sexual Misconduct', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred by allowing evidence of other alleged sexual misconduct by defendant to be presented to the jury through the testimony of Zoe, in violation of Rules 403 and 404(b).

Dubois, 36 A.3d 191, 199 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. John, 881 A.2d 920, 926 (R.I. 2005)). However, it is also well recognized that “[e]vidence of other conduct, even of a criminal nature, may be received if it is interwoven with the current charge in a way that tends to establish guilty knowledge, intent, motive, design, plan, scheme, system, or the like.” Id. (quoting John, 881 A.2d at 926). This Court has “permitted the introduction of other crimes evidence when crimes are interwoven or in instances when introduction is necessary for a trier of fact to hear a complete and * * * coherent story so as to make an accurate determination of guilt or innocence.” State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1214 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 950 (R.I. 2008)).', 'Accordingly, “it is within the sound discretion of the trial justice to determine ‘whether this type of evidence should be admitted, excluded, or limited.’” State v. Buchanan, 81 A.3d 1119, 1125 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Dubois, 36 A.3d at 200). In exercising that discretion, the trial justice balances the relevance of the evidence against its potential prejudicial effect on the', '-6- factfinder. See Ciresi, 45 A.3d at 1211. When the scale tips in favor of admitting testimony of other sexual acts into evidence, “the trial justice must offer a limiting instruction to guide the jury’s consideration of the evidence * * * and caution that it not be used to prove defendant is a bad person or that he acted in conformity with the evidence.” Dubois, 36 A.3d at 201. Correspondingly, this Court will not disturb a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence unless the probative value was substantially outweighed by the prejudicial effect of the evidence and there was a clear abuse of discretion. See Ciresi, 45 A.3d at 1211.', 'As noted above, the state filed a motion in limine seeking to introduce evidence of allegations of sexual misconduct committed by defendant against Zoe. Although the trial justice granted the state’s motion, his ruling was not final. This Court has firmly held that a trial justice’s rulings on motions in limine are preliminary in nature. See Buchanan, 81 A.3d at 1126 (recognizing that “the grant or denial of a motion in limine is by no means a final ruling on the admissibility of the evidence addressed in the motion”). “[T]he inherent purpose of a motion in limine ‘is to prevent the proponent of potentially prejudicial matter from displaying it to the jury * * * in any manner until the trial court has ruled upon its admissibility in the context of the trial itself[.]’” Id. (quoting Ciresi, 45 A.3d at 1212). As such, “an in limine ruling is not final and a trial justice is vested with broad discretion to reconsider the ruling as the trial unfolds.” Id. Accordingly, it is incumbent upon counsel to raise “timely and appropriate” evidentiary objections throughout the trial in order to preserve the issues for appeal. Ciresi, 45 A.3d at 1212 (quoting In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273, 1280 (R.I. 2011)).', 'In this case, when ruling on the state’s motion in limine, the trial justice explicitly stated that he would be willing to review his ruling on the motion at trial, and he invited defendant to raise the issue again during the trial testimony, signifying the preliminary nature of his ruling.', '-7- However, although defendant had objected to and argued against the state’s motion during the pretrial proceedings, he failed to object when statements referencing the other alleged acts of molestation against Zoe were introduced into evidence, and he failed to object when Zoe testified that defendant had touched her on New Year’s Eve when she was eight or nine years old.5', 'A careful review of the trial transcripts discloses that, after Zoe had testified, the state called Amy P. Goldberg, M.D. (Dr. Goldberg), who testified as an expert in child-abuse pediatrics. Defense counsel objected to testimony relating to Zoe’s medical history obtained by Dr. Goldberg. Defense counsel told the trial justice:', '“Your Honor, at this point I think I will forward an objection based', 'upon the fact that we are intertwining [Chris] and [Zoe]. With', 'regard to [Zoe], your Honor, I believe, I still have a 403 objection', 'and I believe that at this time I will enforce that 403 objection with', 'regard to this witness.” A sidebar conference was held, at which defense counsel argued:', '“* * * You have been clear about the 403 with regard to [Zoe],', 'with regard to [Kara] and their testimony, your Honor, but at this', 'point now we’re having a third person testifying about the same', 'incidents. * * * The [s]tate has been able to explore this through', 'direct testimony. Now, they’re getting additional testimony.”6 We are therefore satisfied that defendant’s objection with respect to any Rule 404(b) evidence was not preserved for appeal.', 'Further, it is apparent that Zoe’s allegations were so intertwined with the complainant’s allegations and the circumstances surrounding the complainant’s inevitable disclosure to the 5', 'Before Zoe testified, a sidebar conference occurred that was not recorded. There is nothing before us to suggest that defendant at that time renewed his Rule 404(b) objection with respect to any of Zoe’s testimony. 6', 'The trial justice ultimately ruled that the probative value of Zoe’s medical history outweighed its prejudicial effect and admitted the evidence. Following direct examination of Dr. Goldberg, the trial justice administered a cautionary instruction to the jury on the limited purpose for which Dr. Goldberg’s testimony could be considered.', '-8- police that the evidence was necessary for a coherent chronology of the events in this case. Correspondingly, an examination of the record shows that the trial justice, on six separate occasions, including immediately before Zoe testified, complied with his obligation to provide the jury with a limiting instruction about the use of such evidence. See Dubois, 36 A.3d at 201. The defendant did not object to the instructions, nor did he renew his Rule 404(b) argument during the trial. Moreover, Zoe’s testimony proved fruitful grounds for defendant’s closing argument, during which defense counsel relied on Zoe’s testimony to attempt to undermine the credibility of the complainant.', 'Accordingly, because there was no objection to the proffered testimony, we deem defendant’s argument waived. See Ciresi, 45 A.3d at 1212 (noting that “the ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes a litigant from arguing an issue on appeal that has not been articulated at trial”) (quoting State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Limited Witness Testimony', 'Next, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he sustained the state’s objections to questions posed to Kara by defense counsel on cross-examination that pertained to her initial allegations and later recantation about abuse by her father. On appeal, defendant suggests that he was attempting to proceed on a theory that someone else had influenced Kara to make the initial false reports. This argument is without merit.', '“This Court repeatedly has recognized the well-established, constitutionally-protected right of a criminal defendant to effective cross-examination of the prosecution’s witnesses.” Dubois, 36 A.3d at 198. However, “[t]his right is not absolute[.]” Id. “When we review a contention that a defendant’s right to cross-examination erroneously was limited by the trial justice, we look to whether the trial justice clearly abused his or her discretion when limiting the', '-9- scope of the cross-examination.” State v. Moore, 154 A.3d 472, 485 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Alston, 47 A.3d 234, 249 (R.I. 2012)).', 'Here, defendant asserts that the jury was confronted with two discrete questions— namely, why Kara made the false reports and, correspondingly, who influenced her to make them. Yet, an inspection of the record reveals that, when the state objected to defense counsel’s questioning of Kara as to why she made the reports in the first instance, defendant failed to rephrase the questions or make an offer of proof that the testimony he intended to elicit would have led to relevant evidence, and instead simply moved on. See Moore, 154 A.3d at 485 (upholding the trial justice’s limitation of cross-examination because the defendant failed to make an offer of proof that further cross-examination would have elicited relevant evidence); Alston, 47 A.3d at 249 (same). In any event, we are hard-pressed to see how this evidence was relevant and important to defendant at trial because, instead of specifying the purpose for which he was asking these questions or attempting to rephrase the questions, defense counsel simply moved on to another line of inquiry. See State v. Hazard, 785 A.2d 1111, 1116 (R.I. 2001) (holding that the defendant had failed to preserve his objection to evidentiary rulings for this Court’s review where defense counsel “simply moved on to his next cross-examination question without even indicating what answers he expected to receive”). Accordingly, defendant has failed to preserve his objection to these evidentiary rulings for our review on appeal.', 'We pause to note, however, that an exception to the raise-or-waive rule exists for issues involving a basic constitutional right. Accordingly, even if the trial justice’s decision to limit cross-examination was erroneous, it nonetheless would not constitute reversible error “if the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Hazard, 785 A.2d at 1116. In determining harmless error, this Court looks to the following factors: “the importance of the witness’s', '- 10 - testimony; whether the testimony was cumulative; the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the witness’s testimony on material points; the extent of cross- examination otherwise permitted; and the overall strength of the prosecution’s case.” Id.', 'Were we to conclude that the trial justice erred in the present case, such error would have been harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because, although Kara was prevented from expressly identifying Chris as the alleged catalyst for her disclosure, this fact was readily apparent from Kara’s earlier testimony. For example, when Kara was asked whether she told the police what she remembered, she responded, “I told them what [Chris] had told me when I was younger.” When similarly asked about a statement she gave to a doctor, Kara responded, “[Chris] told me what had happened to me so I repeated it to the doctor.”7 Notably, in his closing argument, defense counsel outwardly exploited this inference, stating that Kara had “incorporated the story that [Chris] had developed because [Chris] told her that’s what happened.” For this reason, we hold that, even if defendant had properly preserved his objections, the evidence defendant sought to elicit from Kara was merely cumulative.', 'Rule 801(d)(1)(A) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence', 'Lastly, defendant contends that the trial justice erred when he permitted Chris’s former boyfriend, Vigo, to testify about the complainant’s disclosure that she was molested by her uncle. Specifically, defendant argues that the trial justice committed reversible error when he allowed Vigo to recount Chris’s disclosure after the prosecutor indicated that the evidence was offered as a prior inconsistent statement of the complainant under Rule 801(d)(1)(A). The defendant argues that this evidence amounted to improper bolstering. We disagree. 7', 'The bracketed alterations here indicate instances where Kara used the complainant’s actual name, and we have substituted the pseudonym.', '- 11 -', 'As explicated above, “we review a trial justice’s evidentiary rulings under an abuse of discretion rubric, and will not overturn a trial justice’s decision with respect to evidentiary issues unless it constitutes an abuse of that discretion and prejudices the complaining party.” State v. Florez, 138 A.3d 789, 793 (R.I. 2016). We are “disinclined to perceive an abuse of discretion so long as the record contains some grounds for supporting the trial justice’s decision * * *.” State v. Cavanaugh, 158 A.3d 268, 279 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 838 (R.I 2013)).', 'We conclude that this argument was also not properly preserved for appellate review. On direct examination, the prosecutor asked Vigo what Chris had confessed to him about her uncle when she was approximately fourteen years old. At that point, defense counsel stated, “Objection, your Honor.” Counsel failed to articulate any ground for the objection and simply proffered a general objection to the question. It was the prosecutor who responded with a non- hearsay ground for admissibility, stating, “Judge, prior inconsistent statement.” Defense counsel never indicated why the question was improper and, in particular, failed to assert at the trial level what defendant now contends on appeal, that it was impermissible bolstering.', 'In accordance with our well-settled “‘raise or waive rule,’ a litigant must make a timely and appropriate objection during the lower court proceedings before this Court will indulge the issue on appeal.” State v. Grant, 840 A.2d 541, 546 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Toole, 640 A.2d 965, 972 (R.I. 1994)).', 'Furthermore, when an evidentiary issue is raised on appeal, Rule 103(a)(1) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence explicitly provides that a finding of error must be based upon “a timely objection or motion to strike * * * of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not apparent from the context.” State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 646 (R.I. 2006) (emphasis added). On several occasions we have held that “issues that', '- 12 - were not preserved by a specific objection at trial, sufficiently focused so as to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis for said objection, may not be considered on appeal.” State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1107 (R.I. 1999) (quoting Toole, 640 A.2d at 972-73); see State v. Cook, 45 A.3d 1272, 1279 (R.I. 2012); State v. Merced, 933 A.2d 172, 174 (R.I. 2007). As such, “[g]eneral objections to the admissibility of evidence, when the context does not supply the specific ground for the objection, are thus insufficient to preserve the issue under Rule 103(a)(1).” Feliciano, 901 A.2d at 646.', 'In the case at bar, the defendant’s general objection failed to adequately alert the trial justice as to the basis for his concern regarding the admissibility of Vigo’s testimony. Similarly, the context surrounding the defendant’s objection also failed to supply the specific ground for the objection. For this reason, the objection was insufficient to preserve the argument for appeal.

The defendant timely appealed.', 'After thoroughly reviewing the record and after carefully considering the arguments of the parties, we vacate the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In August 1990, Richard Mouchon arrived at the West Warwick home of his grandmother, eighty-five year old Germaine Mouchon, intending to bring her to a birthday party for one of her great-grandchildren. When Mrs. Mouchon did not answer the locked door, Richard decided to check to see if she was doing laundry in another building of her elderly- housing complex. As he walked around the building outside her apartment, he peered through a window and was horrified to see his grandmother lying naked and in a perpendicular position on', '-1- her bed.', 'He immediately asked Mrs. Mouchon’s neighbor to call the police and the fire department. When first responders arrived, they found that the deadbolt on the apartment door was locked from the inside and, consequently, they were required to remove an intact screen from the apartment window to gain access into the apartment.', 'Detective Dennis Bousquet of the West Warwick Police Department arrived shortly thereafter and found that there had been no forced entry and, further, that the apartment was in relative order, aside from a woman’s slip or housecoat that had been discarded on the living room floor and an overturned plastic end table. A cigarette lighter and a small brown leather belt were discovered next to Mrs. Mouchon’s body.', 'The medical examiner, Francis Garrity, M.D., pronounced Mrs. Mouchon dead at the scene, and he also conducted a cursory external examination of her body. Upon a more detailed examination at the medical examiner’s facility, he catalogued injuries to Mrs. Mouchon’s head and face, including bruises and a lacerated upper lip. There was another bruise on her left breast. Doctor Garrity used cotton swabbing to sample tissues from the decedent’s mouth, anus, and vagina, sealed the samples in an evidence collection kit, and sent them to a laboratory for testing. The next day, Dr. Garrity performed an autopsy, which revealed fluid around Mrs. Mouchon’s lungs, an enlarged heart, and other indicators of a failing cardiovascular system. Significantly, there were no vaginal injuries and no defensive wounds, such as blood or skin under her fingernails or fresh injuries to her hands. However, the autopsy did uncover that Mrs. Mouchon had been suffering from a urinary tract infection. Based on those observations and findings, Dr. Garrity determined that Mrs. Mouchon’s cause of death 1 was “a heart attack or a cardiac arrest 1', '“‘Cause of death’ means the agent that has directly or indirectly resulted in a death[,]” and refers to the specific injury or disease that resulted in death.

However, when he later learned that laboratory testing on the evidence collection kit had revealed the presence of sperm, Dr. Garrity contacted Det. Bousquet to inquire as to whether Mrs. Mouchon had been involved in a relationship at the time of her death. Detective Bousquet questioned Mrs. Mouchon’s son George, her grandson Richard, and two of her friends, Anna Blais and Henriette Van Coughen. 2 After completing these tasks, Det. Bousquet advised Dr. Garrity that Mrs. Mouchon had not been involved in a relationship. Now believing Mrs. Mouchon to have “died as a result of actions of another[,]” Dr. Garrity changed his opinion as to the manner of Mrs. Mouchon’s death from “undetermined” to “homicide.”', 'Nearly twenty-five years later, Richard discovered Mrs. Mouchon’s death certificate among his late father’s belongings, and he was surprised when he discovered that his grandmother’s manner of death had been determined to be homicide. He contacted Detective Thomas Nye of the West Warwick police, who reopened what had become a cold case. Detective Nye got in touch with Cara Lupino at the Rhode Island Department of Health Forensic Laboratory, who was able to locate the evidence collection kit that had been created decades earlier by Dr. Garrity. Lupino tested the preserved cotton swabs inside the kit and successfully obtained a male DNA profile. She ran that profile through a DNA database and obtained a potential match for defendant.

Roscoe argues that those references to the rules of hearsay left the jurors with the impression that inculpatory evidence existed that was known to the state but was kept from them.', 'To support his argument, Roscoe cites Commonwealth v. Bolden, 323 A.2d 797 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1974), in which the Superior Court of Pennsylvania awarded the defendant a new trial after the prosecutor remarked during his closing argument that “there are certain things that I cannot tell you referring to this case.” Bolden, 323 A.2d at 798. The court held that “the implication is clear that there existed other incriminating or sinister facts which either were inadmissible or could not be produced. The reference could only lead to wild speculation by the jury in their determination of guilt.” Id. at 799.', 'While we agree that, at first blush, the comments by the prosecutor in the present case may resemble those made in Bolden, the prosecutor’s remarks here are distinguishable. As the trial justice ruled, when read in context, it is clear that the prosecutor was merely attempting, albeit ineloquently, to explain the complex and potentially confusing process by which sperm', '-6- was matched with DNA taken from buccal swabs and other samples. To us, that is quite different from the direct appeal to “wild speculation” that was found to be the case in Bolden. Here, the trial justice discerned no error in the prosecutor’s remarks, stating that, while “the [c]ourt’s ears went up” at the mention of hearsay, “what [the prosecutor] was trying to do is explain to the jury what the different swabs were and the different testing process that [the jury] heard or didn’t hear certain things.” The trial justice was in the best position to evaluate any prejudice that the prosecutor’s remarks might have engendered, sitting, as he was, in a “front row seat” during the trial. See Dubois, 36 A.3d at 197. He determined that there was no prejudice to defendant, and, as noted above, “[t]he ruling of the trial justice * * * is accorded great weight and will not be disturbed on appeal unless clearly wrong.” Id. We can see no error in his ruling about the prosecutor’s remarks regarding the rules of hearsay.', '2', 'Inferences Drawn from the Expert Testimony', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice erred when he allowed the prosecutor to mislead the jury by misstating the testimony of the medical examiner. We do not agree.', 'During the trial, the prosecutor posed this hypothetical to the medical examiner on redirect examination: “a person who has a serious heart condition, who is sexually assaulted and assaulted, what impact would you believe that the assault and the sexual assault would have on that person who has that type of heart condition?” The medical examiner’s response to this question was, “I believe it would cause an extreme risk to life. I think the individual, the decedent, would have suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of the stress, the panic, and the pain.” 4 4', 'Defense counsel did not object to this question, nor was there a motion to strike the resulting answer by the medical examiner.', '-7-', 'There can be no argument that posing a hypothetical question to an expert witness is appropriate. See State v. Feliciano, 901 A.2d 631, 643 (R.I. 2006). Roscoe assigns error, however, to the manner in which the prosecutor characterized the answer to that question in his closing argument to the jury. The prosecutor told the jury:', '“The next question for you is if you find there was a sexual assault,', 'the next question did she die as a result of the sexual assault. And', 'I am going to direct your attention back to Dr. Garrity, the expert', 'in this case, ‘The pain, the panic, the anxiety of the sexual assault', 'pushed this woman over the edge.’” Roscoe argues before this Court, as he did below, that with those remarks the prosecutor purported to directly quote Dr. Garrity, but in fact he blatantly misrepresented the medical examiner’s testimony.', 'After reviewing the trial transcripts, we agree with the trial justice that the prosecutor was not engaged in an effort to directly quote Dr. Garrity. Rather, the prosecutor called attention to Dr. Garrity’s testimony and attempted to draw what seems to us to be a fair inference that could be gleaned from that testimony. In State v. Fortes, 922 A.2d 143 (R.I. 2007), a police officer who responded to the scene of a sexual assault discovered a chicken bone outside the victim’s home. Fortes, 922 A.2d at 148. The officer testified during trial that it was his belief that someone had removed some leftover chicken from the victim’s home and consumed it prior to leaving. Id. at 150. During closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury, “[B]efore [the defendant] left, what did he [do]? * * * he * * * grabbed a piece of chicken after he rapes his wife, walks outside, discards the chicken, gets in the car and takes off. That is exactly what happened.” Id. at 148. We held that the prosecutor was permitted to suggest that the defendant had been the person who consumed the chicken because such a suggestion was a reasonable', '-8- inference from the testimony that had been offered by the officer and the complaining witness. Id. at 151.', 'In our opinion, it was permissible here for the prosecutor to suggest a reasonable inference that could be gleaned from the trial testimony. Doctor Garrity testified that, in his opinion, a person with a serious heart condition who was assaulted “would have suffered a cardiac arrest as a result of the stress, the panic, and the pain.” It is well settled that prosecutors enjoy “considerable latitude in closing argument, as long as the statements pertain only to the evidence presented and represent reasonable inferences from the record.” Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 1007 (quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885). As the trial justice noted, the prosecutor’s remarks were not “so outside of what the evidence was.” What is more, the trial justice reminded the jury that closing arguments are not evidence. He cautioned the jury that:', '“[W]hat was said by the attorneys in their closing arguments is not', 'evidence and should not be considered in evidence. For example,', 'if something was said during closing argument and your', 'recollection or notes of what the testimony was during the trial are', 'different, you are to rely on your memories and your notes and not', 'what was said. * * * [T]he only evidence in this case are the', 'responses of the witnesses on the witness stand during their direct', 'and cross-examination and any full exhibits that are in evidence.”', 'After closely examining the prosecutor’s closing remarks in light of the record, and after considering the cautionary instruction imparted by the trial justice, it is our opinion that the prosecutor did not drift outside the bounds of proper prosecutorial conduct by suggesting that the jury draw a reasonable inference from the medical examiner’s testimony.', '3', 'The Prosecutor’s Characterization of Defense Strategy', 'During her closing arguments, Roscoe’s defense counsel argued that evidence of sexual assault was lacking and that the prosecution’s case necessarily depended on the inference that an', '-9- eighty-five year old widow simply would not have engaged in consensual sexual relations with a man fifty years her junior. This inference, she argued, was out of step with modern society. 5 In response to defense counsel’s suggestion in this respect, the prosecutor told the jury during the state’s closing argument, “And I apologize for being angry but I’m tired of this victim being called a slut the whole trial.” Later, he added, “I make faces. My wife yells at me all the time. I can’t play polka [sic] and I get upset. An 85-year old woman, serious health condition, urinary tract infection, being called a whore.”', 'This type of coarse and vulgar verbiage is simply unacceptable and has no place in the courtrooms of this state. Perhaps more importantly, the prosecutor’s comments were untethered to the record. In the absence of injuries typical of a violent sexual assault, defense counsel asked the jury to consider that Mrs. Mouchon and defendant may have engaged in consensual intercourse. At best, the prosecutor mischaracterized this defense as an attack on Mrs. Mouchon, and then inappropriately expressed his personal anger at the very mischaracterization that he had concocted.', 'At worst, the prosecutor launched an ad hominem attack on the defendant, demonizing him in an effort to arouse the jury’s passions.', 'We have repeatedly condemned “ad hominem attacks that solely ‘serve to demonize a particular defendant.’” Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d at 1007 (quoting State v. Horton, 871 A.2d 959, 965 (R.I. 2005)). We have held that:', '“A guilty verdict must be based upon the evidence and the', 'reasonable inferences therefrom rather than on ‘an irrational', 'response that [sic] may be triggered if the prosecution unfairly', 'strikes an emotion in the jury.’ Appeals to the jurors’ sympathy or', 'emotions are to be rejected because they go beyond the facts of the', 'case and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from such facts.” 5', 'In her closing remarks to the jury, defense counsel made a reference to the 1990s television program “Golden Girls,” which depicted the energetic and sometimes randy exploits of four elderly women.', '- 10 -', 'State v.

Although “there is no formula in law which precisely delineates the proper bounds of a prosecutor’s argument,” Tucker, 111 A.3d at 388, we can say with confidence that the comments employed in this case exceeded propriety and were well outside any reasonable standard.', 'We are mindful that the trial justice gave a cautionary instruction after closing arguments regarding the words used by the prosecutor. Further, it cannot be gainsaid that we have held that a prosecutor’s inappropriate remarks may be harmless error in the face of “overwhelming evidence of the defendant’s guilt” and adequate cautionary instructions. State v. Simpson, 658 A.2d 522, 528 (R.I. 1995). Nonetheless, it is our opinion that, in this case, the prosecutor’s remarks were unacceptable and crossed the line. However, because we vacate the judgment and remand this case for a new trial on other grounds, we need not, and will not, decide if the inappropriate remarks were sufficient to require that defendant’s conviction be vacated. We caution the state to avoid inflammatory ad hominem attacks in future proceedings. 6', 'B', 'The Medical Examiner’s Testimony', 'The defendant next argues that the trial justice erred when he admitted the expert testimony of the medical examiner, Dr. Garrity, with respect to the manner of death. This is so, he argues, because Dr. Garrity relied on anecdotal history and the results of the police investigation when he determined that the manner of Mrs. Mouchon’s death was homicide.', 'Rule 702 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence permits expert witnesses to testify about their scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge if their doing so will assist the trier of fact. 6', 'We realize that the prosecutor in this case is seasoned and well respected, and thus we chalk up his inappropriate remarks to a sudden burst of overzealous advocacy.', '- 11 - We previously have stated that “the jury will benefit from expert testimony when ‘the subject matter of the inquiry is one involving special skills and training beyond the ken of the average layman.’” State v. Castore, 435 A.2d 321, 326 (R.I. 1981) (quoting Barenbaum v. Richardson, 114 R.I. 87, 90, 328 A.2d 731, 733 (1974)).', 'On the other hand, “[i]f all the facts and circumstances can be accurately described to a jury and if the jury is as capable of comprehending and understanding such facts and drawing correct conclusions from them as is the expert, there is no necessity for the expert testimony.” Barenbaum, 114 R.I. at 90-91, 328 A.2d at 733. A medical examiner’s conclusions as to the cause and manner of death in a particular case will assist the jury when those conclusions are based on a “strong, independent foundation[,]” such as autopsies, examinations of the decedent’s body, and other physical evidence, State v. Mattatall, 603 A.2d 1098, 1116 (R.I. 1992), as well as the exercise of the examiner’s “scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge” in interpreting their findings. R.I. R. Evid. 702. Ultimately, however, the admission of expert testimony lies within the wide discretion of the trial justice, whose “rulings will not be disturbed unless they are clearly erroneous.” State v. Griffin, 691 A.2d 556, 558 (R.I. 1997).', 'To address defendant’s argument, we must determine whether a medical examiner may opine as to a decedent’s manner of death if that determination relies on the statements of lay witnesses and the results of police investigations in addition to the findings based on his or her medical examination of the decedent. Because an anecdotal history of a decedent’s death is often helpful in making a sound determination as to manner of death, and because it cannot be said that Dr. Garrity relied solely or primarily on information relayed to him by the police, we cannot agree with defendant that the trial justice erred by admitting Dr. Garrity’s testimony.', '- 12 -', 'After an initial external examination of the decedent’s body, Dr. Garrity performed a more extensive examination and a detailed autopsy, in which he catalogued evidence of external injuries and examined internal organs for signs of disease. He testified that the autopsy revealed several injuries to Mrs. Mouchon’s head, face, and left breast, a urinary tract infection, an enlarged heart, and fluid around her lungs, but none of the usual defensive injuries one might expect to see on a victim of a violent crime. Based on his findings, the medical examiner concluded that the cause of death was “[b]asically a heart attack or a cardiac arrest following a traumatic event[,]” namely “[m]ultiple blunt force injuries about the face, left breast.” Doctor Garrity was at that point unable to opine as to the manner of death, however, until he learned that laboratory testing of the evidence collection kit indicated the presence of sperm in Mrs. Mouchon’s body and that witness statements indicated she had not been in a relationship.', 'Roscoe argues that a medical examiner’s conclusions do not assist the trier of fact when they are based on witness statements and the results of a police investigation because this extrinsic information is just as easily understood by a jury, without the need for expert testimony. In Castore, we considered the admissibility of a physician’s expert testimony regarding his opinion that the complainant had been molested. Castore, 435 A.2d at 325. The physician testified at trial that he had taken a history from the complainant, including the circumstances surrounding an alleged assault, before he conducted a general and pelvic examination and tested items of clothing. Id. The physician reported that the results of all tests and examinations were normal. Id. Despite those findings, however, the physician testified that, “based upon the history that the patient had given there was sufficient reason to reach a conclusion that child abuse may, in fact, have occurred * * *.” Id. We observed that the physician’s opinion “was based, not upon his examination of [the complainant] or upon laboratory tests, but solely on what', '- 13 - she had related to him about what went on within the walls of the Castore home.” Id. at 326. We held that such an opinion, based solely on what the complainant had related to the physician, was an impermissible comment on a witness’s credibility. Id.', 'In resolving this issue, we have the benefit of jurisprudence in other states. Some courts have held expert testimony to be inadmissible when it relies too heavily on witness statements and other anecdotal information. In State v. Tyler, 867 N.W.2d 136 (Iowa 2015), a medical examiner was able to determine neither the cause nor the manner of death after examining the body of a deceased infant and after conducting an autopsy. Tyler, 867 N.W.2d at 148. In his final report, however, the medical examiner cited the mother’s statement to police that she had given birth to a live child in a motel room and that she had then placed the infant in a bathtub filled with water to support his conclusion that the cause of the infant’s death was drowning and the manner of death was homicide. Id. at 163. At a hearing on a motion in limine, the medical examiner “admitted the only way he reached his final opinions was by reference to [the mother’s] statements to police[,]” and at trial he said, “[W]ithout the witness statements, I could not have diagnosed drowning in this case.” Id. at 163-64. The Supreme Court of Iowa noted that the medical examiner “based his opinions primarily, if not exclusively, on [the mother’s] inconsistent and uncorroborated statements to police.” Id. at 167. His opinions, therefore, “were not sufficiently based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge and therefore did not assist the trier of fact.” Id.', 'Similarly, in State v. Sosnowicz, 270 P.3d 917 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2012), the Arizona Court of Appeals ruled that the testimony of a medical examiner was inadmissible because his determination as to manner of death was based largely on the statements of lay witnesses. Sosnowicz, 270 P.3d at 924-25.', 'In that case, an exchange of insults and a parking lot brawl', '- 14 - turned deadly when the defendant struck the victim with his vehicle. Id. at 919. There was no dispute that the defendant was driving the vehicle that collided with the victim, and the issue at trial was whether that collision was intentional and amounted to murder or was merely an unfortunate accident. Id. at 921. The medical examiner concluded that the decedent’s manner of death was homicide based on the results of the autopsy that he conducted as well as the information reported to him by police. Id. The court opined that “it does not appear that [the medical examiner] relied on any ‘specialized knowledge’ to classify the death as a ‘homicide’ rather than an ‘accident.’” Id. at 922. These conclusions, the court held, were based “largely on the testimony of lay witnesses whose credibility the jury can determine without the aid of expert testimony[,]” and, thus, the expert’s testimony would not assist the jury in understanding the evidence. Id. at 925.', 'The Supreme Judicial Court of Maine reached a similar conclusion in State v. Vining, 645 A.2d 20 (Me. 1994). In that case, a medical examiner testified that the decedent’s manner of death had been homicide, despite conceding “that there was no physical evidence that [the decedent’s] death had been caused by a human agent as opposed to an accidental fall.” Vining, 645 A.2d at 20-21. The court held that the medical examiner’s opinion “was based solely on her discussions with the police investigators and therefore amounted to an assessment of the credibility and investigatory acumen of the police.” Id. at 21.', 'However, in State v. Commander, 721 S.E.2d 413 (S.C. 2011), the Supreme Court of South Carolina held that anecdotal histories are at times essential to a medical examiner’s interpretation of autopsy findings. Commander, 721 S.E.2d at 419-20. In that case, the decedent was discovered covered by a blanket, lying on a sofa in her home. Id. at 415. After examining the partially decomposed body, the medical examiner found no marks or other evidence of', '- 15 - injury; but, after learning about the “suspicious circumstances” in which the body was found, the medical examiner determined the cause of death to be asphyxiation and the manner of death to be homicide. Id. at 415-16. The medical examiner testified that he based his conclusions on the results of his autopsy and the anecdotal history of the body’s discovery. Id. The medical examiner explained during cross-examination that “[t]he history is vital and a mandatory part of all autopsies * * *. [W]ithout a history, the autopsy, in and of itself, is invalid. The two are not separable, they are part of one another. The autopsy includes the history as well as all the other anatomic and laboratory findings.” Id. at 420. The court agreed, holding that, “[b]ecause the anecdotal history is an essential component of any autopsy, we find testimony concerning findings based on this information falls within the umbrella of the expert’s specialized knowledge.” Id.', 'The cited cases are largely in line with our own reasoning in Castore, and together they suggest that an expert’s opinion will not be admissible if it relies solely or primarily on witness statements that are within the ken of the jury. We recognize, however, that medical examiners do not conduct their examinations in a vacuum.', 'We are persuaded by the reasoning in Commander and agree that an understanding of the circumstances surrounding the death and discovery of a deceased person is an important component of any determination of cause or manner of death.', 'Indeed, medical examiners have a statutory duty to inquire into these circumstances. General Laws 1956 § 23-4-8(a) provides, in relevant part:', '“When the office of state medical examiners has notice that there', 'has been found or is lying within this state the body of a person', 'who is supposed to have come to his or her death by violence * * *', 'an agent of the office of state medical examiners shall immediately', 'proceed to the place where the body lies and take charge of it, view', 'it, and make personal inquiry into the cause and manner of death.”', '(Emphasis added.)', '- 16 -', 'We therefore conclude that medical examiners may supplement their medical findings with other information to assist them in interpreting their findings in the exercise of their “scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge[,]” R.I. R. Evid. 702, so long as they do not rely solely or primarily on such information. 7 It is for the trial justice, based on the particular facts and circumstances of the case before him, to determine whether a medical examiner has relied too heavily on witness statements such that the testimony amounts to an impermissible comment on the witness’s credibility. We do not disturb such findings on appeal unless they are clearly erroneous. See Griffin, 691 A.2d at 558.', 'In this case, the trial justice ruled that Dr. Garrity’s opinion as to the manner of death was within his area of expertise and that his testimony would assist the jury in its fact finding function. In our opinion, allowing Dr. Garrity to testify about his consideration of witness statements was not clearly erroneous, because he did not rely solely or primarily on those statements. At trial, Dr. Garrity testified that he catalogued extensive injuries to Mrs. Mouchon’s head, face, and left breast—injuries that he did not believe were consistent with falling—and that those blunt force injuries likely caused Mrs. Mouchon’s already-compromised heart to fail. He also testified that, at the time of her death, Mrs. Mouchon was suffering from a urinary tract infection and that the inflammation and pain from that infection would certainly dampen any desire for sexual intercourse. The statements of acquaintances to the effect that Mrs. Mouchon had not been involved in a relationship may have assisted Dr. Garrity to arrive at the conclusion that Mrs. Mouchon’s manner of death was homicide, but we cannot say that Dr. Garrity’s conclusion was based solely, or even primarily, on those statements. 7', '“We believe that the medical examiner should not be required to close his eyes to sources of information relied upon by mankind generally in order to determine the questions that must be resolved in his official capacity.” State v. Dame, 488 A.2d 418, 426 (R.I. 1985); see also State v. Correia, 600 A.2d 279, 286 (R.I. 1991).', '- 17 -', 'Roscoe also argues that Dr. Garrity’s testimony should have been excluded under Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, because Dr. Garrity’s determination that Mrs. Mouchon’s manner of death was by homicide was likely to confuse jurors who might have equated the medical term “homicide” with the legal charge of murder. We do not agree. Again, as we acknowledged in Mattatall, where police believe that violence may have caused the death of an individual, a medical examiner is obliged by § 23-4-8 to “immediately proceed to the place where the body lies and take charge of it, view it, and make personal inquiry into the cause and manner of death.” See Mattatall, 603 A.2d at 1115 (quoting the predecessor statute to § 23-4-8, with minor linguistic deviations). As we noted in that case, where a medical examiner has determined the cause and manner of death, the jury has every right to hear the medical examiner’s opinion and to assign that testimony the appropriate weight in furtherance of their function as factfinder. Id. at 1116.', 'The admission of Dr. Garrity’s testimony with regard to the manner of death was not clearly erroneous, and we will not disturb the trial justice’s ruling.', 'C', 'Violations of the Confrontation Clause', 'Roscoe next argues that allowing Det. Bousquet 8 to testify about his conversations with Henriette Van Coughen, Anna Blais, and George Mouchon violated his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him. He also points to the state’s closing argument as allowing the content of out-of-court statements made by unavailable witnesses to be “readily inferred” by the jury. He contends that this violated his right to confront the witnesses against him, in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of 8', 'Detective Bousquet was long-retired at the time of his testimony.', '- 18 - the Rhode Island Constitution. Because we agree that the Confrontation Clause was violated when the state implicitly conveyed the content of statements made by deceased witnesses to the jury, both through Det. Bousquet’s testimony and the closing argument of the prosecutor, and because we cannot say that those violations were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, we are constrained to vacate the judgment of conviction.', '“When a criminal defendant claims on appeal that the introduction of certain evidence violated his constitutional rights of confrontation and cross-examination, we review such an evidentiary ruling in a de novo manner.” State v. Moten, 64 A.3d 1232, 1238 (R.I. 2013). “Both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution (through the Fourteenth Amendment) and article 1, section 10, of the Rhode Island Constitution guarantee individuals accused of criminal charges the right to confront and cross-examine any adverse witnesses who testify against them.” State v. Dorsey, 783 A.2d 947, 950 (R.I. 2001). Violations of the Confrontation Clause are subject to harmless-error analysis. State v. Albanese, 970 A.2d 1215, 1222 (R.I. 2009). The inquiry is whether, assuming the defense had been afforded the opportunity to cross- examine the unavailable witness and that “the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. (quoting State v. Pettiway, 657 A.2d 161, 164 (R.I. 1995)).', 'Analysis of DNA recovered from sperm at the scene of Mrs. Mouchon’s death established a very high probability that defendant had had sexual contact with Mrs. Mouchon before her death. The key issue at trial was whether or not that sexual contact had been consensual.

Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 53- 54 (2004); see Albanese, 970 A.2d at 1222.

Although the actual words spoken by the now-deceased witnesses were not themselves elicited at trial, the content of their statements—that Mrs. Mouchon had not been involved in a relationship—was “readily inferred.” United States v. Kizzee, 877 F.3d 650, 657 (5th Cir. 2017) (quoting Favre v. Henderson, 464 F.2d 359, 362 (5th Cir. 1972)).', 'In Kizzee, the defendant was charged with multiple drug-related federal offenses. Kizzee, 877 F.3d at 655. Investigating officers arrested a man named Carl Brown after he was seen leaving the defendant’s home. Id. at 654. Although Brown told police that he had purchased narcotics from Kizzee, he later recanted his statements and declined to testify at the defendant’s trial. Id. The prosecution asked a testifying detective whether he had asked Brown if he had purchased narcotics from the defendant, but he did not elicit Brown’s response to the detective’s question. Id. at 655, 657. The prosecution then asked the detective if he had taken any actions as a result of Brown’s statement, and the detective testified that he had obtained a search warrant for the defendant’s home. Id. at 655. Although at no point during his testimony did the detective reveal the words of Brown’s statement, the Fifth Circuit held that the prosecutor’s questions to the detective “appeared designed to elicit hearsay testimony without directly introducing Brown’s statements.” Id. at 657-58. The court went on to conclude that, because the out-of- court statements of a nontestifying declarant could be “readily inferred[,]” the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him had been violated. Id. at 658-59.', '- 22 -', 'In this case, Det. Bousquet testified that he had interviewed Anna Blais, Henriette Van Coughen, and George Mouchon and that he asked each of them whether they knew if Mrs. Mouchon had been involved in a relationship. Although their answers to these questions were not elicited directly at trial, the jury was left with the unavoidable implication that each of these individuals had told police they did not believe Mrs. Mouchon was in a relationship. This inference was reinforced during the prosecutor’s closing argument, when he recalled Det. Bousquet’s testimony and asked the jury, “Don’t you think they would have followed up?”', 'We agree with those courts that have held the Confrontation Clause applies with full force when the jury can readily infer the contents of untested out-of-court testimonial statements. See Kizzee, 877 F.3d at 657 (“[A] prosecutor’s questioning may introduce a testimonial statement by a nontestifying witness, thus implicating the Confrontation Clause.”); United States v. Meises, 645 F.3d 5, 21 (1st Cir. 2011) (“[I]f what the jury hears is, in substance, an untested, out-of-court accusation against the defendant, particularly if the inculpatory statement is made to law enforcement authorities, the defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confront the declarant is triggered.”); see also Ocampo v. Vail, 649 F.3d 1098, 1111 (9th Cir. 2011); Ryan v. Miller, 303 F.3d 231, 249 (2d Cir. 2002). The Confrontation Clause ensures the right of defendants “to tease out the truth” by questioning the reliability of the witnesses against them. Crawford, 541 U.S. at 67. Were we to hold otherwise, we would deprive defendants of this important truth-finding function.', 'The state argues that, even if the statements of Blais, Van Coughen, and George Mouchon could be readily inferred from Det. Bousquet’s testimony, those statements did not run afoul of the Confrontation Clause because they did not directly implicate defendant. According to the state, those statements can only support the inference that Mrs. Mouchon was not in a', '- 23 - relationship at the time of her death. While this inference might lead to the further inference that sperm found with Mrs. Mouchon was a result of a sexual assault rather than consensual sexual contact, the state maintains, it did not directly or indirectly inculpate Roscoe in that crime. In other words, the state maintains that only when weighed in combination with DNA evidence did those witnesses’ statements in any way incriminate Roscoe in the crime of sexual assault. However, in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009), the United States Supreme Court was not persuaded by that very argument, reasoning that the Sixth Amendment “contemplates two classes of witnesses—those against the defendant and those in his favor. * * * [T]here is not a third category of witnesses, helpful to the prosecution, but somehow immune from confrontation.” Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 313-14.', 'That reasoning applies here with full force. Although it is true that the statements of the now-deceased declarants do not directly identify or implicate Roscoe, the statements were nonetheless employed in an effort to prove that defendant’s DNA was present as the result of nonconsensual sexual contact. Anna Blais, Henriette Van Coughen, and George Mouchon were therefore witnesses against the defendant. Their deaths prior to trial deprived Roscoe of the ability to subject them to cross-examination, yet the trial justice nonetheless admitted testimony that referred to their statements to police in 1990. In our opinion, this was error.', 'It is further our opinion that this error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. The state was tasked with proving that any sexual contact between Roscoe and Mrs. Mouchon was nonconsensual. However, there were no signs of forced entry into Mrs. Mouchon’s apartment, there were no defensive wounds on Mrs. Mouchon’s hands, and vaginal injuries were not present. We therefore cannot say that, had “the damaging potential of the cross-examination', '- 24 - [been] fully realized,” no reasonable jury could have acquitted the defendant. 10 Albanese, 970 A.2d at 1222.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the introduction of out-of-court statements of deceased declarants violated the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10, of the Rhode Island Constitution. Therefore, we vacate the judgment of conviction and remand the case to the Superior Court for new trial.', 'Chief Justice Suttell, concurring. I am pleased to join the majority opinion in all respects save one. I write separately merely to express my belief that the trial justice’s failure to grant defendant a mistrial based upon the prosecutor’s comments in closing argument insinuating that the defense had called Mrs. Mouchon “a slut” and “a whore” throughout the trial was an abuse of discretion.', 'These statements are not only inflammatory, they are false. The record is devoid of any reference by the defense to the victim as being a “slut” or a “whore.” In my judgment, these remarks could not help but “arouse the sympathy and passion of the jurors.” State v. Mead, 544 A.2d 1146, 1150 (R.I. 1988). Nor do I believe that a curative instruction could expiate the prejudice inherent in such fallacious and incendiary comments. To be sure, the defense strategy was to suggest that this 85-year-old woman was involved in a consensual sexual relationship 10', 'Defendant also appealed his convictions for both felony murder and first degree sexual assault on the grounds that these dual convictions amounted to double jeopardy. The state agreed in its brief before this Court that double jeopardy principles prevent the conviction of murder under the felony-murder theory alongside the underlying felony, in this case, first degree sexual assault. Because we vacate the judgment of conviction on other grounds, we need not, and do not, reach this argument.', '- 25 - with a man over fifty years younger.

78,State : v. : Danielle LeFebvre. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Danielle LeFebvre, appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury found her guilty of first degree child abuse, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-9-5.3. The trial justice sentenced the defendant to twenty years’ imprisonment, with eighteen years to serve and the balance suspended, with probation. Before this Court, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred by requiring Sheila Russell, a licensed clinical social worker, to testify about statements the defendant made to her while seeking mental-health treatment. The defendant claims that her communications with Russell were privileged pursuant to the Confidentiality of Health Care Information Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 37.3 of title 5 (CHCIA). A threshold, and ultimately dispositive, issue is whether any privilege arising from that statute is abrogated by G.L. 1956 § 40-11-11, which nullifies “[t]he privileged quality of communication between * * * any professional person and his or her patient or client * * * in situations involving known or suspected child abuse or neglect and [the privileged quality of communications] shall not constitute grounds for * * * failure to give or accept evidence in any judicial proceeding relating to child abuse or neglect.” After thoroughly reviewing the record, and carefully considering the arguments of the parties, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In the fall of 2011, defendant lived in her mother’s apartment with her infant son, James, who was born on September 3, 2011. 1 This was a difficult time for her. She and her mother, JoAnn LeFebvre, had a tense relationship; defendant was averaging only two to five hours of sleep at night, and baby James had become frustratingly fussy. 2 James’s father was absent from the baby’s life, and, although JoAnn would occasionally babysit, the burden of child care fell mostly on defendant. Life was stressful for defendant, and the impact of that stress appears to have affected her relationship with her son. According to JoAnn, defendant was experiencing difficulty bonding with James. JoAnn did not observe the kind of playfulness and affection that one would expect from a new mother, and she observed that defendant was “aggressive” with the baby and would sometimes yell to vent her pent-up frustrations. 3', 'On October 19, 2011, defendant arrived at the emergency room of Hasbro Children’s Hospital with James, then almost seven weeks old. The defendant told the attending physician that the day before, she had been sitting on the edge of her bed with James cradled against her shoulder, trying to lull him to sleep for a quick nap, when she herself fell asleep. She testified that she woke up sometime later to find James crying on the floor by the bed, where he had fallen while she slept. As she was consoling him, defendant claimed, she noticed that his head was red, but she did not feel anything out of the ordinary when she checked the back of his head, and he 1', 'We have assigned a pseudonym to the child to protect his privacy. 2', 'According to defendant, she voluntarily terminated her parental rights to James before her criminal trial. 3', 'The record reveals that defendant also had a seven-year-old child at the time of James’s birth. That child did not reside with defendant.', '-2- calmed down to take a bottle. The defendant then brought James to her grandmother’s home for an overnight visit.', 'The next morning, defendant returned to work for the first time since she had gone on maternity leave. While she was at work, she received two phone calls from her grandmother, who had noticed that James was not acting normally. The defendant left work an hour early to check on James, and she knew something was wrong as soon as she saw him. After returning to her apartment to pack a diaper bag, she brought James to the emergency room. The defendant told the attending physician that her grandmother had reported that James appeared listless, was not eating, had rapid eye movements, and that his limbs were twitching. A head CT scan and a skeletal survey of James’s body revealed a fractured skull, bleeding in and around his brain, and two fractured ribs, which, based on how much they had healed, may have occurred as late as the very afternoon James was admitted to the hospital. Hospital staff, concerned that James’s injuries might be the result of abuse, referred James’s case to the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF). The defendant was later charged by criminal information with one count of first degree child abuse, in violation of § 11-9-5.3(b)(1).', 'The attending physician later testified that she did not believe that any of the baby’s injuries were consistent with the type of short fall that had been described by defendant. To the contrary, the attending physician testified that James’s rib fractures could not have been caused by a fall from a bed, but rather were more consistent with someone squeezing or compressing the infant’s chest. The doctor further opined that James’s head injuries were consistent with abusive head trauma, also known as “Shaken Baby Syndrome.” 4 4', 'The defendant told an interrogating police officer that it was possible that she had injured her son, because she “know[s] that [she] get[s] upset” and that she was “rougher than [she] should be.”', '-3-', 'Before trial, defendant’s counsel, in connection with plea negotiations, provided the state with medical records from mental health treatment that defendant had sought at Butler Hospital in the days following James’s injuries. Included in those records were the intake notes of Sheila Russell, a licensed clinical social worker who had conducted an initial psychiatric evaluation of defendant. That evaluation said, in pertinent part, that “[defendant] doesn[’]t remember what she did or on h[o]w many occasions, but has enough ‘fuzzy recollection’ to know she did indeed cause the harm. [R]emembers feeling ‘enraged’ at the baby and ‘throwing him on the bed just to get away from him.’” After the trial justice granted the state’s motion in limine to use those records against defendant at trial, the state served a subpoena duces tecum on Butler Hospital to produce copies of Russell’s records and to require her testimony. Over the hospital’s strenuous objection, the trial justice denied Butler’s motion to quash the subpoena, and she also required Russell to testify about her notes during the state’s rebuttal case. 5', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she required Sheila Russell to testify about disclosures defendant made to her during the intake interview, because, defendant contends, her conversation with Russell was privileged as a “confidential health care communication[]” under § 5-37.3-6.

The defendant’s counsel admitted, with laudable candor, that she had been unaware of the existence of § 40-11-11 prior to receiving notice of the state’s motion in limine two days before the hearing. After hearing argument from both sides, the trial justice ruled that § 40-11-11 did away with any potential privilege under', '-5- CHCIA that may have attached to any disclosures defendant made to Russell during her psychiatric evaluation. 6 In response to the trial justice’s ruling, defendant’s counsel stated:', '“It was a very straightforward statute, I agree with that, Judge, and', 'I defer to the [c]ourt on this matter. * * *.', '“So I defer to the Court on the decision here, but I would like to', 'state that without having, I’d say, a week to look into this, to look', 'into other jurisdictions, I can’t say that I have a strong argument to', 'make either way at this point.” As a result of this representation before the trial court, the state argues on appeal that the claim of privilege was waived.', 'However, despite her seeming acquiescence to the trial justice’s ruling, defendant’s counsel later challenged the state’s proffer of Russell’s testimony before it was offered to the jury. She maintained that the communication was privileged under CHCIA. Addressing the potential abrogation of defendant’s CHCIA privilege, counsel stated:', '“I would like to put on the record that, again, I have not been able', 'to fully explain to my client exactly all of her options because,', 'again, I do not feel I had enough time or been [sic] able to put the', 'effort into this untried, and if you will, novel idea of bringing in', 'records which I in fact turned over, from my understanding,', '[during] plea negotiations to the State.', '“So I would just like there be [sic] a continuing objection. * * *.” The trial justice granted the request for a continuing objection to Russell’s testimony.', 'In our opinion, for the purposes of this appeal, the defendant’s request for, and the trial justice’s grant of, a continuing objection sufficiently preserved this argument for review by this Court.', 'B', 'The First Sentence of § 40-11-11 6', 'The state’s motion in limine mistakenly named Melissa Ludwig, M.D., as the therapist who had conducted defendant’s initial psychiatric evaluation at Butler Hospital.', '-6-', 'Under CHCIA, “confidential health care communications” are not “subject to compulsory legal process in any type of judicial proceeding[.]” Section 5-37.3-6(a). The act defines “[c]onfidential health care communication” as “a communication of health care information by an individual to a health care provider * * * not intended to be disclosed to third persons[.]” 7 Section 5-37.3-3(3)(i).', 'The defendant argues that Russell was a “health care provider” under the statute, that any statements she made during her intake evaluation with Russell were made for the purpose of obtaining mental health treatment, and that those statements were not intended to be disclosed to any third persons. Therefore, she argues, the statements were privileged and consequently should not have been admitted into evidence.', 'However, this appeal does not turn on whether defendant’s discussion with Russell was privileged. This is so because, even though the requirements of CHCIA may have been met, any privilege that she might otherwise have enjoyed was rendered a nullity by the clear and unambiguous language of § 40-11-11. That statute provides, in pertinent part: 7', 'We have considered the constitutionality of this statute on multiple occasions. See State v. Almonte, 644 A.2d 295, 297-99 (R.I. 1994); Bartlett v. Danti, 503 A.2d 515, 517 (R.I. 1986). In those cases, we declared the privilege enacted in G.L. 1956 § 5-37.3-6 to be unconstitutional because the statute, as written, gave “uncontrolled discretion over how the litigants and the trial courts of the state adjudicate disputes to the patient ‘who can decide with impunity whether to permit access to such information.’” Almonte, 644 A.2d at 297 (quoting Bartlett, 503 A.2d at 517). In Almonte, we said that § 5-37.3-6 “substantially makes unavailable to the judicial process any health care information whether arising out of a confidential communication, or objective tests or observations. This is an intrusion upon the judicial power of the state which cannot be countenanced.” Id. at 299. After our decision in Almonte, the General Assembly enacted § 5-37.3-6.1, which provides a mechanism for trial courts to admit confidential health care information in certain circumstances. See P.L. 2006, ch. 248, § 3; P.L. 2006, ch. 266, § 3. We have since held that this latter enactment “adequately addresses the heretofore recognized constitutional infirmities and strikes a permissible balance between a party’s interest in maintaining the confidentiality of his or her personal health care records and the court’s need to access relevant information.” In re Doe, 717 A.2d 1129, 1133 (R.I. 1998).', '-7-', '“The privileged quality of communication between husband and', 'wife and any professional person and his or her patient or client,', 'except that between attorney and client, is hereby abrogated in', 'situations involving known or suspected child abuse or neglect and', 'shall not constitute grounds for * * * failure to give or accept', 'evidence in any judicial proceeding relating to child abuse or', 'neglect. In any family court proceeding relating to child abuse or', 'neglect * * * no privilege of confidentiality may be invoked with', 'respect to any illness, trauma, incompetency, addiction to drugs, or', 'alcoholism of any parent.” Section 40-11-11.', 'The defendant first agrees with the state that § 40-11-11 is unambiguous, but argues that any abrogation of privacy applies only in certain Family Court proceedings. She posits that the phrase “proceeding relating to child abuse or neglect,” used in the first sentence of the statute, is a “term of art” that refers only to DCYF-initiated proceedings that are heard on a specialized calendar in the Family Court, which defendant refers to as the “abuse and neglect calendar.” The defendant offers no support for this bald assertion, stating only that “proceeding relating to child abuse or neglect” is a “shorthand phrase” that parties and judges use to refer to that specialized calendar and the cases that appear on it.', 'Accepting, arguendo, that the phrase “proceeding relating to child abuse or neglect” has in fact entered the lexicon of breviloquent colloquialisms favored by legal professionals familiar with Family Court practice, we nonetheless conclude that the General Assembly would not have employed the phrase in a colloquial fashion when enacting the legislation. The plain meaning of the phrase “any judicial proceeding relating to child abuse or neglect” is indeed unambiguous, and it encompasses the full spectrum of matters that relate to the abuse or neglect of a child. Had the General Assembly intended to limit the application of § 40-11-11 to the narrow class of cases', '-8- suggested by defendant, it surely would have done so explicitly, rather than employing what defendant refers to as a “shorthand phrase.” 8', 'At best, defendant may have demonstrated that “any judicial proceeding relating to child abuse or neglect” has a specialized meaning in the context of the Family Court. It is true that “[a] word [or phrase] may acquire a specific meaning and become a word of art through constant and unmistakable usage.”', 'State v. Domanski, 57 R.I. 500, 501, 190 A. 854, 856 (1937). However, if a word or phrase “has no technical or precise definition” and “does not in all cases convey a single identical meaning[,]” but rather has a “variety of meanings” based on the context of its usage, then that word or phrase is not a term of art. Douglas v. Pratt, 102 R.I. 445, 448, 231 A.2d 486, 488 (1967).', 'When the language of a statute is unambiguous, we must enforce the words of the statute as they are written according to “their plain and ordinary meaning.” Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of New England, Inc. v. Gelati, 865 A.2d 1028, 1037 (R.I. 2004). As the trial justice held below, § 40-11-11 unambiguously abrogates all privileges that might otherwise attach to communications “between husband and wife and any professional person and his or her patient or client, except that between attorney and client * * * in situations involving known or suspected child abuse or neglect” and any such privileges cannot justify a “failure to give or accept evidence in any judicial proceeding relating to child abuse or neglect.” The language employed by the General Assembly could not be more clear.', 'C 8', 'We also note that, when the General Assembly enacted G.L. 1956 § 11-9-5.3, known as Brendan’s Law, it vested the Family Court with exclusive jurisdiction over the offense. State v. Sivo, 925 A.2d 901, 916 (R.I. 2007). However, on July 3, 2006, the General Assembly enacted two public laws that removed jurisdiction of child abuse offenses from the Family Court to the Superior Court. See State v. Jennings, 944 A.2d 171, 173 (R.I. 2008); see also P.L. 2006, ch. 260, § 1; P.L. 2006, ch. 290, § 1.', '-9-', 'The Second Sentence of § 40-11-11', 'The defendant argues in the alternative that the wording of the first sentence, if clear on its face, is rendered ambiguous by the inclusion of the phrase “any family court proceeding relating to child abuse or neglect” that is found in the second sentence. Section 40-11-11 (emphasis added). The defendant contends that the limitation in the second sentence to “family court proceeding” can plausibly be read as restricting the scope of the first sentence. We do not agree. The defendant’s argument presumes that the two sentences of § 40-11-11 overlap one another. The interpretation that defendant urges upon us would not only contravene our firmly held principle that the “Legislature is presumed to have intended each word or provision of a statute to express a significant meaning,” but would also ignore the clearly separate substance of the two sentences. Clark, 974 A.2d at 571. The first sentence of the statute abrogates all privileges, regardless of subject matter, that are based on the identity of the communicants, namely those “between husband and wife and any professional person and his or her patient or client, except that between attorney and client[.]” Section 40-11-11. By contrast, the second sentence, in Family Court proceedings only, prevents the invocation of any privilege of confidentiality only with respect to certain subject matter, namely “any illness, trauma, incompetency, addiction to drugs, or alcoholism of any parent.” Id. Our interpretation of § 40- 11-11 is further bolstered by the fact that the General Assembly thought it necessary to add the second sentence when it amended § 40-11-11 in 1988. See P.L. 1988, ch. 106, § 1. 9', 'Based on the plain meaning of the words of this statute, the second sentence of § 40-11- 11 limits the ability to invoke privileges with respect to certain subject matter in Family Court 9', 'We also observe that, when the General Assembly chose to limit the second sentence of G.L. 1956 § 40-11-11 to “any family court proceeding,” it did so explicitly rather than employ the ostensible “shorthand” that defendant suggests was used in the first sentence.', '- 10 - only. On the other hand, the first sentence, in sweeping language, does away with virtually all privileges in any and all judicial proceedings that involve the abuse or neglect of a child. This would include criminal proceedings.', 'We pause briefly, however, to add our concerns to those expressed by the trial justice that, especially in criminal cases, our ruling today could have a chilling effect on the benefits of psychotherapy as a rehabilitative tool in instances of child abuse and neglect. Nonetheless, whatever our reservations might be, we are constrained to give effect to the enactments of the General Assembly. “How to effectuate policy—the adaptation of means to legitimately sought ends—is one of the most intractable of legislative problems.” State v. Oliveira, 882 A.2d 1097, 1117 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Tigner v. Texas, 310 U.S. 141, 148 (1940)). It is not for this Court to determine whether a statute enacted by the General Assembly “comports with our [own] ideas of justice, expediency or sound public policy.” State v.

Baptista, 79 A.3d 24, 29 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Staffier, 21 A.3d 287, 290 (R.I. 2011)). Accordingly, “the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the', '-4- evidence.” State v. Baker, 79 A.3d 1267, 1273 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. LaPierre, 57 A.3d 305, 310 (R.I. 2012)). “In this determination, the trial justice must consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, then independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and also ultimately determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” LaPierre, 57 A.3d at 310 (quoting State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 232 (R.I. 2012)).', '“If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” State v. Paola, 59 A.3d 99, 104 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)). Alternatively, “if the trial justice does not agree with the jury verdict, ‘he or she is required to proceed to a fourth step * * * to determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.’” Baptista, 79 A.3d at 29 (quoting Staffier, 21 A.3d at 290-91). “If the verdict meets this standard, then a new trial may be granted.” Id. (quoting Staffier, 21 A.3d at 291).', 'Accordingly, “[i]f the trial justice has complied with this procedure and articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion, his or her decision will be given great weight and left undisturbed unless the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence or otherwise was clearly wrong.” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (quoting State v. Smith, 39 A.3d 669, 673 (R.I. 2012)). On appeal, we apply this deferential standard of review because “a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Id. (quoting State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 141 (R.I. 2008)).', '-5-', 'Analysis', 'The defendant’s sole challenge on appeal to this Court is that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. He argues that the evidence presented at trial raised serious doubt about the allegations and that the trial justice overlooked and misconceived material evidence. Specifically, defendant argues that John’s testimony was neither credible nor reliable and that the testimony of the other witnesses failed to corroborate John’s assertions, but instead contradicted critical aspects of his testimony. For this reason, defendant contends that the verdict returned by the jury was against the weight of the evidence and failed to serve the interests of justice.', 'By calling into question the trial justice’s assessment of the testimony and the weight of the evidence, defendant effectively challenges the trial justice’s credibility determinations. However, “[t]his Court has stated that ‘[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.’” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (quoting State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 903 (R.I. 2010)). As we have elucidated on numerous occasions, “the trial justice * * * has [had] the opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testify and therefore is in a better position [than this Court] to weigh the evidence and to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses than is this [C]ourt.” Rivera, 987 A.2d at 903 (quoting State v. Luanglath, 749 A.2d 1, 5-6 (R.I. 2000)). For this reason, we will not disturb the trial justice’s determination on appeal “unless the trial justice clearly erred in his credibility determinations or ‘overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence[.]’” Paola, 59 A.3d at 104 (quoting State v. Banach, 648 A.2d 1363, 1368 (R.I. 1994)).', 'A careful review of the record reveals that the trial justice, when considering defendant’s motion for a new trial, articulated the correct analysis to be undertaken, recounted his', '-6- independent observations from trial, and carefully assessed the credibility of the witnesses and weight of the evidence. The trial justice comprehensively articulated his reasons for denying the motion for a new trial. His conclusion—that the overwhelming and credible evidence of sexual contact between defendant and John supported the jury’s finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt—is clear and reflects thoughtful deliberation.', 'Furthermore, in assessing the credibility of the witnesses, the trial justice found John in particular to be “a very nervous ten-year[-]old boy on the stand and some of his answers were contradictory especially when the [c]ourt found he was nervous during cross-examination and began answering correct to just about every question. But with respect to his testimony as a whole, the [c]ourt [found John] to be a very credible witness.” Thus, the trial justice concluded that, based on John’s testimony, the jury could conclude that the requisite elements of the charged offense were proven “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Accordingly, after reviewing the evidence adduced at trial, the trial justice concluded that he agreed with the verdict on all three elements of the charge, and he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Having carefully reviewed the record before us, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive any material evidence. The trial justice conducted an appropriate analysis of the evidence presented, evaluated the credibility of the witnesses, and assessed the weight of the evidence; and, having done so, he determined that sufficient credible evidence was submitted to support the verdict on both counts. We therefore hold that the trial justice did not err in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.

A jury in Providence County Superior Court found the defendant, Joseph Silva (Silva or defendant), guilty of reckless driving, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-27-4, which was count two of the original five counts of a criminal information brought against him. Following the jury verdict and the denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice sentenced him. The defendant filed his timely notice of appeal on May 17, 2017. This matter came before the Supreme Court on December 4, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised on appeal should not be summarily decided. After reviewing their submitted memoranda, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and further briefing or argument is therefore not required. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The events giving rise to this case occurred on November 13, 2014. There are two competing versions of what transpired on that day, both of which were presented at a four-day', '-1- jury trial.1 Devin Smith (Smith) testified for the state that he left a restaurant that afternoon and was driving his mother’s car eastbound on Putnam Pike in Smithfield, with three friends in the vehicle, when he approached a red light next to a vehicle, later identified as defendant’s, in the lane to his left. Smith testified that defendant asked him, through their open car windows, if Smith “wanted to see a frog leap.” Smith testified that he was unsure what defendant meant, but responded by saying, “Whatever, Buddy[.]”', 'When the light turned green, both vehicles continued down the road, and, Smith testified, defendant began swerving into Smith’s lane three or four times, forcing Smith to swerve into the far right portion of the roadway, until they eventually reached the traffic light at Esmond Street. Smith testified that, at that light, he came to a stop in the “left only” lane and defendant was in the right “straight only” lane, to Smith’s right. Additionally, Smith testified that, when the light turned green, he attempted to turn left onto Esmond Street, at which time defendant also turned left from his straight-only lane and struck Smith’s car in the rear-passenger side, causing Smith to drive over a mulched area and into a gas station parking lot.', 'Smith further testified that, as he drove to the exit of the gas station parking lot to pull back onto Putnam Pike, defendant again hit Smith’s car, this time in the rear. Smith described that it was “not a bad hit” but “[j]ust, like, a tap.” Smith also testified that, after he left the gas station, defendant followed him down Esmond Street and again hit the back of his car, this time at the intersection of Dean Avenue. Smith explained that, as he drove down Dean Avenue, he was in the right lane and defendant continued on the side of his car “trying to cut in front of [him] to slow [him] down.” Smith testified that, at that point, defendant got out of his vehicle and “threw his hands up”; it looked to Smith as though defendant threw something at Smith’s 1', 'For the purposes of this opinion, we will only discuss the witnesses’ testimony at trial that pertains to the reckless driving charge.', '-2- vehicle. Then, Smith explained, he put his car in reverse, drove home, told his mother what had happened, and called the police. Smith testified that his vehicle never struck defendant’s vehicle. Finally, Smith testified regarding the details of the damage to his vehicle, and photographs depicting that damage were admitted into evidence.', 'The state called Aaron Mazzulla (Mazzulla) to testify next. Mazzulla was one of the three passengers in Smith’s vehicle during the incident; he was sitting in the back seat behind Smith. Mazzulla’s account of the events corroborated Smith’s testimony. William Achille (Achille), the gas station clerk on duty that night, also testified for the state and described that, at around 5:00 p.m., he saw two vehicles speed through the parking lot, stop at the furthest exit, and then get back onto the road. Achille also testified that he did not hear or see any collision take place at the station; rather, he merely heard “[a] little bit of beeping.”', 'The defendant also testified at trial. According to defendant, he was driving home from work when he stopped to pick up dinner for his children. When he left the restaurant, defendant testified, he was traveling on Putnam Pike when he approached a red light near the above- mentioned gas station, and he observed that his mirror had become dislodged and he heard “the sound of change hitting the door, or rocks or sand[.]” The defendant testified that, after his car was struck, he looked to his left and saw a car pulling into the gas station. Thereafter, defendant testified that he used his left directional and pulled into the gas station behind the vehicle because he “figured they knew they hit [his] vehicle, and that’s why they were parking.” The defendant stated that he pulled directly behind the vehicle, at which point the other vehicle reversed and struck defendant’s vehicle, leaving a dent on the front driver’s side above the headlight. Subsequently, the other vehicle pulled westbound onto Putnam Pike and took an immediate right onto Esmond Street. The defendant testified that he followed the vehicle as far as he could', '-3- before losing it. He then returned to the gas station with the hope that someone had seen something or that a police officer would be there. The defendant denied any other interaction with Smith or his passengers.', 'Both Smith and defendant reported their versions of the events to the Smithfield police department. After taking statements and investigating, the Smithfield police arrested defendant on November 20, 2014, and he was ultimately charged by information on May 28, 2015, with assault with a dangerous weapon, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2 (count one); reckless driving, in violation of § 31-27-4 (count two); leaving the scene of an accident, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-26-2 (count three); falsely reporting a crime, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-32-2 (count four); and disorderly conduct, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-45-1(a) (count five). Prior to trial, the state dismissed count three pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', 'Subsequently, on April 20, 2017, defendant was convicted by a jury of count two, reckless driving, and acquitted of the remaining counts. The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to convict him of reckless driving and further contending that the jury did not note the specific location where defendant’s alleged reckless driving took place. On May 15, 2017, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial and sentenced defendant to one year at the Adult Correctional Institutions, the entirety of which was suspended, with probation. The trial justice further ordered defendant to complete anger-management counseling.

81,Augustina Mokwenyei : v. : Rhode Island Hospital. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. This appeal presents the issue of whether a plaintiff’s request for a right-to-sue letter from the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (the commission) can be timely made only when submitted in the form requested by the commission. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issue raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On August 23, 2016, the plaintiff, Augustina Mokwenyei, filed a complaint alleging that the defendant, Rhode Island Hospital, terminated her employment in 2013 “because of her race, ancestral origin, and age[,]” in violation of the Fair Employment Practices Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 5 of title 28 (FEPA), and the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 112 of title 42 (RICRA). The plaintiff alleged that she had been employed by defendant from 1989', '-1- until March 15, 2013, when she “was forced, under threat of being fired, to sign a resignation letter which she did not write.”', 'The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that neither of plaintiff’s claims were timely initiated in Superior Court—the RICRA claim because it was filed more than three years after plaintiff’s termination, and the FEPA claim because she had not properly and timely requested a right-to-sue letter from the commission as required by § 28-5-24.1. The defendant attached three exhibits to its motion: a copy of plaintiff’s complaint; a September 20, 2013 letter from the commission to defendant requesting a full response to the charge of discrimination that plaintiff had filed with the commission on September 11, 2013; and a March 30, 2015 letter from the commission to Rhode Island Hospital advising it that no probable cause had been found to support plaintiff’s charge of discrimination. The latter letter included a one- page insert entitled “Options for Complainant Following a No Probable Cause Ruling – Co-Filed Cases.”', 'The commission moved to intervene in the case as a party defendant pursuant to Rule 24(a)(2) and Rule 24(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. At the same time, the commission filed a motion to dismiss plaintiff’s FEPA claim on the basis that plaintiff had neither appealed from the commission’s finding of no probable cause nor complied with the required timeframe for requesting a right-to-sue letter. The commission attached one exhibit to its motion: its faxed response to plaintiff’s request for the right-to-sue letter, including a form for plaintiff’s signature and a request that it be signed and returned to the commission.', 'The plaintiff’s objection to the motions to dismiss simply stated that plaintiff had timely requested a right-to-sue letter from the commission and, once she received the letter,', '-2- subsequently timely filed a complaint in Superior Court.1 The plaintiff attached one document to her objection: a copy of her counsel’s April 10, 2015 letter to the commission requesting the issuance of a right-to-sue letter, which was accompanied by an affidavit signed by plaintiff stating that she wanted her counsel to prepare a right-to-sue letter.', 'A hearing on these motions was held in Superior Court on December 15 and 16, 2016,2 and focused primarily on defendant’s and intervenor’s arguments that plaintiff’s FEPA claim must be dismissed because plaintiff had failed to properly and timely request the right-to-sue letter on the form prepared by the commission for plaintiff’s signature. The plaintiff argued that the right-to-sue letter was timely requested from the commission on April 10, 2015, but that the request had not been submitted in the form preferred by the commission, so the commission faxed the proper form to plaintiff’s counsel for plaintiff’s signature. The plaintiff’s attorney admitted that plaintiff had not returned this completed form because this task “fell through the cracks” at the attorney’s office.', 'After plaintiff’s first attempt to initiate litigation in Superior Court was dismissed by stipulation (see footnote 1, supra), plaintiff received a right-to-sue letter from the commission on July 22, 2016. In addition, plaintiff conceded that she did not have a tenable objection to defendant’s argument that the statute of limitations had expired on her RICRA claim. 1', 'The plaintiff’s objection to the motions was filed in error in a previously dismissed case. The plaintiff apparently had filed the same complaint prior to receiving the right-to-sue letter from the commission, and that case was docketed in the Superior Court as No. PC-2016-3095. After defendant filed a motion to dismiss in that case based on plaintiff’s failure to obtain a right-to- sue letter from the commission before initiating litigation in Superior Court, the parties submitted a stipulation agreeing to dismiss that case, without prejudice. 2', 'The plaintiff has only provided us with the transcript from the second day of the hearing, December 16, therefore the record on appeal does not include a transcript from the first day of the hearing.', '-3-', 'After reviewing the submitted written communications between the parties pertaining to the processing of plaintiff’s charge of discrimination with the commission and plaintiff’s request for a right-to-sue letter from the commission, the hearing justice granted Rhode Island Hospital’s and the commission’s motions to dismiss. The hearing justice reasoned that plaintiff had not timely requested the right-to-sue letter because plaintiff had allowed more than one year to elapse between receiving the proper form for the request of the right-to-sue letter from the commission and returning the form so she could obtain the letter and proceed to file her complaint in Superior Court. Final judgment entered in favor of defendant on January 3, 2017, and plaintiff timely filed a notice of appeal to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'A threshold issue before us is the appropriate legal standard under which to consider the issue presented to us. The hearing justice granted defendant’s and intervenor’s motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. It is well settled that a Rule 12(b)(6) motion has a narrow and specific purpose: “to test the sufficiency of the complaint.” Multi-State Restoration, Inc. v.

If “it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff would not be entitled to relief from the defendant under any set of facts that could be proven in support of the plaintiff’s claim[,]” then the motion to dismiss may be granted.

She relied on the information provided in these documents to establish the timeline of the communications between plaintiff and the commission so that she could determine whether plaintiff had timely requested the required right-to-sue letter. However, the only relevant date explicitly provided within the four corners of the complaint was July 22, 2016, the date on which plaintiff obtained the right-to-sue letter. The hearing justice also relied exclusively on federal district court cases in which district court judges had considered federal agency charges, dismissals, and right-to-sue notices when they decided whether to grant motions to dismiss based on failure to comply with statutory timeframes in cases alleging discrimination.', 'To be sure, this Court often looks to federal jurisprudence for guidance or interpretation of our own rules of civil procedure, especially when the state rule and federal rule are substantially similar. Chhun v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems Inc., 84 A.3d 419, 422 (R.I. 2014). But this Court was clear in Chhun that it was not adopting the federal courts’ recently “altered” interpretation of the legal standard employed with respect to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Chhun, 84 A.3d at 422 (citing Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009); Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). Moreover, we have repeatedly held that, when a motion to dismiss includes documents as exhibits that were either mentioned or', '-5- referred to in a complaint but not expressly incorporated, and the hearing justice does not “explicitly exclude them from * * * consideration,” the motion “automatically” converts to one for summary judgment.

Bank of America, N.A., 184 A.3d 1121, 1126 (R.I. 2018). To be more precise, if “a complaint’s factual allegations are expressly linked to—and admittedly dependent upon—a document (the authenticity of which is not challenged), [then] that document effectively merges into the pleadings and the trial court can review it in deciding a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).” Jorge v. Rumsfeld, 404 F.3d 556, 559 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Beddall v. State Street Bank and Trust Co., 137 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 1998)). In the context of employment discrimination claims, these documents have included correspondence between an attorney and an administrative agency as well as from a claimant to an employer. See id.', 'In Jorge, the court identified a notice-of-intent-to-sue letter to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a notice of retirement from a claimant to her employer as documents that could be considered without converting the motion to dismiss to a motion for', '-6- summary judgment because the first notice showed that the claimant had failed to exhaust the required administrative remedies for one of her claims, and the second notice informed the court’s analysis of the actual accrual date for the other claim asserted in the complaint. Id. at 559, 561-62, 564-65.', 'In the case at bar, the correspondence attached to the motions to dismiss were relied on exclusively to support defendant’s and intervenor’s arguments that the form of plaintiff’s request for the right-to-sue letter was inadequate.

There is no allegation in the complaint that plaintiff timely requested the letter; the complaint simply alleges that she received it on a particular date. At the hearing on the motions to dismiss and in the hearing justice’s subsequent decision rendered from the bench, the hearing justice specifically considered and relied on other correspondence attached as exhibits to the motions to dismiss, including the no-probable-cause letter from the commission to Rhode Island Hospital, plaintiff’s counsel’s letter to the commission requesting the right-to-sue letter, and the commission’s faxed response requesting plaintiff’s signature on a prepared form. These items of correspondence are not central to plaintiff’s claims or ones that the complaint’s factual allegations are “expressly linked to” or “dependent upon.” Jorge, 404 F.3d at 559 (quoting Beddall, 137 F.3d at 17).

82,"Martin Malinou : v. : Barbara Neri, Individually and as Permanent : Co-Guardian of Ida D’Amore, et al.",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The plaintiff, Martin Malinou, ostensibly acting as successor executor for the wills of two former clients, is appealing from the Superior Court’s judgment dismissing his probate court appeals for his failure to comply with several court orders. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The travel of the case begins with two sisters living at Cedar Crest Nursing and Rehabilitation Centre in Cranston (Cedar Crest): Yolanda and Ida D’Amore. According to Malinou, each sister appointed him as her attorney-in-fact by signing a Short Form Power of Attorney soon after they moved from their home in Providence to Cedar Crest in 2009 and then,', '-1- in 2014, asked him to represent them in the Cranston Probate Court’s guardianship proceedings that had been initiated by their niece and nephew, the defendants Barbara Neri and Donald D’Amore. The defendants had initiated the proceedings in early 2014 after staff from Cedar Crest expressed concerns about the sisters’ abilities to make financial decisions for themselves. Malinou’s subsequent truculent and tortuous pursuit of his contention that the D’Amore sisters were not in need of legal guardians during the final months of their lives has wound its way through the probate courts of two cities, the Providence County Superior Court, and our Court.', 'On February 18, 2014, a Cranston Probate Court judge appointed defendants as temporary co-guardians of Yolanda and Ida. On March 13, 2014, Malinou appeared in the probate court to oppose the temporary guardianship status, asserting that the D’Amore sisters had asked him to represent them; however, he was unable to produce any documentation—such as a retainer agreement—to support his assertion. The probate judge continued the guardianship proceedings to allow the parties to conduct discovery, the parameters of which were set during the hearing. At a control date hearing on May 8, 2014, the probate judge reviewed some discovery questions and concerns, then set a date for a contested permanent guardianship hearing.', 'Before the next hearing, defendants filed a petition to remove Malinou as attorney-in-fact for the D’Amore sisters because discovery had uncovered suspicious banking activity in an account held by the sisters and Diane LaFerriere, an associate of Malinou’s. The latest account activity had been to close the account entirely.', 'On May 10, 2014, the final balance of $133,107.33 was transferred to Malinou without providing any notice to defendants. Counsel also forwarded the petition to remove to the Supreme Court’s Disciplinary Counsel and to the Rhode Island State Police Financial Crimes Unit. Around that same time, Malinou filed a', '-2- petition for a writ of certiorari asking this Court to review the Cranston Probate Court’s award of temporary guardianship; the petition was ultimately denied.', 'The probate court considered the petition to remove Malinou and the contested guardianship at a hearing held on June 26, 2014. After a long discussion about the suspicious banking activity, wherein Malinou represented to the probate court that he had deposited the $133,107.33 into his client account, the probate court granted defendants’ petition to remove Malinou as counsel for their wards. After reviewing the evidence indicating that the D’Amore sisters were unable to look after their financial affairs and finding that Malinou had not provided any evidence to the contrary, the probate court appointed defendants to be permanent co- guardians of the D’Amore sisters.', 'Shortly thereafter, on July 26, Yolanda passed away. Within a few days, Malinou filed a petition to probate her will in the Providence Probate Court and proposed that he be named executor pursuant to the terms of her will. The defendants filed motions to dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction, to transfer venue to the Cranston Probate Court, and to remove Malinou as proposed executor of the will. The Providence Probate Court dismissed Malinou’s petition without prejudice for lack of jurisdiction because Yolanda was a resident of Cranston (not Providence) at the time of her death. A decree to this effect entered on September 16, 2014. Ida passed away on May 31, 2015; an identical sequence of events transpired, resulting in a decree dismissing Malinou’s petition to probate Ida’s will for the same reasons. Malinou appealed from the Providence Probate Court’s decrees as well as from the orders issued by the Cranston Probate Court.', 'A justice of the Providence County Superior Court first encountered the parties in this case in October 2014, when he heard argument on Malinou’s motion to stay the Providence', '-3- Probate Court’s impending transfer of the petition to probate Yolanda’s will to the Cranston Probate Court.1 At that hearing, Malinou admitted he had received at least $133,107.33 of the D’Amore sisters’ money. The Superior Court justice subsequently consolidated all five of Malinou’s probate court appeals and held several hearings over the next two years related to the various issues raised in and by those appeals.2 The Superior Court justice ultimately dismissed the appeals pursuant to Rule 41(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure due to Malinou’s repeated refusals to comply with the orders of the Superior Court. The following summary of the proceedings in Superior Court therefore focuses on those orders—all of which relate to the money Malinou received and retained from the D’Amore sisters prior to their deaths.', 'The Superior Court held eight hearings between February and November 2015, at which the court repeatedly ordered Malinou to deposit the $133,107.33 into the Registry of the Superior Court. While Malinou twice assured the court that he could deposit this sum, he deposited only $100,000 after the fourth hearing at which this money was discussed. At the fifth hearing, he claimed that he no longer had any additional funds. The Superior Court ordered Malinou to provide a detailed accounting of all of the D’Amore sisters’ money that had come into his possession, and the court referred the matter to this Court’s Disciplinary Counsel. Malinou failed to comply with two separate orders directing him to provide a full accounting of the funds; 1', 'Malinou has not provided this Court with transcripts from any of the hearings held in Superior Court on his appeals from the probate courts’ orders. As a result, we rely on the Superior Court justice’s procedural summary in his written decision, filed on September 2, 2016, dismissing Malinou’s appeals. 2', 'Two of the appeals were from the Cranston Probate Court’s orders disqualifying Malinou from representing each D’Amore sister and granting defendants’ petitions for guardianship over Yolanda and Ida; one of the appeals was from the Cranston Probate Court’s order granting defendants’ petition for a citation compelling Malinou to provide testimony about the D’Amore sisters’ assets; and two of the appeals were from the Providence Probate Court’s orders granting defendants’ motions to dismiss Malinou’s petitions to probate Yolanda’s and Ida’s wills for lack of jurisdiction and improper venue.', '-4- when he finally provided some records and copies of checks, these did not account for the full missing $33,107.33. Eventually, in October 2015, the Superior Court justice held Malinou in contempt for his repeated failure to deposit the $33,107.33 balance into the registry of the court, ordering him to deposit the money within one week or be assessed a fine in the amount of $100 for each day that he failed to deposit that balance with the court.3 Status hearings held after the contempt order issued—on November 2, 2015 and May 6, 2016—came and went; Malinou still had not deposited the $33,107.33.', 'In the spring of 2016, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the appeals pursuant to Rule 41(b)(2) for Malinou’s repeated failure to comply with the court’s orders. The Superior Court granted the motion to dismiss on September 2, 2016. The Superior Court justice also granted defendants’ motion to order the Providence Probate Court to transfer the D’Amore sisters’ probate records to Cranston Probate Court.4 Final judgment entered on October 18, 2016, and Malinou timely filed notices of appeal.5 3', 'The verbal order issued at the hearing on October 23, 2015, was memorialized in a written order signed on November 30, 2015. 4', 'The Superior Court justice also opened a separate cause of action to monitor the status of his order finding Malinou in contempt for his failure to deposit the $33,107.33 balance into the registry of the court—No. PM-2016-3454. No significant activity has registered in this case since it opened. 5', 'The complaints filed with this Court’s Disciplinary Counsel were investigated by the Disciplinary Board, which recommended a minimum ninety-day suspension of Malinou’s license to practice law, with reinstatement of his license only after he deposits the $33,107.33 balance into the registry of the court. After this Court directed Malinou to show cause why we should not adopt the Disciplinary Board’s recommendation and considered the matter at a conference held in October 2017, we issued an order agreeing with the Disciplinary Board’s conclusion that Malinou had violated Article V, Rule 1.15 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct when he did not notify defendants about the local bank account he knew was held by the D’Amore sisters and LaFerriere and that LaFerriere had closed the account during the pendency of the guardianship proceedings and given the proceeds to Malinou. In the Matter of Malinou, 172 A.3d 774, 774-76 (R.I. 2017) (mem.).

He asserts that, as a result, there was not a proper guardianship in place for the D’Amore sisters when he received the $133,107.33, so he was not obligated to disclose these funds either to defendants or to the probate court. With respect to his appeal from the Providence Probate Court’s dismissal of his petition to probate Yolanda’s will, Malinou argues that a jury trial is required to make a factual determination regarding whether Yolanda resided in Cranston or Providence at the time of her death. He also asserts that his inability to pay is a complete defense to his failure to comply with the Superior Court’s contempt order.6 He does not challenge the contempt order itself, only the dismissal of his appeals. reinstatement only after Malinou deposited the $33,107.33 balance into the registry of the court.

While Malinou filed a notice of appeal in each of the Superior Court cases, along with five motions to proceed in forma pauperis, there is no dispute that he paid only one filing fee after a Superior Court justice denied his motions to proceed in forma pauperis. Regardless, Malinou urges this Court to review the Superior Court’s decision and judgment as it relates to all five of his probate court appeals.', 'It is well settled that causes of action may be consolidated for judicial economy when the actions involve common law and facts, but that the consolidated matter does not merge into a single cause of action. Instead, the causes of action “remain distinct throughout trial and in the event of an appeal, a notice of appeal must be filed for each action.” In re Estate of Ross, 131 A.3d 158, 159 n.2 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State Water Resources Board v. Howard, 729 A.2d 712, 714 (R.I. 1999)). It is equally well settled that a condition precedent to a valid, perfected appeal is to pay the required filing fee. Illas v. Przybyla, 850 A.2d 937, 943 (R.I. 2004); Martin v. Lilly, 505 A.2d 1156, 1160 (R.I. 1986); Article I, Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. A filing fee is therefore required for each separate notice of appeal.', 'Here, Malinou filed five separate notices of appeal; but, after his motions to proceed in forma pauperis were denied by the Superior Court, he paid only the filing fee for the notice of appeal from No. PP-2014-4885. This particular cause of action represented Malinou’s appeal from a decree of the Providence Probate Court in case No. 2014-337, denying Malinou’s petition to probate Yolanda’s will due to lack of jurisdiction and improper venue. Malinou’s appeal from this probate court decree to the Superior Court ended with an involuntary dismissal pursuant to Rule 41(b)(2); therefore, the only issue properly before us for review is whether the Superior', '-7- Court justice abused his discretion when he dismissed this probate court appeal for Malinou’s failure to comply with the court’s orders. We therefore do not reach any of the Superior Court justice’s substantive findings and legal conclusions with respect to any of Malinou’s probate court appeals.', 'Rule 41(b)(2) provides, in relevant part, that “[o]n motion of the defendant the court may, in its discretion, dismiss any action for failure of the plaintiff to comply with these rules or any order of court * * *.” A dismissal under this rule “operates as an adjudication upon the merits[,]” unless the court specifies otherwise.

Nye, 102 A.3d at 630.', 'In the case at bar, it is our opinion that the Superior Court justice properly exercised his discretion in dismissing Malinou’s appeal from the probate court decree dismissing his petition to probate Yolanda’s will. The Superior Court justice was clearly concerned from the outset of the appeals that a portion of the deceased’s assets were potentially improperly in Malinou’s possession. The Superior Court justice provided several opportunities for Malinou to deposit the $33,107.33 balance into the registry of the court, continuing the probate appeal proceedings many times in reasonable anticipation of Malinou’s compliance with the court’s orders. 7', 'After the 1995 amendment to this rule removed the language allowing a defendant in a nonjury trial to move for dismissal at the close of the plaintiff’s evidence, most of the appeals from judgments dismissing cases pursuant to Rule 41(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure involve a plaintiff’s lack of prosecution of the case or failure to effectuate service of process within the required time frame.

Eventually, he claimed that he did not have the money, but he did not tell the court that he was unable to pay this sum at all. After two years of regular hearing dates but no compliance from Malinou with the Superior Court’s orders to deposit the remaining $33,107.33 into the registry of the court, even after the Superior Court had held him in contempt, the decision to grant defendants’ motion to dismiss Malinou’s appeal was amply justified.

On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred, pursuant to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine,1 in allowing a firearm and ammunition into evidence after the Providence police obtained statements from the defendant in violation of her constitutional right to remain silent and right to counsel. Moreover, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in failing to exclude the physical evidence obtained through the defendant’s statements, asserting that her statements were involuntary and the product of coercion.', 'Finally, the defendant avers that the trial justice erred in failing to suppress the physical evidence seized from her vehicle because the Providence police violated her constitutional rights pursuant to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution by impounding her vehicle without probable cause. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'In Wong Sun v.

Wong Sun, 371 U.S. at 485-86.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 17, 2015, a grand jury indicted defendant on count one, first-degree murder, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1; and count two, discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(b)(4). The following facts give rise to these charges. At the time of her death, Pamela Donahue (Donahue) shared her apartment with Walter Woodyatt (Woodyatt), her former boyfriend. At trial, Woodyatt testified that he had a strained relationship with Donahue due to his drinking and her drug use. He explained that his romantic relationship with Donahue ultimately ended, but that he still lived in Donahue’s apartment at the time in question. Following the end of her romantic relationship with Woodyatt, Donahue met defendant while they were both staying in the hospital, and the two began dating.', 'On December 1, 2014, the day before Donahue was murdered, defendant went to the Providence police station to discuss concerns she had regarding Donahue’s drug use and her abusive relationship with her drug dealer, with whom, according to defendant, Donahue had had sexual relations. After spending approximately thirty minutes speaking with a detective at the police station, defendant left without ever identifying Donahue by name.', 'In the late afternoon of December 2, 2014, Woodyatt arrived at Donahue’s apartment, after spending several hours at a local bar, to find Donahue and defendant talking; he alleged they were also doing drugs. Woodyatt testified at trial that, around 7:45 p.m., defendant gave him $40 and asked him to go “to the store right across the street” to get three packs of cigarettes and soda. Woodyatt testified that he obliged, and that he thought it was odd when he saw defendant pulling away in her vehicle as he left the store with defendant’s change and the items she had requested. Woodyatt testified that he proceeded back to the apartment and that his', '-2- announcement of arrival went unanswered. Woodyatt described finding Donahue face down on the floor; he testified that he “couldn’t get her up.” At 8:25 p.m., Woodyatt, unable to find the apartment phone, went upstairs to use a neighbor’s phone to call the police; he informed them that he believed Donahue had overdosed.', 'After the paramedics arrived and transported Donahue’s body to the hospital, the police looked around the apartment for about an hour and a half, collecting drugs and cell phones. Woodyatt testified that, after the detectives left, he learned that Donahue had died. Later that same night, Woodyatt testified, defendant called the landline phone at the apartment and asked how Donahue was doing. Woodyatt informed defendant, “She’s dead[,]” and defendant hung up the phone. Upon examining Donahue’s body, the medical examiner determined that a gunshot wound to the chest had caused Donahue’s death. An investigation ensued.', 'A', 'The First Interview', 'On December 3, 2014, detectives met defendant at her Johnston, Rhode Island, apartment, and defendant agreed to accompany them to the Providence police station to discuss Donahue’s death.', 'During that time, other detectives began drafting a search warrant for defendant’s apartment, and Johnston police secured the scene. Police conducted a search of defendant’s apartment around 11:00 p.m. and found nothing of evidentiary value. However, while at defendant’s apartment, detectives located her white Kia in the back parking lot of the apartment complex and towed the vehicle to the Providence police station for secure keeping until police could apply for a search warrant. That warrant was obtained and executed the next day, December 4, 2014. The police seized a shell casing and three cell phones from defendant’s vehicle.', '-3-', 'In the interim, Detectives William Corrigan and Frank Villella of the Providence police department initiated an interview (the first interview)2 with defendant at the police station and read defendant her Miranda rights.3 Detective Corrigan testified that defendant confirmed that she understood her rights and that she checked a box on the rights form acknowledging as much. He testified that defendant told the detectives that someone had stolen money from her bank account during her recent stay in the hospital. Moreover, Det. Corrigan testified that defendant told detectives that she had been in a relationship with Donahue for several years.', 'Finally, Det. Corrigan testified that defendant admitted to having had an argument with Donahue on the night of December 2, 2014, and that defendant told the detectives that she left the apartment soon after she sent Woodyatt to get cigarettes and soda because Donahue had asked her to leave. Approximately twenty-five minutes into the interview, defendant requested counsel and the police terminated the interview. At that time, defendant was not under arrest and she left the station. Detective Corrigan testified that, based on his extensive experience dealing with individuals under the influence of narcotics or alcohol, defendant did not appear to be inhibited by either during that interview.', 'B', 'The Second Interview', 'Nine days later, on December 12, 2014, police obtained an arrest warrant for defendant.

Corrigan informed defendant that the attorney had not. Detective Corrigan then read defendant her rights again. Near the beginning of the interview, defendant referenced counsel twice more. At one point she asked, “I mean, do I get my lawyer in here with * * * me then? I don’t want to be alone if that’s (inaudible). I don’t know. I mean, I do know.

The trial justice viewed and listened to this video at the suppression hearing.', '-5- involvement regarding the shell casing.', 'Instead, defendant proposed the idea that perhaps someone had planted the shell casing in her vehicle in an effort to “pin” the crime on her. Until this point, defendant and the detectives had remained quiet and calm in their exchanges. However, after the detectives informed defendant about the shell casing, the video recording of the interview reveals, defendant became tense and raised her voice for a moment. The detectives also became argumentative for a short time.', 'After that, the remainder of the second interview proceeded in a conversational and seemingly relaxed manner, and defendant continually denied any involvement in Donahue’s murder. Eventually, defendant stated, “I thought I was supposed to have a lawyer here for questioning.” The detectives, again, continued to question defendant. At some point thereafter, defendant asked the detectives if they had anything else to tell her, at which time the detectives told defendant that “[t]he bullet—the shell casing we found in your car, it matches the bullet that we found in her body.” In response, defendant repeatedly told detectives that was “impossible.”', 'Subsequently, defendant again invoked her right to counsel:', '“[DEFENDANT]:', 'You’re supposed—', '“DETECTIVE SICAL:', 'Sendra—', '“[DEFENDANT]:', '—to have a lawyer here.

Detective Corrigan candidly testified that he was aware that he was legally required to stop questioning defendant once she requested counsel; however, he had continued to question her after her first requests for counsel in an effort to elicit information and because she had continued talking.', 'Officer Chamberlain testified that, upon arriving back at the cellblock, defendant placed her one allotted phone call to her attorney. Officer Chamberlain further testified that she was unware if defendant’s attorney had answered the call and that, while she did stand close by, she did not listen to defendant’s exact words because it was a “private phone call[.]” Officer Chamberlain also testified that, at around 8:00 p.m., defendant “was hollering for [Officer Chamberlain] to come” to her cell, at which time defendant requested to speak with the detectives. Officer Chamberlain testified that she contacted the detectives and that, at around 9:00 p.m., the detectives arrived at the cellblock to take defendant back to the interview room. Lastly, Officer Chamberlain testified that, between the time detectives brought defendant back to her cell after the second interview and the time that defendant requested to speak to the detectives again, no detective or police officer spoke with defendant in the cellblock.', '-7-', 'C', 'The Third Interview', 'Sergeant Fabio Zuena, of the Providence police department detective division, and Det. Sical conducted the next interview (the third interview).6 Sergeant Zuena testified that he believed defendant had stated that she was cold as the detectives took her from the cellblock to the interview room; so, at the onset of the third interview, Det. Sical gave defendant a jacket. After that, the interview began with the following exchange:', '“DETECTIVE ZUENA:', 'Before we get started, you', 'approached them downstairs, you', 'wanted to speak to us again?', '“[DEFENDANT]:', 'Yes.

The defendant proceeded to confess to using the gun to shoot Donahue one time in the chest. After defendant confessed to murdering Donahue, she explained that she buried the gun at a location off Route 116 in Scituate, Rhode Island. The detectives then asked defendant to bring them to where the gun was buried “because [they] wouldn’t want anybody else to get hurt with [it].”', 'The detectives proceeded to tell defendant that they “really [didn’t] want anybody to find it, especially a small child * * * playing in the area, to find it and hurt themselves.” Ultimately, defendant agreed to go with the detectives the next morning to show them where she buried the gun.', 'D', 'The Fourth Interview', 'At approximately 9:30 a.m. the next day, Detective Jason Simoneau and Det. Corrigan transported defendant to a park in Scituate where she had informed them that she had hidden the', '-9- gun (the fourth interview).7 Due to inclement weather, after pointing officers in the general direction of the gun, defendant remained in the police cruiser as the detectives searched for the gun. Eventually, the detectives located the gun, and ammunition, hidden under leaves. The detectives did not read defendant her Miranda rights at any time that morning.', 'E', 'Pretrial Motions, Trial, and Appeal', 'Prior to trial, defendant filed two separate motions to suppress—the first, in May 2015, dealt with the search and seizure of defendant’s vehicle; and the second, in October 2015, just prior to trial, sought the suppression of defendant’s statements to police and the physical evidence obtained from those statements. In an effort to give more context to the crux of the arguments, we will first consider defendant’s Miranda arguments regarding the motion to suppress the statements and physical evidence obtained therefrom, and then we will address defendant’s motion to suppress concerning the search and seizure of her vehicle.', 'On October 16 and 20, 2015, the trial justice heard arguments on defendant’s motion to suppress her statements to police, as well as a motion to suppress the physical evidence that was obtained as a result of those statements. At the October 20, 2015 hearing, the state conceded that the Providence police had violated defendant’s Miranda rights with regard to the second, third, and fourth interviews. Accordingly, the parties and the trial justice agreed that defendant’s statements in each of those interviews required suppression at trial.8 Therefore, the remaining issue for the trial justice to consider was whether, in light of the Miranda violations, the gun and 7', 'Detective Corrigan testified that he believed Lieutenant Figueiredo and Bureau of Criminal Investigation Detectives Braga and Moscarelli were also present that morning. 8', 'At the suppression hearing, the state also requested that defendant’s statements be deemed admissible for impeachment purposes should she decide to testify at trial; the trial justice agreed in her written decision. The defendant chose not to testify at trial.', '- 10 - ammunition that defendant had led the police detectives to in Scituate were inadmissible physical evidence, as the fruit of defendant’s inadmissible statements.', 'The defendant contended that the trial justice should reject the Supreme Court’s holding in United States v. Patane, 542 U.S. 630 (2004), in which the Supreme Court declined to extend the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine to exclude physical evidence obtained through voluntary but unwarned confessions. Patane, 542 U.S. at 636-37. Instead, defendant urged the trial justice to follow the lead of other states and broaden protections under the Rhode Island Constitution. The defendant also argued that, even if the trial justice did find Patane controlling, the physical evidence is nevertheless inadmissible because her mental illness and the alleged coercive nature of the interrogation rendered her confession involuntary and outside the parameters of Patane. The state argued, however, that the physical evidence that the Providence police obtained by way of defendant’s statements was admissible, notwithstanding the Miranda violations, because of the holding in Patane.', 'The state further contended that a suspect’s mental illness is not dispositive in determining coercion; instead, the nature of the police conduct is controlling.', 'On November 12, 2015, the trial justice issued a written decision denying defendant’s motion to suppress. The trial justice thoroughly explained the split among states’ interpretations and applications of Patane, ultimately concluding that she was constrained to follow the approach announced in Patane, based on this Court’s jurisprudence. Moreover, the trial justice awarded no merit to defendant’s contention that her confession was involuntary. The trial justice determined that the detectives did not violate defendant’s rights during the interrogations when they made “misstatements” regarding the link between the bullet found in Donahue’s body and the shell casing found in defendant’s vehicle. The trial justice also concluded that the police', '- 11 - acted lawfully in waiting more than fourteen days, after they first questioned her on the day after Donahue’s murder, to arrest defendant and conduct the second interview.', 'The defendant’s trial began on November 12, 2015, and concluded on November 24, 2015, when a jury found defendant guilty of second-degree murder on count one and guilty of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence on count two. On January 8, 2016, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. Thereafter, on March 4, 2016, the trial justice imposed a life sentence on count one and a consecutive life sentence on count two.', 'On March 9, 2016, defendant appealed her convictions to this Court. She argues on appeal that the trial justice erred in admitting the physical evidence obtained as a result of what defendant asserts were involuntary and coerced statements in violation of Miranda. Moreover, defendant avers that the seizure of her vehicle was unlawful and the evidence obtained therein was tainted physical evidence.', 'We will first address whether the trial justice erred in allowing the firearm and ammunition into evidence at trial, in light of the fact that the Providence police obtained defendant’s statements in violation of her right to remain silent and her right to counsel under Miranda. Next, we will consider whether defendant’s statements were involuntary and, if so, whether the trial justice therefore erred in declining to suppress the physical evidence. Finally, we will consider whether the impounding of defendant’s vehicle by the Providence police violated her protections against unreasonable searches and seizures guaranteed under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions and whether any evidence seized therefrom was tainted and inadmissible.', '- 12 -', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When we review a trial justice’s decision on a motion to suppress, we engage in a two- step process. See State v. Hall, 940 A.2d 645, 656 (R.I. 2008). First, “we ‘defer to the trial justice’s findings of historical fact concerning the voluntariness of the confession unless those findings are clearly erroneous.’” State v. Tejeda, 171 A.3d 983, 1000 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Musterd, 56 A.3d 931, 938 (R.I. 2012)). Second, because the issues we address herein are “of constitutional dimension, we accept the historical facts and credibility determinations, and then conduct a de novo review of the trial justice’s conclusion that the confession was voluntary.” Hall, 940 A.2d at 656.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Admission of Physical Fruits of Unwarned Statements', 'Prior to commencing our analysis, we reiterate that the state conceded prior to trial that defendant’s statements during her second, third, and fourth interviews required suppression and could not be used against her at trial, except for impeachment purposes. Therefore, the issue before this Court is whether law enforcement’s failure to comply with Miranda requires the suppression of the physical evidence acquired as a result of a suspect’s unwarned, but voluntary, statements. In answering this question, this Court must first decide whether to adopt the United States Supreme Court’s 2004 holding in Patane, where the Court concluded that suppression is not required in such instances. See generally Patane, 542 U.S. 630. In appealing the trial justice’s decision, defendant avers that we should instead follow the lead of other state courts and', '- 13 - provide broader protections based on our state constitution. To accept defendant’s argument in this respect would require that we hold that our state constitution provides broader protections than the Self-Incrimination Clause of the United States Constitution.', 'In Patane, the Supreme Court addressed “whether a failure to give a suspect the [Miranda] warnings * * * requires suppression of the physical fruits of the suspect’s unwarned but voluntary statements.” Patane, 542 U.S. at 633-34. There, a police officer attempted to read the defendant his rights, and the defendant interrupted and informed the officer that he was aware of his rights. Id. at 635. The officer proceeded to act on information he received prior to the interaction and asked the defendant, a convicted felon, if he had a firearm in his residence. Id. After the defendant hesitated in responding, the officer persisted, and, ultimately, the defendant informed the officer of the location of a pistol in his home, and the officer seized the firearm. Id. Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to suppress the pistol, arguing in part that the officer unlawfully obtained the firearm as the fruit of an unwarned statement. Id.', 'The Supreme Court held that the admission of the physical fruits of a voluntary statement into evidence will not implicate the Self-Incrimination Clause, finding “no justification for extending the Miranda rule to [that] context.” Patane, 542 U.S. at 636-37. The Supreme Court reasoned, “the Miranda rule is a prophylactic employed to protect against violations of the Self- Incrimination Clause.” Id. at 636.', 'Moreover, the Supreme Court explained that “the core protection afforded by the Self-Incrimination Clause is a prohibition on compelling a criminal defendant to testify against himself at trial[,]” and “[t]he Clause cannot be violated by the introduction of nontestimonial evidence obtained as a result of voluntary statements.” Id. at 637. Additionally, the Supreme Court stated, “any further extension of [prophylactic] rules must be justified by its necessity for the protection of the actual right against compelled self-', '- 14 - incrimination. * * * Indeed, at times the Court has declined to extend Miranda even where it has perceived a need to protect the privilege against self-incrimination.” Id. at 639; see, e.g., New York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649, 657 (1984).', 'The Supreme Court also drew an important distinction between unreasonable searches that violate the Fourth Amendment and failure to properly “Mirandize” a suspect, and concluded that the exclusion of unwarned statements at trial is a sufficient remedy for Miranda violations. Id. at 641-42.', 'While this Court has not yet had the opportunity to address this issue, several other jurisdictions have. In the wake of Patane, state courts are at odds as to whether their state constitutions would produce the same result as in the Patane holding. Accordingly, some states have construed their own constitutions as requiring broadened protections against self- incrimination. Those states decline to follow Patane, and extend Miranda-violation remedies to prohibit the admission of physical evidence. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Martin, 827 N.E.2d 198, 203 (Mass. 2005); State v. Farris, 849 N.E.2d 985, 996 (Ohio 2006); State v. Vondehn, 236 P.3d 691, 700 (Or. 2010); State v. Peterson, 923 A.2d 585, 593 (Vt. 2007); State v.

These states provide the same protections available under federal law. For example, in Coleman-Fuller v. State, 995 A.2d 985 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2010), the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland followed the Supreme Court and concluded that photographs obtained as a result of a voluntary statement by the defendant were admissible, notwithstanding the fact that the officers disregarded the defendant’s unambiguous request for an attorney.

In re H.V., 252 S.W.3d at 329. There, after giving the defendant his Miranda warnings, and after the defendant invoked his right to counsel, the police officers continued to question the defendant until he eventually disclosed the location of the murder weapon.

The Texas Supreme Court affirmed the lower court’s decision to suppress the defendant’s statements that the officers had obtained unlawfully, but reversed the lower court’s holding that suppressed the murder weapon as fruit of the poisonous tree. Id. at 329. The Texas Supreme Court relied on Patane in reasoning that—absent police coercion or other situations rendering a confession involuntary—a Miranda violation does not require suppression of physical evidence. Id. at 329; see also State v. John, 123 So. 3d 196, 202, 203 (La. Ct.

Nevertheless, “[i]t is not for this Court to impose its preferred police practices on * * * law enforcement officials[.]” See Patane, 542 U.S. at 642.

Specifically, defendant references the nineteen days that detectives allowed to pass between the first interview and the date on which she was arrested. Additionally, defendant refers to the detectives’ falsified statements in the second interview, informing defendant that the shell casing seized from her vehicle matched the bullet found in Donahue’s body. The defendant also highlights several instances where the detectives ignored her requests for counsel.

In Gilkeson, the court concluded that physical evidence was inadmissible against the defendant because his confession was the product of police coercion, making Patane inapplicable. Gilkeson, 431 F. Supp. 2d at 294. Not only is Gilkeson factually distinguishable on several grounds, that case also holds no precedential value', '- 19 - in this Court, as it is a decision from the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York.10 There, the defendant claimed that police handcuffed him to a floor rail for several hours and repeatedly denied his requests to contact his attorney. Id. at 274. Additionally, several different police officers questioned the defendant over a span of roughly seventeen hours—until 4:00 a.m.—when the defendant ultimately signed a consent form. Id. at 294.', 'In considering whether police coercion elicited a statement, we look to the conduct of the police and do not consider the mental state of the suspect or defendant dispositive of coercion. This is so because “[t]he sole concern of the Fifth Amendment, on which Miranda was based, is governmental coercion.” Colorado v. Connelly, 479 U.S. 157, 170 (1986).', 'Moreover, the Supreme Court has explained that “the Fifth Amendment privilege is not concerned ‘with moral and psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official coercion.’” Id. (quoting Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 305 (1985)). This Court has also determined that a defendant who suffered from delusions had voluntarily made statements free from coercion. See State v. Arpin, 122 R.I. 643, 650 n.4, 655, 410 A.2d 1340, 1344 n.4, 1346 (1980); see also State v. Brouillard, 745 A.2d 759, 764 (R.I. 2000) (explaining that the “defendant’s impaired mental state, if it was impaired, was irrelevant to the question of the voluntariness of his confession because it was not induced by the police or by any other state actor”).', 'A review of the record of this case reveals that the Providence police did not coerce defendant. For instance, defendant did not endure prolonged interrogation, and she had the opportunity to call her lawyer—albeit after several requests. Furthermore, the detectives never employed abusive interrogation tactics to elicit information from defendant. Instead, a review of 10', 'We would note that, while United States v. Gilkeson, 431 F. Supp. 2d 270 (N.D.N.Y. 2006), lacks precedential value on this Court, a federal district court decision could still be persuasive under certain circumstances. However, in light of the vastly different facts in that case as opposed to the one before us, it has no such value here.', '- 20 - the interrogation videos assures us that the interviews were relaxed in nature and conversational in tone for almost the entirety of each of the interviews. The detectives also provided defendant with water during the interviews, gave her a jacket, and agreed to inquire about getting a blanket for her to use in her cell. Officer Chamberlain testified that defendant also had food in her cell and that the officer placed more food in defendant’s cell when the detectives brought defendant to the interview room.', 'This case is also distinct from Gilkeson because, here, defendant voluntarily initiated the third interview with detectives when she summoned Officer Chamberlain to her cell and requested that she be allowed to speak with detectives again. The defendant in Gilkeson did not have a choice. See Gilkeson, 431 F. Supp. 2d at 274. At that time, Beauregard had the opportunity to make a phone call to her attorney. Officer Chamberlain testified that no one from the Providence police department interacted with defendant during that time. Notably, as the trial justice described, defendant appeared “intelligent, polite, alert, calm, rational and responsive during all three interviews,” and “[h]er responses to the police questions were clear, thoughtful and reflective.” We therefore opine that defendant’s statements were not coerced on these grounds.11', 'Additionally, defendant avers that law enforcement’s decision to wait nineteen days to arrest her was procedurally improper and indicative of coercion. However, in Maryland v. Shatzer, 559 U.S. 98 (2010), the Supreme Court held that, after a suspect invokes his or her right 11', 'The defendant refers to her mental illness to argue that her statements were coerced and involuntary. Although it is not necessary to consider, we would highlight defendant’s lucid train of thought as she maneuvered through the interviews with police, offering alternative theories for Donahue’s murder and attempting to pass blame onto various other actors throughout the interview. The defendant offered an array of suspects as well as several alternative rationales to explain why she murdered Donahue. Additionally, defendant also suggested that the police planted the shell casing in her vehicle to frame her for the crime. These facts make us confident in our conclusion that defendant was not inhibited by a mental illness such as to render her confession involuntary.', '- 21 - to counsel, police must then wait at least fourteen days before reinitiating contact with the suspect. Shatzer, 559 U.S. at 110 (holding that fourteen days “provides plenty of time for the suspect to get reacclimated to his [or her] normal life, to consult with friends or counsel, and to shake off any residual coercive effects of his [or her] prior custody”). Based on this reasoning, the detectives here acted lawfully and reasonably in waiting that allotted amount of time between the first interview with defendant and her subsequent arrest. We do not view this as a coercive tactic.', 'Furthermore, defendant’s contention that the detectives coerced her statements by misstating facts regarding the connection between the shell casing seized from her vehicle and the bullet found in Donahue’s body similarly fails. The United States Supreme Court has held that “[t]he fact that the police misrepresented the statements that [a witness] had made is, while relevant, insufficient * * * to make [an] otherwise voluntary confession inadmissible.” Frazier v. Cupp, 394 U.S. 731, 739 (1969). In light of the totality of the circumstances, we agree with the trial justice that the detectives’ interview techniques did not amount to coercion and were not “sufficient to affect a voluntariness finding.”', 'Accordingly, we cannot say that the trial justice clearly erred in determining that defendant’s statements were voluntary. Therefore, pursuant to Patane, the gun and ammunition that defendant’s unwarned statements led detectives to are admissible.', 'C', 'Impounding of Defendant’s Vehicle', 'We next consider whether the trial justice erred in concluding that the police’s seizure through the impounding of defendant’s vehicle and the subsequent search of the vehicle were constitutional and the evidence obtained therein consequently admissible. As stated above, the', '- 22 - detectives obtained a search warrant for defendant’s apartment after their first interview with defendant, which was at approximately 7:00 p.m. on December 3, 2014. Around 11:00 p.m. that same night, detectives executed the search warrant and found nothing of evidentiary value in defendant’s apartment. After the detectives finished searching her apartment, they impounded defendant’s white Kia, which was in a parking lot behind defendant’s apartment complex. The next day, the police obtained a search warrant for defendant’s vehicle; they performed the search at approximately 10:10 p.m. that day. In executing the search warrant, detectives uncovered a .38-caliber shell casing and three cell phones.', 'At the hearing on defendant’s motion to suppress the shell casing and three cell phones that Providence police seized from her vehicle, defendant averred that the police had violated her Fourth Amendment rights when they seized her vehicle.12 The defendant contended that the police did not have probable cause; and, therefore, defendant argued that the items seized were inadmissible. In opposing defendant’s motion, the state contended that the police had probable cause to believe that defendant’s vehicle contained evidence of Donahue’s murder, particularly in light of the fact that they had just obtained a search warrant for defendant’s apartment. The state additionally argued that the evidence obtained from defendant’s vehicle was admissible under the automobile exception to the exclusionary rule.', 'On June 5, 2015, after considering the parties’ memoranda and the relevant case law, the trial justice concluded that the police had reason to believe that defendant’s vehicle contained evidence relating to Donahue’s murder, and she therefore denied defendant’s motion. The trial 12', 'The parties did not orally argue this motion. At the beginning of the hearing, the trial justice explained that she had reviewed the papers submitted by the parties and proceeded to issue a bench decision.', '- 23 - justice further noted that the automobile exception would apply to allow the evidence seized from defendant’s car, even without the warrant that the police had subsequently obtained.', 'In reaching her conclusion, the trial justice reviewed Woodyatt’s detailed timeline of events, as described in his statement to police. Specifically, Woodyatt explained that he was in the apartment with defendant and Donahue just before Donahue was murdered. Woodyatt testified that defendant gave him $40 and asked him to go to the store across the street to get cigarettes and soda; as he left the store and made his way back to the apartment with the items and defendant’s change, he saw defendant driving away in her white Kia. Upon returning to the apartment, after just a short time, Woodyatt found Donahue alone and unresponsive. Video surveillance from the convenience store corroborated Woodyatt’s version of the events. Further, Woodyatt had described various occasions in the past in which he witnessed defendant and Donahue having both verbal and physical altercations. Finally, the trial justice noted that, “if the police had gone and got the warrant [before impounding the vehicle], they would have received the warrant based on * * * probable cause and obtained the same evidence.” Accordingly, the trial justice declared that this case fell squarely within the holding of State v. Werner, 615 A.2d 1010 (R.I. 1992), and therefore the automobile exception to the warrant requirement clearly applied to the facts of this case.', 'In appealing the trial justice’s denial of her motion to suppress, defendant contends that the Providence police violated her rights under both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution, because the police lacked the requisite probable cause to seize her vehicle. As such, defendant argues that the shell casing and three cell phones seized from her vehicle were tainted and consequently inadmissible at trial.', '- 24 -', 'To the contrary, the state maintains that the trial justice correctly determined that the police had probable cause to seize defendant’s vehicle. The state also argues that the seizure of the vehicle was necessitated by the circumstances because, on the day that defendant’s vehicle was seized, defendant was not under arrest and therefore she could have moved the vehicle or discarded any evidence that was inside. Lastly, the state posits that the Providence police showed good faith in obtaining a warrant to search defendant’s vehicle and that the police would have been justified in searching it in the parking lot of the apartment complex without a warrant.', 'Both the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution protect individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. Accordingly, to conduct a search, the police must have probable cause and a warrant, absent an exception to the warrant requirement. The Supreme Court has defined probable cause, in the automobile context, as “a belief, reasonably arising out of circumstances known to the seizing officer, that an automobile or other vehicle contains that which by law is subject to seizure[.]” United States v. Ross, 456 U.S. 798, 805 (1982) (quoting Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 149 (1925)). Additionally, the Supreme Court explained, “the probable-cause determination must be based on objective facts that could justify the issuance of a warrant by a magistrate and not merely on the subjective good faith of the police officers.” Id. at 808. This Court has held that, in the absence of a warrant, the automobile exception “permits a warrantless search of an automobile if there is probable cause to believe that its contents offend against the law * * * and if the attendant circumstances are exigent because the delay incident to obtaining a warrant would create a potential for the vehicle to be moved or its illegal contents disturbed.” State v. Benoit, 117 R.I. 69, 72, 363 A.2d 207, 210 (1976).', '- 25 -', 'The case now before us is analogous to the situation in Werner, in which we addressed the automobile exception. There, the police relied on facts from “eyewitnesses at the scene of the shooting [who] supplied officers with a detailed description of the assailant’s car[.]” Werner, 615 A.2d at 1014. We held that the officer was justified in relying on the eyewitnesses’ statements and thereafter searching the vehicle, without a warrant, seeking evidence relating to the crime. Id. We relied on Supreme Court opinions in holding “that exigency is no longer a requirement of the automobile exception” to the Fourth Amendment. Id.', 'Moreover, we explained that “[a]s long as the police have probable cause to believe that an automobile * * * holds contraband or evidence of a crime, then police may conduct a warrantless search of the vehicle * * * even if the vehicle has lost its mobility and is in police custody.” Id. at 1013-14.', 'We agree with the trial justice’s probable-cause analysis, and hold that the Providence police had probable cause to justify the seizure of the defendant’s vehicle under the automobile exception. The trial justice clearly and thoroughly articulated her review of the facts in making her determination that the Providence police had probable cause to impound and subsequently search the defendant’s vehicle.', 'Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s denial of the defendant’s motion to suppress the shell casing and three cell phones seized from that search.13 We also note that, while in an abundance of caution, the Providence police, in good faith, sought and obtained a search warrant before searching the defendant’s vehicle, the police would have 13', 'The defendant argued below that there was an absence of exigency because defendant had possession of her vehicle for nearly twenty-four hours after Donahue’s murder. While exigency is no longer a requirement for the automobile exception, the trial justice did explain why she believed exigent circumstances existed. In her decision, the trial justice noted that defendant’s first interaction with the Providence police took place on December 3, 2014, when the police asked defendant to accompany them to the police station. At that time, defendant was not under arrest, and she was free to leave when the first interview ended. Accordingly, the trial justice concluded that the police had reason to believe that, in light of defendant’s interactions with them, she might attempt to dispose of any evidence that may have been in her vehicle.', '- 26 - been justified in searching the vehicle prior to obtaining a warrant, based on the probable cause detailed herein.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

He was sentenced to a term of ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with two years to serve and the balance suspended with probation. On appeal, the defendant contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the trial justice committed what the defendant submits were three evidentiary errors— two of which relate to the admissibility of certain testimony, and one of which relates to the trial justice’s having allowed a specific line of questioning by the prosecution as to whether the defendant’s wife had contacted the alleged victim or his family.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further', '-1- briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 1, 2015, the state filed a criminal information charging defendant with one count of second-degree sexual assault in violation of §§ 11-37-4 and 11-37-5. In due course, a jury trial was held in Kent County Superior Court over three days from October 17 through October 19, 2016. We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony of the Complaining Witness', 'The complaining witness, Jacob,1 testified that, on February 2, 2015, he and his mother were driving home when they saw defendant, their neighbor, shoveling snow in his driveway. Jacob stated that he got out of the car to assist his neighbor in clearing the snow. Having been neighbors for a few months, Jacob and defendant knew each other. Jacob was then fifteen years old, and defendant was in his mid-seventies. It was further Jacob’s testimony that, after the two finished shoveling the snow, they both entered the shed located in defendant’s backyard so that Jacob could return the shovel which he had been using. According to Jacob, once they were both inside the shed, defendant shook Jacob’s hand and then “pulled [him] into a * * * two-handed hug * * * and kissed” his cheek. Jacob testified that defendant then asked “if he was moving too fast” and that, when Jacob said no, defendant told him that “he knew how [they] felt about each other.” Jacob further testified that he had said no when defendant asked “if he was moving too 1', 'In order to respect the privacy of the complaining witness and that of his family, we refer to the complaining witness pseudonymously as “Jacob.”', '-2- fast” because defendant had “recently” told Jacob that “his son had died and [Jacob] reminded him of his son, so [Jacob] thought he kissed [him] seeing [him] as a son figure.”', 'Jacob proceeded to testify that defendant then “cupped [Jacob’s] penis with his hand” over Jacob’s jeans for five to seven seconds. According to Jacob, as defendant was acting in that manner, defendant asked if it felt good, to which Jacob responded in the negative. After the two of them left the shed, defendant asked for Jacob’s cell phone number, which Jacob gave him. Jacob testified that he then returned home, told his parents what had happened, and they went to the police station to give a statement.', 'During his cross-examination of Jacob, defense counsel asked him: “Now, did you seek professional help for any reaction that you might have had?” The prosecutor objected, the trial justice sustained the objection, and defense counsel immediately requested a sidebar, which was granted.', 'At sidebar, the trial justice asked defense counsel: “How is that relevant to the elements?” Defense counsel responded:', '“Part of the discovery was whether he had gone for counseling and', 'I was provided the name of a counselor that he went too [sic].

That’s all. I believe they asked him and his family.” In response, the trial justice said: “That was something under the rules you', '-3- could have even compelled at deposition if you wanted to under the criminal rule. The Court will not allow that to play out in front of the jury.”2', 'B', 'The Testimony of Defendant', 'The defendant testified that, while he and Jacob were in the shed, defendant “gave him a hug” with “[j]ust [his] left arm” because elevating his right arm “hurt so much from days of shoveling that it was hard to pick it up.” He further testified that his right hand “must have totally by accident brushed against [Jacob].” Also, referring to the hug, he testified that he asked Jacob if he liked it. He testified that he did not kiss Jacob on the cheek or ask him if he was moving too fast.', 'C', 'The Testimony of Defendant’s Wife', 'In her testimony, defendant’s wife, Johanna MacNeil, indicated that, at her husband’s request, she had given him money to pay Jacob for having assisted with the snow shoveling and that she told her husband to ask Jacob for his phone number in case they might need help again. In the course of his cross-examination of Mrs. MacNeil, the prosecutor asked her if she ever tried to go to speak to Jacob or his parents after February 2, 2015. She responded that she had not 2', 'In the course of pretrial discovery, defense counsel had, on March 28, 2016, filed a motion seeking to compel the prosecution to provide the name and address of the counselor whom the prosecution previously disclosed Jacob had seen.

On April 18, 2016, the trial justice additionally granted defense counsel’s oral motion to issue a subpoena to that counselor and ordered that the counseling records be returnable on April 27, 2016 for an in camera review by the court. However, the record indicates that defense counsel did not pursue the matter further before trial, which began six months later.', '-4- done so and that the MacNeils had been “told not to have any contact” with Jacob and that she “assumed [they] were not allowed to” talk to his parents. The prosecutor then asked: “You live across from an elementary school; correct?” Mrs. MacNeil responded, “On the side.” Defense counsel then objected on relevance grounds, and the trial justice overruled the objection, noting that the fact of the proximity of the elementary school was already in evidence.3', 'D', 'The Verdict', 'On October 19, 2016, the jury returned a guilty verdict, and Mr. MacNeil filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court accords great “latitude to a trial justice’s rulings made during examination of witnesses at trial.” State v.

We will “overturn such rulings only when there has been an abuse of discretion or substantial injury to a defendant.” Id. at 1062 (internal quotation marks omitted). The scope of cross-examination is subject to the exercise of the trial justice’s sound discretion. State v. Anthony, 422 A.2d 921, 924 (R.I. 1980); see also State v.

However, “the exercise of this discretion must not unduly restrict a defendant’s right to cross- examine. It is the essence of a fair trial that reasonable latitude be given the cross-examiner.” 3', 'In the course of his testimony on the first day of the trial, Jacob indicated that there was an “[e]lementary school about a house away from him” in response to a question asking him to describe defendant’s neighborhood.', '-5- Anthony, 422 A.2d at 924.

We address each argument in turn.', 'A', 'Defense Counsel’s Cross-Examination of Jacob', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in sustaining the prosecutor’s objection to defense counsel’s question to Jacob as to whether he sought professional help after the events at issue in this case.

He argues that his attorney posed the question in order to challenge Jacob’s credibility and that the trial justice’s ruling was incorrectly based on the trial justice’s view that counsel could have obtained that information by taking a deposition of Jacob. We note initially that defendant is correct in contending that the trial justice erred in stating that defense counsel could have taken a', '-7- deposition of Jacob before trial.4', 'However, after careful review of the record, we have determined that this error was not prejudicial.', 'We have stated that “[i]nquiries that are potentially misleading or irrelevant, that offer little or no probative value, or that exceed the scope of the direct examination are objectionable, and may be restricted by the trial justice.” State v. Porter, 179 A.3d 1218, 1228-29 (R.I. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). In Porter, this Court affirmed a trial justice’s decision to limit the scope of cross-examination during a trial for second-degree murder when “defendant could not point to even a scintilla of evidence” that there was a possibility of an unknown second assailant and weapon. Porter, 179 A.3d at 1229; see State v. Alston, 47 A.3d 234, 249 (R.I. 2012) (holding that “when the state objected to defendant’s question, defendant did not make any offer of proof that the examination he intended to embark upon could lead to relevant evidence” and that, therefore, the trial justice did not commit prejudicial error in limiting defendant’s cross- examination of a witness); see also State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 474 (R.I. 1998).', 'In the instant case, defense counsel acknowledged at sidebar that he had received from the state before trial the name of one counselor from whom Jacob had sought treatment and stated that he “just wanted to make sure [he had] all the correct information * * *. [He] just wanted the name.” Defense counsel further stated that he “want[ed] to make sure there [was] no other person that he saw for counseling.

However, defendant could have sought to compel further discovery before trial regarding additional counseling Jacob may have sought if he believed that the state had withheld pertinent evidence. See Super. R. Crim. P. 16.', '-8- that Jacob withheld the names of any such counselors from the state. Allowing defense counsel to question Jacob in this manner would have constituted an inquiry that was irrelevant and offered little probative value. See Porter, 179 A.3d at 1228-29. Therefore, the trial justice’s ruling is not reversible; he did not allow further investigation to occur in the middle of a cross- examination, a decision entirely within his discretion. See State v. Lynch, 770 A.2d 840, 847 (R.I. 2001) (stating that “this Court can affirm the judgment of the Superior Court on grounds not actually relied upon by the trial court to justify its ruling”); cf. Chiaradio v. Falck, 794 A.2d 494, 497 (R.I. 2002) (holding in a civil case that “[t]he trial justice should have rebuffed the defendant’s midtrial attempt to resume discovery”). Accordingly, we perceive no reversible error in the trial justice’s evidentiary ruling regarding defense counsel’s questioning of Jacob with respect to professional counseling he may have received.', 'B', 'Mrs. MacNeil’s Testimony Regarding Not Contacting the Victim or His Parents', 'The defendant also argues on appeal that the trial justice erred in allowing the prosecutor to ask Mrs. MacNeil: “[A]fter this incident occurred * * * did you ever go down to talk to [Jacob]? * * * Did you go down to find out what had happened? * * * Did you talk to his parents?” The defendant contends that those questions were “totally irrelevant to the issue of the defendant’s guilt,” citing Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence; and he further argues that the questions “gave rise to an inference of [d]efendant’s guilt.”', 'This Court need not address either of those arguments, because defense counsel did not timely object to this line of questioning at trial. See State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 468-69 (R.I. 2013). In Pona, this Court held that “[a]ccording to our well settled raise or waive rule, if an', '-9- issue was not preserved by specific objection at trial, then it may not be considered on appeal.” Pona, 66 A.3d at 468 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'The prosecutor asked Mrs. MacNeil three questions about contacting the victim and his parents, and Mrs. MacNeil answered each one with no objection by the defense:', '“[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] * * * So after this incident', 'occurred on February 2nd * * * did you ever go down to talk to', '[Jacob]?', '“[MRS.

As noted above, at trial, the prosecutor asked Mr. MacNeil’s wife: “You live across from an elementary school; correct?” Mrs. MacNeil responded: “On the side.” Defense counsel objected: “Objection, relevance.” The trial justice overruled the objection, stating: “It’s already in evidence. The answer will stand.” At trial, defendant raised a relevance objection to the testimony, and the trial justice overruled it. He may not now raise an objection based on improper inference.', 'In addition, the testimony that defendant and his wife lived near an elementary school had already been admitted into evidence without objection before Mrs. MacNeil testified to that fact;6 therefore, the objection is unavailing.

85,Mariano Jimenez : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. On November 15, 2016, Mariano Jimenez petitioned this Court for the issuance of a writ of certiorari to review a September 19, 2016 judgment denying his application for postconviction relief in Providence County Superior Court. On December 1, 2017, this Court granted his petition for a writ of certiorari. He contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel in his 2000 criminal trial and in his 2003 direct appeal to this Court. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this case should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided at this time.

Those charges stemmed from an incident that occurred on April 9, 2000, during which applicant fatally shot Manuel Clemente “in the back of the neck as Clemente was leaving an apartment building on Dartmouth Avenue in Providence” after a confrontation between the two at a party. State v. Jimenez, 882 A.2d 549, 550 (R.I. 2005). On December 1, 2000, a jury found applicant guilty of Counts One, Two, and Three.1 The trial justice denied applicant’s motion for a new trial on December 8, 2000. He was thereafter sentenced to life imprisonment on the first-degree murder count, as well as concurrent ten-year terms of imprisonment on Counts Two and Three, suspended, with probation, to be served consecutively to the life sentence.', 'Mr. Jimenez appealed that judgment to this Court in 2003, “contending that the trial justice committed reversible error (1) in permitting him to be questioned concerning his previous experience with the pistol that fired the fatal shot and (2) in failing to instruct the jury on the 1', 'In addressing the direct appeal, this Court noted as follows:', '“Before trial, [Mr. Jimenez] had entered a plea of guilty to a charge', 'of possession of a firearm by a fugitive from justice (count 4).', 'Upon [Mr. Jimenez’s] conviction of the other charges, the trial', 'justice sentenced him to serve a term of life imprisonment on count', '1 with a concurrent ten-year term of imprisonment on count 4.

This Court rejected these contentions and affirmed the conviction in Jimenez, which sets forth a comprehensive recitation of the facts. Id. at 557.', 'In 2016, Mr. Jimenez filed the instant application for postconviction relief, alleging that he was denied effective assistance of counsel by his trial attorney in 2000 and by his appellate counsel in his direct appeal in 2003. In due course, an evidentiary hearing was held on his postconviction relief application on July 7, 2016.2 We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that hearing.', 'A', 'The Testimony at the Postconviction Relief Hearing', '1. The Testimony of Applicant', 'Mr. Jimenez testified at the evidentiary hearing that his trial counsel never offered to give him a copy of the indictment against him, police reports, or other documents about the case, saying that he “never got any paper of anything.” In addition, applicant responded in the negative when his postconviction relief attorney asked him if his trial counsel had prepared him to testify on his own behalf.3 Mr. Jimenez also testified under redirect examination that he did not know before the trial that he would be called upon to testify on his own behalf. The applicant additionally testified that he told his appellate counsel that his trial counsel had acted ineffectively, but that appellate counsel declined to comply when he asked her to “deliver” “a letter to the prosecutor” about his trial counsel’s allegedly ineffective representation. 2', 'We note that the same justice of the Superior Court presided over both the criminal trial and the hearing on the application for postconviction relief. 3', 'The applicant’s postconviction relief attorney asked: “Before you testified at the trial, did he review your testimony with you?” The applicant responded: “Before going – no.”', '-3-', '2. The Testimony of Applicant’s Trial Counsel', 'The applicant’s trial counsel also testified at the postconviction relief hearing. When asked whether he “provided Mr. Jimenez with the package that was put together by the police” in the course of their investigation of the murder of Manuel Clemente, trial counsel responded: “I don’t remember whether or not I did give it to him. I know it was my practice to make copies and especially if my people are out in the prison, I would bring them a copy * * *.” Trial counsel added that he had no independent recollection of going to the prison and giving applicant physical copies of the documents. Trial counsel further testified as follows:', '“I recall speaking to [Mr. Jimenez] about his testimony and what', 'he had to say. I don’t recall if we sat down and did a question-by-', 'question preparation, but I remember telling him what he had to', 'say. How he had to say it. How he had to maintain himself in', 'front of the jury. How to behave with the prosecution.”', 'B', 'The Hearing Justice’s Decision', 'On September 19, 2016, the hearing justice denied Mr. Jimenez’s application for postconviction relief, holding that, taking into account the criteria set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984),4 he had not met his burden of proving that either his trial counsel or his appellate attorney had failed to provide effective assistance of counsel. In a thirteen-page written decision, the hearing justice specifically determined as follows:', '“In all, Jimenez has completely failed to present any evidence', 'which overcomes his prodigious burden of demonstrating that even', 'if his attorney’s efforts were somehow substandard (and this Court', 'expressly finds that they were not), the result would have been 4', 'It was in Barboza v. State, 484 A.2d 881 (R.I. 1984), that this Court first alluded to the then-recent decision of the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); and the analytical approach set forth in Strickland has been utilized by this Court and the Superior Court in cases alleging ineffective assistance of counsel since that time. Barboza, 484 A.2d at 883.', '-4-', 'different. * * * The conviction in this case was not a result of', 'petitioner’s attorney but, rather, the weight of the credible evidence', 'against [him].” (Internal quotation marks omitted.)', 'On December 1, 2017, Mr. Jimenez filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari for review of the judgment denying his application for postconviction relief, which petition this Court subsequently granted.', 'C', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Mr. Jimenez has sought review of the decision denying his application for postconviction relief, arguing that the hearing justice erred and that his decision warrants reversal due to: (1) ineffective assistance by his trial counsel in that said attorney “never provided him with any documents” and did not prepare him to testify in his own defense; and (2) ineffective assistance of his appellate counsel for failure to argue ineffective assistance of trial counsel as part of his direct appeal.5', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When reviewing the denial of an application for postconviction relief, “this Court accords great deference to the hearing justice’s findings of fact.” Lynch v. State, 13 A.3d 603, 605 (R.I. 2011). As such, “[t]his Court will uphold the decision absent clear error or a determination that the hearing justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence.” Id.

However, in a memorandum filed subsequent to the prebriefing conference concerning this case, Mr. Jimenez “raises a claim that his appeals counsel * * * refused to obey the petitioner’s request that she present a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,” which he argues amounts to ineffective assistance by appellate counsel in the direct appeal.', '-5- involving questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact pertaining to an alleged violation of an applicant’s constitutional rights.” Bustamante v. Wall, 866 A.2d 516, 522 (R.I. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, even when the de novo standard is applied with respect to constitutional issues, “we still accord a hearing justice’s findings of historical fact, and inferences drawn from those facts, great deference in conducting our review.” Gomes v. State, 161 A.3d 511, 518 (R.I. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). An applicant for postconviction relief “bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such relief is warranted * * *.” Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 16 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'As we have often noted, it “is well settled that [we] will pattern [our] evaluations of the ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the requirements of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 * * * (1984).” Barros v. State, 180 A.3d 823, 828 (R.I. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). In applying that standard, “the benchmark issue is whether counsel’s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.” Id. at 829 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'We have further observed that “[t]he Strickland standard consists of two prongs” and that an applicant must satisfy both of those prongs. Id. Accordingly, an applicant’s “failure to satisfy one prong of the Strickland analysis obviates the need for a court to consider the remaining prong,” due to the fact that “it cannot be said that the conviction * * * resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.”', 'Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', '-6-', 'Under the Strickland mode of analysis, it is first required that an applicant “demonstrate that counsel’s performance was deficient, to the point that the errors were so serious that trial counsel did not function at the level guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.” Page v. State, 995 A.2d 934, 942 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addressing a case with respect to this first prong, there is a “strong (albeit rebuttable) presumption * * * that counsel’s performance was competent.” Id. at 943 (internal quotation marks omitted). To satisfy the second prong of Strickland, an applicant must “demonstrate that the deficient performance was so prejudicial to the defense and the errors were so serious as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). To do so, an applicant must “show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.”', 'Id. (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'A', 'The Allegation Concerning “Copies of Documents”', 'Firstly, Mr. Jimenez argues that the hearing justice erred in denying his application for postconviction relief because his 2000 trial counsel allegedly failed to provide him with documents relative to his case. It is his contention that “the fact that his counsel failed to give him any copies of documents standing alone would show counsel did not function at the level guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.”', 'The only document that Mr. Jimenez alluded to in his postconviction relief application was “applicant’s hand written and executed April 9th, 2000 confession which applicant wrote at', '-7- the Providence Police station * * *.”6 At the hearing, Mr. Jimenez testified that his trial counsel did not provide him with that purported handwritten statement. The relevant portion of the hearing transcript reads as follows:', '“[APPLICANT’S COUNSEL:] What did [trial counsel] say about', 'the handwritten statement?', '“[APPLICANT:] Oh, he asked me where is the – I think he asked', 'me where was the statement, and I told him, I mean, the police –', 'the police has [sic] the statement. That’s what I told him.', '“[APPLICANT’S COUNSEL:] And what did he say?', '“[APPLICANT:] He said he was going to try to find it.', '“[APPLICANT’S COUNSEL:] Did he ever provide it or produce', 'it for you?', '“[APPLICANT:] No. Because I remember at the trial I asked him', 'for my statement, and I don’t know who said it, but somebody said', 'that there was no statement. And I told him, Why not? I mean, I', 'just – I wrote the statement, and I signed it. So it’s supposed to be', 'somewhere.” In his decision following this hearing, the hearing justice found as follows:', '“At trial and at the [postconviction relief] hearing, Jimenez said', 'that he had also provided the police with a handwritten statement,', 'which he faults his trial attorney for not retrieving. He testified at', 'trial and at the [postconviction relief] hearing that he had never', 'read the typed statement. In denying Jimenez’[s] new trial motion,', 'this Court rejected any notion that Jimenez was ignorant of the', 'contents of that statement * * *. The Court also accepts the state’s', 'assertion that there never was any handwritten statement * * *.” 6', 'While no such handwritten statement was introduced at trial, a typed statement signed by Mr. Jimenez that was generated by the police after interviewing him was introduced. (Mr. Jimenez testified at that hearing that he never read that typed statement before signing it and that the typed statement did not accurately reflect his written statement or what he told the police. As to the typed document, he testified: “this doesn’t even start the way I tell them.”)', '-8-', 'The existence vel non of the just-referenced “handwritten statement” was a question of fact that the hearing justice ruled upon after hearing testimony from both Mr. Jimenez and his trial counsel. The hearing justice determined that that statement did not exist, and this Court perceives no clear error in his determination. See Fontaine v. State, 602 A.2d 521, 525-26 (R.I. 1992) (“Because the trial justice was presented with conflicting testimony and evidence, he was able to make sound credibility findings by assessing the facts and the totality of the circumstances before him.”); see also State v. Feng, 421 A.2d 1258, 1273 (R.I. 1980). Affording the requisite deference to the hearing justice’s findings, we perceive no basis for concluding that trial counsel’s representation of applicant was constitutionally deficient in this regard.', 'To the extent that applicant contends that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to provide applicant with other documents related to the case, we similarly defer to the hearing justice’s determinations and conclude that there was no clear error on this ground. It is fundamental that “[t]his Court will not disturb credibility determinations by a postconviction- relief hearing justice unless the [applicant] demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that the hearing justice was clearly wrong.” Rice v. State, 38 A.3d 9, 17 n.11 (R.I. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'When applicant’s postconviction relief counsel asked if his trial counsel “gave [him] a copy of the indictment against [him],” Mr. Jimenez replied: “No. I never got any paper of anything.” The applicant also testified that he never received any copies of the police reports in his case. At the postconviction relief hearing, applicant’s trial counsel testified in pertinent part as follows with respect to this issue:', '“[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] Do you recall whether or not', 'you provided Mr. Jimenez with the package that was put together', 'by the police in this case?', '-9-', '“[TRIAL COUNSEL:] I don’t remember whether or not I did give', 'it to him. I know it was my practice to make copies and especially', 'if my people are out in the prison, I would bring them a copy * * *.', 'But I don’t have an independent recollection that, you know, I', 'actually went there and gave it to him.', '“[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] And is that because it was so', 'long ago?', '“[TRIAL COUNSEL:] Yes, that’s why.”', 'We see no basis for concluding that the hearing justice erred when he determined that applicant had not met his “heavy burden” under Strickland with respect to this allegation of error. The applicant has failed to satisfy both prongs of the Strickland analysis concerning ineffective assistance of trial counsel. Mr. Jimenez’s assertion before this Court that he “has proof of the prejudice that resulted from the counsel’s error” in not providing him with documents is not even remotely sufficient to meet his burden under Strickland. Mr. Jimenez’s burden was to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the hearing justice’s determination was clearly wrong and that by allegedly failing to provide him with documents relating to the case, his trial counsel was so ineffective that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694; see Rice, 38 A.3d at 17 n.11. He has not met this burden by simply stating that his trial counsel allegedly committed this error. Therefore, this Court affirms the ruling of the hearing justice on this ground.', 'B', 'The Allegation Concerning Trial Counsel’s Failure to Prepare Applicant to Testify', 'Mr. Jimenez also contends that the hearing justice erred in denying the application for postconviction relief because his trial counsel allegedly failed to prepare applicant to testify in his own defense and that “[h]e was prejudiced by his counsel not preparing him to testify.” At', '- 10 - the postconviction relief hearing, Mr. Jimenez testified repeatedly that his trial counsel did not prepare him to testify and that he had not known before trial that he would be expected to testify on his own behalf:', '“[APPLICANT’S COUNSEL:] Did he prepare you to testify on', 'your own behalf?', '“[APPLICANT:] No.” Shortly thereafter, Mr. Jimenez further testified:', '“[APPLICANT’S COUNSEL:] Before you testified at the trial,', 'did he review your testimony with you?', '“[APPLICANT:] Before going – no.', '“[APPLICANT’S COUNSEL:] When did you first learn that you', 'were going to testify on your own behalf?', '“[APPLICANT:] At the hearing.', '“[APPLICANT’S COUNSEL:] At which hearing?', '“[APPLICANT:] In the courtroom. He told me that I was going to', 'take the stand.', '“[APPLICANT’S COUNSEL:] At the trial?', '“[APPLICANT:] Yes.” Trial counsel testified at the hearing as follows (in pertinent part) regarding applicant’s trial testimony and the pre-trial preparation for same:', '“[COUNSEL FOR THE STATE:] Prior to the trial beginning, did', 'you have a conversation with [Mr. Jimenez] about whether or not', 'he might have to testify? Do you recall that at all?', '“[TRIAL COUNSEL:] Yes.

It was well before the', 'trial.”', 'In his written decision, the hearing justice stated: “The Court fully credits [trial counsel’s] testimony that long before the commencement of trial, and on more than one occasion, he discussed the merits of the case with Jimenez and that he had also advised him several times that he would probably have to testify * * *.”', 'This Court affords great deference to such a determination concerning credibility, and we conclude that there was no clear error on this ground. See III.A, supra. The hearing justice made an express credibility determination after Mr. Jimenez and trial counsel both testified on this question of fact, and we see absolutely no basis for reversal with respect to this issue. See generally State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 872 (R.I. 2010) (“This Court affords a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama', '- 12 - that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'C', 'The Alleged Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel', 'Mr. Jimenez argues that the hearing justice additionally erred when he found that counsel in Mr. Jimenez’s direct appeal had not rendered ineffective assistance.

See Gomes v. State, 161 A.3d 511, 518 (R.I. 2017).

State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 (R.I. 2011)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, Atryzek first argued that G.L. 1956 § 11-37-16, the 1992 sex offender registration statute that was in place at the time of his underlying conviction, was silent as to the duration of his registration requirement and therefore was ambiguous. As a result, he argued, the rule of lenity required that the registration period be no longer than that provided for in the 1992 statute’s immediate successor statute, § 11-37.1-4, enacted in 1996, which required sex offenders to register “for a period of ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction[.]” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1. Of significance is the fact that we considered and disposed of this very issue in Gibson, discussed below—a case that was decided during the pendency of our review in this case. See Gibson, 182 A.3d at 548-49.', 'In light of our decision in Gibson, Atryzek submitted a supplemental memorandum, which recognized that the duration of his registration requirement is governed by the current incarnation of § 11-37.1-4, which was enacted in 2003. He now argues that, therefore, his duty to register expired ten years after his supervised probation ended in 2000, requiring, at least, the', '-3- vacation of his 2012 and 2013 convictions for failure to register. Atryzek also argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when he pled nolo contendere to his four convictions for failure to register as a sex offender, because his attorneys did not advise him that he was not burdened with a lifetime duty to register.', 'For its part, the state, in its initial three page Rule 12A prebriefing statement, asserted that, given the similarities between the issues in Atryzek’s case and those raised in Gibson, this Court’s decision in Gibson would control the outcome of this appeal. However, in response to Atryzek’s supplemental memorandum, the state changed course, arguing that Gibson is not controlling in this case because the underlying offense here satisfied the requirements of an “aggravated offense” under § 11-37.1-2(a) and thus results in a lifetime registration requirement. There can be no doubt that this is a completely new argument that was not raised by the state at any point before this Court or before the hearing justice.', 'A', 'Lifetime Registration', 'We discuss first the state’s argument, raised a mere seven days before this Court heard argument in this case, that Atryzek has a lifetime duty to register as a sex offender because his underlying offense fits the definition of an “aggravated offense.” For the purposes of the sex- offender registration statute, “‘[a]ggravated offense’ means, and includes, offenses involving sexual penetration of victims of any age through the use of force, or the threat of use of force, or offenses involving sexual penetration of victims who are fourteen (14) years of age or under.” Section 11-37.1-2(a) (emphasis added).', 'Those who have been convicted of an aggravated offense have a lifetime duty to register as a sex offender. See § 11-37.1-4(c).', '-4-', 'In its supplemental memorandum to this Court, the state avers that Atryzek is obligated to register for life because the underlying offense for which he was convicted involved sexual penetration of a minor under fourteen years of age. This argument, raised as it was at this late stage in the proceedings, comes too late. At every point in the prior proceedings, from Atryzek’s two applications for postconviction relief in 2015, to the hearing justice’s decision in 2016 and the prebriefing stage before this Court, it has been the state’s consistent contention that Atryzek had a lifetime duty to register under § 11-37-16, the registration statute in place at the time of his underlying conviction. Indeed, when the state submitted its initial prebriefing statement to this Court, it acknowledged that our decision in Gibson, which was then pending, “present[s] legal issues identical to those presented in the instant case, and which will in all likelihood resolve the instant controversy one way or the other.”', 'Over the course of decades, we have made it abundantly clear that “a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.” State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 829 (R.I. 2008); see State v. Donato, 592 A.2d 140, 141 (R.I. 1991); State v. Byrnes, 433 A.2d 658, 670-71 (R.I. 1981). This rule “promotes fairer and more efficient trial proceedings by providing opposing counsel with an opportunity to respond appropriately to claims raised.” 1 State v. Burke, 522 A.2d 725, 731 (R.I. 1987). Allowing the state to argue an entirely new theory, presented to this Court at the eleventh hour in a supplemental memorandum, would do violence to our longstanding and uniform jurisprudence and would be fundamentally unfair to the petitioner. We conclude, therefore, that the state has waived any argument that Atryzek has a lifetime duty to register on the theory that his underlying conviction amounted to an “aggravated offense.” 1', 'Significantly, offered as late as it was, the state’s new argument deprived the petitioner of a meaningful opportunity to respond.', '-5-', 'B', 'Gibson', 'In our opinion, this case fits squarely within the ambit of our holding in Gibson. In that case, the defendant was convicted in 1994 of second degree child molestation sexual assault. Gibson, 182 A.3d at 544. Consequently, he was required to register as a sex offender, and, when he did not do so, he was convicted on multiple occasions of failure to register. Id. at 544-45. We were tasked, as we are now, with determining the duration of that registration requirement. Id. at 546. In Gibson, as here, the tortuous history of this state’s sex offender registration statutes complicated the issue.', 'In 1992, the General Assembly enacted § 11-37-16, imposing a duty to register as a sex offender for those convicted of certain enumerated sexual offenses. That statute was silent, however, as to the duration of the duty. In 1996, the General Assembly repealed § 11-37-16 and replaced it with chapter 37.1 of title 11, the Sexual Offender Registration and Community Notification Act. See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, §§ 1, 3. That act preserved the duty to register of those, like Gibson and Atryzek, whose duty originated under the former § 11-37-16, but limited the duration of that duty to “a period of ten (10) years subsequent to the date of conviction[.]” See P.L. 1996, ch. 104, § 1. The durational period, codified currently at § 11-37.1-4(a), was amended twice more—in 1997 to “ten (10) years subsequent to the date of release from confinement or placement on parole, supervised release or probation[,]” and in 2003 to “ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense[.]” See P.L. 1997, ch. 156, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 162, § 1; P.L. 2003, ch. 170, § 1.', 'We held in Gibson that, “when it repealed and replaced § 11-37-16, the General Assembly not only preserved the duty to register from that statute, but it also imposed the', '-6- provisions of the new enactment, including the duration of registration.” Gibson, 182 A.3d at 548. Each subsequent revision to § 11-37.1-4 extended that duration. Id. at 549. Therefore, while Gibson’s duty to register was governed by the provisions of § 11-37-16, the duration of his duty was governed by the current iteration of § 11-37.1-4 and therefore continued until “ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense” giving rise to his duty to register. Id. at 548, 549.', 'Our holding in Gibson is controlling on the strikingly similar facts before us now. Atryzek was convicted of a sexual offense in 1993, and, like Gibson, his duty to register is governed by § 11-37-16, the registration statute that was in place at the time of that conviction. Pursuant to our holding in Gibson, however, the duration of that duty is controlled by the present version of § 11-37.1-4(a), and therefore runs “for a period of ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence for the offense” which gave rise to Atryzek’s duty to register.', 'Even though Gibson may control the legal issue in this case, we are unable to determine just when the “expiration of sentence for the offense” occurred. The record indicates that Atryzek was sentenced in 1993 to fifteen years’ suspended imprisonment, with a term of supervised probation that terminated on June 19, 2000. It would be reasonable to conclude that the expiration of his sentence occurred in 2008, at the end of his suspended fifteen-year sentence. Atryzek submits, however, that his sentence expired when his period of supervised probation was terminated in 2000. Further, the state points out that failing to register as a sex offender in violation of § 11-37.1-10 is itself a registerable offense, which may have further extended Atryzek’s duty to register. See § 11-37.1-2(e)(8).', 'It is our opinion that the record on review is inadequate to enable us to define the correct contours of the duration of Atryzek’s duty to register. We therefore quash the judgment of the', '-7- Superior Court and remand for further factfinding and proceedings in light of our decision in Gibson.', 'C', 'Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', 'Atryzek also argues that his various counsel were constitutionally deficient in their representation of him in the various Superior Court proceedings because they never advised him that he had a potentially viable challenge to his duty to register as a sex offender. It is our considered opinion, however, that prior to our decision in Gibson, there was a reasonable argument to be made that § 11-37-16 did indeed impose a lifetime duty to register on those sex offenders who incurred a duty to register prior to the enactment of the successor statute in 1996. It is true that, as we hold here in accordance with our decision in Gibson, the period of Atryzek’s duty to register is not for his lifetime, but for “ten (10) years from the expiration of sentence” for the underlying offense. Nevertheless, we cannot fault petitioner’s counsel for failing to foresee our decision in Gibson, and it is clear to us that petitioner’s various counsel faced the arduous task of finding a clear path through this murky area of the law. We therefore conclude that the representation by Atryzek’s attorneys was not constitutionally deficient.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we quash the judgment of the Superior Court and remand the record to that court for further factfinding and proceedings in light of our decision in this case and our holding in State v.

Duffy, appeals from a final judgment of the Superior Court granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 41(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. This matter came before this Court on November 8, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The pertinent facts of this case are as follows. Sometime between December 2007 and June 2008,1 plaintiff was arrested, and allegedly assaulted, by uniformed officers of the West 1', 'At the hearing on defendants’ motion to dismiss, defendants indicated that the incident occurred on May 28, 2008, while plaintiff’s counsel stated that “it happened in around [sic] 2007, December, 2008.” We note that the complaint alleges that the incident occurred on May 18, 2008.', '-1- Warwick Police Department. Subsequently, on January 8, 2010, plaintiff, through his then- attorney, filed the instant action in Kent County Superior Court against Michael J. Nye and Stephen J. Blais—two officers of the West Warwick Police Department—and the Town of West Warwick. Service, however, was not completed at that time. More than five years elapsed before plaintiff retained a new attorney in January 2015; and, on February 24, 2015, plaintiff had copies of the complaint and summonses served upon defendants.', 'In response, on March 5, 2015, defendants, in lieu of filing an answer, and in accordance with Rule 41(b), filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of prosecution and failure to serve process upon defendants within the time required in Rule 4(l) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. In their memorandum in support of that motion, defendants argued that:', '“Plaintiff effectuated personal service of the [d]efendants more', 'than five (5) years after the complaint was filed in the Superior', 'Court and close to seven (7) years after the alleged incident. As', 'such, pursuant to Rule 4([l]), this matter should be dismissed for', 'failure to obtain service.” The defendants went on to state: “In addition, under Rule 4l(b)(l), the [p]laintiff has failed to prosecute this action for over five (5) years.”', 'A hearing on the motion was held on April 27, 2015, at which defendants reiterated the arguments that they had advanced in their memorandum. In response, plaintiff highlighted his previous attorney’s failure to serve process within the preceding five years. He further noted that the complaint had been served immediately after plaintiff retained new counsel. The plaintiff admitted, however, that both the hiring of new counsel and service of the complaint were accomplished after the five-year period set forth in Rule 41(b)(1) had elapsed.2 Despite the lapse 2', '“The court may, in its discretion, dismiss any action for lack of prosecution where the action has been pending for more than five (5) years, or, at any time, for failure of the plaintiff to', '-2- of time, plaintiff argued that the “savings section in the statute” allowed the motion justice to reinstate the case, “upon a showing of preventing injustice.”3 Finally, plaintiff averred that this case fit the factual scenario required for the action to proceed, because he had served process and was ready to engage in discovery. The motion justice inquired into the reason for the delay in service, to which plaintiff’s new attorney replied: “[I]t’s through no fault of Mr. Duffy himself, but his previous counsel who—.” The motion justice cut short this argument, stating: “Mr. Duffy acts through his attorney. If Mr. Duffy has a problem, he gets into a problem because of the neglect of his attorney * * *.”', 'In the end, the motion justice dismissed the action, with prejudice, under Rule 41(b). He based his ruling on the length of time that the case had lain dormant, noting that “both parties at some point in time after an incident occurred and after suit is filed have a right to think that, you know, things should have been settled.” The court cited to our opinion in the case of Norcliffe v. Resnick, 694 A.2d 1210 (R.I. 1997), holding that prejudice to the defendant was not a necessary consideration in this case. On May 4, 2015, an order entered granting defendants’ motion to dismiss with prejudice; and, on May 12, 2015, plaintiff timely appealed to this Court. However, we remanded the case for entry of final judgment; and, on September 8, 2016, final judgment entered.4 Plaintiff then submitted an amended notice of appeal on March 9, 2017. comply with these rules or to proceed when the action is reached for trial.” Super.R.Civ.P. 41(b)(1). 3', 'The statute that plaintiff likely referred to is G.L. 1956 § 9-8-6, which provides: “Any case dismissed under §§ 9-8-3—9-8-5, may be reinstated by the court with or without terms upon motion within one year from dismissal, if the court deems it proper to prevent injustice.” (Emphasis added.) Section 9-8-3 is the statutory authority for Rule 41(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Compare § 9-8-3 with Super.R.Civ.P. 41(b). Thus, § 9-8-6 would provide authority for a motion justice to reinstate a case that is involuntarily dismissed under Rule 41(b). 4', 'It appears that the delay in the appellate process was due in part to that remand.', '-3-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well settled that abuse of discretion is ‘the applicable standard to be used by [this Court] when reviewing a [motion] justice’s dismissal of a civil action for lack of prosecution,’ pursuant to Rule 41(b).” Cotter v.

Ocean State Jobbers, Inc., 18 A.3d 554, 558 (R.I. 2011)). “Thus, ‘this Court must determine whether [the motion justice’s] findings are supported by the evidence or whether in making such findings [he or she] misconceived or overlooked any material evidence.’” Id. (quoting Coates, 18 A.3d at 558).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'In this appeal, plaintiff argues that the motion justice abused his discretion in granting defendants’ motion to dismiss under Rule 41(b)(2) because the court failed to consider whether the defendants had suffered any prejudice from plaintiff’s five-year delay in serving the complaint. We disagree.', 'Rule 41(b)(2) states: “On motion of the defendant the court may, in its discretion, dismiss any action for failure of the plaintiff to comply with these rules or any order of court, or for lack of prosecution as provided in paragraph (1) of [Rule 41(b)].” (Emphasis added.) Involuntary dismissal for any reason under Rule 41(b), “other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or for improper venue or for lack of an indispensable party, operates as an adjudication upon the merits[,]” and, thus, is a dismissal with prejudice. Super.R.Civ.P. 41(b)(3). Accordingly, Rule 41(b)(2) clearly grants discretion to a motion justice to dismiss a case with prejudice in one of two manners, which have differing requirements under our caselaw.', '-4-', 'First, “[i]n considering a dismissal motion [under Rule 41(b)(2) for lack of prosecution], a trial justice must weigh the equities between the parties.” Cotter, 130 A.3d at 168 (quoting Coates, 18 A.3d at 560). “On the one hand is the court’s need to manage its docket, the public interest in the expeditious resolution of litigation, and the risk of prejudice to the defendants from delay, and [o]n the other hand, there is the desire to dispose of cases on their merits.” Id. (quoting Coates, 18 A.3d at 560). “When weighing the equities, the court ‘need not view the evidence in a light most favorable to the plaintiffs.’” Id. (quoting Bergeron v. Roszkowski, 866 A.2d 1230, 1237 (R.I. 2005)). “Also, it is well settled in our jurisprudence that ‘[m]ere delay is not enough to warrant dismissal for lack of prosecution.’” Id. (quoting Harvey v. Town of Tiverton, 764 A.2d 141, 143 (R.I. 2001)).', 'Second, we have held that “[p]ursuant to Rule 41(b)(2) * * * a trial justice may grant a defendant’s motion to dismiss for a plaintiff’s failure to comply with the rules of civil procedure.” Norcliffe, 694 A.2d at 1212.', 'More specifically, “[a]n unreasonable delay in procuring service of process constitutes noncompliance with Rule 4 * * * for which dismissal may be granted pursuant to Rule 41(b)(2).”5 Id.

Norcliffe, 694 A.2d at 1211. Without determining that the defendant had been prejudiced by the delay, the trial justice in that case held that the delay in service was unreasonable and dismissed the complaint under Rule 41(b)(2). See id. at 1211-12. On appeal, in response to the plaintiff’s request that we “require a showing of prejudice to the defendant as a precondition to dismissal under Rule 41(b)(2)[,]” we held that “[a] showing of prejudice * * * is not required to sustain a trial justice’s dismissal of the complaint for a plaintiff’s failure to comply with the requirements of Rule 4.” Id. at 1212 (emphasis added). We also noted that the “plaintiffs’ fourteen-month delay in effectuating service on defendant [was] presumptively unreasonable.” Id. This Court then went on to hold: “Having found that the fourteen-month delay in effecting service of process was unreasonable and inexcusable, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in dismissing the complaint.” Id.', 'Here, plaintiff posits that the motion justice abused his discretion because the court did not consider the possible prejudice to defendants from the delay in service. The plaintiff offers no explanation for the delay, but instead proffers that he should not suffer for his previous attorney’s lack of diligence. In ruling on defendants’ motion to dismiss, the motion justice held:', '“And I think the point that has to be made here is that where', 'there’s a delay of this magnitude, seven years from the time of the', 'incident, five years from the time of the filing of the complaint and', 'absolutely nothing has happened, that a message has got to be sent', 'that the rules—we might as well just throw the rules away if we', 'allow this lawsuit to be re-filed.

See Norcliffe, 694 A.2d at 1212.', 'Given the five-year delay in serving the complaint, which is significantly longer than the fourteen-month delay that we held was “presumptively unreasonable” in Norcliffe, and the lack of any explanation for such delay, we cannot say that the motion justice abused his discretion in dismissing the plaintiff’s complaint under Rule 41(b)(2). Norcliffe, 694 A.2d at 1212; see Ricci v. Ricci, 689 A.2d 1051, 1053 (R.I. 1997) (holding that a seven-and-one-half-month delay in service was sufficient for the trial justice to dismiss a complaint under Rule 41(b)(2), where plaintiff failed to proffer a good cause for the delay). We note that “‘[t]he widest discretion must be given to calendar justices and trial justices’ in managing a trial calendar, a task that is ‘among the most difficult of all judicial assignments.’” Coates, 18 A.3d at 558 (quoting Bergeron, 866 A.2d at 1235). Moreover, one of the main purposes of Rule 41(b) is to ensure the efficient and expeditious resolution of controversies; this purpose would be undermined were we to allow plaintiff to proceed with his complaint, even if his previous attorney was responsible for the delay.', 'See Harvey, 764 A.2d at 143.', 'Therefore, we affirm the final judgment granting defendants’ motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 41(b)(2).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant, Patrick Cahill, was found guilty of second-degree child abuse, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-9-5.3(b)(2), by a Superior Court trial justice sitting without a jury in Providence County. The trial justice sentenced him to ten years’ imprisonment, with six months to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation. The defendant now appeals from the judgment of conviction, arguing that the trial justice erred by (1) allowing opinion testimony by a witness not tendered as an expert; (2) failing to consider simple assault as a lesser-included offense to second-degree child abuse; and (3) denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The defendant was charged with one count of second-degree child abuse stemming from an incident with his half-sister. He waived his right to a jury trial, and a trial commenced before a justice of the Superior Court on September 22, 2014.', 'The state called four witnesses:', '-1- complaining witness Abigail; her sister, Beth; her mother, Danielle;1 and Dana Kaplan, M.D. The defendant presented two witnesses: himself and his girlfriend, Amanda Paquette (Paquette). Their testimony is summarized below.', 'A', 'Testimony', '1', 'Abigail and Beth', 'Abigail testified that, on August 20, 2012, her mother, Danielle, dropped her and her sister Beth at their father’s house in Woonsocket on Danielle’s way to work.2 The defendant is half-brother to Abigail and Beth; the three share the same biological father. Abigail and Beth lived with their mother and grandmother in Burrillville after their mother and father separated. Both Abigail and Beth testified that they had a normal sibling relationship with defendant and, for the most part, got along well with defendant.', 'A short time after arriving at the house, the girls discovered that defendant was at home, and they went downstairs to defendant’s room. Beth testified that she stayed in defendant’s room for only a short time before returning upstairs to finish watching a television show, but that Abigail remained with defendant to watch television and watch defendant exercise. At some point, Beth testified, Abigail returned upstairs to ask Beth if she could go outside and play with the girl next door. Beth told Abigail that it was “up to [defendant.]” Abigail testified that she then returned to defendant’s room to ask him if she could go outside, but that defendant said no. 1', 'We will use pseudonyms when referring to the complaining witness and her sister to protect their privacy. For similar reasons, we refer to their mother by her first name; no disrespect is intended. 2', 'Abigail was nine years old on the day of the incident and eleven years old at the time of trial. Beth was fourteen years old on the day of the incident and sixteen years old on the date of her trial testimony.', '-2- Abigail, unhappy with defendant’s answer, ran up the stairs and out of the house. Abigail recalled seeing defendant’s girlfriend, Paquette, when she ran outside. Abigail testified that she ran around and attempted to get in Paquette’s locked car; she was “scared” because defendant was chasing her. Beth testified that she saw Abigail running up the stairs, with defendant following behind her. She also heard both Abigail and defendant yelling as they ran outside. Beth further testified that she heard defendant tell Abigail to “get back over here” and that he “is the boss.”', 'The defendant eventually caught up with Abigail at Paquette’s car, according to Beth. Abigail testified that defendant then grabbed her hair, which was in a high ponytail, and pulled it straight up. Abigail testified that it hurt when defendant grabbed her ponytail and that defendant did not let go of her hair as he “pulled [her] into the house.” Beth testified that she stood on the steps of the house, about twenty-eight to thirty feet away from Abigail, and watched defendant grab and pull Abigail into the house by her ponytail. Beth recalled that Abigail was crying while defendant held on to her ponytail.', 'According to Abigail, once inside the house, defendant “threw [her] on the couch” in the living room and let go of her ponytail. Next, defendant placed his knee on her chest and stomach area, which Abigail testified gave her a “sharp pain[.]” According to Abigail, defendant then grabbed and squeezed her cheeks with one hand and placed his other hand on her throat as she continued to cry. Although Abigail could not recall how hard defendant squeezed her cheeks, she said that it hurt “[a] little bit.” As for the hand on her throat, Abigail testified that defendant “pushed down a little bit[,]” and that his hand was “a little tight” on her neck. Abigail testified that at this time she was still crying and had “[a] little bit” of trouble breathing. Abigail', '-3- remembered defendant telling her that she needed to listen to him, but testified that her attempted response “wasn’t clear because he was squeezing [her] cheeks.”', 'Beth gave a similar account of the events on the couch. She testified that she and Paquette had followed defendant and Abigail into the living room of the house, and that she heard defendant repeatedly tell Abigail that he was “the boss,” that he “runs the show here[,]” and that the girls needed to listen to him.', 'Beth testified that she watched Abigail try unsuccessfully to get up off the couch at first, and that she did not see Abigail kick or spit at defendant at any time. Beth saw defendant put his knee on Abigail’s stomach and push, as well as squeeze her cheeks and place his hand on her throat. Beth stood a “cushion” distance away from defendant at the couch and yelled at him to get off Abigail when she saw Abigail “change color in her face[.]” Beth recalled that defendant had his hand on Abigail’s throat for a minute but squeezed for only about five seconds, and that, during that time, Abigail’s face turned from pink to “a deeper red.” Beth continued to yell at defendant to stop, and tried to take defendant’s hand off Abigail’s neck. The defendant eventually let go of Abigail’s cheeks and neck, stood up, and left the room.', 'Beth testified that, immediately after defendant let go, Abigail coughed and tried to catch her breath. Beth took Abigail upstairs into the bedroom they shared at their father’s house and called their mother. Beth proceeded to take pictures of Abigail on her cell phone, following her mother’s instructions. Those pictures were introduced into evidence at trial. Beth then brought Abigail outside to wait for their mother to pick them up from the house. Both Abigail and Beth recalled being taken to their “Aunt Sara’s” house immediately after the incident, and then to the police station later that day. Abigail testified that her mother brought her to the hospital the following day to be examined, and that she returned home later that day.', '-4-', '2', 'Danielle', 'Danielle testified that she dropped her daughters off at their father’s house on the morning of August 20, 2012, intending to pick them up after she got out of work at noon. At 11:50 a.m., Danielle received a phone call from Beth, who told her about the incident with defendant. Danielle raced to pick the girls up from the house; she saw them sitting outside when she arrived, about fifteen minutes after Beth’s phone call. She then drove the girls to her friend’s house, about a minute away from defendant’s house. Once at her friend’s house, Danielle noticed a moon-shaped mark on the right side of Abigail’s cheek. She called the girls’ and defendant’s father to discuss how to deal with the incident; however, the two were not in agreement as to how to proceed. After a couple hours at her friend’s house, Danielle took the girls to the Woonsocket police station, where Abigail, Beth, and Danielle were interviewed and gave statements. Later that night, after some thought, Danielle decided to file a complaint against defendant. The following day, Danielle took Abigail to Hasbro Children’s Hospital after she complained of cheek pain. Danielle testified that Abigail was examined and that they stayed at Hasbro for a couple hours before Abigail was discharged.', 'Danielle recalled that after returning from the hospital, police officers arrived at her friend’s house to take photographs of Abigail. Those photographs were also introduced into evidence at trial.', '3', 'Dana Kaplan, M.D.', 'The state called Dr. Dana Kaplan, a child-abuse pediatrics fellow at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, to interpret the medical records admitted by stipulation as a full exhibit at trial. Doctor Kaplan testified that she was a licensed physician in Rhode Island and New York, and that,', '-5- through that work, she reviewed medical documentation and reports on a daily basis. She confirmed during her testimony that she was not Abigail’s treating physician, but that she had reviewed Abigail’s medical records at the state’s request. Doctor Kaplan testified that the medical records indicated that Abigail’s “chief complaint was an attempted strangulation.”', 'When the prosecutor asked about strangulation, Dr. Kaplan explained: “[S]trangulation is part of an umbrella term asphyxia, lack of oxygen. You can provide lack of oxygen through strangulation and through suffocation. Strangulation is when you apply external forces to the neck to close down the vein and artery.” She expounded that strangulation by force would result in the impairment of a bodily function—namely, “[d]elivery of oxygen to the brain.” Doctor Kaplan was also shown the photographs of Abigail that Beth had taken on her phone following the incident, and she testified that those photographs were consistent with Abigail’s medical records. Lastly, Dr. Kaplan testified that she did not find it uncommon that Abigail would be discharged from the hospital after a couple hours or that no further tests would be performed.', '4', 'Patrick Cahill', 'The defendant in his testimony described a different version of the events of August 20, 2012. At the time of the incident, defendant was twenty-three years old and working as a Woonsocket police officer. He testified that, on that day, he went upstairs to greet Abigail and Beth when he heard movement in the house. The defendant confirmed that, at some point after he had gone back downstairs to his bedroom, Abigail and Beth came down to watch television and watch him exercise. After a few minutes in his room, defendant recalled that Abigail began “tearing [his] things up” by throwing his clothes on the floor and dumping out his jar of loose coins. The defendant testified that both Abigail and Beth also knocked down travel souvenirs', '-6- that he kept on the top of his bureau. The defendant then told the girls that they “had to go upstairs * * * if they [were] going to tear everything apart * * *.” The defendant testified that he grabbed Abigail by the arm and walked her upstairs; Beth also walked upstairs. He recalled that Abigail said to him, “[Y]ou can’t touch me” as he walked her up the stairs. Abigail returned downstairs within a minute and repeated this behavior two more times, and defendant brought her upstairs each time. On one of the two trips back upstairs, defendant testified, Abigail “dropped dead weight” as he moved toward her, so he picked her up with one hand behind her back and one behind her legs to carry her upstairs.', 'After the third time he brought Abigail upstairs, defendant testified Abigail and Beth yelled down to him to come up the stairs; defendant began up the stairs, at which point he saw a substance, either salad dressing or mustard, placed “on the stairs so that [he] would slip.” The defendant again told both girls to “stop, knock it off, stop, go outside, play, go sit down, watch TV, [and] quit tearing up the house.” The defendant returned to his bedroom, and, a couple of minutes later, Abigail returned to defendant’s room and told him that she was going to the “Dollar Store,” which was about a quarter of a mile from defendant’s house. The defendant told Abigail that he would not take her to the store, and he followed Abigail when she ran up the stairs and out of the house. The defendant testified that, when he observed Abigail ask Paquette to take her to the store, he told Paquette that he would not take the girls because “they were not listening.”', 'The defendant testified that, after the exchange between defendant and Paquette, Abigail walked out into the middle of the street. When defendant told her to get on the sidewalk, Abigail taunted him with a “hip shake,” telling him, “I don’t have to listen to you.” The defendant recalled that Abigail was “playing this game to try to get away from [him]” and that his concern', '-7- was to get her out of the street. When defendant caught up to Abigail, he grabbed her by “something”—he was not sure what he grabbed—before Abigail dropped to the ground, dead weight, as she had in the basement. The defendant said that he “scoop[ed] [Abigail] up,” with his hands underneath her arms, waist, and chest, to get her out of the street. Once defendant walked Abigail to the sidewalk, she put her feet underneath her, and he took her by the arm to walk her into the house.', 'The defendant recalled that Abigail began “headbutting” him in the chest and kicking backwards as he walked her from the sidewalk into the house. The defendant testified that he placed his hand on the back of Abigail’s neck to prevent her from continuing to “headbutt” him. Throughout his testimony, defendant emphasized that he was not mad or upset, but that he was annoyed and aggravated at Abigail’s behavior.', 'The defendant testified that, once inside the house, he brought Abigail to the couch, and when he sat her down, she immediately stood up and took a step toward the entrance of the house.', 'The defendant then grabbed Abigail by the shoulder and upper arms to sit her down again, and she began to spit at him and kick him. The defendant testified that he covered Abigail’s mouth with his hand and placed his knee on her thigh to prevent her from spitting and kicking. The defendant further testified that his other hand was on the side of the couch, supporting his weight, and was not on Abigail’s throat at any time. When he was satisfied that she was going to stay, defendant let go of Abigail. According to defendant, the entire encounter on the couch lasted only about fifteen seconds. The defendant never saw Abigail have trouble breathing, instead commenting that “[s]he was talking and yelling the whole time.” He also testified that Abigail was hyperventilating because she had been crying.', '-8-', '5', 'Amanda Paquette', 'During her testimony, Amanda Paquette recalled having a conversation with Abigail outside on the sidewalk about going to the “Dollar Store.” Paquette testified that defendant told her from the stairs of the house that they are not going to the store, and that she then watched Abigail and defendant run around her car before defendant walked Abigail into the house by the arm. Paquette had herself walked into the kitchen of the house, and she observed as defendant led Abigail into the living room. Paquette testified that Abigail was screaming, kicking, and spitting, but that she did not have any concern about defendant’s interaction with Abigail because he “seemed completely in control of himself.” Paquette could see defendant “put” Abigail on the couch, but could not see if defendant placed his hands on Abigail’s face or throat. Similar to defendant’s testimony, Paquette stated that the incident on the couch lasted about ten to fifteen seconds.', 'B', 'Trial Justice’s Decision', 'On October 9, 2014, the trial justice issued a bench decision. He found Abigail and Beth to be “surprisingly mature and articulate” given “their age and education[.]” Moreover, the trial justice found that there was “no attempt on their part to cover or embellish any fact or circumstance they testified to[,]” and that “[t]hey exhibited no signs of being coached, coerced or rehearsed to testify as they did.” The trial justice found Beth’s testimony to be “particularly powerful,” and that it had “a ring of truthfulness to it.” He further found the testimony by Danielle and Dr. Kaplan to be credible. The trial justice also found Dr. Kaplan’s testimony to be “particularly relevant to the physical injury requirement of the offense charged.” On the other', '-9- hand, the trial justice found that the version of events described by defendant and Paquette was “neat, somewhat contrived and carefully scripted.”', 'The trial justice concluded that “any physical injury that falls below the definition of serious bodily injury and is not an injury resulting from non[-]excessive or appropriate corporal punishment may be found to be a physical injury as contemplated by the language related to second degree child abuse” in violation of § 11-9-5.3(b)(2).3 He found that defendant had “voluntarily asserted himself as an authority figure over [Abigail] and was acting in loco parentis during the events involving him and [Abigail] on the morning in question.” Further, the trial justice found that the physical injury element had been met, and that the injury was not the result of non-excessive corporal punishment. Ultimately, the trial justice found that the evidence at trial established, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was guilty of second-degree child abuse, in violation of § 11-9-5.3(b)(2). 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-9-5.3 reads, in relevant part:', '“(b) Whenever a person having care of a child, as defined by § 40-', '11-2(2), whether assumed voluntarily or because of a legal', 'obligation, including any instance where a child has been placed', 'by his or her parents, caretaker, or licensed governmental child', 'placement agency for care or treatment, knowingly or', 'intentionally:', '“(1) Inflicts upon a child serious bodily injury, shall be', 'guilty of first degree child abuse.', '“(2) Inflicts upon a child any other physical injury, shall be', 'guilty of second degree child abuse.', '“* * *', '“(d) For the purpose of this section, ‘other physical injury’ is', 'defined as any injury, other than a serious bodily injury, which', 'arises other than from the imposition of nonexcessive corporal', 'punishment.', '“(e) * * * Any person who is convicted of second degree child', 'abuse shall be imprisoned for not more than ten (10) years, nor less', 'than five (5) years and fined not more than five thousand dollars', '($5,000).”', '- 10 -', 'C', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'On October 17, 2014, defendant filed a motion for a new trial, asking the trial justice to vacate the judgment of conviction. The defendant argued that the trial justice had overlooked and misconceived relevant material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong in his consideration of the facts of the case, given the evidence presented. He asserted that: (1) the trial justice impermissibly allowed the testimony of Dr. Kaplan; (2) the trial justice overlooked the inconsistencies in the testimony by Abigail and Beth; (3) the physical manifestations of the events did not rise to the level of “physical injury”; and (4) the trial justice misconceived material evidence in finding that defendant’s actions constituted excessive corporal punishment. At the commencement of the hearing on the motion, the trial justice noted that the motion would be treated as a motion to vacate the judgment of conviction, pursuant to State v. Dunn, 726 A.2d 1142 (R.I. 1999), and Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. At the end of the hearing, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion. The defendant later was sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment, with six months to serve and the remaining suspended, with probation. The judgment of conviction was entered on April 20, 2016; defendant timely appealed.4', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The defendant raises three issues for our consideration. First, he argues that the trial justice erred in admitting the testimony of Dr. Kaplan; according to defendant, the doctor 4', 'The defendant filed a premature notice of appeal on December 19, 2014, and that appeal was docketed as No. 2015-86-C.A. The case was remanded to the Superior Court for entry of judgment on defendant’s request. Following entry of judgment, in an abundance of caution, defendant filed a second notice of appeal on May 9, 2016, and that appeal was docketed as No. 2016-138-C.A. These appeals have been consolidated.', '- 11 - provided opinion testimony without having been called as an expert witness and her testimony was cumulative and impermissibly bolstered the medical records in evidence. Next, defendant contends that the trial justice erroneously failed to consider simple assault as a lesser-included offense of second-degree child abuse. Last, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial.', 'A', 'Admissibility of Dr. Kaplan’s Testimony', 'The defendant first argues that the trial justice erred by allowing Dr. Kaplan to provide expert opinion testimony when she was not tendered as an expert witness. He asserts that Dr. Kaplan’s testimony violated Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, 5 which requires advance notice of expert testimony.', 'The defendant also argues that Dr. Kaplan’s testimony was cumulative and impermissibly bolstered the medical records that were in evidence in the case. 5', '“Rule 16 [of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure] governs discovery procedures in criminal trials.” State v. Santiago, 81 A.3d 1136, 1140 (R.I. 2014).

Furthermore, “[t]he trial justice will not have abused his or her discretion as long as some grounds supporting his or her decision appear in the record.” Id. (quoting Adams, 161 A.3d at 1194). Moreover, this Court will not disturb a trial justice’s evidentiary ruling absent a finding that the abuse of discretion resulted in prejudicial error. State v. Ceppi, 91 A.3d 320, 331 (R.I. 2014).', '2', 'Discussion', 'The defendant admits that he did not specifically reference Rule 16 during the trial or in his post-trial motion, but he argues that “the parties and the [c]ourt were clearly discussing and referencing the obligation of the prosecution to provide advance notice of proposed expert testimony.” The state counters that, because the trial justice never specifically ruled on a Rule 16 violation, there is no ruling for this Court to review, and, thus, the issue has been waived.', 'It is well settled that the raise-or-waive rule “precludes us from considering at the appellate level issues not properly presented before the trial court.” State v. Yon, 161 A.3d 1118, 1128 (R.I. 2017) (quoting State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 236 (R.I. 2008)). “The raise-or-waive rule ‘imposes upon litigants a duty to raise all their claims for relief in the trial court and properly articulate them to a judge for a ruling.’” Id.

Stierhoff, 879 A.2d 425, 435 (R.I. 2005).', 'At the start of Dr. Kaplan’s testimony, counsel for defendant articulated a preliminary objection for the record, stating that, because the doctor had not been noticed as an expert witness, he feared that her testimony beyond the hospital records had the potential to be cumulative or bolstering. Additionally, the trial justice and the prosecutor engaged in a brief colloquy referencing this discovery issue during Dr. Kaplan’s testimony.6', 'However, as defendant concedes, neither the parties nor the trial justice mentioned Rule 16 specifically. Moreover, the trial justice did not make any rulings with respect to a discovery violation at any point during trial. The defendant argues before this Court that, nonetheless, there has been no waiver of the issue on appeal because “everyone involved in the case was cognizant” of the Rule 16 violation.', 'This general awareness and the brief colloquy, however, are insufficient to preserve the issue for appeal. It is clear that defendant did not “adequately express[] [his] Rule 16-based objection in a manner sufficient to afford the trial justice an opportunity to elicit further 6', 'The colloquy between the trial justice and the prosecutor proceeded as follows:', '“THE COURT:', 'Here is the thing, it is a very, I think difficult', 'line you are trying to walk with this witness', 'and I’m not -- I don’t mean that in a critical', 'way but I think it is a hard examination', 'because she is neither the treating doctor nor', 'an expert.

Thus, this issue has been waived.', 'Nevertheless, the record demonstrates that defendant made particular evidentiary objections to Dr. Kaplan’s testimony at several points throughout the trial, arguing that the testimony was cumulative, impermissibly bolstered the medical records, and improperly crossed into expert-testimony territory. Evidence is considered to be cumulative if it “tends to prove the same point to which other evidence has been offered.” Ceppi, 91 A.3d at 332 (quoting State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 622 n.7 (R.I. 2012)). The test for determining whether evidence is cumulative “is a retrospective one, administered at the close of all the evidence to determine whether the admission of certain evidence was harmless in light of all the evidence admitted on that point.” State v. Robinson, 989 A.2d 965, 979 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1032 (R.I. 2004)). “Impermissible bolstering occurs typically ‘when one witness offers an opinion concerning the truthfulness of the testimony of another witness.’” Ceppi, 91 A.3d at 332 (quoting State v. Hazard, 797 A.2d 448, 470 (R.I. 2002)).', 'Further, “[w]hen this Court determines that specific testimony constitutes impermissible bolstering, our task is then to determine whether the trial justice’s decision to admit such improper testimony constituted prejudicial error.” State v. Rushlow, 32 A.3d 892, 899 (R.I. 2011).', 'In a jury-waived case, cumulative or bolstering evidence does not have the same prejudicial impact as it would in a jury trial. Ceppi, 91 A.3d at 332 (holding that any prejudice resulting from an evidentiary error would be “substantially diminished” in a jury-waived trial (quoting State v. Medeiros, 996 A.2d 115, 121 (R.I. 2010))); State v. Notarantonio, 622 A.2d 457, 459 (R.I. 1993) (“Most of our rules of evidence relating to * * * bolstering of the credibility of the witness are designed to protect jurors from being misled by testimony that may be', '- 15 - improperly assessed by untrained lay persons.”).', 'In the case at bar, the trial justice acknowledged the potential “danger” of cumulative testimony in jury trials, but commented that he would “guard against that as a fact finder”; he specifically assured the parties that he “w[ould] not be prone to give it more weight as [he] heard it more than once.”', 'To the extent that Dr. Kaplan’s testimony was cumulative, therefore, we are satisfied that it was not prejudicial to defendant.', 'Moreover, we are of the opinion that defendant’s challenge to Dr. Kaplan’s testimony as bolstering is somewhat of a misnomer. The medical records were admitted into evidence by stipulation of the parties; the truth and accuracy of their contents were not in question. Furthermore, the portions of Dr. Kaplan’s testimony to which defendant objected were, at best, harmless in this jury-waived trial. Although the trial justice did state that he found Dr. Kaplan’s testimony to be “credible and particularly relevant to the physical injury requirement of the offense charged[,]” he clearly relied upon his own expertise as an experienced trial justice:', '“The dictionary definition of the word injury is harm or damage', 'from trauma. In this case, the evidence establishes and this Court', 'finds that defendant’s grasping and pulling the ponytail of a nine[-]', 'year-old child weighing 66 pounds for a distance of approximately', '30 feet, placing his knee on her stomach while lying on a couch,', 'placing one hand on her cheeks and the other on her neck and', 'applying pressure to the cheeks and neck for a period sufficient to', 'temporarily impair a bodily function, in this case breathing,', 'satisfies this Court beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant', 'inflicted a physical injury on [Abigail].” By allowing Dr. Kaplan to render a medical definition of “strangulation[,]” the trial justice permitted her to exceed the appropriate boundaries of a fact witness and enter the realm of expert testimony. We reject, however, any notion that the trial justice, sitting as he was, without a jury, required such an expert explication in light of the facts of this case. “Strangulation” is a term well-known to a seasoned trial justice in the context of a criminal trial.', '- 16 -', 'The defendant also objected at trial to Dr. Kaplan’s testimony that the photographs of Abigail were consistent with the history provided in the medical records.', 'In overruling defendant’s objection, the trial justice noted, “I think all she is saying at least from this person’s view who is the fact finder is she is saying that those photographs are consistent with the term strangulation that was used in the medical record. I think that is all she can say.”', 'The photographs in question were those taken of Abigail by Beth immediately after the incident with defendant. We are hard-pressed to categorize Dr. Kaplan’s testimony in this regard as an expert opinion. The photographs were admitted by stipulation as full exhibits; the trial justice was certainly capable of comparing them to the medical history. We perceive no error.', 'Finally, defendant objected at trial to Dr. Kaplan’s testimony that she did not think it was uncommon that Abigail was discharged from the emergency room a couple hours after initially presenting herself there. The trial justice, however, did not refer to this information in his decision and appeared to give it little, if any, weight. To the extent that Dr. Kaplan’s testimony in this regard may have been improperly admitted, it is beyond question harmless.', 'In sum, we are of the opinion that Dr. Kaplan’s testimony provides no basis for vacating defendant’s conviction.', 'B', 'Lesser-Included Offense', 'The defendant next challenges the trial justice’s determination that second-degree child abuse does not include any lesser-included offenses. He contends that, as a matter of law, simple assault is a lesser-included offense of the crime of second-degree child abuse, as set forth in § 11-9-5.3(b)(2) and (d), in cases where there has been no evidence of injury, or evidence of only a de minimis injury.', '- 17 -', '1', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that, “[i]n a jury-waived criminal proceeding, this Court gives deference to a trial justice’s finding[s] of facts.” Medeiros, 996 A.2d at 121 (second alteration in original) (quoting State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1221-22 (R.I. 2009)).

Similarly, G.L. 1956 § 12-17-3 provides that, in jury-waived cases, “the court shall, upon request of the accused, make special finding upon any issue of fact and special ruling upon any question of law arising in the case.” (Emphasis added.)', '- 18 -', 'The state argues that the issue of the trial justice’s failure to consider a lesser-included offense has been waived because defendant did not request a ruling of law on this issue, and that, although defendant commented on the applicability of a lesser-included offense in his supplemental memorandum to his closing argument, defendant did not “urge” the trial justice to consider it in this case. Furthermore, the state argues that, even if the issue has not been waived, the trial justice’s decision was valid on these facts, based on his findings that the “other physical injury” and “excessive” force requirements had been met.', 'A review of the record reveals that the trial justice provided commentary regarding his reading of the statute at several points throughout the trial proceedings.8 Most notably, he remarked on the statute’s construction during defendant’s closing argument, opining that “[i]t is a very unique statute the way it was drafted[,]” and further observing, “I don’t see any -- there is no lesser[-]included offense of any kind.” The state was the first party to raise the argument that simple assault was a lesser-included offense of the crime of second-degree child abuse during its 8', 'For example, during the hearing on defendant’s motion to dismiss following the state’s case, the trial justice inquired:', '“THE COURT:', 'Is second degree [child abuse]', 'anything else unless it falls within', 'corporal punishment[?]', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:', 'Yes, your Honor.', '“THE COURT:', 'Anything else that --', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:', 'Physical injury.', '“THE COURT:', '-- that can be a physical injury.

The defendant did not challenge the trial justice’s discussion during the trial or at closing argument; indeed, he first raised this contention in his supplemental memorandum to his closing argument.9', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice clearly articulated a basis for his finding that the injury requirement of the second-degree child abuse statute had been met, relying on credible witness testimony from Abigail, Beth, and Danielle, in addition to the medical records and photographs of Abigail’s injury.

Rather, “Rule 33 permits only that a trial justice on motion by the defendant ‘may vacate the judgment * * * take additional testimony and direct the entry of a new judgment.’” Id. (quoting Super. R.

Champagne, 668 A.2d 311, 313 (R.I. 1995)).

89,State : v. : Troy Footman. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. After a jury trial in the Superior Court, Troy Footman (Footman or defendant) was convicted of two counts of sex trafficking of a minor, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-67-6 (counts one and two); two counts of pandering or permitting prostitution, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-34.1-7(b) (counts three and four); and one count of driving a motor vehicle with a suspended license, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-11-18 (count five). The trial justice imposed two concurrent sentences of forty years to serve for the two counts of sex trafficking of a minor; a consecutive sentence of five years to serve for one count of pandering or permitting prostitution; a concurrent sentence of five years suspended, with probation, on the second count of pandering or permitting prostitution; and a term of thirty days to serve and a fine of $250 for driving with a suspended license. Because the parties have waived oral argument before the Court, we decide this appeal on the basis of the briefs.', 'Before this Court, defendant advances three assignments of error.', 'First, defendant contends that he received constitutionally deficient notice of the charges against him because the trial justice denied his motion for an amended bill of particulars. Next, defendant claims that his convictions for two counts of sex trafficking of a minor and two counts of pandering or', '-1- permitting prostitution violate the Double Jeopardy Clauses of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. Finally, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a mistrial after a witness testified to a conversation she had with defendant about human trafficking and his concern about returning to jail. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of conviction with respect to counts one and two, and affirm the judgment in all other respects.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts in this case recount a chronicle of debauchery and sexual exploitation of a fourteen-year-old runaway girl.', 'On January 30, 2014, defendant was charged by criminal information with two counts of sex trafficking of a minor, two counts of pandering or permitting prostitution, and one count of driving with a suspended license. A jury trial commenced on July 8, 2015, and the following facts were revealed through the testimony of various witnesses.', 'After an argument with her parents because she had slept over at a friend’s house without their permission, young Natalie1 ran away from home.', 'Natalie first sought refuge at a community shelter near Boston, where she encountered a friend, Michelle, who had also run away from home. After a month and a half on the run, staying with various friends, Natalie and Michelle arrived at the home of another friend, Courtnay, where they stayed for approximately one month. One afternoon, after an outing to a fast-food restaurant, Natalie’s friends told her to fix her hair because they had met a man named Troy who asked them if they wanted to earn some money by making a music video. That man was defendant. The three girls proceeded to defendant’s home. 1', 'We use pseudonyms to protect the privacy of the complaining witness and her friends, who were minors at the time of the incidents.', '-2-', 'During their visit, defendant and the three girls were joined by two other people—Karen Van Buren (Van Buren), who was employed by defendant in some capacity, and another gentleman who was a friend of defendant. When asked how old they were, Courtnay disclosed her true age—seventeen years old—but Michelle, who was fifteen at the time, lied and said that she was seventeen, while Natalie, who was fourteen at the time, told defendant that she was eighteen. Natalie testified that she lied about her age because she “wanted to be older[.]” The defendant then began to discuss “dancing” with the three girls and explained that it was a way to make “fast money.” The defendant gave Natalie his number and told her that, if she ever needed anything, she could contact him.', 'Two weeks later, Courtnay’s mother learned from an Amber Alert that Natalie was a missing child; she asked Natalie to leave the home. With no money and no other place to go, Natalie contacted defendant, who invited her to live at his home. Soon thereafter, the two began an intimate sexual relationship. The defendant initially paid for all living expenses, including rent, food, and utilities, and gave Natalie extra money for personal expenses.', 'However, defendant urged Natalie to get a job and again raised the topic of dancing or stripping at a club. After Natalie disclosed that she had not been home and therefore had no birth certificate or other form of identification, defendant assured her that he “could handle all that.” The two traveled to the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, where they acquired a fake Delaware identification card for Natalie. The identification card included Natalie’s photo, the name “Maxine Cooper,” and a birth date of April 13, 1991, making Natalie twenty-one years old at that time. The defendant also gave Natalie a fake Boston College student identification card with the name “Maxine Cooper.”', '-3-', 'Shortly thereafter, on March 12, 2013, defendant and Van Buren drove Natalie to Cheaters, an exotic dancing club in Providence. Upon arrival, defendant instructed Natalie to act mature and ask for Paul “Paulie” Calligano (Paulie), the manager of Cheaters at that time. Natalie followed Van Buren into the club, introduced herself to Paulie, and expressed a willingness to embark on a dancing career.', 'After Paulie examined and photocopied her identification documents, he told Natalie that she was hired and that she was required to sign an acknowledgement that she would be terminated if she engaged in “any activity that is deemed to [b]e in violation of the Rhode Island indoor [p]rostitution law.” After Natalie executed the document, Paulie gave Natalie a tour of the facility and briefly described her duties as an exotic dancer. Paulie also explained Cheaters’ pay-to-dance fee structure and told her that she would have to pay $35 to the manager on duty each day that she worked. The defendant gave Natalie $35 for her first shift and told her that Van Buren was going to take her “under her wing[.]”2 He also advised Natalie “[t]o be extremely polite to the customers and to try and get as much money as [she could].” At the end of her first shift, defendant picked Natalie up from Cheaters, asked her how much money she earned, and explained that he would keep the money so that she was not carrying cash when she reported for work.', 'The defendant had greater ambitions for Natalie beyond her dancing career at Cheaters. He also posted sexually suggestive photographs of Natalie on the now-defunct website Backpage.com, with the expectation that Natalie would engage in sex acts for compensation.3 2', 'The record before us is silent as to whether Van Buren was prosecuted for her role in these crimes. 3', '“Backpage is a classified advertising website where individuals can list a variety of products and services. Until January 2017, Backpage included an adult section containing different subcategories of various sex work professions, including escorts and strippers.” State v. Adams, 161 A.3d 1182, 1187 n.1 (R.I. 2017) (internal citation omitted).', '-4- Interested callers would call the phone number posted on Natalie’s profile, and defendant would discuss the price for each sex act and schedule an appointment. After each sexual encounter, Natalie’s earnings would be relinquished to defendant. Natalie also began working in the “Godiva Room,” a private area within Cheaters, where she would charge anywhere from $100 to $200 or more for performing sex acts with patrons of Cheaters. The defendant provided the condoms, and Natalie turned over the profits.4', 'Natalie continued dancing and appearing in the Godiva Room until July 29, 2013, when, pursuant to an undercover investigation, Providence police detectives Jonathan Kantorski and Louis Gianfrancesco entered Cheaters in plain clothes. The two detectives first sat at a bar and watched as defendant entered the club and spoke to Natalie.', 'After defendant left, Det. Gianfrancesco approached Natalie, who identified herself by her stage name, Rozay. Several minutes later, uniformed officers entered the club and approached Natalie; Dets. Kantorski and Gianfrancesco then left the club. When asked for her name, Natalie first said Maxine Cooper; but, after further prompting, she disclosed her true identity and was transported to Providence police headquarters. Natalie was fifteen years old at the time. The defendant was arrested that night and later charged by way of criminal information.', 'On July 20, 2015, defendant was found guilty on all five counts as charged; his motion for a new trial was subsequently denied, and the trial justice imposed the sentences as set out above. The defendant timely appealed.', 'Before this Court, defendant proffers three arguments: (1) the trial justice committed reversible error when she denied defendant’s motion for an amended bill of particulars as to the 4', 'During this time, Natalie and defendant also persuaded Michelle to work at Cheaters and perform sex acts for compensation while at the club. Michelle, too, gave all of her earnings to defendant. However, approximately two months after she first began working for Cheaters, Michelle was fired.', '-5- two counts of sex trafficking of a minor and the two counts of pandering or permitting prostitution; (2) the imposition of multiple punishments for the two counts of sex trafficking of a minor and two counts of pandering or permitting prostitution, all of which arose out of the same conduct, violated his constitutional protection against double jeopardy; and (3) the trial justice erred in denying defendant’s motion for a mistrial because the cautionary instruction to the jury was insufficient to eradicate the taint of the offending testimony.', 'Analysis', 'Sex Trafficking of a Minor—State v. Maxie, 187 A.3d 330 (R.I. 2018)', 'As an initial matter, defendant was convicted of two counts of sex trafficking of a minor, in violation of § 11-67-6, which has since been repealed and replaced with G.L. 1956 § 11-67.1- 3. See P.L. 2017, ch. 232, § 1; P.L. 2017, ch. 260, § 1. However, in State v. Maxie, 187 A.3d 330 (R.I. 2018), this Court declared that § 11-67-6 was flawed in that the statute failed to charge a criminal offense. Maxie, 187 A.3d at 341. Although § 11-67-6 contained a definitional section, a section describing various types of conduct, and a penalty section, there was no declaration that the conduct set forth in the statute was a felony crime. See id. at 338-39, 341. Accordingly, defendant’s convictions under counts one and two, sex trafficking of a minor, are vacated on the grounds that the statute he was charged under, § 11-67-6, failed to charge an offense. We shall proceed to address defendant’s appellate contentions as they relate to the remaining counts for which defendant stands convicted.', 'Bill of Particulars', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court has held that “the function of a bill of particulars is to apprise a defendant of the evidentiary details establishing the facts of the offense when such facts have not been', '-6- included in the indictment or information.” State v. LaChapelle, 638 A.2d 525, 527 (R.I. 1994). A bill of particulars is not comparable to a party’s answers to a set of interrogatories; instead, “[t]he primary purpose [of a bill of particulars] is to supply the defendant with such particulars as are necessary in order that judicial surprise is avoided at trial.” State v. Hunt, 137 A.3d 689, 693 (R.I. 2016) (quoting State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1253 (R.I. 1998)).', 'In addition, this Court has stated that “the granting of a bill of particulars in any civil or criminal proceeding is within the discretion of the justice who hears the motion and his discretion will not be disturbed unless it appears that there has been an abuse of discretion.” State v. Gregson, 113 A.3d 393, 397 (R.I. 2015) (quoting Union Mortgage Co. v. Rocheleau, 51 R.I. 345, 348, 154 A. 658, 660 (1931)).', 'Discussion', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice abused her discretion when, on the eve of trial, she denied his motion for an amended bill of particulars, contending that he was forced to defend this case in the absence of constitutionally adequate notice. We reject this argument.', 'On June 18, 2015, defendant moved for a bill of particulars pursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.5 The state provided an answer on June 30, 2015, and responded that defendant had committed, inter alia, various acts of sex trafficking and pandering or permitting prostitution between certain specific dates.', 'As to the counts for pandering or permitting prostitution, the state declared “[t]hat the defendant did knowingly permit, allow, transport or offer or agree to receive [Natalie], a juvenile female, into a business 5', 'Although defendant was charged by information on January 30, 2014, he did not file for a bill of particulars until June 18, 2015—seventeen months after being charged and just twenty days prior to the commencement of trial. Rule 7(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[a] motion for a bill of particulars may be made within thirty (30) days after arraignment or at such later time as the court may permit.”', '-7- for the purpose of committing any commercial sexual activity, or to aid or abet or participate in commercial sexual activity, to wit sexually explicit performance[,]” and “[t]hat the defendant did, knowing [Natalie], a minor, to be a prostitute, derive support or maintenance in whole or in part from the earnings, or proceeds of commercial sexual activity, or did share in the earnings, proceeds, or money from commercial sexual activity, to wit sexually explicit performance.” The defendant challenged the sufficiency of the state’s response and argued that the response deprived him of the minimum notice required under the law. The trial justice denied this motion for an amended bill of particulars, concluding that the bill of particulars and the state’s response to defendant’s discovery requests gave defendant ample notice upon which to prepare his defense.', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in refusing to order an amended bill of particulars. The defendant has failed to demonstrate how the denial of the motion has prejudiced him in any way. The bill of particulars listed the evidentiary facts that the state intended to prove regarding the crimes of sex trafficking of a minor and pandering or permitting prostitution. This response, coupled with the abundant pretrial discovery, including several witness statements detailing defendant’s conduct from May 9, 2013, to July 30, 2013, more than satisfied the notice requirement. This material afforded defendant an adequate opportunity to inform himself of the evidence the state was prepared to present at trial. Accordingly, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in denying defendant’s motion for an amended bill of particulars.', '-8-', 'Double Jeopardy', 'Standard of Review', 'An alleged violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause presents this Court with a mixed question of law and fact. Therefore, “our review of such a claim is de novo.” State v. Marsich, 10 A.3d 435, 441 (R.I. 2010). Within the purview of de novo review, a trial justice’s findings of historical fact are accorded great deference. See, e.g., Lopes v. State, 111 A.3d 344, 348 (R.I. 2015).', 'Discussion', 'The defendant argues that the imposition of multiple punishments for two counts of sex trafficking of a minor and two counts of pandering or permitting prostitution, which he contends arise from the same conduct, was improper and violated his constitutional protections against double jeopardy. Because we are vacating defendant’s convictions for sex trafficking of a minor as set forth in counts one and two, defendant’s argument in that respect is moot. See United States v. Bass, 310 F.3d 321, 323 (5th Cir. 2002) (holding that double jeopardy argument is moot where court vacated one of the convictions at issue on other grounds); United States v. Otis, 127 F.3d 829, 835 (9th Cir. 1997) (same).', 'In addition, Rule 12(b)(2) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that “[t]he defense of double jeopardy * * * may be raised only by motion before trial.” Therefore, “a defendant’s failure to raise such a motion before trial precludes that defendant from thereafter raising a double jeopardy challenge.” State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 977 (R.I. 2007). Our careful review of the record reveals that defendant did not raise the defense of double jeopardy prior to trial, as required by Rule 12(b)(2). The defendant has not presented a compelling reason for this Court to grant relief from the waiver of his double jeopardy argument', '-9- occasioned by his failure to raise it in a pretrial motion to dismiss. We therefore also consider this issue to be waived.', 'The Motion to Pass the Case', 'Standard of Review', 'When called upon to review a trial justice’s ruling on a motion for a mistrial, this Court affords the decision great weight and will disturb the decision only if it was clearly wrong. State v. Fry, 130 A.3d 812, 828 (R.I. 2016). We often have stated that “[t]he trial justice has a ‘front row seat’ during the trial so that he can best evaluate the effects of any prejudice on the jury.” State v. Barkmeyer, 949 A.2d 984, 1007 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198, 1207 (R.I. 1995)). As such, when a trial justice rules on a motion for a mistrial, he or she “must determine whether the evidence would cause the jurors to be so inflamed as to make them unable to decide the case on the basis of the evidence presented.” State v. Enos, 21 A.3d 326, 332 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Luciano, 739 A.2d 222, 228 (R.I. 1999)). A mistrial is appropriate only when a timely cautionary instruction cannot cure the prejudice. See State v. Disla, 874 A.2d 190, 198 (R.I. 2005). “In the absence of any indication that the jury was not capable of complying with the trial justice[’]s cautionary instruction, this [c]ourt must assume that the jury did disregard the witness comments as it was instructed to do.” Id. (quoting State v. Powers, 566 A.2d 1298, 1304 (R.I. 1989)).', 'Discussion', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a mistrial when Natalie disclosed that she learned about human trafficking during a conversation with defendant in which he discussed returning to prison. He also contends that the cautionary instruction given by the trial justice was insufficient to cure the prejudicial effect. We disagree.', '- 10 -', 'During cross-examination of Natalie, defendant attempted to impeach her credibility by highlighting the inconsistencies between the statements she made to the police on July 30, 2013, and her testimony at trial. Specifically, when Natalie was first interviewed, she told the officers that, on the day she began working as an exotic dancer at Cheaters, she and defendant took a commuter train from Boston to Providence.', 'At trial, however, she testified that she and defendant went by automobile. When questioned by defendant about these inconsistent statements, Natalie testified, “I told them that we took the commuter rail because I didn’t, once again, want to get [defendant] in trouble because it would be trafficking if we took a car.” On redirect examination, the state asked Natalie how she learned of the term “human trafficking,” and she testified that defendant explained “trafficking” to her when they were talking “[a]bout him going to jail again.” The defendant objected, asked for a sidebar, and moved for a mistrial “based on the witness’s remark to the jurors referencing a prior period of incarceration[.]” The trial justice denied the motion for a mistrial and, in order to eliminate any potential prejudice, struck Natalie’s answer from the record and gave a comprehensive cautionary instruction to the jury:', '“THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, I’ll strike the answer the', 'witness just gave to the last question some reference to something', 'to do with jail. That is not before you. There’s no evidence to that', 'effect. I have no idea what the reference is, so I’m going to strike', 'that completely and direct you not to consider it.', '“Again, as I instructed you repeatedly yesterday, the only', 'matters you are concerned with is [sic] the matters before the', '[c]ourt and nothing else. So that answer is stricken and you should', 'not consider that at all. It has nothing to do with this case.” Defense counsel did not object to this instruction.', 'Notwithstanding defendant’s contention before this Court that the prejudice caused by the jury hearing Natalie’s remark was “profound and inexpiable[,]” we are not convinced that this one remark was so prejudicial that the jury would not have been able to decide the case based on', '- 11 - the abundant evidence of guilt that was admitted at trial. Furthermore, any prejudicial effect caused by Natalie’s remark was sufficiently minimized by the trial justice’s cautionary instruction. See Disla, 874 A.2d at 198 (“Certainly, the entire rationale underlying the structure of jury trials and the lyrical deference that is paid to jury findings rests upon the proposition that jurors will obey the admonitions of the trial justice and will apply the law as given to them by the justice presiding.” (quoting State v. Fenner, 503 A.2d 518, 522 (R.I. 1986))). As we often have declared, we presume the jury was able to follow instructions from the trial justice; we are satisfied that this cautionary instruction was more than sufficient to cure any potential prejudice in these circumstances. See State v. LaRoche, 683 A.2d 989, 1000 (R.I. 1996). Accordingly, after reviewing the record and the trial justice’s cautionary instruction, we see no reason to conclude that the jury in this case was not able to make an objective evaluation of the evidence against defendant. The trial justice, therefore, did not abuse her discretion in denying the motion for a mistrial.', 'Moreover, we also note that it was the defendant who opened the door to this topic when he attempted to attack Natalie’s credibility on cross-examination. Again, as part of his defense, the defendant challenged Natalie’s credibility by emphasizing the inconsistencies between her statements made to law enforcement agencies and her testimony at trial.', 'This line of questioning, in particular relating to her reason for lying about the mode of transportation from state to state, opened the door for the state to explain Natalie’s inconsistent statements and, specifically, to inquire into how Natalie came to learn the term “trafficking” and the context in which it was discussed with the defendant. See State v. Mastracchio, 112 R.I. 487, 495, 312 A.2d 190, 195 (1973) (“Once [the] defendant opened up the door to [certain] evidence in an attempt to impeach [a witness’s] credibility, he could not complain when the state followed with', '- 12 - further testimony of a like character in clarification of what had been brought up on cross- examination.”). Therefore, because defense counsel opened the door during cross-examination, it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial justice to refuse to grant a mistrial when the state made inquiry into this testimony on redirect examination.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we vacate in part and affirm in part. We vacate the judgment of conviction with respect to counts one and two, sex trafficking of a minor, and we affirm the judgment in all other respects.

This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on September 27, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The respondent, Tony Gonzalez (respondent or Gonzalez), appeals from a decree entered in the Family Court terminating his parental rights with respect to his daughter, Izabella G.

On appeal, the respondent argues that the Family Court justice erred by: (1) permitting a witness to provide expert testimony; (2) admitting the child’s letter into evidence; and (3) taking judicial notice of adjudicative facts. Lastly, respondent contends that the alleged errors were not harmless and require reversal. We disagree.', 'Having carefully considered the memoranda filed by the parties and the arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time.

At a pretrial hearing on the neglect petition, in July 2012, respondent admitted sufficient facts to support a finding of neglect, and Izabella was committed to the care, custody, and control of DCYF. The respondent subsequently was convicted of first-degree murder and other felonies. The respondent was sentenced, inter alia, to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment.', 'In November 2013, DCYF filed a petition in the Family Court seeking to terminate respondent’s and mother’s parental rights to Izabella.

The respondent was the first witness. Although respondent had previously testified about his relationship with Izabella as well as his involvement in raising the child, at the remand hearing he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. However, respondent subsequently agreed to answer non-incriminating questions regarding his visits with Izabella, his employment at the ACI during his incarceration, and questions about a letter he wrote to Shaw in August 2013, in which he admitted that prior to his incarceration he had placed Izabella in a cold shower while she was having a tantrum. Nevertheless, despite the opportunity to present testimony concerning his parental fitness, respondent failed to offer any evidence of his actual ability to care for Izabella at that time or upon his release from the ACI.', 'The next witness to testify was Shaw, the DCYF caseworker assigned to Izabella’s case. Shaw testified about case activity notes concerning Izabella and recounted her observations from visits she had with Izabella and Lomberto, as well as visits between Izabella and respondent.

Based on Wilson’s testimony, DCYF’s counsel requested that the Family Court justice qualify Wilson as an expert witness.', 'Over respondent’s objection, Wilson described a letter-writing exercise she used with Izabella as a part of her therapy treatment. Wilson explained that she asked Izabella to write letters—which were not mailed or forwarded—in an effort to assist Izabella in expressing her feelings in a non-aggressive manner. The letter in question had been dictated by Izabella to Wilson and was admitted into evidence.', 'In the letter, Izabella expressed anger towards respondent and her paternal grandmother. During her testimony, Wilson discussed the contents of the letter and the discussions she had with Izabella during her therapy sessions.', 'After allowing voir dire of Wilson regarding her qualification, the Family Court justice qualified Wilson as an expert in the field of marriage and family therapy and, specifically, in the area of providing therapy to traumatized children. The Family Court justice also found that Izabella’s letter was part of the child’s therapy and, thus, she admitted the letter as an exhibit. 5', 'Izabella has a history of neglect, which includes both physical and emotional abuse. The record demonstrates, without contradiction, that respondent physically abused Izabella in response to her temper tantrums. For instance, respondent tied Izabella’s hands and feet; put her in a cold shower; placed her in a room alone for six hours; and permitted her to be force fed. As a result of the traumatic experiences Izabella endured, Wilson opined that Izabella had a fear of adults and was affected by her parents not being there for her.', '-6- Lastly, Ellsworth testified about her investigation of Izabella’s case, including the disclosures of physical abuse which respondent committed in August 2010.6', 'On February 21, 2017, the Family Court justice issued a second decision, again terminating respondent’s parental rights.

However, we perceive no error in the trial justice’s decision to qualify Wilson as an expert in the field of marriage and family therapy, and, specifically, in the area of providing therapy to traumatized children.', 'This Court has consistently held that “[t]he question of whether a witness is qualified to express an expert opinion is a matter that is committed to the sound discretion of the trial justice, and the exercise of such discretion will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of abuse.” Narragansett Electric Co. v. Carbone, 898 A.2d 87, 95 (R.I. 2006) (quoting Mangasarian v.

D’Alessio, 848 A.2d 1118, 1123 (R.I. 2004).

Wilson', '-8- estimated that she had worked with over 1,000 children—many of whom were in foster care— and that, throughout her twenty-six-year career as a therapist, her work primarily focused on providing therapy to children who had a history of trauma.', 'In light of Wilson’s “education, training, employment, [and] prior experiences[,]” we are of the opinion that the Family Court justice properly exercised her discretion to qualify Wilson as an expert witness. Villani, 491 A.2d at 979. The mere fact that Wilson did not have a degree in child psychology was not disqualifying. Moreover, the fact that Wilson had not worked specifically with children who had visited a parent in prison goes to the weight of her testimony, not its admissibility. See D’Alessio, 848 A.2d at 1124 (holding that the fact that an expert was not a specialist in neuropathology “might bear on the weight of [the] testimony, but not its admissibility”).', 'The respondent also contends that the Family Court justice impermissibly permitted Wilson to render an expert opinion relative to the issues of the best interests of the child, parental unfitness, and visitation rights. However, this argument is unsupported by the record.', 'The Family Court justice unequivocally stated that she would not rely on Wilson’s testimony as it related to respondent’s fitness. She made clear that she was only considering Wilson’s opinions as they related to the child’s best interest; and, as an experienced trial justice, she was fully capable of considering Wilson’s opinion for that limited purpose.7 7', 'The Family Court justice clarified:', '“[Wilson’s] expertise in this case is as to [Izabella], * * * what the', 'results of her therapy are with regard to [Izabella], what her', 'observations are with regard to [Izabella].

Given that Form 188 merely delineates a timeline for DCYF’s reunification process, whether a signed copy was admitted into evidence was of no consequence to the Family Court justice’s findings. The Family Court justice concluded that DCYF had made reasonable efforts to reunify respondent and Izabella. The Family Court justice reviewed the case plans that DCYF prepared. Additionally, DCYF workers testified that respondent was given the case plans and information on programs available at the ACI to improve his relationship with Izabella. Thus, we conclude that competent evidence supports the Family Court’s findings and conclusions. Accordingly, respondent’s arguments pertaining to Form 188 are without merit.', 'Harmless Error', 'Lastly, respondent asserts that the errors he has raised cannot be characterized as harmless.', 'Having concluded that defendant failed to establish record error, we reject this contention. “In order to effectively conduct a harmless error analysis, the particular evidence must be ‘quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine [the effect it had on the trial].’” State v.

The defendant, James Dalton, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction on one count of second-degree sexual assault, for which the trial justice sentenced the defendant to ten years, with the entirety of the sentence suspended, with probation. On appeal, the defendant asserts that the trial justice erred when he allowed testimony by the responding officer in which he commented on the complaining witness’s credibility, arguing that this testimony was impermissible bolstering or vouching of the witness’s credibility. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On the morning of September 5, 2015, Jonathan,1 his girlfriend Amanda, and eight to ten friends drove from Connecticut to Newport to celebrate Amanda’s birthday. At the time, twenty- four-year-old Jonathan worked part-time as security at a hospital, attended school for HVAC technician training, and was a member of the Army National Guard. When the group of friends left for Newport at around 8 a.m., Jonathan had just ended a shift at the hospital, which had started at midnight.', 'The group arrived in Newport around 11 a.m. and went to lunch at a local restaurant. After lunch, the group split up; the women went shopping, and the men went to an Irish pub a couple of blocks away. A few hours later, the group convened again and decided to drive to a nearby beach. Amanda drove Jonathan and three other friends. On the way, Jonathan and Amanda quarreled. Jonathan testified that, when the car stopped at a red light, he “exited the vehicle to cool down.” Not familiar with the area, he started walking “aimlessly” because he did not know where he was and then stopped at a liquor store and bought a beer and a “nip” of alcohol.', 'Around 3 p.m., Jonathan sat down to cool off in a park. Jonathan testified that families and dogs were running around in the park and people were playing tennis at courts nearby. He drank the nip and the beer, which brought his total alcohol consumption that day to approximately six drinks. Tired from his late-night hospital security shift, Jonathan pulled his hat over his head and fell asleep under a tree. 1', 'We will refer to the complaining witness and his girlfriend by their first names to protect their privacy; no disrespect is intended.', '-2-', 'When Jonathan woke up, it was nighttime. He explained that he felt a bit hazy at first, but that he quickly became clearheaded. Jonathan testified that when he awoke, a man was hovering over him with his hands down Jonathan’s shorts, fondling Jonathan’s genitals and muttering repeatedly, “Yeah, motherfucker.” At trial, Jonathan identified defendant as the man who had touched him in the park.', 'Jonathan testified that he pushed defendant away from him. As he shoved defendant, Jonathan saw that defendant had been touching his genitals, with his hands in his own pants, while fondling Jonathan.2 Jonathan testified that defendant began to run away from him, towards the tennis courts. Jonathan tackled defendant to the ground, punched him in the head several times, and yelled, “Call the cops.” Jonathan testified that defendant was trying to talk to him, telling Jonathan that he was just trying to wake him up. Two people playing tennis at the nearby court heard Jonathan and called the police.', 'A few minutes later, the police arrived, one of whom was Russell Carlone, who was at that time a captain with the Newport Police Department.3 Jonathan told the police officers what had happened at the park, and he was brought to the police station to write a witness statement. Carlone testified that, when he and a fellow police officer first arrived at the scene, he initially heard yelling, and then as he got closer, he observed a younger man holding down an older man. As the officers approached the two men, Carlone testified, the younger man was “very, very upset” and was “crying and screaming[.]” Carlone and the other officer separated the two men. Carlone spoke with Jonathan. Carlone testified that Jonathan said repeatedly, “He touched me.” 2', 'The transcript indicates that Jonathan testified that defendant had his “hands” down Jonathan’s shorts, and also that defendant had his “hands” down his own pants. No explanation for the use of the plural is given. 3', 'Although he was still on the job at the time of defendant’s arrest, Carlone was retired from the police department when he testified at trial.', '-3- When Carlone asked Jonathan what happened, Jonathan said he was sleeping in the park and woke up to defendant “on top of him” with “his hand down his pants” and said continually, “Oh yeah, mother[fucker].”', 'Carlone also questioned defendant at the scene. From that conversation, Carlone learned that defendant had seen a person lying down in the park, left his car to check on the person, tried giving the person verbal commands, and when that was unsuccessful, tried to wake the person by shaking him. The defendant also told Carlone that, when Jonathan woke up, Jonathan attacked defendant, placed him in a headlock, and pinned him to the ground. The defendant, in his conversation with Carlone, denied touching Jonathan inappropriately or putting his hands down Jonathan’s pants. After speaking to defendant, Carlone asked Jonathan to tell his story once again. Carlone testified that Jonathan’s second telling was consistent with the first. Carlone testified that, although Jonathan was emotional the entire time they were speaking, Carlone was able to understand his story.', 'After a two-day trial, the jury found defendant guilty on the single count charged: second-degree sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4. On January 18, 2017, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. On April 6, 2017, the trial justice sentenced defendant to ten years, suspended, with probation, and ordered defendant to register as a sex offender and receive appropriate counseling.

This Court “require[s] a specific objection so that the allegation of error can be brought to the attention of the trial justice, who will then have an opportunity to rule on it.” Id.', 'Carlone testified that it was his “judgment that [Jonathan] had just woken up from a deep sleep and been assaulted[.]” The defendant objected to this statement, but failed to provide any specificity as to the nature of his objection. The defendant argues that the nature of his objection was clear from the context because he objected at the precise moment that bolstering or vouching occurred.', 'After reviewing the record, however, we are of the opinion that the basis for defendant’s objection was not clear from the context of the state’s questioning. Merely objecting at the precise point of testimony at which the alleged impermissible bolstering or vouching occurred— without more—does not sufficiently alert a trial justice to a potentially prejudicial evidentiary issue. See Pona, 66 A.3d at 469; but cf. State v. Offley, 131 A.3d 663, 670 (R.I. 2016) (finding counsel’s repeated attempts to explain his objection’s rationale, despite never actually articulating them, to be sufficiently focused in context of that case to preserve evidentiary objections for review).', 'Here, defendant objected after Carlone had responded, “it was my judgment that he had just woken up from a deep sleep and been assaulted[,]” to the state’s unrelated question, “Did you detect anything on him with regard to alcohol?” Significantly, following his objection, defendant did not move to strike Carlone’s answer or pass the case. If a general objection at a precise moment were sufficient to constitute a “specific objection,” a trial justice would be required to divine the reason for the objection, essentially reading the mind of the objecting counsel. Also, if every well-timed “Objection” could be considered as a specific objection, the', '-7- specificity requirement would be rendered meaningless. We therefore conclude that defendant’s mere “Objection,” without providing any detail as to its basis, did not suffice to preserve the issue of the admissibility of Carlone’s testimony for our substantive review.', 'Even if the issue had been properly preserved, however, we would conclude that the admission of Carlone’s testimony did not constitute prejudicial error.', 'As noted above, to successfully challenge a trial justice’s admission of evidence as impermissibly bolstering or vouching, a party must demonstrate not only that such bolstering or vouching actually occurred, but also that it “constituted prejudicial error with respect to the defendant.” State v. Kausel, 68 A.3d 524, 532 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Adefusika, 989 A.2d at 476).', 'Assuming without deciding that Carlone’s testimony constituted impermissible bolstering or vouching, we are convinced that the admission of this testimony did not amount to prejudicial error in this case. The statement at issue was brief and without follow-up.', 'Unlike in State v. Brash, 512 A.2d 1375 (R.I. 1986), where the bolstering testimony of two witnesses, an FBI agent and a state police lieutenant, was pointedly “offered for the purpose of supporting [the witness’s] credibility,” Brash, 512 A.2d at 1381, here, Carlone’s brief statement was a non-responsive answer to the state’s inquiry as to whether Carlone smelled alcohol on Jonathan’s breath. The state was not asking whether Carlone thought Jonathan had been assaulted.', 'Moreover, Jonathan was subject to intense cross-examination at trial, providing the jury with its own opportunity to assess Jonathan’s credibility. See Rushlow, 32 A.3d at 900 (holding that the admission of impermissible vouching or bolstering was not prejudicial error because of “the jurors’ sufficient opportunity to judge [the complaining witness’s] truthfulness” through cross-examination).', 'Also, the trial justice provided detailed jury instructions, including a reference to Carlone’s testimony, with specific instructions that the jury not afford a police', '-8- officer’s testimony “any more credibility or less credibility merely because that person is a police officer.”', 'Thus, the jury had “ample opportunity to form an independent opinion about [Jonathan’s] credibility[.]” State v. Higham, 865 A.2d 1040, 1046 (R.I. 2004). We conclude that, even if this issue had been properly preserved for appellate review, no reversible error occurred in the admission of this testimony.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.

92,Ricardo Hernandez : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Ricardo Hernandez appeals from a judgment of the Superior Court denying and dismissing his application for postconviction relief. 1 This case came before this Court for oral argument on October 2, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed on behalf of the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'We note that G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-9 was amended in 2015, and now requires an aggrieved party to file a petition for certiorari to review the denial of an application for postconviction relief. See P.L. 2015, ch. 91, § 1; P.L. 2015, ch. 92, § 1. Hernandez’s notice of appeal was filed on April 29, 2010, before this amendment took effect, and therefore his appeal is proper.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 1998, a justice of the Superior Court sentenced Hernandez to sixty-three years to serve at the Adult Correctional Institutions after a jury found him guilty, in three consolidated criminal cases, of first degree sexual assault, two counts of second degree sexual assault, assault with intent to commit murder, assault with intent to commit robbery, unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, and assault with a device similar to a firearm. He appealed to this Court, and we affirmed the conviction. 2 Ten years later, in January 2008, Hernandez filed an application for postconviction relief, in accordance with G.L. 1956 chapter 9.1 of title 10. A justice of the Superior Court appointed counsel to represent Hernandez. After a thorough examination of Hernandez’s claims, postconviction relief counsel opined that the issues that had been raised in Hernandez’s application were “wholly frivolous, without merit, and neither supported by existing law, nor by a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.” Counsel further determined that “no other non-frivolous issues or arguments exist which might arguably support plaintiff’s Petition[,]” and that “trial counsel’s performance was neither deficient, prejudicial, nor ineffective.” Consequently, and in accordance with the mandate set forth in Shatney v. State, 755 A.2d 130 (R.I. 2000), counsel moved to withdraw from the case.', 'A hearing was held on postconviction relief counsel’s motion to withdraw on April 23, 2010. After counsel explained to the hearing justice his basis for concluding that Hernandez’s claims for postconviction relief lacked merit, the hearing justice granted his motion. The hearing justice then reviewed Hernandez’s claims and said that he agreed with counsel that the claims lacked merit. He informed Hernandez that, if he still wished to pursue his postconviction relief 2', 'The underlying facts pertinent to Hernandez’s conviction can be found in State v. Hernandez, 822 A.2d 915 (R.I. 2003).', '-2- claims, he would have to do so without court-appointed counsel. After the hearing justice asked Hernandez what he wished to do, Hernandez replied that he continued to believe that he had the right to an attorney to represent him, and that he should not have been charged with attempted murder for using a BB gun during one of the assaults. The hearing justice responded that Hernandez’s argument was “wholly and totally without merit[,]” was a matter “set forth to the finders of fact[,]” and was never raised.', 'He denied Hernandez’s application for postconviction relief. Final judgment was entered on that same day, and Hernandez timely appealed to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Pursuant to § 10-9.1-1, postconviction relief is a remedy available to “any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant’s constitutional rights or that the existence of newly discovered material facts requires vacation of the conviction in the interest of justice.” Duvere v. State, 151 A.3d 314, 317 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Lamoureux v. State, 93 A.3d 958, 961 (R.I. 2014)).', 'An applicant for postconviction relief bears “[t]he burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such [postconviction] relief is warranted[.]” Navarro v. State, 187 A.3d 317, 325 (R.I. 2018) (quoting Motyka v. State, 172 A.3d 1203, 1205 (R.I. 2017)). “This Court will not disturb a [hearing] justice’s factual findings made on an application for post[ ]conviction relief absent clear error or a showing that the [hearing] justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence in arriving at those findings.” Id. (quoting Chapdelaine v. State, 32 A.3d 937, 941 (R.I. 2011)).', '-3-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'Before this Court, Hernandez argues that postconviction relief counsel acted as a mere screening agent rather than as his advocate, as required under state law. He also contends that the hearing justice erred when he denied the application without providing Hernandez with notice of his intent to dismiss the action or granting a continuance to allow Hernandez to respond to the proposed dismissal. Moreover, Hernandez alleges that the hearing justice failed to probe the potential existence of genuine issues of material fact.', 'A', 'Appointment of Counsel', 'Hernandez argues that postconviction relief counsel acted primarily as a “screening agent” for the Superior Court and not as his advocate. Specifically, Hernandez maintains that the attorney who had been appointed to represent him misconstrued, in his memorandum in support of his motion to withdraw, his role as counsel to conduct an “independent examination” of the merits of the applicant’s claim. According to Hernandez, this is contrary to the mandate of § 10-9.1-5.', 'At the outset, we note that we have held that the right to counsel in a postconviction relief proceeding “is a matter of legislative grace, not constitutional right.” Reyes v. State, 141 A.3d 644, 658 (R.I. 2016) (quoting Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 454 (R.I. 2012)). “Because the postconviction remedy amounts to a collateral attack on a conviction, the action is civil in nature, for which there is no constitutional right to counsel.” Campbell, 56 A.3d at 454 (citing Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551, 555 (1987); Bryant v. Wall, 896 A.2d 704, 708 (R.I. 2006); Louro v. State, 740 A.2d 343, 344 n.1 (R.I. 1999)). Despite that, the General Assembly', '-4- has provided that “[a]n applicant who is indigent shall be entitled to be represented by the public defender. If the public defender is excused from representing the applicant because of a conflict of interest or is otherwise unable to provide representation, the court shall assign counsel to represent the applicant.” Section 10-9.1-5; see also Reyes, 141 A.3d at 649; Ramirez v. State, 89 A.3d 836, 839 (R.I. 2014); Campbell, 56 A.3d at 454-55. Importantly, neither Shatney', '“nor its progeny contemplates the appointment of an objective or', 'independent lawyer who does not represent the applicant, and that', '[g]enerally, Shatney considerations should arise after counsel has', 'been appointed in accordance with § 10-9.1-5 and the applicant has', 'been provided with a meaningful discussion with counsel about the', 'issues that may or may not be suitable grounds for postconviction', 'relief.” Navarro, 187 A.3d at 328 (quoting Ramirez, 89 A.3d at', '840).', 'In this case, postconviction relief counsel was appointed by the hearing justice. 3 There is no question about the thoroughness and diligence of counsel’s work—he claimed that he met with Hernandez at least three times at the ACI; reviewed his application for postconviction relief along with supporting documents; reviewed and read the police reports and witness statements from Hernandez’s case; researched all the issues raised in Hernandez’s application; spoke with pretrial and trial counsel; reviewed the decision from this Court on direct appeal and the briefs filed in that case; and read the pretrial and trial transcripts. Counsel then determined that Hernandez’s claims lacked merit and he filed a memorandum to that effect, along with a motion to withdraw, pursuant to Shatney.', 'Critically, however, in that Shatney memorandum, counsel described his role as “for a limited entry of appearance under the guidelines established by [the] Shatney decision by the Rhode Island Supreme Court to determine if Mr. Hernandez’[s] post conviction is with merit.” 3', 'We note that the record is unclear whether the hearing justice first considered the Public Defender before opting to appoint private counsel to represent Hernandez, an indigent applicant.', '-5- This is an incorrect interpretation of counsel’s role in representing a postconviction relief applicant.', 'As we have indicated in our prior decisions, counsel’s role in representing a postconviction relief applicant is to be an advocate for his or her client. See Navarro, 187 A.3d at 328 (postconviction relief counsel properly “described his role as being appointed to represent [applicant] in his postconviction-relief application”); Reyes, 141 A.3d at 659 (in recognition of a potential conflict between pressing an applicant’s claims that are frivolous and the risk of sanctions under Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, “we adopted a mechanism in Shatney so ‘that an attorney * * * appointed to represent an indigent applicant may withdraw from that representation when it becomes clear, after a reasonable investigation, that some or all of the applicant’s claims lack merit’” (emphasis added) (quoting Campbell, 56 A.3d at 455-56)); Campbell, 56 A.3d at 456 (citing post-Shatney decisions by this Court where counsel had been appointed to represent a postconviction relief applicant, and not as an independent or objective lawyer). It is true that, as the state argues, counsel’s deficiency is apparent in but a few lines in an otherwise thorough and comprehensive memorandum. Nonetheless, the description by counsel of his belief as to his role in this case leads to the inevitable conclusion that he was not acting as a zealous advocate, despite the meticulous nature of his work. Therefore, we are constrained to hold that Hernandez was not afforded “a full, fair, and counselled opportunity” to present his claims before the hearing justice determined them to be meritless. See Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135 (emphasis added) (quoting Commonwealth v. Harris, 553 A.2d 428, 433 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1989)).', '-6-', 'B', 'Notice of Dismissal and an Opportunity to be Heard', 'Hernandez also argues that he should have been given notice of the hearing justice’s intent to dismiss his application or a continuance to provide him with the opportunity to respond to the proposed dismissal. Section 10-9.1-6(b) states the following:', '“When a court is satisfied, on the basis of the application, the', 'answer or motion, and the record, that the applicant is not entitled', 'to post conviction relief and no purpose would be served by any', 'further proceedings, it may indicate to the parties its intention to', 'dismiss the application and its reasons for so doing. The applicant', 'shall be given an opportunity to reply to the proposed dismissal. In', 'light of the reply, or on default thereof, the court may order the', 'application dismissed or grant leave to file an amended application', 'or direct that the proceedings otherwise continue. Disposition on', 'the pleadings and record is not proper if there exists a genuine', 'issue of material fact.” As this Court has recognized, § 10-9.1-6(b) “permits a trial justice to dismiss an application whenever, based upon the record, the application, and the answer, he finds that no genuine issue of material fact exists and the applicant is therefore not entitled to relief as a matter of law.” Palmigiano v. State, 120 R.I. 402, 404, 387 A.2d 1382, 1384 (1978).', '“Dismissal under § 10-9.1-6(b) is akin to a dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and is subject to the same standard.” Reyes, 141 A.3d at 652.', 'This Court has held that “a hearing justice is not obligated to conduct an evidentiary hearing in connection with an application for postconviction relief if there exists no genuine issue of material fact; however, the hearing justice must give the applicant an opportunity to reply to the hearing justice’s proposed dismissal of the application.” Perez v. State, 57 A.3d 677, 681 (R.I. 2013); see also Shatney, 755 A.2d at 135 (“The point in time at which a trial court may determine that a * * * petitioner’s claims are frivolous or meritless is after the petitioner has been', '-7- afforded a full, fair, and counselled opportunity to present those claims.”) (quoting Harris, 553 A.2d at 433).', 'In our opinion, Hernandez was not provided with an opportunity to reply to the hearing justice’s proposed dismissal of his application for postconviction relief. After the hearing justice granted counsel’s motion to withdraw, he afforded Hernandez the option to pursue his claims pro se, but forewarned him that he had determined that his claims were meritless. 4 After that preface, the hearing justice gave Hernandez an opportunity to respond as to whether he wished to continue to pursue his claims, to which Hernandez stated that he believed that it was “ludicrous” that he could be convicted of assault with the intent to commit murder when the weapon that he had used was a BB gun. After hearing this, the hearing justice stated that his claim was without merit, and summarily denied his application for postconviction relief.', 'By way of contrast, the hearing justice in Perez—after granting counsel’s motion to withdraw pursuant to Shatney—informed the applicant that the issues he had raised in his application had no merit. Perez, 57 A.3d at 681. Nonetheless, the hearing justice “generously allowed [the applicant] to file another memorandum if he wished to further pursue the matter[,]” cautioning the applicant that if he did not file a memorandum within ten days, his application would summarily be rejected. Id. Further, despite this admonition, the hearing justice granted a motion for an extension of time, giving the applicant almost an additional month to file the supplemental memorandum. Id. When the applicant still failed to file the memorandum by that time, the hearing justice provided an additional month after that extended deadline before 4', 'Before he asked Hernandez what he wished to do, the hearing justice first said, “I can tell you that the laundry list of claims that you make are meritous [sic].” After combing through each of Hernandez’s claims, the hearing justice continued, “Mr. Hernandez, if you want to pursue this thing alone, you can do so. But it is my intention, I’m giving you forewarning right now, I agree with the claims that have been set forth in the Shatney brief and the comments set forth a few minutes ago.”', '-8- entering an order denying and dismissing the application. Id. We held that the hearing justice had afforded the applicant an opportunity to respond to the proposed dismissal of his application for postconviction relief. Id. at 682; see also Reyes, 141 A.3d at 650-51 (hearing justice— proposing to dismiss application after granting counsel’s motion to withdraw—gave applicant approximately six weeks to submit a supplemental memorandum outlining why he was entitled to postconviction relief and also provided him with an opportunity to be heard again at the hearing on the state’s motion for summary dismissal of his application).', 'Although we have not drawn a bright line between what constitutes an opportunity to respond and what does not, our case law has stated that the opportunity to respond must be “meaningful[,]” regardless of the merits of the application.

93,Luigi Ricci : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. On August 29, 2016, Luigi Ricci petitioned this Court for the issuance of a writ of certiorari to review a June 13, 2014 judgment entered against him in Washington County Superior Court granting the state’s motion for summary judgment and denying Mr. Ricci’s application for postconviction relief. On October 14, 2016, this Court granted Mr. Ricci’s petition for a writ of certiorari.', 'Mr. Ricci contends before this Court that the hearing justice erred in granting the motion for summary judgment for the following reasons: (1) “ineffective assistance of counsel is a material fact;” (2) “claims of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be barred by res judicata;” (3) the hearing justice did not hold an evidentiary hearing, which Mr. Ricci contends he was entitled to given the severity of his sentence; (4) the hearing justice “utilized the ‘farce and mockery’ standard which was abolished by this Court;” (5) the hearing justice “utilized a higher standard of proof than the statute requires;” (6) “[t]he interest of justice requires that [Mr. Ricci] be permitted to assert the tardiness of the habitual offender notice as grounds for relief;” and', '-1- (7) “[t]he interest of justice requires that [Mr. Ricci] be permitted to assert the lack of consent to the amendment of the criminal indictment as grounds for relief.”', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this case should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments (both written and oral), we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided at this time.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On December 18, 2009, Mr. Ricci entered Francis Quinn’s home. Mr. Ricci knocked Mr. Quinn to the floor and put his hands around Mr. Quinn’s throat before taking approximately forty dollars from him and fleeing. Mr. Quinn recognized the assailant’s voice and identified him to the police as Mr. Ricci. On September 30, 2010, Mr. Ricci was found guilty by a jury on the following three counts: burglary, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-8-1; robbery in the first degree, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a)(3); and assault on a person over the age of sixty, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-10. Mr. Ricci was sentenced as follows: (1) on the first count, thirty years with twenty years to serve and ten years suspended with probation; (2) on the second count, thirty years with twenty years to serve and ten years suspended with probation; and (3) on the third count, ten years to serve. All sentences were to run concurrently. Additionally, at sentencing, Mr. Ricci was declared an habitual offender and was sentenced to fifteen years with at least ten years to serve before becoming eligible for parole, to run consecutively.', '-2-', 'Mr. Ricci appealed to this Court and contended on appeal that the trial justice committed reversible error in failing to adequately instruct the jury as to how to assess credibility, in failing to instruct the jury that a history of drug abuse could weaken credibility, and in denying Mr. Ricci’s motion for a new trial. This Court affirmed Mr. Ricci’s conviction in State v. Ricci, 54 A.3d 965 (R.I. 2012). In the course of relating the facts in that opinion, the Court made two observations in footnotes to which Mr. Ricci directs our attention in the instant case. The first of those footnotes is footnote 1, which reads as follows:', '“On [the assault count], the original indictment incorrectly charged', 'defendant with violating G.L. 1956 § 11-5-20, rather than § 11-5-', '10.

Subsequently, in footnote 2, this Court stated the following:', '“It appears from our review of the record that the Attorney General', 'did not present Ricci as a habitual offender either within forty-five', 'days of the arraignment or prior to the date of the first pretrial', 'conference, as required by the statute. However, this issue is not', 'before us on appeal.” Id. at 967 n.2.', 'On February 15, 2013, Mr. Ricci filed a pro se application for postconviction relief, in which he alleged: (1) that the indictment in his case was “improperly amended without [his] consent;” (2) that he was “improperly sentenced as an habitual offender because [he] was not presented as an habitual offender within forty-five days of arraignment or prior to the first pretrial conference;” and (3) that his “trial attorney was ineffective for failing to object to the amendment of the indictment, and for failing to object to the untimely habitual offender notice and sentence.”', 'Mr. Ricci was then provided with court-appointed counsel; that attorney subsequently filed a no-merit memorandum and a motion to withdraw pursuant to the dictates of', '-3- Shatney v.

That motion was granted, and Mr. Ricci thereafter engaged private counsel.', 'In March of 2014, Mr. Ricci’s private counsel submitted a “Post Conviction Relief Pre- Hearing Memorandum.” In that document, the above-summarized allegations were expanded to include the further allegations that Mr. Ricci’s trial counsel had been ineffective for: (1) his “failure to establish a sound theory of the case;” (2) his “failure to make effective and timely objections” concerning the prosecutor’s opening statement, the direct and re-direct testimony of Mr. Quinn, the testimony of Walter French,1 and the admission of the transcript of Mr. Quinn’s 911 call; (3) his “failure to effectively impeach the state’s key witness;” and (4) his “failure to make an effective final argument.”', 'On April 11, 2014, the state moved for summary judgment pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10- 9.1-6.2 A hearing on that motion took place on June 13, 2014 in Superior Court.

The hearing justice next noted that the burden of proof with respect to an application for postconviction relief was on the petitioner, Mr. Ricci. She then began her analysis by addressing the contention that the habitual offender notice was not filed at the appropriate time. She concluded that the notice was in fact timely and that, regardless, the doctrine of res judicata barred consideration of the argument because it could have been raised in Mr. Ricci’s direct appeal. With respect to the amendment of Mr. Ricci’s indictment, she determined that the statutory citation error in the indictment was not prejudicial to Mr. Ricci and, as such, was not an “error in form” as contemplated by Rule 7(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, which would have required his consent to amend the indictment. She further held that, in any event, that issue was similarly barred by the doctrine of res judicata.', 'The hearing justice also addressed the allegations of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. She noted that Mr. Ricci had the burden of demonstrating the existence of a genuine issue of material fact and that he could not rely on mere allegations, unsupported statements, and pleadings. She concluded that Mr. Ricci had not met that burden because he had presented “no affidavit or other evidence * * * that demonstrate[d] that [Mr. Ricci] was prejudiced inasmuch as the jury would have acquitted him had it not been for counsel’s alleged defective examinations, his inadequate final argument, and his failure to object at various times during the trial * * *.” She also noted that there was “overwhelming evidence” against Mr. Ricci.', 'Accordingly, on June 13, 2014, a judgment entered granting the state’s motion for summary judgment and denying Mr. Ricci’s application for postconviction relief. On August 29,', 'there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is', 'entitled to judgment as a matter of law.”', '-5- 2016, Mr. Ricci filed a petition for the issuance of a writ of certiorari for review of that judgment, which petition this Court subsequently granted.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We begin by noting that “[o]ur review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination of the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.” DeCurtis v.

State, 151 A.3d 314, 317 (R.I. 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted). In the instant case, the state moved for summary judgment pursuant to § 10-9.1-6.3 Under § 10-9.1-6(c), the hearing justice is tasked with examining the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, 3', 'We note that it is not clear from the state’s “Motion for Summary Judgment” whether it was moving for summary dismissal pursuant to § 10-9.1-6(b) or (c). See footnote 2, supra.

It is titled as a “Motion for Summary Judgment.” However, it also references Rule 12(b)(6) as the rule on which it is relying in moving to dismiss Mr. Ricci’s application. The hearing justice clearly couched her decision as a decision pursuant to subsection (c). Accordingly, we conduct our review of her decision pursuant to subsection (c).', '-6- admissions, agreements of fact, and affidavits submitted and determining only whether or not genuine issues of material fact exist; the hearing justice may not resolve those issues or “pass on the weight or credibility of the evidence.” Doyle v.

As such, a summary dismissal under § 10-9.1-6(c) “closely resembles” a grant of summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure and “[t]he standards for granting a § 10-9.1-6(c) [summary dismissal] motion are identical to those utilized in passing on a summary judgment motion.” Palmigiano v.

Just as in cases that deal with summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, our review in this case is de novo. See Adams v. Santander Bank, N.A., 183 A.3d 544, 547 (R.I. 2018).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Res Judicata', 'We begin our analysis of Mr. Ricci’s contentions by addressing his contention in his pro se application for postconviction relief that, in his original criminal case, notice that he would be deemed an habitual offender if convicted was filed outside the time frame provided for in G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21(b). We shall also address his argument, set forth in his application for postconviction relief, that the trial justice erred in permitting the amendment of his indictment', '-7- without his consent, which consent he alleges was required pursuant to Rule 7(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.4', 'However, we need not delve any further into the specific facts forming the basis of Mr. Ricci’s arguments in this portion of the opinion, due to our conclusion that his contentions were barred by the doctrine of res judicata and could not be raised in Mr. Ricci’s application for postconviction relief.', 'The doctrine of res judicata as applied to applications for postconviction relief is codified in § 10-9.1-8. Hall v. State, 60 A.3d 928, 931 (R.I. 2013); see also Ferrell v. Wall, 971 A.2d 615, 620 (R.I. 2009). That section provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“Any ground finally adjudicated or not so raised, or knowingly,', 'voluntarily and intelligently waived in the proceeding that resulted', 'in the conviction or sentence or in any other proceeding the', 'applicant has taken to secure relief, may not be the basis for a', 'subsequent application, unless the court finds that in the interest of', 'justice the applicant should be permitted to assert such a ground', 'for relief.” Section 10-9.1-8. Thus, the doctrine of res judicata “bars the relitigation of any issue that could have been litigated in a prior proceeding, including a direct appeal, that resulted in a final judgment between the same parties, or those in privity with them.” Hall, 60 A.3d at 932 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Lamoureux v. State, 93 A.3d 958, 962 (R.I. 2014); see also Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 457 (R.I. 2012); Bossian v. Anderson, 991 A.2d 1025, 1027 (R.I. 2010). It is clear that the same parties who were involved in Mr. Ricci’s direct appeal (viz., the state and Mr. Ricci) are involved in the instant application for postconviction relief. Additionally, Mr. Ricci’s direct appeal clearly resulted in a final judgment. And, most importantly, Mr. Ricci could have raised 4', 'Mr. Ricci further contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the allegedly untimely filing of the habitual offender notice and for failing to object to the amendment of the indictment. Those contentions are addressed in Part III.B, infra.', '-8- his contention with respect to the timeliness of the habitual offender notice in his direct appeal. He could also have raised at that time his contention that it was error for the trial justice to allow the amendment of his indictment without his consent. For those reasons, those contentions are barred from consideration before this Court.5', 'As § 10-9.1-8 states, there is an exception to the application of the doctrine of res judicata in postconviction relief cases when the Court finds that the contention should be considered “in the interest of justice.” Mr. Ricci argues, in his supplemental memorandum filed in accordance with Article I, Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, that that exception applies to this case. We have stated that “the interest of justice” exception “can be defined only upon a review of the facts in a particular case.” Ferrell, 971 A.2d at 621. After our thorough review of the record and the arguments presented to this Court, we simply cannot conceive of any reason—nor have we been directed to any reason other than with respect to the length of his sentence—that the “interest of justice” exception is applicable to this case.', 'Accordingly, in our judgment, Mr. Ricci’s contention that he received the habitual offender notice out of time and his contention that the trial justice erred in allowing the amendment of Mr. Ricci’s indictment are barred. 5', 'Mr. Ricci has raised in this case, with particular reference to the amendment to the indictment, the issue of whether or not a contention of ineffective assistance of counsel can be barred by the doctrine of res judicata. We need not address that issue. Mr. Ricci’s contention that the trial justice impermissibly permitted the amendment of his indictment, in his pro se application for postconviction relief, is barred by res judicata. With respect to his contention that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the amendment, he has failed to present any evidence to show a genuine issue of material fact. See Part III.B, infra.', '-9-', 'B', 'Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', 'It is well settled that we “pattern [our] evaluations of the ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the requirements of” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). Barros v. State, 180 A.3d 823, 828 (R.I. 2018) (internal quotation marks omitted). That standard consists of two prongs, and a defendant must satisfy both prongs. Id. at 829. First, an applicant for postconviction relief must prove that “counsel’s performance was deficient, to the point that the errors were so serious that trial counsel did not function at the level guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment;” counsel’s performance “must have fallen below an objective standard of reasonableness * * * considering all the circumstances.” Page v. State, 995 A.2d 934, 942 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'There is “a strong (albeit rebuttable) presumption * * * that counsel’s performance was competent” and that “counsel’s strategy and tactics fall within the range of reasonable professional assistance.” Barros, 180 A.3d at 829 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'To satisfy the second prong of the Strickland standard, an applicant must “demonstrate that the deficient performance was so prejudicial to the defense and the errors were so serious as to amount to a deprivation of the applicant’s right to a fair trial.” Page, 995 A.2d at 943 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Young v. State, 877 A.2d 625, 629 (R.I. 2005). Specifically, the second prong of Strickland “requires a showing that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.” Barros, 180 A.3d at 829 (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[It] is a ‘highly demanding and heavy burden.’” Id. (quoting Knight v. Spencer, 447 F.3d 6, 15 (1st Cir. 2006)).', '- 10 -', 'In his application for postconviction relief and his subsequent “Post Conviction Relief Pre-Hearing Memorandum,” Mr. Ricci raised numerous allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. It was his contention that his counsel was ineffective in the following ways: (1) “failing to object to the untimely habitual offender notice and sentence;” (2) “failing to object to the amendment of the indictment;” (3) failing to “establish a sound theory of the case;” (4) failing to “make effective and timely objections,” specifically as to the prosecutor’s mention of Mr. Ricci’s potential alibi witness during her opening statement, the prosecutor’s reading of a document to Mr. Quinn during his direct testimony, leading questions during the re-direct examination of Mr. Quinn, leading questions during the testimony of Walter French, and admission of the redacted transcript from Mr. Quinn’s 911 call; (5) failing to effectively impeach Mr. Quinn; (6) failing to make an effective closing argument; and (7) failing to “demand DNA testing for blood found at the scene of the crime.”6', 'Before this Court, Mr. Ricci contends that the hearing justice erred in granting summary judgment in the state’s favor on his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, he posits that “ineffective assistance of counsel is a material fact” because determinations of credibility cannot be made at the summary judgment stage. He cites to the following sentence in Randall v. State, 609 A.2d 949 (R.I. 1992), to support his contention: “Since a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel raises questions of fact, disposition of such a case by way of summary judgment is not possible.” Randall, 609 A.2d at 950. Finally, it is his contention that the hearing justice could not make credibility determinations without an evidentiary hearing. 6', 'The allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to the failure to demand DNA testing was first raised in Mr. Ricci’s June 6, 2014 “Addendum to the Memorandum of Law in Objection to Responden[t]’s Motion for Summary Judgment.”', '- 11 -', 'We must first address the Randall case on which Mr. Ricci relies. While Mr. Ricci accurately quotes from that opinion, we are of the view that the statement in that opinion to the effect that allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel raise issues of fact that cannot be disposed of by way of summary judgment is not a blanket statement intended to apply to every allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel.', 'We turn next to Mr. Ricci’s contention that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the allegedly untimely filing of the habitual offender notice. Section 12-19-21(b) states in pertinent part as follows:', '“Whenever it appears a person shall be deemed a ‘habitual', 'criminal,’ the attorney general, within forty-five (45) days of the', 'arraignment, but in no case later than the date of the pretrial', 'conference, may file with the court a notice specifying that the', 'defendant, upon conviction, is subject to the imposition of an', 'additional sentence in accordance with this section[.]”', 'In the instant case, Mr. Ricci was arraigned on April 8, 2010. The habitual offender notice was filed on June 21, 2010. Mr. Ricci contends that the first pretrial conference in the instant case occurred on May 17, 2010. However, the hearing justice stated that the May 17, 2010 pretrial conference was “vacated” and was conducted on June 21, 2010 instead. Our review of the record confirms the hearing justice’s statement. Thus, the habitual offender notice in the instant case was filed outside the forty-five day window provided for in the statute, but on the same day as the first pretrial conference. In State v. Peterson, 722 A.2d 259 (R.I. 1998), this Court held that an habitual offender notice filed outside the forty-five day window provided for in the statute but before the first pretrial conference was timely. Peterson, 722 A.2d at 263-64, 265. In that case, the arraignment took place on July 22. Id. at 263. The pretrial conference had been continued due to the defendant’s “difficult relationship with attorneys who were appointed to represent him” from September 2 (within the forty-five day window) to November 18 (outside', '- 12 - the window). Id. The habitual offender notice was filed on November 10, outside the forty-five day window. Id. We specifically stated in Peterson that “[t]he state should not be deprived of its statutory right to seek enhanced sentencing merely because a pretrial conference is continued.” Id. at 265. Given the existence of such a holding in our jurisprudence, it cannot be said that an attorney was ineffective for failing to raise an argument about a purported untimely filing of the habitual offender notice in this case. Accordingly, we perceive no reversible error by the hearing justice with respect to the issue of the ineffectiveness of trial counsel for failure to raise the timeliness of the habitual offender notice.', 'The next allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel to be addressed is Mr. Ricci’s contention that it was ineffective for his counsel to have failed to object to the amendment of his indictment. He contends that the amendment of his indictment required his consent and, as this Court noted in Ricci, 54 A.3d at 967 n.1, that consent was not given. Rule 7(e) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“At any time prior to verdict or finding, the court may with the', 'consent of the defendant permit the indictment to be amended to', 'correct an error in form or the description of the offense intended', 'to be charged or to charge a lesser included offense.” Meanwhile, Rule 7(c) states in pertinent part:', '“Error in the citation or its omission shall not be grounds for', 'dismissal of the indictment, information, or complaint or for', 'reversal of a conviction if the error or omission did not mislead the', 'defendant to the defendant’s prejudice.” As the hearing justice noted in the instant case, this Court reconciled those two rules in State v. Donato, 414 A.2d 797 (R.I. 1980). In that case, we were likewise confronted with an error as to a statutory citation in the indictment. Donato, 414 A.2d at 801. We held that “a nonprejudicial error in statutory citation simply * * * could not properly be deemed to be a Rule 7(e) ‘error in', '- 13 - form.’” Id. at 802. As such, it was our holding that in such circumstances the defendant’s consent was not required to correct such an error. Id. at 802-03. We went on to state that only if the error were prejudicial to the defendant would it be deemed an “error in form” under Rule 7(e) requiring the defendant’s consent to amend the indictment. Id. We held that the citation error in the indictment in that case was not prejudicial. Id. at 804.', 'The indictment in the instant case charged Mr. Ricci with “knowingly and willfully commit[ting] an assault and battery upon Francis Quinn, he being a person over Sixty (60) years of age, causing bodily injury, in violation of § 11-5-20 of the General Laws of Rhode Island * * *.” The citation in the indictment should have been to § 11-5-10 rather than § 11-5- 20. That error was certainly not prejudicial to Mr. Ricci, because it was clear what crime he was being charged with from the text of the indictment. See Donato, 414 A.2d at 804. The citation error was clearly of the de minimis variety. As such, Mr. Ricci’s consent was not required for the indictment to be amended. We perceive no error on the part of the hearing justice in finding that there was no evidence to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact concerning Mr. Ricci’s allegation that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the amendment of the indictment.', 'What is more, with respect to the remaining allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, our thorough review of the hearing justice’s decision indicates that, contrary to the assertion of Mr. Ricci, she did not make credibility determinations. Rather, it was her clear holding that Mr. Ricci had produced no evidence to indicate that any of the remaining allegedly ineffective actions or inactions by his trial counsel had resulted in any prejudice to him; specifically, she found that Mr. Ricci was relying on mere allegations and the fact that he was ultimately convicted. After our review of the record in this case, we are in agreement with the', '- 14 - hearing justice. See Page, 995 A.2d at 943 (discussing the second prong of the Strickland standard). Mr. Ricci has not produced any evidence to indicate that a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to whether, but for the allegedly ineffective actions or inactions of trial counsel, the result of his trial would have been different. See Barros, 180 A.3d at 829. The operative rules do not permit Mr. Ricci to rely solely on “mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, mere conclusions or mere legal opinions.”', 'Moura v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 90 A.3d 852, 856 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Coccoli v. Town of Scituate Town Council, 184 A.3d 1113, 1117-18 (R.I. 2018) (stating that “the burden is on the nonmoving party to produce competent evidence that prove[s] the existence of a disputed issue of material fact”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, we note that there was strong evidence of Mr. Ricci’s guilt, including the fact that Mr. Quinn identified Mr. Ricci as his attacker. Thus, given the fact that Mr. Ricci did not produce any evidence to show the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the second prong of the Strickland standard, the state was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the remaining allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. See § 10-9.1-6(c); see also Doyle, 122 R.I. at 593-94, 411 A.2d at 909.', 'Accordingly, we perceive no reversible error in the hearing justice’s grant of summary disposition as to the allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel in this case.', 'C', 'Other Issues Raised by Mr. Ricci', 'Mr. Ricci raises two additional contentions before this Court. He posits that he should have been given an evidentiary hearing on his application for postconviction relief due to the', '- 15 - length of his sentence. He further avers that the hearing justice inappropriately used “farce and mockery” language in assessing his application. We shall address these contentions in turn.', 'We first address Mr. Ricci’s contention that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing due to the severity of his sentence. This Court stated in Tassone v. State, 42 A.3d 1277 (R.I. 2012), that an evidentiary hearing is required in the first application for postconviction relief in any case in which the applicant was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. Tassone, 42 A.3d at 1287. Mr. Ricci has not been sentenced to life without the possibility of parole; and, therefore, Tassone is inapplicable. Additionally, we decline at this time to consider extending the holding in Tassone.', 'Mr. Ricci further argues that the hearing justice inappropriately used what Mr. Ricci characterizes as the “farce and mockery” standard when assessing his contentions that his trial counsel was ineffective. Specifically, the hearing justice stated as follows:', '“[A] Court deciding an actual ineffective assistance claim must', 'judge the reasonableness of counsel’s challenged conduct on the', 'facts of the particular case viewed as of the time of counsel’s', 'conduct. It is an extremely high standard that requires the', 'petitioner to demonstrate that representation made a farce or a', 'mockery out of the trial proceeding.” Mr. Ricci correctly states that this Court abrogated the “farce and mockery” language in Reyes v. State, 141 A.3d 644, 656 (R.I. 2016).7 We stated therein that “[h]enceforth, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel * * * shall continue to be decided by reference to the familiar performance and prejudice prongs of the Strickland standard.” Id. 7', 'We stated, in Reyes v. State, 141 A.3d 644 (R.I. 2016), that “the farce-and-mockery language * * * is a relic of a bygone era that has no place in assessing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel after Strickland.” Reyes, 141 A.3d at 656.', '- 16 -', 'We note initially that the Reyes opinion was issued on July 11, 2016, more than two years after the June 13, 2014 decision of the hearing justice in this case. What is more, after our intensive review of the hearing justice’s decision, it is clear to us that she also properly articulated the Strickland standard; and we are convinced that she utilized the appropriate standard in addressing Mr. Ricci’s allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. We point out as well that in Reyes “[w]e [did] not imply that the difference in phraseology between the performance and prejudice prongs of Strickland * * * and the farce-and-mockery language would necessarily make a difference in the adjudication of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim in any particular case; indeed, we suspect[ed] that such a difference would exist ‘only in the rarest case.’” Id. at 656 n.17 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 668).8', 'In conclusion, after an exhaustive review of the record in this case and careful consideration of the numerous issues raised by Mr. Ricci, we cannot perceive any reversible error in the granting of summary disposition in the state’s favor in this case.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. We remand the record to that tribunal. 8', 'Mr. Ricci makes an additional argument in his supplemental memorandum filed in accordance with Article I, Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure to the effect that the hearing justice should have employed a “satisfaction of the court” standard under § 10-9.1-6(b) in assessing Mr. Ricci’s application, whereas she instead asked Mr. Ricci’s counsel what evidence would be presented that would “definitively prove” that the result in his case would have been different but for the ineffectiveness of his counsel. There is no merit to this contention. The hearing justice was utilizing § 10-9.1-6(c), not subsection (b), and it is clear from perusal of her decision that she was not requiring definitive proof of a different outcome but rather some evidence to show that a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether or not the result of Mr. Ricci’s trial would have been different but for the alleged errors by trial counsel.', '- 17 - STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'Luigi Ricci v.

This case came before the Court on October 3, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'The defendant, James Oliveira, appeals from a Superior Court order that denied his motion to reduce a sentence, filed in accordance with Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. After a thorough review of the record and consideration of the parties’ arguments, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court denying defendant’s motion to reduce sentence.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The facts of the underlying case are set forth in detail in State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299 (R.I. 2008) (Oliveira I), and State v. Oliveira, 127 A.3d 65 (R.I. 2015) (Oliveira II). Accordingly, the Court recites only those facts relevant to this appeal.', 'On October 29, 2004, a grand jury indicted defendant on two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.1, for sexually assaulting his six-', '-1- year-old grandson by anal penetration. On September 19, 2006, a Superior Court jury convicted defendant on one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault and acquitted defendant on the second count. The trial justice sentenced defendant to sixty years’ imprisonment, with forty years to serve and the remainder suspended, with probation. This conviction was vacated on appeal, and the case was remanded for a new trial. Oliveira I, 961 A.2d at 319. At a second trial, before a different trial justice, defendant again was convicted on one count of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and this Court affirmed the conviction.

The defendant argued that it was improper for a second trial justice to depart from the original forty-year term to serve due to defendant’s disciplinary record at the Adult Correctional Institutions. The defendant also argued that the trial justice erred because, while he commented upon defendant’s disciplinary record, the trial justice failed to make clear “that [the record] was the reason why he imposed a life sentence.” The state disagreed, and argued in opposition to the motion to reduce that there was ample evidence in the record to support the trial justice’s sentencing decision, including conduct by defendant that occurred after the first conviction was vacated.', 'In denying defendant’s Rule 35 motion, the trial justice acknowledged that, although he “could have been more explicit in using * * * direct language” when departing from defendant’s first sentence and imposing a life sentence following his second conviction, this omission was 1', 'This is not defendant’s first conviction.

Furthermore, in the context of the second trial, which, again, was presided over by a different trial justice than the first trial, any suggestion of vindictiveness based on the successful appeal of the first conviction would be entirely speculative. See Texas v. McCullough, 475 U.S. 134, 139 (1986) (explaining that the possibility of vindictiveness is speculative where the second sentence is imposed by a different trial justice who has “no motivation to engage in self-vindication” (quoting Chaffin v.

95,State : v. : Victor Arciliares. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. After a 2012 trial in Providence County Superior Court, a jury found the defendant, Victor Arciliares (Arciliares or defendant), guilty of one count of second-degree murder and one count of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence.1 The defendant timely appealed to this Court, but ultimately filed a motion to remand the matter to the Superior Court for a new trial in light of newly discovered evidence. This Court granted the defendant’s unopposed motion. While on remand, the defendant filed supplemental memoranda contending that he was entitled to a new trial because the trial justice’s jury instructions regarding involuntary manslaughter were improper in light of this Court’s opinion in State v. Diaz, 46 A.3d 849 (R.I. 2012). The trial justice granted the defendant’s motion for a new trial on that ground, and we granted the state’s petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of that decision. The state argues that the defendant’s motion for a new trial based on the issue of the propriety of the trial justice’s jury instructions was procedurally improper and that, even if the trial justice did not err in hearing the motion, he nevertheless erred in granting it because Diaz did not set forth a new rule of law and the defendant failed to preserve this issue at trial. For the reasons set forth herein, we quash the order of the Superior Court. 1', 'These were counts 1 and 4 of the indictment, respectively.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 28, 2010, a grand jury indicted defendant on two counts of second-degree murder (counts 1 and 3), in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1;2 one count of carrying a pistol without a license (count 2), in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-8(a); and one count of discharging a firearm while committing a crime of violence (count 4), in violation of § 11-47-3.2(b)(3).3 A jury found defendant guilty of counts 1 and 4. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial following the jury verdict, and he sentenced defendant to a term of forty-five years imprisonment on count 1 and a consecutive life sentence on count 4.', 'On July 3, 2012, defendant timely appealed his convictions to this Court. Subsequently, on June 17, 2013, prior to filing his brief-in-chief,4 defendant moved to remand the case to the Superior Court so that he might file a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The state did not object to this motion. This Court granted defendant’s motion on September 16, 2013, remanding the case and holding the appeal in abeyance pending the disposition of defendant’s Rule 33 motion. On April 15, 2014,5 in Superior Court, defendant filed his motion for a new trial and corresponding memorandum in support of the motion, alleging that newly discovered evidence and violations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), entitled him to a new trial. The state filed its objection to the motion for a new trial. Thereafter, defendant filed supplemental 2', 'It appears from the record that counts 1 and 3, both charging defendant with second-degree murder, were based upon separate and distinct theories—felony murder and murder committed with a reckless indifference to human life. 3', 'Prior to the start of trial, the state dismissed counts 2 and 3. 4', 'Defendant filed his brief-in-chief on August 1, 2013. 5', 'A review of the record does not indicate a reason for the delay between this Court’s remand order and defendant’s filing of his motion in Superior Court; rather, there appears to have been no activity during that seven-month period.', '-2- memoranda on August 4, 2015, December 22, 2015, and February 23, 2016. In his second and third supplemental memoranda, defendant proffered a new argument in support of his motion for a new trial, contending that the trial justice had erred in instructing the jury as to involuntary manslaughter. In support of his new position, defendant averred that Diaz created a new rule of law requiring that the trial justice’s jury charge for involuntary manslaughter contain a reference to “criminal negligence.”', 'The defendant reasoned that, because the trial justice’s jury instructions at defendant’s trial lacked such language, and in fact contained nearly identical language to that used in the trial in Diaz,6 he was entitled to a new trial.7', 'On February 29, 2016, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion for new trial on those grounds, and the state filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with this Court.

96,In re B.H. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The respondent, B.H., appeals from a Family Court order requiring him to register as a sex offender, and denying his motion to waive sex-offender registration and notification pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-37.1-4(j).1 This matter came before the Supreme Court on September 25, 2018, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After considering the arguments set forth in the parties’ memoranda and at oral argument, we are convinced that cause has not been shown. Thus, further argument or briefing is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons outlined below, the Family Court’s order is affirmed.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The pertinent facts of this case may be found in our opinion in the case of In re B.H., 138 A.3d 774 (R.I. 2016), in which respondent had appealed from Family Court adjudications of 1', 'While not addressed by either party, we note that G.L. 1956 § 11-37.1-4, entitled, “Duration of registration—Frequency of registration[,]” concerns only the duration and frequency of registration, while § 11-37.1-3, entitled “Registration required—Persons covered[,]” sets out individuals who are required to register as sex offenders. It is quite plausible that § 11-37.1-4(j) does not give the trial justice discretion to waive the registration requirement for juveniles in toto, but only to determine the duration of registration for “as long as the court deems it appropriate to protect the community and to rehabilitate the juvenile offender.” However, in light of our opinion in this case, we need not reach this issue at this time.', '-1- delinquency with respect to two charges of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. We determined in that appeal that the state had not proven the requisite element of penetration to substantiate two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault. In re B.H., 138 A.3d at 783. However, in doing so, we held that, because the trial justice had made an explicit finding that there was contact for the purpose of sexual gratification, respondent was responsible for the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation sexual assault.2 Id. at 785, 786. We remanded the case to the Family Court “with directions to enter adjudications of delinquency on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation and for resentencing.” Id. at 787.', 'At the hearing on remand, which took place on August 17, 2016, respondent pressed his motion to waive sex-offender registration and notification that he had filed prior to that hearing, arguing that he should only be required to register as a sex offender until his nineteenth birthday, which was one week after the hearing date. In support of his motion to waive sex-offender registration, respondent contended that the conduct that formed the basis of the adjudications of delinquency on the two counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault was criminal only because the victims, Kevin and Henry,3 were under the age of fourteen at the time of the incident, and thus the trial justice had the discretion to waive sex-offender registration under § 11-37.1-4(j). The respondent argued that, had the two youths been sixteen years old rather than eleven years old, no charges would have been brought against respondent. In response, the state argued that the trial justice had no discretion in this case because respondent had used 2', '“A person is guilty of a second-degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual contact with another person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” General Laws 1956 § 11-37-8.3. 3', 'We use fictitious names to protect the privacy of the victims, who were eleven years old at the time of the conduct.', '-2- threats, manipulation, and coercion against the victims, which made his conduct criminal apart from the ages of the victims.', 'With regard to the trial justice’s discretion, respondent argued that he had been fully compliant with all previous court orders regarding registration and therapy. The respondent based his argument in support of a waiver in part on reports from David W. Ingle, Psy.D., a licensed clinical psychologist, and Leo D. Keating, a licensed clinical social worker, both of whom indicated that respondent posed little risk to the community for sexual misconduct. The respondent pointed out that Dr. Ingle, who has had extensive experience in treating adult and juvenile offenders, specifically indicated that he could not diagnose respondent with pedophilia due to his age and the various statistical analyses that were performed. According to respondent, Dr. Ingle’s assessment was supported by Mr. Keating, who performed both a Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III4 and an Abel Assessment of Sexual Interest-3,5 in addition to reviewing redacted Cranston police statements, probation records, and the sentencing report.', 'The state argued that Dr. Ingle and Mr. Keating had based their assessments purely on respondent’s account of the events, and that, therefore, the assessments themselves were suspect. According to the state, respondent had not accepted responsibility for his actions and had not been fully rehabilitated. The state further argued that, in the five years since the incident, 4', '“The primary intent of the [The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-III] is to provide information to clinicians * * * who must make assessments and treatment decisions about persons with emotional and interpersonal difficulties.” The Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory- III (MCMI-III) (2009) with new norms and updated scoring, THE MILLON PERSONALITY GROUP, https://www.millonpersonality.com/inventories/MCMI-III/ (last visited Oct. 15, 2018). 5', '“The [Abel Assessment of Sexual Interest]-3 can be used with adult men and women with sexual behavior problems.

Additionally, the state faulted Dr. Ingle for not performing a juvenile-sex-offender protocol evaluation as part of his assessment of respondent due to Dr. Ingle’s belief that the evaluation was not reliable.6', 'Ultimately, the trial justice committed respondent to the Rhode Island Training School for Youth, but suspended the commitment; respondent was placed on probation until further order of the court.7 The court also required respondent to register as a sex offender.8 In finding that she had no discretion under § 11-37.1-4(j) in this case, the trial justice contrasted respondent’s case with what she termed a “Romeo and Juliet type of situation”:9', '“where two kids who were perhaps thirteen years old, engage in', 'sexual contact that is consensual. And, that under that scenario,', 'sometimes the girl’s parents might find out. They are outraged.', 'They call the police. They have the boyfriend charged. The', 'boyfriend is charged with first degree child molestation because of', 'the age of the victim in that matter. And then the [c]ourt will have', 'the ability at that time, if the [r]espondent is adjudicated, to look at', 'the statute and look at the ages of the parties and say, well due to', 'the age and the consent between the parties, this [c]ourt finds that', 'the [r]espondent is not a danger to the public and will suspend the', 'obligation to register as a sex offender.”10', 'In so stating, the trial justice found that there was a clear lack of consent to the sexual contact in this case; she pointed out that the victims were coerced by respondent, an older friend, who told them it was merely “an experiment to find out if you are gay.” Additionally, the trial 6', 'According to the state, the “juvenile sex offender protocol” is an assessment that the Rhode Island Family Court often relies upon to measure a juvenile’s risk of committing sexual offenses in the future. 7', 'By law, the sentence of incarceration and probation ended on respondent’s nineteenth birthday. See G.L. 1956 § 14-1-7.3. 8', 'Section 11-37.1-4(j) requires a juvenile offender to register as a sex offender for fifteen years. 9', 'Romeo and Juliet is a classic Shakespearian tragedy about two adolescent lovers caught in the middle of their families’ blood feud. 10', 'The trial justice went on to state: “under that scenario that the [c]ourt just imagined, there was consent; there was the closeness in age between the [r]espondent and the victim in that matter.”', '-4- justice found that there was no curiosity-motivated sexual play by the two young victims, with the only mention of homosexuality coming from respondent himself. The trial justice also highlighted the fact that respondent was nearly fourteen years old at the time of the incident, while Kevin and Henry had not yet reached puberty. Moreover, she found that, while the respondent was also young at the time and sexually curious, most adolescents do not experiment with younger persons in a coercive and manipulative manner.', 'Furthermore, the trial justice stated that, even if she had discretion under § 11-37.1-4(j) in the present case, she would not have exercised that discretion. The trial justice based that determination on her finding that respondent was an untreated sexual offender who had not accepted responsibility for his actions. She agreed with the state that Dr. Ingle and Mr. Keating had relied in their assessments upon respondent’s own account of the events. Finally, she contrasted what she found to be respondent’s lack of accountability for his actions with the fact that the victims were “horrified over the entire experience[,]” finding that this case did not fit the factual situation necessary for her to exercise discretion. An order entered imposing sentence and denying respondent’s motion to waive sex-offender registration.

(quoting Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1226 (R.I. 1996)). If, however, the language of a statute is ambiguous, this Court turns to “our well-established maxims of statutory construction in an effort to glean the intent of the Legislature.”11 Town of Warren v. Bristol Warren Regional School District, 159 A.3d 1029, 1039 (R.I. 2017) (quoting Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069, 1078 (R.I. 2013)). “[T]he Legislature is presumed to have intended each word or provision of a statute to express a significant meaning, and the [C]ourt will give effect to every word, clause, or sentence, whenever possible.” State v.

Finally, we give great respect and deference to the factual determinations of a trial justice. State v. Erminelli, 991 A.2d 1064, 1069 (R.I. 2010).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'In this appeal, respondent argues that: (1) the words of the statute, § 11-37.1-4(j), “the conduct of the parties is criminal only because of the age of the victim,” plainly apply to his case; and (2) the trial justice should have exercised the discretion granted to her by § 11-37.1-4(j) to waive sexual-offender registration.', 'Prior to 2000, § 11-37.1-4, entitled, “Duration of registration—Frequency of registration[,]” did not contain a specific provision regarding the duty of juveniles to register as sex offenders. Instead, the statute set forth the procedure for registration by any person required 11', 'In their Rule 12A statements to this Court, both parties submit that the language contained in § 11-37.1-4(j) is not ambiguous.', '-6- to register as a sex offender under § 11-37.1-3.12 In 2000, the Legislature added subsection (j) to § 11-37.1-4, promulgating sex-offender registration requirements for juveniles in particular. Seemingly to combat the harsh results that might follow from requiring juveniles to register as sex offenders in some cases, the Legislature also saw fit to give the Family Court certain judicial discretion. To this end, § 11-37.1-4(j) provides, in relevant part:', '“[I]f a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent under [G.L. 1956]', '§[§] 11-37-8.1 or 11-37-8.3, the court shall assess the totality of', 'the circumstances of the offense and if the court makes a finding', 'that the conduct of the parties is criminal only because of the age', 'of the victim, the court may have discretion to order the juvenile to', 'register as a sex offender as long as the court deems it appropriate', 'to protect the community and to rehabilitate the juvenile offender.”', 'This provision contains a clear two-step analysis: (1) the trial justice must assess the particular circumstances of the case to determine whether the conduct of the juvenile respondent was criminal only because the victim was fourteen years of age or under; and (2) if the trial justice determines that to be the case, she may require registration for only as long as it is necessary to protect the community and to rehabilitate the juvenile. It is the first part of this analysis that this Court is called upon to interpret in the present case.', 'In his Rule 12A statement to this Court, respondent claims that the statutory language “conduct of the parties is criminal only because of the age of the victim” applies here because, if the victims were over the age of fourteen, respondent would not have been guilty of second- degree child molestation sexual assault. Therefore, he contends that the trial justice had discretion under § 11-37.1-4(j) in this case. This argument misses the mark. Both §§ 11-37-8.1 and 11-37-8.3 (first-degree and second-degree child molestation sexual assault) require proof 12', 'Currently, persons required to register under § 11-37.1-3 include: “Any person who, in this or any other jurisdiction: (1) has been convicted of a criminal offense against a victim who is a minor, (2) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense, (3) has been determined to be a sexually violent predator * * *.”', '-7- that the victim was fourteen years of age or under at the time of the incident. Thus, every case of first-degree and second-degree child molestation sexual assault is essentially “criminal only because of the age of the victim.” A plain reading of § 11-37.1-4(j) reveals that the Legislature did not extend judicial discretion to every case in which a juvenile is adjudicated delinquent of first-degree or second-degree child molestation sexual assault. Rather, the Legislature limited the discretion to those cases where, under “the totality of the circumstances[,]” the victim’s age is the only reason to find that the respondent’s conduct was criminal.13', 'Here, it is clear from the record that the trial justice based her determination that § 11-37.1-4(j) did not give her discretion in the instant matter on her finding that “factually this case does not fit into the criteria required for the [c]ourt to exercise discretion[.]” While she pointed to no specific criminal statute, she found as fact that this was not a case of willing sexual exploration between curious adolescents, as in her “Romeo and Juliet” example.', 'To the contrary, she found “that there was coercion, there was manipulation and there was, in fact, the abuse of trust.” In the trial justice’s estimation, this coercion made the conduct at issue criminal, apart from the ages of the victims.', 'We agree with the trial justice’s interpretation of § 11-37.1-4(j), and we conclude that she appropriately applied the plain language of the statute in determining that she had no discretion in the present case. Any other reading would essentially rewrite the statute—a task this Court is not at liberty to perform. See State v. Calise, 478 A.2d 198, 201 (R.I. 1984) (holding that the Court has “neither the authority nor the competence to rewrite” a statutory definition). Under a 13', '“[W]e are [also] mindful of the oft-quoted maxim ‘expressio unius est exclusio alterius,’ (‘the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another’).” Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 75 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 1830 (9th ed. 2009)). In § 11-37.1-4(j), the Legislature, referring to subsections (b) and (c), has required automatic sex-offender registration for juveniles adjudicated delinquent as sexually violent predators, as well as recidivists and aggravated crime offenders, without allowing for judicial discretion.', '-8- plain reading of § 11-37.1-4(j), once a trial justice finds the existence of some conduct under the facts of the particular case that would be considered criminal, beyond the age of the victim, the inquiry is at an end, and the respondent is required to register as a sex offender.', 'Because we hold that the trial justice did not have discretion in this case under § 11-37.1-4(j), we leave for another day the determination of which factors a Family Court trial justice should properly consider when exercising his or her discretion under the second part of the § 11-37.1-4(j) analysis.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree and order of the Family Court, and remand the papers to that tribunal.', '-9- STATE OF RHODE ISLAND AND', 'PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS', 'SUPREME COURT – CLERK’S OFFICE', 'OPINION COVER SHEET Title of Case', 'In re B.H.', 'No. 2016-322-Appeal.

97,State : v. : Ricardo Romero. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. After a trial in Providence County Superior Court, a jury found the defendant, Ricardo Romero (Romero or defendant), guilty of three counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-8.3 and 11- 37-8.4. On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice improperly admitted testimony regarding previous restraining orders against defendant and erred in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. On September 25, 2018, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the parties’ arguments and reviewing the memoranda submitted by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, further briefing or argument is not required to decide this matter. For the reasons explained herein, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', '1', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On December 18, 2013, the state charged defendant by indictment with two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault and one count of second-degree child molestation sexual assault for acts alleged to have been committed against the victim, Mary,1 then six years old.2 Mary is the daughter of defendant’s then-girlfriend, Joann, and, at the time of the alleged incidents, Mary and Joann lived together in a small, two-bedroom apartment. In August 2012, Joann began dating defendant and he occasionally stayed overnight at the apartment.', 'According to the testimony at trial, on or about February 8, 2013, defendant spent the night at the apartment.', 'Joann testified that she was aware that defendant got up from the bed two or three times during the night. Joann further testified that, when she asked defendant “if he was okay and why he kept getting up[,]” he became defensive and agitated; Joann found defendant’s reaction to be odd. Joann testified that, the next day, she asked Mary if defendant had gone into her room the night before and that Mary had responded in the affirmative. That same day, Joann called defendant and confronted him about his having gone into Mary’s room the previous night. Joann testified that defendant became defensive and confirmed that he had been in Mary’s bedroom, but he stated that he had “always” checked on Mary. However, Joann testified that this upset her because that was not true and defendant “ha[d] no reason to be in [her] daughter’s room.” After the phone call with defendant, Joann asked her sister to attempt to elicit more information from Mary concerning defendant’s presence in her bedroom the night 1', 'Throughout this opinion, we use pseudonyms to identify the complaining witness and her mother. 2', 'During the course of trial, counsel for both sides, as well as the trial justice, refer to Mary as a six-year-old, as do we. However, the record reveals that Mary had, in fact, recently turned seven years old at the time of the alleged sexual assaults.', '2 before. Joann’s sister took Mary out to eat; when the two returned, Joann’s sister reported that Mary told her that defendant had “rubbed her butt.”', 'According to Joann, later in the day on February 9, 2013, defendant arrived at the apartment unannounced.', 'While there, defendant warned Joann, in what she characterized as a “very aggressive” manner, to “keep [her] windows locked.” That same day, Joann called the police. When the police arrived, they spoke with Joann and then took Joann and Mary to Hasbro Children’s Hospital. Mary was interviewed at a later date by the Child Advocacy Center. Defendant was arrested and the grand jury returned an indictment charging defendant with three counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault on December 18, 2013.', 'Mary, who was ten years old at the time of trial, testified as to three separate times— comprising the three separate counts of the indictment—that defendant entered her bedroom on the night in question. Mary testified that defendant came into her bedroom while she was sleeping and pulled down her pants and underwear; Mary then felt a fingernail and a finger go inside her buttocks. Mary then testified that defendant again “did something bad” to her. According to Mary, she heard someone stomping in her room and remembers feeling something wet on her buttocks. Mary testified that defendant again pulled down her pants and underwear; she testified that, when she tried to move toward the wall, defendant grabbed her on the stomach. According to Mary, “[i]t was kind of in, but not that much”; she testified that defendant was moving a little and she knew it was in her buttocks because it “hurted” her. Finally, Mary testified that the final time defendant entered her bedroom she felt a hand, fingers, and fingernails squeeze her buttocks.', 'The state also called Joann as a witness. Defense counsel, during his cross-examination of Joann, attempted to elicit a motive for the accusations against defendant. In that inquiry,', '3 defense counsel asked Joann if she desired to have children with defendant, if she was aware that defendant had five children, and if she knew that defendant had previously had a vasectomy. During this line of questioning, Joann denied wanting to have children with defendant, confirmed knowledge of the fact that he had had a vasectomy, and further stated that defendant was “not able to see” his children. The state’s redirect examination of Joann on the topic of defendant not being able to see his children, discussed in more detail below, is at issue in this appeal.', 'At the conclusion of two days of trial, the jury found defendant guilty of the lesser- included offense of second-degree child molestation sexual assault on the first two counts, and also guilty of second-degree child molestation sexual assault on the third count. Thereafter, defendant moved for a new trial, arguing that the trial testimony lacked any indication of the necessary element of sexual gratification as to all three counts of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. Moreover, defendant averred that Mary’s testimony indicating that there were two instances of penetration, particularly in light of the jury’s finding of not guilty on the two counts of first-degree child molestation sexual assault, precluded a finding of guilty on the lesser-included offense of second-degree child molestation sexual assault. Ultimately, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial and sentenced defendant to three concurrent twenty-year terms of imprisonment, with seven years to serve and the remainder of the sentences suspended, with probation. Defendant timely appealed to this Court, arguing that the trial justice erred: (1) in overruling defendant’s objection to Mary’s testimony about existing restraining orders that prevented defendant from seeing his children and failing to strike that portion of Joann’s testimony; and (2) in denying his motion for a new trial.', '4', 'II', 'Standards of Review', 'A', 'Admission of Testimony Regarding Prior Restraining Orders', '“Evidentiary rulings * * * are reviewed for abuse of discretion.” State v.

(quoting State v. Lake, 90 A.3d 186, 193 (R.I. 2015)).', '6', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Admission of Testimony Regarding Prior Restraining Orders', 'Defendant first asserts that the trial justice erred in allowing certain portions of Joann’s testimony concerning the existence of restraining orders that prevented defendant from seeing his children from another relationship. Specifically, defendant contends that the trial justice’s failure to respond to the objection or to strike Joann’s testimony allowed the jury to “speculate on why such an order had been necessary and what behavior it was intended to forestall.” The following exchange occurred during the state’s redirect examination of Joann:', '“[THE STATE:]', 'Defense counsel asked you about', 'wanting to have a child with the', 'defendant.

Accordingly, failure to make a specific objection—or any objection—will trigger the longstanding “raise-or-waive” rule. The record reveals that defense counsel did not object to the state’s question to Joann confirming her prior testimony on cross-examination as to her knowledge regarding whether defendant could see his children, and defense counsel similarly did not object or move to strike after Joann answered that defendant “has restraining orders.” Instead, defense counsel made a blanket objection to the state’s question, “Why is that?” The defendant never articulated a specific reason for the objection, and likewise did not specify which part of Joann’s testimony he believed should be stricken from the record. Moreover, defendant did not request a limiting instruction or move for a mistrial at any point during the questioning or thereafter. For these reasons, the “raise-or-waive” rule precludes defendant from raising the issue of the admission of Joann’s testimony—that defendant “has restraining orders”—into evidence at trial.', 'Even if defendant had properly preserved this issue on appeal through a timely and specific objection, the record reveals that defense counsel opened the door to the state’s inquiry on the topic during his cross-examination of Joann. Notably, during the cross-examination, defense counsel asked Joann if she was aware that defendant had had a vasectomy. Moreover, defense counsel asked Joann whether she was aware that defendant had five children of his own. In response, Joann testified that she knew defendant had five children and that “he can’t see', '8 them.” Accordingly, even if a proper objection to the testimony had been raised, it would not have been an abuse of discretion to allow Joann’s testimony on this issue because defendant opened the door during his cross-examination of Joann. See Virola, 115 A.3d at 997 (holding that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in overruling the defendant’s objection, because the defendant opened the door during cross-examination of the witness).', 'B', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant also appeals the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new trial. Specifically, defendant posits that the trial justice abused his discretion because the jury finding defendant “guilty of second degree assaults instead of first degree assaults as charged was an insufficient response to testimony that was essentially vague and incredible.”', 'Moreover, defendant maintains that the trial justice’s analysis regarding Mary’s testimony was “entirely conclusory.”', 'As we have noted, “when ruling on a motion for a new trial, the ‘record should reflect a few sentences of the justice’s reasoning on each point.’” Virola, 115 A.3d at 991 (quoting State v. Rosario, 35 A.3d 938, 947 (R.I. 2012)). In denying defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice thoroughly explained his reasoning and rationale. He first reviewed the language of his jury instructions, which included the admonition to the jury that the state was required to prove that defendant engaged in the alleged activity “for the specific purpose of achieving sexual gratification or arousal[.]” He concluded that defendant’s actions were for the purpose of arousal, “irrespective of whether it was also for sexual gratification.” The trial justice then addressed Mary’s testimony and acknowledged that certain aspects were not as clear on cross- examination as they were on direct regarding the “penetration element.” However, the trial', '9 justice also noted that the victim was testifying as a fourth-grader to events that transpired when she was merely six years old and in the first grade. Additionally, the trial justice explained that Mary’s testimony, in his view, was “unembellished, unvarnished, and, in a word, credible, to the point of the sexual misconduct.” Finally, the trial justice expressed his agreement with the jury’s verdict and their decision to render guilty verdicts on the first two counts of the indictment for second-degree child molestation sexual assault, rather than first-degree child molestation sexual assault as charged, due to the lack of sufficiently explicit testimony on the issue of penetration. The trial justice specifically found it clear that “the jury gave careful attention to all the evidence. They deliberated several hours, they asked pertinent questions * * *. It is clear * * * that these jurors did not rush to judgment.” For these reasons, we accept the credibility determinations of the trial justice, and we see no reason to disrupt his decision denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.
