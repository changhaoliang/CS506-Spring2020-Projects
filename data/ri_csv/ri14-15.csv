These consolidated cases come before this Court on appeal from a decision of the Providence County Superior Court, which contained three distinct holdings. First, the Superior Court granted the Central Falls Receiver’s1 motion for partial 1', 'There were several individuals who served as Receiver for the City of Central Falls during the period of time preceding the filing of these cases and during the pendency of the cases. We shall simply make a generic reference to “the Receiver.” On November 14, 2013, by order of this Court, Allan M. Shine, Esq. (the Trustee) was substituted as Appellee in the place of the Receiver in all three of the cases consolidated in the present action.', 'According to the “Memorandum in Support of Assented to Motion to Change Name of Appellee,” on August 1, 2011, the Receiver for Central Falls filed for bankruptcy. The United States Bankruptcy Court confirmed a “Fourth Amended Plan for the Adjustment of Debts of the City of Central Falls, Rhode Island” (the Plan). The Plan became effective on October 22, 2012. Pursuant to the terms of Article IV, Section S of the Plan, all claims against elected officials of the City of Central Falls were transferred into a trust, and Mr. Shine was appointed as Trustee, thus beginning his involvement in these cases. Mr. Shine, in his official capacity, is the only Appellee in the Supreme Court cases numbered 2013-247 and 2013-249. However, the Appellees in Supreme Court case number 2013-248 are Mr. Shine, in his official capacity; Rosemary Booth Gallogly, in her capacity as Director of the Department of Revenue; James', '-1- summary judgment, holding that the Receiver, who was appointed to Central Falls pursuant to the terms of G.L. 1956 chapter 9 of title 45 (the Financial Stability Act or the Act), was entitled to reimbursement for his attorneys’ fees; the Superior Court determined that such reimbursement was to be provided by the Central Falls Mayor Charles Moreau (the Mayor),2 in his individual capacity, and the members of the City Council for the City of Central Falls (the City Council) (collectively the Appellants),3 in their individual capacities. The Superior Court, consequently, denied the counter-motion for summary judgment filed by the Appellants on the same issue. The Superior Court’s second holding was to determine that the Mayor was not entitled to indemnification from the Receiver for “all losses, costs, expenses, and damages—including Diossa, in his capacity as a member of the City Council for the City of Central Falls; and Richard Licht, in his capacity as Director of the Department of Administration. 2', 'We note that Mr. Moreau was recently released from federal prison after serving a sentence for accepting a bribe in an unrelated matter.

However, this fact has no bearing on our legal analysis. 3', 'In Supreme Court case number 2013-248, the Appellants are Mayor Charles Moreau, in his official capacity as Mayor of the City of Central Falls and individually; the City Council for the City of Central Falls; William Benson, Jr., in his capacity as a member of the City Council for the City of Central Falls; Richard Aubin, Jr., in his capacity as a member of the City Council for the City of Central Falls; Eunice DeLaHoz, in her capacity as a member of the City Council for the City of Central Falls; and Patrick J.

Lastly, the Superior Court denied a “Motion for Advance Attorney’s Fees” filed by Attorney Lawrence L. Goldberg.', 'On appeal, Appellants contend that the hearing justice’s decision was in error for the following reasons: (1) in granting the Receiver’s motion for partial summary judgment with respect to reimbursement of the Receiver’s attorneys’ fees, the hearing justice misapplied the statute at issue, § 45-9-11, and failed to recognize that Appellants were immune under the Anti- SLAPP Act, as codified in G.L. 1956 chapter 33 of title 9, and the “Noerr-Pennington doctrine;”4 (2) in denying Appellants’ partial motion for summary judgment seeking indemnification for the Mayor, the hearing justice erred in concluding that the Mayor was not acting in his official capacity and was, therefore, not entitled to indemnification for his legal costs under G.L. 1956 § 45-15-16 and, as currently codified, Central Falls Code of Ordinances, Chap. 2, Art. III, Div. 3, § 2-108 (the City Ordinance); and (3) in denying Attorney Goldberg’s motion for advance of attorneys’ fees, the hearing justice erred because Attorney Goldberg was properly retained by the City Council to represent it in the suit regarding the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act and, thus, was entitled to remuneration.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we reverse the Superior Court’s judgment in all respects. 4', 'The “Noerr-Pennington doctrine” has been defined as “[t]he principle that the First Amendment shields from liability * * * companies that join together to lobby the government.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1209 (10th ed. 2014).

The Receiver proceeded, quite properly, to invoke the Financial Stability Act so as to assume the function and duties of the Mayor. Id. at 572. Subsequently, the City Council passed a resolution authorizing the hiring of an attorney to provide the City Council with advice and guidance. Id. The next day the Receiver rescinded that resolution. Id. The City Council then passed a resolution which authorized the engagement of legal counsel to file a court action challenging the constitutionality of portions of the Financial Stability Act. Id. The Receiver also rescinded that resolution and sent the City Council a letter which stated that, with respect to the issue of the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act, the City Council was ordered to serve only in an advisory capacity. Id. Then, on September 23, 2010, the Receiver filed a verified complaint in the Superior Court for Providence County seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the Mayor and the City Council. Id. at 573. The Mayor and the City Council reacted by filing, on September 27, 2010, their own cause of action in Superior Court. Id. The cases were consolidated in the Superior Court, and it is in those consolidated cases that this Court ultimately opined that the Financial Stability Act was constitutional. Id.', 'After we handed down our ruling on the Act’s constitutionality, there remained several claims yet to be adjudicated. It is the Superior Court’s rulings as to those claims which are before this Court in the present appeal. See Flanders v. Moreau, Nos. PB 10-5615, PB 10-5672, PB 10-7394, slip op. (R.I. Super. July 22, 2011). As we have indicated, the pertinent remaining claims include a claim by the Receiver for reimbursement of his attorneys’ fees pursuant to § 45- 9-11 and a claim by the Appellants seeking indemnification for the Mayor’s “losses, costs, expenses, and damages—including attorney’s fees and court costs” pursuant to § 45-15-16 and', '-5- the City Ordinance. Additionally, there remains the issue of Attorney Goldberg’s attorneys’ fees.', 'B', 'Motions Before the Superior Court', 'The Superior Court, in the case at bar, was presented with the following filings: (1) the Receiver’s motion for summary judgment seeking reimbursement of his attorneys’ fees and the Appellants’ objection thereto as well as their counter-motion for summary judgment; (2) the motion for summary judgment filed by the Mayor seeking indemnification and the Receiver’s counter-motion for summary judgment with respect to that same claim; and (3) a “Motion for Advance Attorney’s Fees” for Attorney Goldberg and the Receiver’s objection to that motion. We shall discuss the Superior Court’s decision on each motion in turn.', 'C', 'The Superior Court Decision', '1. Reimbursement of the Receiver', 'The hearing justice ruled that, in his estimation, “it [was] abundantly clear that the Receiver has satisfied the elements of his § 45-9-11 claims against Mayor Moreau and the City Council.”7 Focusing on the criteria contained in the just-cited statute, he found that the Mayor and the City Council had “caused” the Receiver to be required to expend unappropriated funds in 7', 'General Laws 1956 § 45-9-11(a) provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“No official of a city * * * that is subject to the jurisdiction', 'of a * * * receiver * * * shall knowingly expend, or cause to be', 'expended, in any fiscal year any sum in excess of that official’s', 'departmental or other governmental unit’s appropriation duly made', 'in accordance with the law, nor commit the city * * * nor cause it', 'to be committed, to any obligation for the future payment of', 'money in excess of that appropriation, with the exception of court', 'judgments.”', '-6- order to engage outside counsel and pursue his Superior Court action for declaratory and injunctive relief; the hearing justice determined that, as a result, the Appellants were personally liable for the expended funds. He stated: “Mayor Moreau and the City Council have failed to proffer any evidence to contradict the fact that no appropriations were made in the fiscal year 2010-2011 budget for the retention of outside legal counsel by any of the Receiver, Mayor Moreau, and the City Council.” The hearing justice also referenced “numerous letters” from the Receiver to the Mayor and the City Council to put them on notice as to the lack of appropriations for the retention of outside counsel. The hearing justice concluded that portion of his analysis with a finding that “Mayor Moreau and the City Council’s retention of counsel and pursuit of the instant litigation—despite the Receiver’s admonitions—were intentional and in derogation of the Receiver’s superior and superseding authority.”', 'Turning next to address the Appellants’ invocation of the Anti-SLAPP statute and the “Noerr-Pennington doctrine” as constituting a “shield from liability,” the hearing justice found that the Anti-SLAPP statute and the “Noerr-Pennington doctrine” were not applicable to the instant cases.8 He went on to state that “both Mayor Moreau and the City Council were free to engage counsel or challenge the [Financial Stability Act’s] constitutionality in their individual capacities and at their own expense.” The hearing justice then concluded his discussion with the following additional words: “Despite numerous admonitions from the Receiver, Mayor Moreau and the City Council proceeded in derogation of [the Receiver’s] authority and caused the City to 8', 'Rhode Island’s Anti-SLAPP statute, as codified in G.L. 1956 chapter 33 of title 9, was “intended to emulate the federal Noerr-Pennington doctrine * * * by providing conditional immunity to any person exercising his or her right of petition or free speech under the United States or Rhode Island Constitution concerning matters of public concern.” Global Waste Recycling, Inc. v. Mallette, 762 A.2d 1208, 1210, 1211 (R.I. 2000).', '-7- incur expenses not previously appropriated. As a result, having chosen not to proceed in their individual capacities, the parties must now face the music and pay the price.”', '2. Indemnification of the Mayor', 'The hearing justice began his consideration of the issue of the Mayor’s asserted entitlement to indemnification by noting that § 45-15-16 authorizes cities to pass ordinances concerning indemnification of public officials for legal fees and further noting that Central Falls had passed such an ordinance—viz., the previously referenced City Ordinance. Under the City Ordinance, in order to be entitled to indemnification, the public official is required to have been acting “within the scope of his official duties or employment” or “from the performance * * * of his public duties” when he or she incurs the attorneys’ fees and costs. It was the judgment of the hearing justice that, when the Mayor engaged counsel and proceeded with the litigation, he was “acting beyond the narrow scope of his official or public duties” because the appointment of the Receiver had reduced the Mayor to merely an advisory capacity. The hearing justice stated that, for that reason, the Mayor was not entitled to indemnification under the City Ordinance.', 'The hearing justice also pointed out that, even if the Mayor were entitled to indemnification, such entitlement would not be absolute in view of the hearing justice’s understanding that the Mayor’s indemnification required the approval of the City Council; he then stated that, since the Receiver had assumed the role of the City Council, he was free to reject the Mayor’s request for indemnification.', '3. Attorneys’ Fees for Attorney Goldberg', 'Attorney Goldberg represented the City Council in these consolidated cases and sought the fees incurred in connection with that representation. The Superior Court denied the motion to advance the fees, observing that Attorney Goldberg could not “point to [any] statutory or', '-8- contractual provision as the basis for his claim for legal fees.” The hearing justice stated that, in light of this Court’s opinion in Moreau v. Flanders, 15 A.3d 565 (R.I. 2011), Attorney Goldberg’s representation of the City Council was in contravention of the Financial Stability Act. The hearing justice also pointed out that the Receiver had rescinded the resolution of the City Council hiring Attorney Goldberg; he added that “Attorney Goldberg may now contest the validity of the Receiver’s rescission, and may accuse the Receiver of serving as an autocrat, but our Supreme Court has expressly disagreed with that contention” when it upheld the “‘broad and sweeping’ powers” of the Receiver under the Financial Stability Act.', 'The hearing justice emphasized his ruling by stating that this Court had “proclaimed the law of this land, and Attorney Goldberg and the City Council are bound by it.”', 'The Appellants timely appealed the hearing justice’s decision to this Court.', 'II', 'Analysis9', 'A', 'Standards of Review', '1.

We also remain mindful of the principle that “[s]ummary judgment is an extreme remedy that should be applied cautiously.” Hill v. National Grid, 11 A.3d 110, 113 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Plainfield Pike Gas & Convenience, LLC v. 1889 Plainfield Pike Realty Corp., 994 A.2d 54, 57 (R.I. 2010).10', '2. Legal Fees', 'This Court has stated that “[t]he issue of whether there exists a basis for awarding attorneys’ fees generally is legal in nature, and therefore our review of such a ruling is de novo.” Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island v. Najarian, 911 A.2d 706, 709 (R.I. 2006) (emphasis in original). “Only if it is determined that there is such a basis, then this Court will review a motion justice’s actual award of attorneys’ fees for an abuse of discretion.” Id.', 'This Court has also “staunch[ly] adhere[d] to the ‘American rule’ that requires each litigant to pay its own attorney’s fees absent statutory authority or contractual liability.” Moore v. Ballard, 914 A.2d 487, 489 (R.I. 2007); see also Eleazer v. Ted Reed Thermal, Inc., 576 A.2d 1217, 1221 (R.I. 1990) (“The plaintiff correctly argues that the right to collect attorney’s fees did not exist at common law and that, consequently such fees may be taxed only when there is either 10', 'It is worth noting that the cases presently before us are ones that seem particularly appropriate for resolution on summary judgment given that there is no dispute between the parties as to any material facts.', '- 10 - specific statutory authority or contractual liability.”). We have further stated that that general rule is not without exception, recognizing “this Court’s inherent power to fashion an appropriate remedy that would serve the ends of justice * * *.” Moore, 914 A.2d at 489 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Vincent v. Musone, 574 A.2d 1234, 1235 (R.I. 1990); see also Truk Away of Rhode Island, Inc. v. Macera Bros. of Cranston, Inc., 643 A.2d 811, 817 (R.I. 1994). Nevertheless, we have stated that, when reviewing a statute under which a party seeks attorneys’ fees, “this [C]ourt may not imply statutory authority through judicial construction in situations in which the statutes are unequivocal and unambiguous.” Eleazer, 576 A.2d at 1221.', 'B', 'Reimbursement of the Receiver', 'The Appellants contend that the hearing justice erred when he granted the Receiver’s motion for summary judgment, whereby the Receiver sought the reimbursement of the attorneys’ fees that he had incurred. The operative statute under which those attorneys’ fees were awarded is § 45-9-11, which provides, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“(a) No official of a city, town, or fire district that is subject', 'to the jurisdiction of a fiscal overseer, budget commission, or', 'receiver, except in the case of an emergency involving the health', 'and safety of the people or the people’s property declared by the', 'city or town council or fire district governing body, shall', 'knowingly expend, or cause to be expended, in any fiscal year any', 'sum in excess of that official’s departmental or other governmental', 'unit’s appropriation duly made in accordance with the law, nor', 'commit the city, town, or fire district, nor cause it to be committed,', 'to any obligation for the future payment of money in excess of that', 'appropriation, with the exception of court judgments.', '“(b) An official who intentionally violates this section shall', 'be personally liable to the city, town, or fire district for any', 'amounts expended in excess of an appropriation to the extent that', 'the city, town, or fire district does not recover such amounts from', 'the person or persons to whom such amounts were paid and shall', '- 11 -', 'not be indemnified by the city, town, or fire district for any such', 'amounts.” (Emphasis added.)', 'As we have stated, we typically adhere steadfastly to the American Rule that, in the absence of a statute providing otherwise, each litigant is responsible for the litigant’s own legal expenses.11 Nunes v. Meadowbrook Development Co., Inc., 24 A.3d 539, 542 (R.I. 2011); Kells v. Town of Lincoln, 874 A.2d 204, 216 (R.I. 2005) (Robinson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); see also Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240, 247 (1975). The question then becomes: does § 45-9-11 provide a statutory basis pursuant to which the Receiver is entitled to attorneys’ fees? It is appropriate to begin our exploration of that question with a brief review of our jurisprudence with respect to statutory analysis generally and with respect to statutes dealing with attorneys’ fees more specifically.', 'Just as we review motions for summary judgment in a de novo manner, so too do we review questions of statutory construction in a de novo manner. Mutual Development Corp. v. Ward Fisher & Co., LLP, 47 A.3d 319, 323 (R.I. 2012); DeMarco, 26 A.3d at 605; Downey v. Carcieri, 996 A.2d 1144, 1149 (R.I. 2010). It is a fundamental principle in our jurisprudence 11', 'It is important to note that, as briefly alluded to supra, this Court has acknowledged that it may award attorneys’ fees “as an exercise of its inherent power to fashion an appropriate remedy that would serve the ends of justice.” Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island v. Najarian, 911 A.2d 706, 711 n. 5 (R.I. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). With respect to our inherent power to award attorneys’ fees, we have stated:', '“This remedy * * * is available only in one of three narrowly', 'defined circumstances: (1) pursuant to the common fund exception', 'that allows a court to award attorney’s fees to a party whose', 'litigation efforts directly benefit others * * * ; (2) as a sanction for', 'the willful disobedience of a court order * * * ; or (3) when a party', 'has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive', 'reasons.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). We are not confronted with any of the just-referenced situations in the instant cases.', '- 12 - that, “when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” State v. Diamante, 83 A.3d 546, 548 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Tanner, 880 A.2d at 796; Accent Store Design, Inc. v. Marathon House, Inc., 674 A.2d 1223, 1226 (R.I. 1996). In the event that we “find the statute to be unambiguous, we simply apply the plain meaning and our interpretive task is done.” Diamante, 83 A.3d at 550. Moreover, we adhere to “the maxim that the plain statutory language is the best indicator of legislative intent.” Marques v. Pawtucket Mutual Insurance Co., 915 A.2d 745, 747 (R.I. 2007) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted). Only when the statute is ambiguous will we “apply the rules of statutory construction and examine the statute in its entirety to determine the intent and purpose of the Legislature.” Diamante, 83 A.3d at 548 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Tarzia v. State, 44 A.3d 1245, 1252 (R.I. 2012); Tanner, 880 A.2d at 796. With respect to statutes providing for an award of attorneys’ fees, we have stated that such statutes “are in derogation of the common law” and, consequently, must be strictly construed. Moore, 914 A.2d at 489 n. 3; see also Accent Store Design, Inc., 674 A.2d at 1226 (“[A] statute that establishes rights not recognized by common law is subject to strict construction.”).', 'Section 45-9-11(b) states that an official would be personally liable for any funds “expended in excess of an appropriation.” While it is arguable that, by employing a liberal hermeneutical approach, this general statement could be broadly interpreted to include attorneys’ fees, the law requires us to construe the statute strictly. See Moore, 914 A.2d at 489 n. 3. Our law is clear that such a general statement, when strictly construed, is not specific enough to allow for the award of attorneys’ fees in a situation such as the one with which we are presented.', '- 13 -', 'It has been the consistent holding of this Court that even statutes which go significantly further than § 45-9-11 and actually provide for the award of “costs” should not be interpreted as providing for the award of attorneys’ fees. See, e.g., Moore, 914 A.3d at 489; Waldeck v. Piner, 488 A.2d 1218, 1220 (R.I. 1985); Di Iorio v. Cantone, 49 R.I. 452, 454-55, 144 A. 148, 149 (1929). We have also held that, when a rule is silent regarding attorneys’ fees, there is “no room for implication by judicial construction” and attorneys’ fees are not available under the statute. Eleazer, 576 A.2d at 1221. Thus our precedent indicates that a statute must explicitly include attorneys’ fees in order for a court to award attorneys’ fees pursuant to that statute. See id.; see also Moore, 914 A.2d at 489; Waldeck, 488 A.2d at 1220; Di Iorio, 49 R.I. at 454-55, 144 A. at 149.', 'A review of § 45-9-11 makes it abundantly clear that the language thereof does not include the words “attorney’s fees;” indeed, it does not even contain the word “costs.” The statute is completely silent with respect to attorneys’ fees. Accordingly, the required strict construction of the statute leads us to the ineluctable conclusion that it unambiguously fails to provide for the award of attorneys’ fees. See Eleazer, 576 A.2d at 1221. We must simply apply the plain meaning of the statute; it is not within our power to read language into a statute which the General Assembly chose not to put there. Diamante, 83 A.3d at 548; see Dodd v. United States, 545 U.S. 353, 359 (2005) (stating that a court is simply “not free to rewrite [a] statute that Congress has enacted”); see also Rivera v. Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 70 A.3d 905, 910 (R.I. 2013) (“[W]e have noted that [w]here there is no ambiguity, we are not privileged to legislate, by inclusion, words which are not found in the statute.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, it is our judgment that the hearing justice erred in awarding attorneys’ fees pursuant to § 45-9-11.', '- 14 -', 'Our confidence in the conclusion that we have reached is buttressed by the fact that the General Assembly has, on multiple occasions, enacted statutes in which it has explicitly provided for the award of attorneys’ fees—statutes that contain wording quite unlike the wording of § 45- 9-11. See, e.g., G.L. 1956 § 28-35-17.1(b) (“Upon determination of the responsibility for any delay or continuance, the [C]ourt shall have the authority to assess all direct costs or expenses incurred by any party or by the [C]ourt as a result of the delay or continuance, or an appropriate penalty, including reasonable attorney’s fees, upon the responsible employer, employee, insurance carrier, or attorney or other representative.”) (emphasis added); G.L. 1956 § 28-9.2-16 (“If either the bargaining agent or the corporate authorities files a petition for writ of certiorari to the [S]upreme [C]ourt of the [S]tate of Rhode Island for a review or modification of a majority decision of the arbitrators * * * the party against whom the decision of the [S]upreme [C]ourt is adverse, if the [S]upreme [C]ourt finds the appeal or petition to be frivolous, shall pay reasonable attorney’s fees and costs to the successful party as determined by the [S]upreme [C]ourt * * *.”) (emphasis added); G.L. 1956 § 5-37.3-9(d) (“Attorney’s fees may be awarded, at the discretion of the [C]ourt, to the successful party in any action under this chapter.”) (emphasis added). Accordingly, it is clear that the General Assembly, when it chooses to do so, is fully capable of specifically providing for the award of attorneys’ fees. It simply did not do so in the statute at issue.', 'For all of the foregoing reasons, it is our holding that the hearing justice erred in awarding attorneys’ fees to the Receiver pursuant to § 45-9-11. This is so because, in our opinion, the hearing justice focused in error on whether the requirements of § 45-9-11 were met, rather than whether that statute actually provided for the payment of attorneys’ fees. Thus, contrary to the conclusion of the hearing justice, summary judgment should be granted in the', '- 15 - Appellants’ favor with respect to the issue of whether the Receiver is entitled to reimbursement of his attorneys’ fees.12', 'C', 'Indemnity of the Mayor', 'The Appellants argue that the Mayor is entitled to be indemnified for his attorneys’ fees and legal costs pursuant to § 45-15-16 and the City Ordinance.13 In response, Mr. Shine argues that the power of the Mayor and the City Council was transferred to the Receiver when he was appointed and the Mayor and the City Council were relegated to a merely advisory capacity. On that basis, he contends that the Mayor was not authorized to bring suit in his official capacity or to retain counsel, which makes him ineligible for indemnification.14', 'Section 45-15-16, on which the Appellants rely, provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“All * * * city council[s] * * * shall * * * indemnify any and all', '* * * public employees * * * [and] officials * * * from all loss, 12', 'The Appellants also contend that they should not be required to reimburse the Receiver in view of the provisions of the Rhode Island Anti-SLAPP statute and the “Noerr-Pennington doctrine.” In light of our holding, we need not reach that argument. See Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n. 4 (R.I. 2009) (referencing “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”). 13', 'We note that the Appellants argue before this Court that both the Mayor and the City Council are entitled to indemnification under G.L. 1956 § 45-15-16 and the City Ordinance. However, the hearing justice was presented with a motion only with respect to the Mayor; accordingly, it is only the decision on that motion that we may review. See State v. Garrett, 91 A.3d 793, 804 n. 8 (R.I. 2014) (stating that “due to the fact that * * * an argument was not raised at any point before the trial court, it has not been preserved for appellate review”); see also State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1290 n. 8 (R.I. 2011). Any fees that were incurred by the City Council are more properly addressed, as they were below, in the context of Attorney Goldberg’s “Motion for Advance Attorney’s Fees.” See Part II.D, infra. 14', 'Mr. Shine cites to numerous statutory provisions which lend support to his contention that the Receiver had been granted virtually absolute power over almost the entire governmental function in Central Falls and that other government officials had been reduced to an advisory capacity. See, e.g., G.L. 1956 §§ 45-9-7; 45-9-12; 45-9-15; 45-9-16; 45-9-6(d)(1); 45-9-6(d)(6).

The city', 'council shall decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether', 'indemnification should be allowed or declined.”', '- 17 - The task before us is to construe the just-quoted statutory provisions and the provisions of the Ordinance to determine whether the hearing justice erred in granting summary judgment for the Receiver on the issue of indemnification.', 'As previously stated, when construing statutes, it is the function of this Court to conduct a de novo review to determine whether the statutory language is clear and unambiguous. Downey, 996 A.2d at 1149. And it is a basic principle of our jurisprudence that, “when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Diamante, 83 A.3d at 548 (internal quotation marks omitted). If the Court finds “the statute to be unambiguous, [it] simply appl[ies] the plain meaning and [its] interpretive task is done.” Id. at 550.', 'After construing § 45-15-16 and the City Ordinance, and after considering the unique factual situation presented in these cases, we are of the opinion that the Mayor is entitled to indemnification pursuant to the terms of the statute and the City Ordinance. Both § 45-15-16 and the City Ordinance are absolutely clear. They squarely provide that a city official shall be indemnified for his or her legal costs, including attorneys’ fees,15 if he or she was acting within 15', 'Central Falls Code of Ordinances, Chap. 2, Art. III, Div. 3, § 2-110(a) explicitly provides that:', '“The city shall have the duty to provide legal representation', 'through the city solicitor or through outside legal counsel without', 'charge to the persons involved to any city officer or employee', 'indicated in section 2-108, in connection with any claim, suit for', 'damages or other action against such person arising from the', 'performance by said person of his public duties, provided that such', 'person may have his own private counsel to assist in his defense, at', 'the expense of the person so involved.” Thus, although the Central Falls Code of Ordinances does not use the specific words “attorneys’ fees,” the just-quoted language, in addition to the use of the term “legal costs” in § 2-108, makes it clear that § 2-108 provides for an award of attorneys’ fees.', '- 18 - the scope of his or her official duties. We are unable to discern any ambiguity whatsoever in the statute or the City Ordinance; accordingly, we must apply their plain meanings. Diamante, 83 A.3d at 548. The use of the word “shall” makes mandatory the indemnification provided for in the statute and the City Ordinance if the criteria set forth in the statute are met.16 See 1A Norman J. Singer and J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 25:4 at 589 (7th ed. 2009) (stating that, “[u]nless the context otherwise indicates, use of the word ‘shall’ * * * indicates a mandatory intent”). Thus, any discretion accorded to a city council with respect to deciding whether or not to provide indemnification relates only to making a determination as to whether the requirements of § 45-15-16 and the City Ordinance have been met—i.e., whether the city official in question was acting within the scope of his or her employment. If the answer to that inquiry is yes, then that official is entitled to indemnification. We note that the statute does not contain any language strictly requiring a vote by the City Council, and we disagree with the hearing justice’s statement to the contrary; the statute simply requires a determination that the requirements of the statute and the City Ordinance have been met. Therefore, since there is no dispute as to the Mayor’s status as a city official, the only question now before the Court is whether the Mayor was “acting within the scope of [his] official duties or employment” when he challenged the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act in the Superior Court and when he defended himself in the action filed by the Receiver. Sec. 45- 15-16. 16', 'It is vitally important to note that, in 2009, § 45-15-16 was amended. Before that amendment, the statute provided that a city council “may” indemnify officials acting in the scope of their official duties. The 2009 amendment changed the term “may” to “shall.” P.L. 2009, ch. 361, § 1. It necessarily follows that the General Assembly thereby made indemnification mandatory, rather than discretionary, if the criteria set forth in the statute are met. See 1A Norman J. Singer and J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes and Statutory Construction § 25:4 at 589 (7th ed. 2009).', '- 19 -', 'A thorough review of the voluminous record in these cases has led this Court to the conclusion that, taking into account the unique and unprecedented set of circumstances presented here, the Mayor was acting within the scope of his official duties. We have reached that conclusion for a number of reasons. The first, and perhaps the most important, reason is that the Mayor’s actions were taken to obtain a definitive ruling as to the constitutionality of an entirely new statute—a statute which removed a significant amount of the power held by the elected officials in Central Falls and vested that broad, sweeping power in a single individual, the Receiver.17 We candidly acknowledge that the actions of the Mayor were in conflict with the clear mandates of the Financial Stability Act; but, critically, it was the constitutionality of that very act which the Mayor was challenging.18 Resolution of that constitutional question was of vital importance to the State of Rhode Island in view of the wide-ranging and indeed draconian powers accorded to the Receiver and in view of the fact that Central Falls was the first municipality in Rhode Island to become subject to the terms of the Financial Stability Act.19 We would emphasize that, in view of the chronology of events and the gravity and novelty of the 17', 'See Unity Telephone Co. v. Design Service Co. of New York, Inc., 179 A.2d 804, 811 (Me. 1962) (“The absence of precedents, or novelty in incident, presents no obstacle to the * * * award of relief in a proper case.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). 18', 'It is our view that it would be grave error to take into account the fact that this Court ultimately found the Financial Stability Act to be constitutional, since that is knowledge that the Mayor did not have at the time when the actions at issue were taken. See Moreau, 15 A.3d at 589. Moreover, it is very important to note that this Court quite obviously wrestled with the pro and con arguments as to the constitutionality of the Act, acknowledging that the Act contained a “flaw,” but nevertheless finding it, overall, to be constitutional; our opinion was by no means quick and easy but rather, in its length and depth of analysis, reflected the substantial and certainly non-frivolous nature of the constitutional question that was before us. Id. at 578, 589. 19', 'See Karin S. Holst, Moreau v. Flanders, 15 A.3d 365 (R.I. 2011), 17 Roger Williams U. L. Rev. 602, 614 (Spring 2012) (stating that “the issue of the constitutionality of the new receivership statute [(i.e., the Financial Stability Act)] is a question of great importance”).', '- 20 - constitutional question, the situation presented to us in these cases is utterly unique. Had the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act already been established, then any acts by the Mayor which contravened the Act might well have been beyond the scope of his official duties— and, in such a situation, it is possible that he might not have been entitled to indemnification. However, that is decidedly not the case that is presently before us. In our opinion, the Mayor, as the City’s chief elected official, had a right, if not a duty, to challenge the Act.', 'We are further impelled to conclude that the Mayor was acting within the scope of his official duties when we reflect on what would be the effects of coming to the opposite conclusion. When the hearing justice ruled that the Mayor was not acting in his official capacity and therefore was not entitled to indemnification, he thereby left the Mayor financially responsible in his individual capacity for these lawsuits—lawsuits which were undertaken on behalf of the people of Central Falls to determine the constitutionality (or lack thereof) of a new, broad, and far-reaching statutory scheme. If the hearing justice’s reasoning were to prevail, the Mayor would be required to pay, out of his own pocket, the attorneys’ fees and costs which he incurred in seeking judicial review of several weighty constitutional questions relative to that statutory scheme.', 'While our respect for the trial justice is profound and sincere, we fundamentally disagree with his conclusion that the Mayor was not entitled to indemnification under the highly unusual and unprecedented circumstances at issue in these cases. Accordingly, we are unequivocally disinclined to leave the Mayor personally financially responsible for these lawsuits. To do so would be inconsistent with our view of what is just and equitable in this unique situation.20 20', 'See Tanner v. Town Council of East Greenwich, 880 A.2d 784, 800 (R.I. 2005) (expressly referencing the “tenets of justice and fairness”); Wilkinson v. Harrington, 104 R.I. 224, 230, 243 A.2d 745, 749 (1968) (stating that “[f]or courts to adopt the approach suggested by', '- 21 -', 'We further note that the Mayor of Central Falls, before entering upon the duties of that office, is required to take an oath; the City of Central Falls Home Rule Charter specifically provides, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“The mayor and members of the city council, before', 'entering upon the duties of their office, shall first be severally', 'sworn or affirmed to the faithful discharge of the same, and to the', 'support of the Constitution and laws of the state, and of the', 'Constitution of the United States, in the form and manner provided', 'for by law.” Central Falls Home Rule Charter Art.

IV, Chap. 1, § 4-100 requires the Mayor to “be at all times vigilant and active in causing the laws of the state and ordinances of the city to be executed and enforced.” We are especially struck by the fact that the mandated oath explicitly requires the person being sworn in to support the constitutions of Rhode Island and of the United States. In spite of the fact that the Mayor was reduced by virtue of the Financial Stability Act to an advisory capacity,21 it is the opinion of this Court that, in this unprecedented and unusual factual scenario, the Mayor was acting in his official capacity with respect to the cases before us because he took an oath to uphold the Constitution and, thus, arguably had a duty to challenge the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act in his official capacity. See Felkner v. Chariho Regional School Committee, 968 A.2d 865, 874 (R.I. 2009) (“Public policy demands that one who holds a public office discharge his or her duties with undivided loyalty * * *.”).

To do justice between the parties is the object of a court of equity.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). 21', 'In the first Moreau opinion, we pointed out that “§ 45-9-7(c) provides that, even when a receiver has assumed the powers of elected officials, these same elected officials ‘shall continue to be elected in accordance with the city or town charter, and shall serve in an advisory capacity to the receiver.’” Moreau, 15 A.3d at 578-79 (quoting § 45-9-7(c)).', '- 22 -', 'Furthermore, this Court has expressly recognized that the Mayor had legal standing to participate in the cases before us in his official capacity. In the first Moreau opinion, we unanimously held, in crystal clear language, that “we have little difficulty in concluding that the mayor and city council, in their individual and official capacities, have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the [Financial Stability Act].” Moreau, 15 A.3d at 574 (emphasis added). Additionally, and significantly, in that first Moreau opinion, with respect to the duration of a receivership, we stated that “judicial relief, by means of an action seeking a declaratory judgment and/or injunctive relief, would be available to municipalities that contend that a receiver has overstayed his statutory authority.” Id. at 578. Thus, we have already made it clear that the Mayor had standing in his official capacity to challenge the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act. It would be contradictory, illogical, and fundamentally unfair for us now to hold that he is not entitled to indemnification because he was not acting within the scope of his official duties.', 'We believe it prudent to reiterate that our conclusion is based on the significant fact that this was the first time that the Financial Stability Act had been implemented and it had yet to be determined that it passed constitutional muster. It is difficult to conceive of an individual better suited to bring such a challenge before the courts than the Mayor of the first city that was subject to the control of a Receiver under the Financial Stability Act. It is true that the Mayor did not compliantly yield to the dictates of the Act; he opted to avail himself of the judicial process in order to obtain a definitive ruling as to whether or not the provisions of that very Act were constitutional. In our judgment, by so doing he was being faithful to the oath that he took to support the constitutions of Rhode Island and of the United States and to advocate for what he perceived to be the best interests of the people of Central Falls. Cf. State v. Keenan, 68 A.3d', '- 23 - 588, 593 n. 4 (R.I. 2013) (stating that “to so rule would be to elevate form over substance, something that we have repeatedly refused to do”); Huffman v.

Accordingly, we hold that, under the factual scenario before us in this case, the actions taken by the Mayor were taken within the scope of his official duties.', 'Consequently, under the mandatory language of § 45-15-16 and the City Ordinance, the Mayor is entitled to indemnification; the law accords no further discretion to the City Council, or the Receiver acting as the City Council, to refuse indemnification.22 The Mayor should certainly not be required to pay from his personal funds for constitutional litigation which, this Court has stated, he had the standing to bring in his official capacity and which had such a potentially profound impact on the city he had been elected to govern.', 'For the reasons just discussed and there being no genuine issues of material fact to be decided, it is our opinion that the Mayor is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See DeMaio, 59 A.3d at 129. Accordingly, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and direct that the Mayor should be indemnified pursuant to § 45-15-16 and the City Ordinance. 22', 'Section 45-15-16 states that a city “may” decline to indemnify a public official if that official’s conduct was “willful, wanton, or malicious.” Additionally, the Central Falls Code of Ordinances, § 2-109, provides that the City Council “shall” decline to indemnify if the official’s actions were “willful, wanton or malicious.”', '“Whether a municipal officer acted within the law is a judicial question,” 62 C.J.S. Municipal Corporations § 465 at 480 (2011), and this Court notes that there is absolutely no evidence that the Mayor’s actions in these cases rose to the level of being willful, wanton or malicious, regardless of how many letters the Receiver may have sent him. Accordingly, despite the Appellee’s contentions to the contrary, the above-referenced provisions do not apply to the instant cases.', '- 24 -', 'D', 'Attorney Goldberg’s Fees', 'The final issue on appeal is whether Attorney Goldberg, who represented the City Council in these actions, is entitled to be awarded attorneys’ fees. The Appellants contend that the City Council “acted in good-faith prosecution and/or defense of an action taken in the public interest and within the scope of [its] official duties” and that Attorney Goldberg is therefore entitled to collect his fees. The Appellants explicitly note that “[n]ever before had any Receiver acted with this scope of authority in any city or town in Rhode Island;” they further assert that the City Council, consequently, had a “duty to challenge the Receiver and the [Financial Stability Act] on behalf of its constituents.” Mr. Shine replies by arguing that the Receiver was the only individual who had authority to engage outside counsel and that, given the existence of the receivership, the City Council’s decision to engage outside counsel exceeded the scope of its duties.', 'Central Falls Code of Ordinances, § 2-110(b) provides that the City Council “shall have the authority to approve or deny any and all requests for outside legal counsel on a case-by-case basis.” This ordinance bestows upon the City Council the exclusive right to hire outside legal counsel. On August 4, 2010 (after the Receiver was appointed), the City Council passed a resolution hiring independent legal counsel “for guidance and/or litigation concerning the numerous matters that currently affect the City, the Central Falls Community as a whole and the discharge of [the] City Council’s obligations * * *.”23', 'Moreau, 15 A.3d at 572 (internal 23', 'We are aware of the general rule that, “when a municipal corporation has legal counsel charged with a duty of conducting the legal business of a governmental agency [i.e., a city solicitor], contracts with other attorneys for additional or extra legal services are void.” Coventry School Committee v.

On September 20, 2010, the City Council passed a second resolution, which authorized the “engagement of independent legal counsel to file a legal action to challenge the constitutionality of the [Financial Stability Act].” Id.', 'However, the Financial Stability Act expressly provides that the Receiver may “[a]lter or rescind any action or decision of any municipal or fire district officer, employee, board, authority, or commission within fourteen (14) days after receipt of notice of such action or decision[.]” Sec. 45-9-6(d)(17); see also § 45-9-7. In the instant cases, the Receiver, pursuant to § 45-9-6(d)(17) and § 45-9-7(b)(1), rescinded both of the City Council’s resolutions providing for the hiring of independent legal counsel within days of their passage. Moreau, 15 A.3d at 572. Upon rescinding each resolution, he sent a letter to the City Council informing it of his decision. Id. The day after the Receiver rescinded the second resolution, he filed his action in Superior Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Id. at 573. Then, on September 27, 2010, “citing its September 20 resolution,” the City Council and the Mayor filed their own cause of action in Superior Court. Id. Both actions are now before us.', 'The question which we must address is whether or not the attorney eventually hired by the City Council (Attorney Goldberg) is entitled to recover his fees in view of the fact that the resolutions of the City Council providing for his hiring were rescinded by the Receiver. The Court acknowledges that the Financial Stability Act does give the Receiver the power to rescind when there is an “implied authority of a municipal board or officer to hire counsel in the good- faith prosecution or defense of an action taken in the public interest and in conjunction with its or his official duties where the municipality’s attorney refuses to act or is incapable of or is disqualified from acting.” Id.; see also Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System v. City of Providence, 666 A.2d 810, 813 (R.I. 1995) (stating that there was a conflict of interest on the part of the city solicitor because the city and the retirement board were on opposite sides of the case). It is our judgment that the exception applies in the instant cases because there was an obvious conflict between the Receiver, who would also be entitled to a city solicitor’s services, and the City Council. As such, the City Council was not barred from retaining independent, outside counsel.', '- 26 - acts of the City Council. However, as we have stated in our extensive discussion concerning indemnifying the Mayor (see Part II.C, supra), the cases now before us are unique and unprecedented and were unique and unprecedented at the nisi prius level. It is clear that the City Council was attempting, in its resolutions, to hire independent legal counsel in order to challenge the constitutionality of the very Act which the Receiver now contends made those resolutions inoperative. Indeed, in determining that Attorney Goldberg was not entitled to his fees, the hearing justice relied heavily on the provisions of the Financial Stability Act which allowed the Receiver to rescind resolutions of the City Council. We are of the opinion that that reliance was misplaced in these unique cases. The hearing justice also relied on our opinion in the first Moreau case—a reliance that was likewise misplaced.', 'At the time that the City Council passed the resolutions at issue, it did not have the benefit of our lengthy and comprehensive opinion in the first Moreau case, in which, after careful consideration, we ultimately held that the Financial Stability Act is constitutional. Additionally, because the Act was entirely new, the City Council did not have the benefit of any judicial ruling as to the constitutionality which could have guided its actions. Like the Mayor, the members of the City Council take an oath “to the support of the constitution and laws of the state, and of the Constitution of the United States * * *.” Central Falls Home Rule Charter Art. II, Chap. 1 § 2-105. It is almost self-evident that the decision of the City Council to hire outside legal counsel was entirely consistent with an effort to comply with that oath. The Financial Stability Act was untested, and the City Council argued that it was unconstitutional.', 'A “municipal corporation which is authorized to contract and to sue or be sued has the implied power to employ counsel to appear in litigation in which it is involved, when in the exercise of its reasonable discretion the interest of the municipality so requires.” 56 Am.Jur.2d Municipal', '- 27 - Corporations, Counties, and Other Political Subdivisions § 194 at 320 (2010). Thus, because the City Council acted in a manner which it undoubtedly had reason to believe was consistent with the members’ sworn duties and in the best interest of the City of Central Falls (and for the other above-discussed reasons) it is our judgment that it was not beyond the pale of the City Council’s official duties for it to challenge the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act in court.', 'Our conclusion is once again buttressed by our statement in the first Moreau opinion that the City Council had standing, in its official capacity, to bring a constitutional challenge to the Financial Stability Act. Moreau, 15 A.3d at 574 (“Here, we have little difficulty in concluding that the mayor and city council, in their individual and official capacities, have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the act.”). As with the Mayor, it would be contradictory, illogical, and fundamentally unfair for this Court to now hold that the attorneys’ fees incurred to bring such a suit (in the City Council’s official capacity) must be paid out of the personal funds of the individual City Council members.', 'Rather, we are of the opinion that, under these exceptional circumstances, the resolutions passed by the City Council authorizing the hiring of independent legal counsel, although thereafter rescinded by the Receiver, should be given full force and effect. Hence, it was misplaced for the hearing justice to rely upon the first Moreau opinion, of which the City Council did not have the benefit when it acted, and to rely on the provisions of the Financial Stability Act, which the City Council was attempting to challenge. Accordingly, we conclude that the hearing justice erred in finding that Attorney Goldberg was not entitled to his fees, and we vacate that judgment.24 24', 'Mr. Shine contends that, due to the fact that the Receiver sent letters to the City Council rescinding the resolutions which would have allowed for the hiring of outside counsel, the actions of the City Council in actually hiring outside counsel amounted to willful, wanton, or malicious conduct.

These cases may be remanded to that tribunal for: (1) the entry of summary judgment in accordance with this opinion; (2) a determination of the amount of indemnification that the Mayor is entitled to receive; and, (3) the amount of attorneys’ fees that Attorney Goldberg is entitled to receive. Justice Goldberg did not participate.', 'Chief Justice Suttell, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I am in complete agreement with Section II.

C and D concerning the indemnification of the mayor and the payment of the city council’s attorneys’ fees.', 'The majority’s mandate directing that the mayor be indemnified for his attorneys’ fees and legal costs rests upon G.L. 1956 § 45-15-16 and § 2-108 of the City of Central Falls Code of Ordinances. In similar language, both the statute and ordinance provide that a municipal official shall be indemnified if the official “was acting within the scope of his or her official duties or employment.” The majority concludes that, “taking into account the unique and unprecedented set of circumstances presented here,” the mayor was indeed acting within the scope of his official Code of Ordinances, § 2-109. We are unable to perceive any reason to conclude that the justified actions of the City Council in the instant cases could, by any stretch of the imagination, be considered willful, wanton, or malicious.', '- 29 - duties in filing suit to challenge the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act (Act). My review of the record, however, leads me to a contrary conclusion.', 'The Financial Stability Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 9 of title 45, is an extraordinary piece of legislation designed “to provide a mechanism for the state to work with cities * * * undergoing financial distress that threatens the fiscal well-being, public safety, and welfare of such cities, * * * with the state providing varying levels of support and control depending on the circumstances.” Section 45-9-1. Pursuant to the Act, the director of revenue is authorized to appoint a receiver if lesser measures have been inadequate to restore fiscal stability to the municipality, as set forth in § 45-9-7(a), or if the municipality is facing a fiscal emergency, as set forth in § 45-9-8. The receiver is then empowered to exercise “any function or power of any municipal * * * officer.” Section 45-9-7(b)(2). Further, under § 45-9-7(c), “the powers of the receiver shall be superior to and supersede the powers of the elected officials of the city,” which officials “shall serve in an advisory capacity to the receiver.”', 'The expansive nature of the Financial Stability Act is further made manifest by § 45-9-12 (“[T]he provisions of this chapter shall supersede any conflicting provisions of the city’s * * * charter, local ordinance, rule or regulation.”); § 45-9-15 (“Insofar as the provisions of this chapter are inconsistent with the provisions of any charter, other laws, or ordinances, general, special, or local, or of any rule or regulation of the state or any municipality * * *, the provisions of this chapter are controlling.”); and § 45-9-16 (“This chapter being necessary for the welfare of the state and its inhabitants shall be liberally construed in order to effectuate its purposes.”). Significantly, at all times relevant to these cases, the Act was presumed to be constitutional. See State v. Faria, 947 A.2d 863, 867 (R.I. 2008) (“legislative enactments of the General Assembly', '- 30 - are presumed to be valid and constitutional”) (quoting Newport Court Club Associates v. Town Council of Middletown, 800 A.2d 405, 409 (R.I. 2002)).', 'In accordance with the Act, the nonjudicial receiver for the City of Central Falls was appointed on July 16, 2010 and thereby assumed the duties and functions of the office of the mayor and relegated the mayor to serve in an advisory capacity only. In light of the statutory framework and the “broad and sweeping” powers devolved by the General Assembly upon the receiver, Moreau v. Flanders, 15 A.3d 565, 577 (R.I. 2011), I do not consider the actions of the mayor in challenging the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act to be within the scope of his official duties or employment. His authority at that time was purely advisory and did not enable him to incur legal costs at the expense of his financially distressed city.', 'Moreover, § 2-109 of the City of Central Falls Code of Ordinances provides that “[t]he city shall decline to indemnify any * * * official * * * for any * * * act, * * * if the same resulted from willful, wanton or malicious conduct on the part of such * * * official * * *. The city council shall decide, on a case-by-case basis, whether indemnification should be allowed or declined.” Clearly the receiver, in whom the authority of the city council had statutorily vested, did not allow indemnification to the mayor; on the contrary, the receiver specifically rescinded the city council’s resolution to engage outside counsel for the mayor. In my opinion, the mayor’s actions were in direct defiance of the receiver’s superior and superseding powers and, thus, far exceeded the narrow scope of his official, i.e., advisory, duties.', 'The majority awards the mayor indemnification of his attorneys’ fees, based upon § 45- 15-16, without regard to the text of the Financial Stability Act. I do not believe, however, that the mayor gets a free pass from the strictures of the Act simply because its constitutionality had yet to be tested.', 'The mayor may well have been raising a courageous challenge to the', '- 31 - constitutionality of the Act, but neither state statute nor city ordinance provided him with a means for indemnification.25 As the hearing justice succinctly put it:', '“[T]he Receiver, exercising the powers of the city council in', 'accordance with §§ 45-9-7(b) and (c), was vested with the', 'authority to approve or deny [the mayor]’s requests for outside', 'legal counsel. In view of [the mayor]’s engagement of outside', 'counsel—in contravention of the Receiver’s September 22', 'letters—the City and Receiver are relieved of responsibility for', 'indemnifying him against those expenses, and [the mayor] must', 'now accept responsibility for the consequences of his choices.”', 'The issue with respect to the payment of Attorney Goldberg’s attorneys’ fees is even more compelling. The majority reverses the hearing justice’s decision, again based upon the exceptional and unique circumstances of this case, primarily because the Financial Stability Act was untested and the city council erroneously believed it to be unconstitutional, noting that the council “did not have the benefit of our lengthy and comprehensive opinion in the first Moreau case.” The majority also faults the hearing justice for relying “heavily on the provisions of the Financial Stability Act which allowed the Receiver to rescind resolutions of the City Council.” This reasoning entirely ignores the fact that the Act was and is, then and now, valid and constitutional.', 'Pursuant to the Act, the authority of the city council was reduced to an advisory capacity, and the receiver was vested with superior, superseding powers. Section 45-9-7(c). In exercising his legislatively granted authority, the receiver rescinded two resolutions of the city council: one that authorized “the engagement of legal representation for the Council concerning the numerous 25', 'The majority also leans heavily on the previous statement of this Court that “the mayor and city council, in their individual and official capacities, have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the act.” Moreau v. Flanders, 15 A.3d 565, 574 (R.I. 2011). However, it does not necessarily follow from the fact that the mayor had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Act that he also had the authority to require the financially ailing city of Central Falls to pick up the tab.', '- 32 - matters that are currently affecting the City and the Central Falls Community”; and another that authorized the engagement of independent counsel to file a legal action to challenge the constitutionality of the Financial Stability Act. See § 45-9-6(d)(17); § 45-9-7(b)(1). Despite these express rescissions, the city council chose to engage the services of outside legal counsel. I do not agree with the majority’s contention that the city council’s resolutions, which were lawfully rescinded by the receiver, were somehow valid because this Court had yet to rule on the constitutionality of the Act.', 'In my judgment, the overriding exceptional and unique circumstance in this case was the dire financial condition afflicting Central Falls, which necessitated the appointment of a receiver. The General Assembly carefully crafted the Financial Stability Act to provide relief to distressed cities and to provide support to allow such municipalities a means of regaining their fiscal footing. Here, the actions of both the mayor and the city council were in contravention of the Act. Accordingly, I see no basis in law to indemnify the mayor or award fees to the city council’s attorney, and I respectfully dissent from Sections II.

1,In re Jah-nell B.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The respondent, Clifton Barr, appeals from a decree entered in Family Court terminating his parental rights to his son, Jah-nell. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Jah-nell and his family came to the attention of the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF) in April 2009 when the DCYF hotline received a call concerning his mother’s “unstable” behavior. In particular, there were allegations that Jah-nell’s mother had hit another person’s child. Due to safety concerns, DCYF formally opened a case and assigned a social caseworker, Aleida Mohammed, to the family on April 24, 2009.', 'On May 19, 2009, a Family Court justice ordered the removal of Jah-nell who was then living with his mother. Jah-nell was placed in the care and custody of DCYF and then situated in', '-1- a nonrelative foster home. At the outset of this case, respondent was identified as the biological father of Jah-nell. The respondent came into court on September 2, 2009, and admitted to allegations of neglect. At that time, he was incarcerated at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI). From Jah-nell’s birth in January of 2008 until the time of trial in May and June of 2013, respondent had spent nearly two of the five years of his son’s young life in prison.', 'On January 30, 2012, DCYF filed a petition in Family Court seeking to terminate the parental rights (TPR) of both Jah-nell’s mother and father. The TPR petition alleged, in wording substantially similar to the statutory language in G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(3), that:', '“The child has been placed in the legal custody of the', 'Department of Children, Youth and Families for at least twelve', '(12) months; and the parents were offered or received services to', 'correct the situation which led to the child being placed and', 'provided further that there is not a substantial probability that the', 'child will be able to return safely to the parents’ care within a', 'reasonable period of time considering the child’s age and the need', 'for a permanent home.” A trial in Family Court was held over six days in May and June of 2013, during which extensive trial testimony was provided by twelve witnesses. 1', 'Ms. Mohammed testified as to the circumstances present that gave rise to serious concerns regarding the safety and well-being of Jah-nell and his siblings. In particular, she testified that her trepidation stemmed from the actions of the child’s mother and concerns about “[i]nappropriate parenting, substance abuse, domestic violence, unstable mental health, [and] putting the needs of her boyfriend before her children.”', 'With respect to respondent, Ms. Mohammed testified that visits between Jah-nell and respondent at the ACI were ordered by the 1', 'The trial in the Family Court pertained to the termination of the parental rights of both the mother and respondent with respect to Jah-nell, in addition to the mother’s parental rights to two of her other children by another father. This opinion will address only the portions of the proceedings below that are relevant to respondent’s appeal from the termination of his parental rights to Jah-nell.', '-2- Family Court. She stated that respondent did not request any visits until October 2009. He completed two visits with his son—one on October 20, 2009 and one on November 30, 2009. At the October visit, Ms. Mohammed was present and observed that Jah-nell “did not know who [respondent] was.”', 'Nevertheless, on cross-examination, Ms. Mohammed testified that respondent “tried his very best to get [Jah-nell] to interact with him [and] to play” with him during the first visit. She explained that she did not set up additional visits for respondent at the time because he had told her “that he was going to be released in December or January, so he would wait for his next visit for when he was released.” Ms. Mohammed testified that she called the ACI in January, but was informed that “[respondent] was in disciplinary and was not allowed to have visitation at the time.”', 'The respondent was released from the ACI in March 2010.', 'Following his release, Ms. Mohammed received a call from him and scheduled a visit for him with Jah-nell on March 24, 2010. The visits between respondent and Jah-nell were intended to occur on a biweekly, or once every other week, basis. However, Ms. Mohammed detailed in her testimony the numerous occasions on which these visits did not take place. She testified that respondent canceled visits on May 7, May 21, and July 30, 2010, and failed to show up for a scheduled visit on September 22, 2010. Ms. Mohammed described the reason that respondent offered for not attending the last scheduled visit as “housing problems.” More specifically, she indicated that he was not “getting along with [the] roommate” with whom he had been court-ordered to live. She testified that, even though respondent had been ordered to live at an address in Woonsocket as “part of his probation parole [sic],” he instead had moved in with his girlfriend. On September 29, 2010, Ms. Mohammed received a phone call from respondent’s girlfriend, after which Ms. Mohammed requested a bureau of criminal investigation (BCI) check on respondent. The BCI check notified', '-3- her that respondent was again incarcerated at the ACI.', 'Ms. Mohammed testified that she believed he was incarcerated from September 2010 until March 2011 and that at no point during that time period did he contact her to request visits with Jah-nell. 2', 'Visitations were re-established after respondent’s release from the ACI, but Ms. Mohammed described them as “sporadic,” stating that: “[h]e would be consistent and then disappear, and then he would call back and said [sic] that he left town for a couple of months and then he would start up again.” After respondent failed to make contact in December 2012, she determined that he had been incarcerated again.', 'In accordance with departmental procedures, Ms. Mohammed prepared three case plans for respondent with a goal of reunifying him with Jah-nell. The first case plan prepared for respondent was dated May 17, 2010; the second plan was dated January 1, 2011; and the third plan was dated October 13, 2011. The core objectives provided in respondent’s case plans included: “Complete a parent-child evaluation, maintain employment so he could save money to obtain a two-bedroom apartment for he [sic] and his son, complete a substance-abuse evaluation, cooperate with conditions of parole and probation, [and] complete services with Early Intervention.” She further testified that in October 2011 respondent eventually completed a substance-abuse evaluation, which indicated that he “was in full remission, according to the counselor.” As a result, no further substance-abuse services were recommended.', 'Ms. Mohammed stated in her testimony that respondent had told her that he wanted Jah- nell to be reunified with Jah-nell’s mother. Further, she explained that “[respondent] stated to me that if the mother was not able to reunify, then he would make efforts to try to reunify with 2', 'During this time period, DCYF made no efforts to contact respondent to schedule visits with Jah-nell. At trial, Ms. Mohammed indicated that this was due to the entry of a decree on May 19, 2010 in the Family Court, ordering DCYF to file a petition for the termination of parental rights (TPR) if the “parents do not cooperate with services.”', '-4- his son, but he was hopeful that she would get his son back.” When respondent testified, he denied that he had said the best place for Jah-nell would be with his mother. He indicated that he did not intend for his son to be with his mother, explaining: “I don’t think that it’s good to take five kids, put one and take the other. If she’s -- if they don’t want her to have kids, I don’t think my kid is safe. For the same reason, no other kids are safe there.”', 'When respondent took the stand at trial, he indicated that he did not currently have a permanent address and that he lived with his cousin. He was employed doing construction work in Boston at the time of the trial. With regard to Jah-nell, respondent stated that he had never lived with his son and never paid any support to Jah-nell’s mother. In 2009, when DCYF became involved with his family, respondent was serving a prison sentence on a September 2007 conviction for the delivery of a controlled substance. 3 Although he could not recall the specific dates, he conceded that he spent about one month in segregation at the ACI while serving that sentence. He testified that, after his first release in March 2010, he met with Ms. Mohammed to discuss a case plan for him to reunify with Jah-nell. In the course of that discussion, respondent indicated that Ms. Mohammed asked him to complete a substance-abuse evaluation and a parent- child evaluation. In September 2010, respondent was re-incarcerated at the ACI for violating the terms of his probation. Following his release in March 2011, respondent moved in with his girlfriend in Lincoln.', 'With regard to Jah-nell and their visits, respondent testified that: “I’m getting left behind everybody, and I’m the biological dad.” He explained that he felt Jah-nell was “trying to learn a 3', 'With regard to respondent’s criminal history, he was convicted of possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance on September 21, 2007 and he was sentenced to fifteen years, with fifty-four months to serve, and 126 months suspended. At the time DCYF opened this case in 2009, respondent was already serving this sentence at the ACI and was subsequently released in March 2010. In September 2010, respondent was again incarcerated at the ACI for a probation violation. He was released in March 2011.', '-5- foster father, [his mother’s] boyfriend, who is supposed to be a father, and then me at the end of the chain.” The respondent indicated that if the court reunified him with Jah-nell, then his “plan would be to get a job, get an apartment, everything they wanted me to do when it started basically.” When asked if he needed any assistance from DCYF to help reunify with his son, respondent replied “[a]nything further than guidance, I would say no.”', 'At the request of DCYF, Dr. John P. Parsons, Ph.D., a licensed clinical psychologist, was engaged to perform “a comprehensive psychological evaluation and parenting assessment” of respondent. Ms. Mohammed testified that she set up the parent-child evaluation for respondent around September 2010. Doctor Parsons testified that it typically takes five sessions to complete his psychological evaluation of the parent and one interactive session with the parent and child to complete the parenting assessment.', 'Nevertheless, in respondent’s case, Dr. Parsons never completed the overall assessment because respondent failed to participate in the final interactive session during which Dr. Parsons would have observed him with Jah-nell. Doctor Parsons testified that respondent was “cooperative” during his first five visits. The respondent was re- incarcerated during the evaluation process, which required Dr. Parsons to reschedule his final observation.', 'After respondent’s release, DCYF again referred respondent to Dr. Parsons. Despite meeting with Dr. Parsons on ten occasions, 4 respondent never completed his final interactive session.', 'Doctor Parsons explained at trial that he utilized “a standard battery of psychological tests and inventories” in his evaluations. He testified that he received a case history from Ms. Mohammed prior to administering the tests and conducting his evaluations of respondent. 4', 'At trial, the parties stipulated to all of the dates on which respondent met with Dr. Parsons. The dates of those sessions were: August 2, 2010, August 6, 2010, August 11, 2010, August 18, 2010, September 1, 2010, February 6, 2012, February 22, 2012, February 24, 2012, February 29, 2012, and March 2, 2012.', '-6- Based upon the tests and evaluations he administered, Dr. Parsons assessed respondent’s cognitive abilities and mental health status. In addition, Dr. Parsons explained that, although respondent had self-reported at an evaluation in 2012 that he was no longer abusing marijuana, he nonetheless “gave him a diagnosis of cannabis dependence in sustained full remission, which meant that he hasn’t smoked the substance in over a year.”', 'Doctor Parsons also described some of the difficulties that he and Ms. Mohammed encountered in terms of communicating with respondent to schedule a date and time for the parent-child evaluation. The respondent elaborated in his testimony that at first it was a “date thing” that precluded them from scheduling the interactive visit. However, respondent further testified that once he learned of what the visit would entail, then “I really didn’t want to do the visits either way. I didn’t want to do the visit with Dr. Parsons and my son.” He also indicated that he felt the evaluation would not be a “fair situation” for him.', 'Although the final parent-child evaluation never occurred, Dr. Parsons nevertheless filed a report with his findings, based on a reasonable degree of “psychological certainty,” after concluding his psychological evaluation of respondent.', 'Based on twenty-five factors, Dr. Parsons determined that, at the time he finalized his evaluations in June 2012, reunification of respondent and Jah-nell was a “high-risk situation.” Doctor Parsons proceeded to highlight some of these factors, such as: (1) his failure to be cooperative with and complete the parent- child evaluation; (2) his history of substance abuse; (3) his difficult family circumstances; (4) his record of incarceration; and (5) his mental health issues. In his report, Dr. Parsons did not make', '-7- any recommendations of services to be provided to respondent. 5 He explained his reasoning behind that decision, testifying:', '“We were talking about a child who needed a stable', 'environment. We were talking about a child that went into care', 'angry, developmentally-delayed, was placed in this foster home', 'and improved significantly.', '“* * *', '“But at that point, I felt what’s in the best interests of this', 'child, permanency planning with someone, other than', '[respondent], was to be provided.” While discussing his findings, Dr. Parsons did note that he “do[esn’t] doubt that [respondent] loves his boy, that he cares about him.” However, Dr. Parsons concluded by testifying: “I felt with a combination of these factors and the amount of time, the length of time this child was in care, that it was a high-risk situation.”', 'On October 17, 2013, the trial justice issued a comprehensive written decision, spanning eighty-three pages, in which he concluded that respondent’s parental rights to Jah-nell be terminated. In that decision, the trial justice conducted an in-depth review of all of the testimony provided over the six-day trial, reviewed portions of the exhibits in evidence, and rendered sixty- five findings of fact. He found that respondent was unfit because he had been unable to complete the objectives of his case plans, which DCYF had tailored in an effort to address the pertinent issues in this case. The trial justice then went on to find that “DCYF has in fact made more than reasonable efforts to reunify [Jah-nell] with [respondent].” Despite DCYF’s efforts, he concluded that “[t]here is not a substantial probability that [Jah-nell] will be able to return 5', 'It came up at trial that Dr. Parsons in his report had erroneously noted that, on May 19, 2010, DCYF had already filed a TPR petition for respondent. In his testimony, Dr. Parsons denied that this error had any effect on the conclusions set forth in his report. Doctor Parsons’s report was dated June 10, 2012. DCYF had filed its TPR petition for respondent in January 2012.', '-8- safely to [respondent’s] care within a reasonable period of time considering [Jah-nell’s] age[] and [his] need for a permanent home.”', 'The trial justice concluded that it was in the best interest of Jah-nell to terminate the parental rights of respondent. In reaching that conclusion, he found the expert testimony of Dr. Parsons to be “credible and probative on the issue of potential reunification of Jah-nell with the father.” Furthermore, he credited many of the twenty-five factors that Dr. Parsons had relied upon in concluding that reunifying Jah-nell with respondent was a “high-risk situation.” In particular, he noted:', '“62. Among the factors were the father’s lack of cooperation with', 'the evaluation; he did not complete the evaluation; he was', 'estranged from his family members; he had numerous arrests, both', 'as a juvenile and as an adult; he wasn’t working; he didn’t have the', 'means to support himself or his family; he has five children and', 'wasn’t paying child support; he had a substance abuse history and', 'his mental health issues.” The trial justice found that since Jah-nell had been placed with a foster family, “the child’s behavior and learning abilities improved significantly.” In his decision, the trial justice noted that he “[gave] substantial consideration to the physical, psychological, mental, and intellectual needs of [Jah-nell] and [his] need for permanency in [his life].”', 'Ultimately, he determined that: “The [c]ourt finds that it is in the best interest of [Jah- nell] to be granted permanency in [his life] in appropriate pre-adoptive foster placement and that the rights of [respondent] be terminated.” The trial justice terminated respondent’s parental rights to his son in accordance with § 15-7-7(a)(1), (3), and (4).', 'The decree terminating respondent’s parental rights to Jah-nell was entered on October 24, 2013.

(quoting In re Amber P., 877 A.2d 608, 615 (R.I. 2005)). On appeal, respondent argues that the trial justice erred in finding that he was unfit because clear and convincing evidence of his parental unfitness was “absent from the record.” We see no merit in this contention.', 'The trial justice found respondent unfit pursuant to § 15-7-7(a)(1), (3), and (4). With respect to § 15-7-7(a)(1), he stated that: “the father is unfit by reason of his willful neglect to provid[e] proper care and maintenance of his child for a period of at least one year where financially able to do so.” He further concluded, that in accordance with § 15-7-7(a)(3), “there is not a substantial probability that the child will be able to return safely to the parents’ care within a reasonable period of time considering the child’s age and the need for a permanent home.”', '- 11 - Finally, the trial justice terminated respondent’s parental rights under § 15-7-7(a)(4) declaring that respondent “has not had, nor has he sought, contact with the child for a period in excess of six (6) months.”6', 'Our case law clearly establishes that a parent whose child is in the care and custody of DCYF has the obligation: “(1) to maintain contact with the child and (2) to plan for the child’s future.” In re Rosalie H., 889 A.2d at 205 (quoting In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d 200, 204 (R.I. 1989)). When a parent in this position demonstrates an unwillingness to cooperate with DCYF services, we have recognized that lack of interest as grounds for a finding of parental unfitness.

His last contact with Jah-nell was in November 2012. Moreover, respondent’s repeated incarcerations made completion of the tasks outlined in the case plans, and ultimately reunification, far more difficult.', 'As we have previously stated, “[w]hen planning for reunification with a child, the parent not only should establish and comply with a plan that can provide a sound and constructive family life but must also perform some minimal act toward the fulfillment of that plan.” In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d at 204. At trial, respondent offered little in terms of future plans should he be reunified with his son. 6', 'Although the trial justice articulated subsections (1), (3), and (4) of G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a) as distinct grounds for termination, we recognize that the TPR petition alleged only § 15-7-7(a)(3).', '- 12 -', 'Although we commend respondent for securing employment, we note that, at the time of trial, he had not established a permanent address for potential reunification with his son and had failed to abide by his probation conditions on one occasion. Moreover, he indicated his reticence towards any assistance from DCYF by expressing his desire for them to instead give him a “clean slate” so that he could have a “fair shot” with his son. In this case, respondent’s various case plans for reunification also required the completion of a parent-child evaluation by Dr. Parsons. However, completion of this very attainable objective eluded respondent. The respondent testified with regard to the evaluation: “I’m in an uncomfortable situation trying to learn how to do something, and I feel I’m being graded and judged by what they put me to do and use it against me like that.” Such expressed discomfort or displeasure with the evaluation, however, is not a justified basis for circumvention. See In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d at 204.', 'In recognition of Jah-nell’s need for a permanent and nurturing home, the trial justice concluded that respondent was unfit to parent Jah-nell. Despite respondent’s contention that the record is devoid of sufficient evidence of parental unfitness, our review of the record convinces us that legally competent evidence exists to support the trial justice’s findings. Therefore, we affirm the trial justice’s findings of parental unfitness.', 'B', 'Reasonable Efforts at Reunification', 'The respondent asserts that the state failed to prove that DCYF made reasonable efforts to reunify him with his son prior to filing the petition to terminate his parental rights. In particular, he contends that DCYF’s reunification efforts were insufficient because these efforts “merely consisted of two evaluations and inadequate visitation.” We disagree.', '- 13 -', 'When a petition to terminate parental rights is filed pursuant to § 15-7-7, and before a parent’s rights can be terminated, “DCYF must prove by ‘clear and convincing evidence that regardless of the parent’s behavior, [DCYF] has made reasonable efforts to encourage and strengthen the parental relationship’ * * *.” In re Alvia K., 909 A.2d 498, 504 (R.I. 2006) (quoting In re Amber P., 877 A.2d at 618). To satisfy this burden, we have never required DCYF to establish that it made “extraordinary efforts to reunite parent and child[.]” In re Lauren B., 78 A.3d 752, 760 (R.I. 2013) (quoting In re Jose Luis R.H., 968 A.2d 875, 882 (R.I. 2009)). Instead, this Court has previously stated that “the concept of reasonable efforts is not a rigid standard, but one of some flexibility that must be defined by the particular facts and circumstances in a case.” In re Alvia K., 909 A.2d at 504 (quoting In re Amber P., 877 A.2d at 618). Furthermore, in conducting our review, we employ the same deferential standard of review with respect to the findings of the trial justice concerning reasonable efforts as we apply to findings of unfitness. Id.', 'In his written decision, the trial justice specifically found that DCYF “made more than reasonable efforts to reunify [Jah-nell] with [respondent].” After our review of the record, we are satisfied that there is ample evidentiary support for the trial justice’s finding. From the outset of DCYF’s involvement in this case, Ms. Mohammed chronicled her efforts on behalf of the agency to establish a consistent, bi-weekly visitation schedule for respondent and Jah-nell. Despite these efforts, respondent’s visitation track record was replete with cancellations, absences, and extended gaps due to either incarceration or lack of communication. Accordingly, we disagree with respondent’s contention that DCYF’s visitation efforts were, in any way, “inadequate.”', '- 14 -', 'In addition to visitation, Ms. Mohammed testified that she had prepared three separate case plans for the respondent in an effort to reunify him with his son. Those plans, admitted into evidence at trial, contained objectives that the respondent failed to complete, which included participating in a parent-child evaluation, securing a permanent address, and abiding by his probation conditions.', 'It is apparent from the respondent’s testimony that he had repeated opportunities to complete the parent-child evaluation with Dr. Parsons. However, the respondent willfully declined to do so. He so indicated at trial, when he stated that “[b]y the time I knew what they were doing in there, I really didn’t want to do the visits either way. I didn’t want to do the visit with Dr. Parsons and my son.” Furthermore, he expressed his frustration with the nature of the proposed evaluation, saying that it did not constitute “a fair situation.” As this Court has often stated, we do not “desire to ‘burden the agency with the additional responsibility of holding the hand of a recalcitrant parent.’” In re Rosalie H., 889 A.2d at 208 (quoting In re Kristen B., 558 A.2d at 204). Therefore, we are convinced that the record supports the trial justice’s finding that DCYF provided reasonable efforts at reunification, and that, notwithstanding such efforts, there was not a reasonable probability that Jah-nell would be able to be reunified within a reasonable period of time.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the decree of the Family Court terminating the parental rights of the respondent.

2,Denise Luppe. : Peerless Insurance Company : v. : No. 2014-100-Appeal. (WC 12-17) Christopher Henderson. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. Is the minor daughter of divorced parents, who lives with her mother but regularly stays at her father’s home for overnight visits twice per week, a resident of the father’s home for the purpose of determining coverage under the provisions of a homeowner’s insurance policy? Under the undisputed facts present in this case, we hold that the child does reside at her father’s home and we therefore affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The defendants, Christopher Henderson and Denise Luppe, each appeal from a final judgment entered in Washington County Superior Court granting summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Peerless Insurance Company (Peerless), and denying Ms. Luppe’s cross-motion for', '-1- summary judgment. 1', 'The defendants are the divorced parents of a minor child, Maya Henderson. On August 23, 2010, while Maya was enjoying overnight visitation with her father, she was bitten by her father’s dog and suffered serious injuries. Ms. Luppe soon brought a personal injury suit on Maya’s behalf against Mr. Henderson, who sought a defense under the terms of his homeowner’s insurance policy with Peerless.', 'Peerless responded by filing a declaratory judgment action, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-30-1. In this action, Peerless sought a declaration that Maya was a resident of her father’s household and, therefore, was excluded from coverage for injuries that she sustained when she was bitten by the dog.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Maya’s parents separated in January 2009, completed a property settlement agreement in September 2009, and terminated their marriage pursuant to a judgment of absolute divorce entered in the Family Court in May 2010. The judgment of divorce awarded joint legal custody of Maya to her parents, with “physical placement to be with [Ms. Luppe] and [Mr. Henderson] to have all reasonable rights of visitation.”', 'This was consistent with the couple’s property settlement agreement, which was incorporated by reference in the judgment, and which defined joint custody as “shared responsibility for all major decisions concerning the upbringing, education, medical care, dental care, spiritual care, and all matters concerning the general welfare of the child.” Following the couple’s separation, Mr. Henderson lived nearby in a small studio apartment, and Ms. Luppe remained in the former marital domicile. As a result of the small size of Mr. Henderson’s apartment, Maya’s visits with her father between January 2009 1', 'Prior to oral argument, the parties stipulated to a motion to consolidate these two matters, No. 2014-99-A. and No. 2014-100-A. The Court granted the motion and will issue this single opinion.', '-2- and June 2010 mostly took place at her mother’s home, which Mr. Henderson visited after work on a near daily basis for a few hours each day. In fact, Mr. Henderson testified by deposition that Maya had no more than a couple of overnight visits to his studio apartment.', 'However, Mr. Henderson soon purchased a home that had sufficient space to allow a regular schedule of overnight visitation with his daughter. 2 That visitation schedule, agreed to amicably by both parents, was “pretty rigid,” in the words of Mr. Henderson. Accordingly, Maya would stay at her father’s house two days each week, overnight, on Wednesdays and Sundays. After exercising overnight visitation, Mr. Henderson would bring Maya to school, and Ms. Luppe or Maya’s grandmother would pick her up at the end of the school day. When Maya stayed at her father’s house, she would sleep in her father’s bedroom, despite the presence of a “spare guest room” in the house. However, Maya would sleep in that room when her cousins would occasionally visit her at her father’s home. Maya’s paternal grandparents also regularly visited, and, when they did, they would stay in that bedroom as well. The bedroom did contain some of Maya’s toys and clothing, including “essentials” and various other “backup items,” such as a “[s]weatshirt, * * * shorts, a pair of jeans, sandals, [and] sneakers.” Generally, what Maya would wear during visitation depended on how she was attired when she arrived at her father’s home. On occasion, Maya would bring a bag she used to transfer her belongings between her mother’s and father’s houses. Mr. Henderson’s house also contained various toiletries belonging to Maya, including a toothbrush, hairbrush, and hair dryer. Mr. Henderson gave deposition testimony that he did not consider his house to be Maya’s home, and neither did she: “[Maya] 2', 'All three properties are in the town of Westerly. To avoid confusion, the home that defendants shared while married will be referred to as the mother’s house. The home where the injuries occurred, where the father lived after his studio apartment, will be referred to as the father’s house.', '-3- knows it as daddy’s house. You know, she knows [her mother’s] home as, let’s say, home, and she knows my home as daddy’s house.”', 'On Sunday, August 22, 2010, Maya was at her father’s house, in keeping with the normal visitation schedule. While Mr. Henderson was in the kitchen, Maya was attacked by the father’s dog. Maya required significant medical attention as a result of the dog bite. 3', 'In 2011, Ms. Luppe filed the underlying personal injury lawsuit, both on behalf of her daughter and asserting injuries of her own against Mr. Henderson. 4 The complaint alleged that Maya was viciously attacked and “was disfigured, suffered personal injuries, * * * may continue to suffer great pain of mind and body, and incurred medical expenses in connection” with the attack. At the time of the injuries to Maya, Mr. Henderson was insured under a homeowner’s liability policy issued by Peerless. When he was served with the lawsuit brought on Maya’s behalf, Mr. Henderson sought a defense from Peerless under the terms of the policy. However, Peerless pointed to an exclusion in the homeowner’s policy, specifically Section II – Exclusions, 2(f), which says that personal liability coverage does not extend to cover liability for “‘[b]odily injury’ to you or an ‘insured’ within the meaning [of this policy].” Further, the policy defines an “insured” as “you and residents of your household who are: a. [y]our relatives; or b. [o]ther persons under the age of [twenty-one] and in the care or any person named above.” Peerless contends that, at the time of her injury, Maya was a resident of her father’s home and, therefore, there was no coverage for her injury because Maya was considered an insured under the policy. 3', 'After the incident, Mr. Henderson returned the dog to the home from which he had adopted him, but defendants did not modify their custody arrangement with Maya. As Mr. Henderson testified, “even though it was a bad incident, we wanted to keep [our visitation schedule] normal.” 4', 'Ms. Luppe individually alleged that she suffered a loss of consortium with her daughter because of Maya’s injuries. That claim is not addressed by this opinion.', '-4-', 'On January 10, 2012, Peerless filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, asking the Superior Court to determine if Maya was a resident of her father’s house. 5 Mr. Henderson filed a counterclaim to Peerless’s complaint, alleging that Peerless had breached its contract of insurance, had acted in bad faith, and had breached its fiduciary duty to Mr. Henderson by taking a position that was adverse to his best interests. 6', 'During the course of discovery, Ms. Luppe gave deposition testimony, in which she generally agreed with Mr. Henderson’s characterization of Maya’s visitation arrangements as regular, and, barring occasional minor changes due to scheduling, consisted of two overnight stays per week. Ms. Luppe also agreed that Maya kept some of her clothing and some of her toys at her father’s house. However, Ms. Luppe testified that Maya was listed as a resident of her home on a variety of school forms, that any mail Maya would receive would be directed to her home, and that Maya was claimed as an exemption on the tax returns that she filed with her husband.', 'On August 16, 2013, Peerless filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that there were no issues of fact in dispute and arguing that the undisputed facts supported a finding that Maya was a resident of her father’s household when she was injured. Both defendants objected to the motion. In addition, Ms. Luppe filed a cross-motion for summary judgment.', 'On November 18, 2013, the motions were heard by a justice of the Superior Court. 7 At the hearing, the parties agreed that there were no genuine issues of material fact. The parties also 5', 'Additionally, Peerless asked the Superior Court for a declaratory judgment that Ms. Luppe did not suffer bodily harm, which would resolve the claims in the underlying personal injury suit in which Ms. Luppe was an individual plaintiff. The parties stipulated to declaratory judgment in favor of Peerless on this count. 6', 'The counterclaim has been stayed by agreement, pending the outcome of this action. 7', 'Before the motions were heard, the parties agreed on a high-low binding settlement in the underlying personal injury action. This agreement provided that, if Peerless were to prevail in its', '-5- agreed that the test to be applied to determine residency for insurance purposes was contained in prior decisions of this Court: Aetna Life and Casualty Co. v. Carrera, 577 A.2d 980, 985 (R.I. 1990), and a subsequent opinion, Barricelli v. American Universal Insurance Co., 583 A.2d 1270, 1271 (R.I. 1990). Counsel for Ms. Luppe then asked the hearing justice to consider an affidavit from an experienced family law attorney that she had submitted with her motions. Counsel for Peerless objected, arguing, “[i]f it’s [Ms. Luppe’s] position that there’s no issue of fact here, then I don’t understand the purpose of the * * * affidavit. If it’s not being offered to establish an issue of fact, my position is it shouldn’t be considered.” After argument, the hearing justice issued a bench decision and granted summary judgment for Peerless, observing that she had not been persuaded by the affidavit and that, because the parties agreed on the facts, the issue before her was a question of law. The hearing justice held that Maya was a resident of Mr. Henderson’s home and therefore concluded that there was no coverage for her injuries under the Peerless policy. Each defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We review a hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment de novo.', 'Miller v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance, Co., 111 A.3d 332, 339 (R.I. 2015) (citing Emond Plumbing & Heating, Inc. v. BankNewport, 105 A.3d 85, 89 (R.I. 2014)). In our review of the record, we employ the same standard as the hearing justice: “[i]f we conclude, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be decided and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter declaratory judgment action, the parties would settle in the amount of $50,000 to be paid by Peerless to Ms. Luppe and her daughter in satisfaction of all claims. However, if Peerless were to be unsuccessful, it would in that event pay $225,000 to satisfy all claims.', '-6- of law, we will affirm the grant of summary judgment.”', 'Leone v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 101 A.3d 869, 872 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Pereira v. Fitzgerald, 21 A.3d 369, 372 (R.I. 2011)).', '“Summary judgment is appropriate when the hearing justice, after considering the ‘pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,’ finds ‘no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as [a] matter of law.’” Miller, 111 A.3d at 339 (quoting Emond, 105 A.3d at 89).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'In their consolidated appeals, defendants advance several arguments as to why summary judgment was wrongly granted in favor of Peerless. Both defendants argue that the test for residency, when properly applied, should have resulted in a finding that Maya was not a resident of her father’s household. Ms. Luppe argues that the hearing justice did not properly consider the affidavit she submitted from a family law attorney, and that the term “resident” should have been construed narrowly in this case in order to serve the greater policy of expanding insurance coverage. Lastly, Mr. Henderson argues that the term “resident” in his Peerless insurance policy is ambiguous and consequently should be construed against the insurer, the drafter of the document. We shall address these arguments below.', 'A. The Affidavit', 'Before the hearing justice, Ms. Luppe argued that the affidavit that she submitted from an experienced family law attorney should be conclusive on the question of Maya’s residency. The affidavit stated that, because during their divorce proceedings the parties had agreed that Maya’s physical placement would be with her mother, the young girl’s residence was with her mother', '-7- only. 8 At the hearing, Peerless contested the relevance of the affidavit because “possession and custody for purposes of divorce are not the same as residence for purposes of insurance.” In her bench decision, the hearing justice stated that she was “not persuaded that custody could have been crafted differently as discussed in [the submitted] affidavit.”', 'In the affidavit at issue, the affiant averred that he had reviewed the documents from defendants’ Family Court divorce and that in his “expert opinion,” Maya should be considered to be a resident of Ms. Luppe’s household only. In our opinion, however, such a statement is merely the affiant’s legal conclusion, based on the circumstances of defendants’ divorce, and it raises no material issue of fact. Indeed, it is well settled that such an opinion is permissible only “when the subject matter is wholly scientific or so far removed from the usual and ordinary experience of the average lay person * * * .”', 'Vallinoto v. DiSandro, 688 A.2d 830, 851 (R.I. 1997) (citing Marshall v. Tomaselli, 118 R.I. 190, 196-98, 372 A.2d 1280, 1284-85 (1977)). An expert is one who “through education or experience, has developed skill or knowledge in a particular subject, so that he or she may form an opinion that will assist the fact-finder.” Black’s Law Dictionary 699 (10th ed. 2014). Here, with the facts largely undisputed, it was a legal conclusion that was required and the parties agreed that the test for residency was controlled by our prior holdings in Carrera, 577 A.2d at 985, and Barricelli, 583 A.2d at 1271. Both cases set forth, in plain language, who is considered to be a resident of a household for the purposes of an 8', 'The affidavit states in relevant part:', '“2. I have been retained by the Defendant Denise Luppe, through her', 'counsel, to offer an expert opinion as to whether, pursuant to the terms of the final', 'judgment of divorce and property settlement agreement, Maya Henderson would', 'be considered a resident of Christopher Henderson’s household.', '“3. To a reasonable degree of certainty, I can state that pursuant to the', 'terms of the Final Decree and Property Settlement Agreement Court [sic], Maya', 'would be considered a resident of Denise Luppe’s household only.”', '-8- insurance policy. Although the test is layered with multiple factors and considerations of the totality of the circumstances, it does not contemplate matters that are outside the usual and ordinary experience of a layperson. See Vallinoto, 688 A.2d at 851 (citing Marshall, 118 R.I. at 196-98, 372 A.2d at 1284-85). The affidavit offered an expert opinion that became unnecessary by the parties’ agreement that there were no facts in dispute. We believe the hearing justice could have been clearer in the way that she addressed the affidavit, but we are not swayed by defendants’ allegations of legal error.', 'B. The Term Resident is Not Ambiguous', 'Mr. Henderson argues that the term “resident” in his Peerless insurance policy is ambiguous. There is no doubt that “[a]n ambiguity in an insurance policy is strictly construed against the insurer.” Koziol v. Peerless Insurance Co., 41 A.3d 647, 651 (R.I. 2012) (citing Bliss Mine Road Condominium Association v. Nationwide Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 11 A.3d 1078, 1085 (R.I. 2010)). However, this Court determines whether a contract is ambiguous as a question of law, employing de novo review.', 'Id. at 649 (citing Bliss Mine Road Condominium Association, 11 A.3d at 1083). In doing so, we read the policy in its entirety, giving words their plain meaning; importantly, we refrain from “engaging in mental gymnastics or from stretching the imagination to read ambiguity into a policy where none is present.” Mallane v. Holyoke Mutual Insurance Co. in Salem, 658 A.2d 18, 20 (R.I. 1995) (citing Aetna Casualty & Surety Co. v. Sullivan, 633 A.2d 684, 686 (R.I. 1993)).', 'It is our opinion the term “residents of your household,” as set forth in Peerless’s policy, is not ambiguous, especially when read in context with the words of the next part of the definition, “who are * * * your relatives.” The defendants do not articulate how they believe this definition is ambiguous, arguing simply that “the meaning of the resident exclusion contained in', '-9- the policy is ambiguous as it relates to the facts of the case at bar.” We believe, as other courts have succinctly said, “a contract is not rendered ambiguous merely because the parties disagree over its proper interpretation.” Greaves v. State Farm Insurance Co., 984 F. Supp. 12, 15 (D.D.C. 1997) (quoting Gryce v. Lavine, 675 A.2d 67, 69 (D.C. 1996)).', 'Indeed, this Court has already defined the term “resident” in the context of insurance policies and has noted the common existence of multiple residences. 9 See Barricelli, 583 A.2d at 1271 (agreeing with the contention that it is consistent with Carrera, “for [the child] to be a ‘resident’ of both [of her parents’] households at the time of the accident,” citing Carrera, 577 A.2d at 983-84). Being a resident implies more than being a mere transient guest, because a resident is “[s]omeone who has a home in a particular place”; that place is often where he or she lives, sleeps, and carries on life with regularity. Black’s Law Dictionary 1502 (10th ed. 2014). Shared-custody arrangements are increasingly frequent in our society, 10 and we recognize that a child may call multiple dwellings his or her home. We perceive no ambiguity in the term, particularly when we gather its meaning, as we always have: “derived in part from the context in which it is used.” Carrera, 577 A.2d at 983 (citing Flather v. Norberg, 119 R.I. 276, 281, 377 A.2d 225, 228 (1977)); see also 9A Steven Plitt et al., Couch on Insurance 3d § 128:6 at 128-15 (2005) (“[A] determination of whether a person is a resident of a particular household is an elastic concept entirely dependent upon the context in which the question arises.”). We now shall address the application of the law to this case’s uncontested facts. 9', 'This is not to be confused with legal domicile, “for a person may have two places of residence, as in the city and country, but only one domicile.” Aetna Life and Casualty Co. v. Carrera, 577 A.2d 980, 983 (R.I. 1990) (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary 1176 (5th ed. 1979)). 10', 'Mr. Henderson included in the appellate record a fact sheet from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which says that “approximately 40 percent of U.S. children have divorced parents.”', '- 10 -', 'C. Application of the Carrera Test', 'Although defendants disagree with the hearing justice’s finding, Peerless argues that there was no error in the hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment, because the definition of resident is constant across all types of insurance and not dependent on the type of policy considered. Determining residency in the specific context of a homeowner’s policy is, to some extent, a matter of first impression for this Court, because our prior cases involved uninsured/underinsured-motorist automobile insurance only. In our opinion, the term resident should not have vastly different meanings across multiple types of insurance contracts. This Court has set out our test for residency in the insurance context, and we perceive no error in the hearing justice’s application of that test to these facts.', 'The purpose of a homeowner’s insurance policy is to defend and indemnify the insureds against liability claims filed by others who may have been injured in the insureds’ home or on their property. 9A Couch on Insurance 3d § 128:2 at 128-7 (such policies insure “against the risk of liability for injuries suffered by others, not injuries suffered by the insured”). Homeowner’s policies commonly and expressly exclude coverage for injuries sustained by an insured, and they define an insured as a resident of the household. Id. at 128-7, 128-8. In view of the fact that the term resident is found in contracts across the entire insurance spectrum, “[n]ot surprisingly, a great deal of litigation has ensued,” and indeed, this Court has already considered the question of what defines a resident for the purposes of construing an insurance contract. Id. at 128-8; see Carrera, 577 A.2d at 984-85.', 'In Carrera, 577 A.2d at 981, the insured was the defendant in a declaratory-judgment action brought by her insurance company.', 'The insured’s adult son had died in a Florida automobile accident involving an uninsured vehicle. Id. In the defendant’s capacity as the', '- 11 - administrator of her son’s estate, she made a demand on her own automobile insurance company, claiming that her son was a resident of her household at the time of his death and that, therefore, he was covered under the provisions of her policy’s uninsured-motorist benefits. Id. This Court adopted the reasoning of Flather, which addressed the definition of resident for the purposes of state income tax, and specifically embraced four factors that are significant in determining residency: “(1) the amount of time [one] spends in the locality (2) the nature of [one’s] place of abode (3) [one’s] activities in the locality and (4) [one’s] intentions with regard to the length and nature of [one’s] stay.” Carrera, 577 A.2d at 984 (quoting Flather, 119 R.I. at 283, 377 A.2d at 229). In Carrera, we focused on the fourth factor, intent, and determined that it was fatal to the defendant’s contention that her son resided in her home. Id. at 984-85. This was so because her son was, in fact, a fugitive from the state of Rhode Island, making it likely that at the time of the accident, “he had no intention of returning to his mother’s household or to this jurisdiction.” Id. at 985. Specifically, we said:', '“In order to determine if a person is a resident of a particular household, the court', 'must consider whether in the totality of the circumstances that person maintains a', 'physical presence in the household with intent to remain for more than a mere', 'transitory period, or that person has a reasonably recent history of physical', 'presence together with circumstances that manifest an intent to return to the', 'residence within a reasonably foreseeable period.” Id. Put simply, one who maintains a personal presence in a home with the intent to continue that presence for more than a temporary period is considered a resident of that home under our law. Id. In Carrera, because of the defendant’s son’s lack of intent to return to his mother’s home, we affirmed the judgment that he was not a resident of her home at the time of his fatal accident. Id.', '- 12 - at 985-86. As a result, his estate was unable to maintain a claim for insurance benefits under his mother’s policy. Id.', 'Shortly after the pronouncement of this definition, this Court again addressed the question of residency, this time in the context of a child of divorce. Barricelli, 583 A.2d 1270- 71. In Barricelli, a case that is more factually similar to the situation here than is Carrera, the plaintiffs were divorced parents and co-administrators of the estate of their deceased daughter, Gina. Id. at 1270. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the estate’s losses, stemming from Gina’s death, which occurred while she was a passenger in a single-car accident, were covered by her mother’s uninsured/underinsured-motorist insurance. Id. The defendant carrier filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that Gina was not a resident of her mother’s household at the time of her death, a requisite for coverage. Id. The defendant’s motion was granted and, occasioned by the parents’ appeal, this Court was asked to review the determination of Gina’s residency. Id. In our decision, we observed that the parents were divorced pursuant to a decree of the Family Court that had awarded custody of Gina to her mother, that Gina lived with her mother for several years following the divorce, and that ultimately she had moved in with her father some three years before the fatal accident. Id. at 1271. After that move, Gina’s contacts with her mother’s household were “structured, albeit intermittent.” Id. Those contacts included weekly visits to her mother’s home and overnight visits on alternate weekends, during which Gina would sleep on a pullout sofa. Id. Although Gina did keep one or two changes of clothing and some personal belongings at her mother’s house, for the overnight visits she packed a suitcase. Id. We recognized that “not all types of contact with an insured’s household make a person a ‘resident,’” and we held that because Gina’s contacts with her mother’s home were infrequent, that she lacked a regular bed to sleep in, and that she needed to pack a suitcase to', '- 13 - visit for weekends, it could not be said that her presence in her mother’s house was more than for “a mere transitory period.” Id. at 1271, 1272. Accordingly, we concluded that Gina was not a resident of her mother’s home for purposes of her mother’s insurance policy. Id. at 1272.', 'Here, in our de novo review, we find ourselves convinced by an analysis of the agreed facts that Maya was a resident of Mr. Henderson’s household. There was no dispute that Maya regularly was present in her father’s home subject to an amicable custody agreement and judgment of divorce. Various items of Maya’s clothing and personal belongings could be found throughout the house and in the home’s second bedroom, to the extent that she needed little more than an occasional bag on her twice-weekly visits. Maya’s visitation arrangement was regular, the parties had every intention of continuing the custody agreement on the date of the incident, and, in fact, it did continue on the same schedule even after Maya’s injuries. Further, Maya’s grandparents and cousins would often visit her at her father’s home. The nature of this type of presence in her father’s home establishes that Maya was there for more than “a mere transitory period”; indeed, when Maya was at Mr. Henderson’s house, it was functionally her home. Barricelli, 583 A.2d at 1272. We acknowledge, as defendants argue, that Maya was listed as residing in her mother’s home for purposes of school enrollment, that what little mail she received was delivered to her mother’s home, and that Maya’s mother claimed her daughter on her tax returns. However, while these factors may certainly support an argument that Maya was a resident of her mother’s home, they do nothing to disprove that she also resided with her father. We acknowledged in Carrera, 577 A.2d at 984, “the general rule that one may have more than one residence.” In our opinion, we should not concentrate on whether Ms. Luppe’s home qualified as Maya’s residence, but should focus instead on Maya’s contacts with her father’s house and whether those circumstances satisfied the criteria that were first set forth in Carrera', '- 14 - and were restated in Barricelli. In the context of the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that Maya was a resident of Mr. Henderson’s home on the day she was injured because it was a place at which she had a “recent history of physical presence together with circumstances that manifest an intent to return to the residence within a reasonably foreseeable period.” Carrera, 577 A.2d at 985.', 'D. Policy Concerns', ""We do not believe that our conclusion as to Maya’s residency with her father is an anomaly; indeed, we point to several other jurisdictions that have found residency with a divorced noncustodial parent in similar situations. See, e.g., Canfield v. Peerless Insurance Co., 692 N.Y.S.2d 562, 563 (N.Y. App. Div. 1999) (holding that a regular schedule of visitation coupled with the child’s keeping personal items at her father’s home was a “sufficient degree of permanency to establish that she was a resident of that household as a matter of law”); see also Estate of Adams v. Great American Insurance Companies, 942 P.2d 1087, 1091 (Wash. Ct. App. 1997) (holding child a resident of her father’s home because “the child regularly spen[t] time in the household in question, such that there exist[ed] a continuing expectation of the child's periodic return on intervals regular enough that the household [wa]s the child's home during the time the child [wa]s there, as opposed to a place of infrequent and irregular visits”). The facts in Canfield are strikingly on point with those present here: a child bitten by a dog in the home of her father, while visiting as part of a regular custody arrangement. Canfield, 692 N.Y.S.2d at 562. We agree with that court’s statement that “the child of divorced parents can be a resident of both her mother’s and her father’s home for the purpose of being insured under the homeowner’s policy of each parent.” Id. at 563.

A rapacious investment scheme exploiting the complexities of certain variable annuity policies provides the context for two questions certified to this Court by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (First Circuit) pursuant to Article I, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. The first question asks whether an “annuity [is] infirm for want of an insurable interest” when “the owner and beneficiary of an annuity with a death benefit is a stranger to the annuitant * * *?” The second question inquires whether “a clause in an annuity that purports to make the annuity incontestable from the date of its issuance preclude[s] the maintenance of an action based on the lack of an insurable interest?” For the reasons set forth herein, we answer the first question in the negative and the second question in the affirmative.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'Although we have only been asked to consider two general questions of law, a brief summary of the underlying civil action will help provide the factual predicate for these intriguing legal issues.

Supp.2d 329 (D.R.I. 2012). 1', 'Joseph Caramadre was an attorney who specialized in finding loopholes in insurance and annuity products that would be personally lucrative to him. One of his investment ideas involved taking advantage of both the application process and structure of variable annuity policies designed and sold by Western Reserve Life Assurance Company of Ohio (plaintiff or Western Reserve). Under plaintiff’s “Freedom Premier III” annuity policy, the investor (also known as the policy’s “owner”) pays the premiums for the policy, directs how the premiums are to be invested, and chooses to whom the periodic annuity payments are to be made. The measuring tool for the policy is the life of the annuitant, who is also selected by the investor. In addition, the investor can elect to purchase the “Double Enhanced Death Benefit.” This death benefit guarantees that, upon the annuitant’s death, the beneficiary will receive the greater of (1) the highest market value of the policy at a specified anniversary date or (2) a return of all of the premiums paid into the policy plus five percent per annum interest.', 'Caramadre seized upon the features of plaintiff’s variable annuity policy and contrived to mine its vast investment potential. By purchasing the death benefit rider, an investor was virtually assured of a risk-free investment. The investor could direct that his premiums be 1', 'Since the First Circuit’s certification is predicated on an appeal from the dismissal of plaintiff’s complaint for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted, the facts summarized are those alleged in the complaint.

On the other hand, such risky investments also held the possibility of very substantial profits. Moreover, as Caramadre apparently realized, the shorter the life of the annuitant, the greater the potential for profits.', 'The macabre sine qua non of the investment strategy, therefore, was the recruitment of terminally ill individuals as annuitants. To implement the scheme, Caramadre and his associates circulated flyers to hospice patients and churches, describing a “Program for the Terminally Ill” wherein hospice patients would receive a cash payment in exchange for their willingness to be designated as the annuitant. Charles Buckman served as the annuitant on the policy that is the subject of the case currently pending in the First Circuit (Buckman policy); a role for which he was paid a total of $5,000. The defendant, ADM Associates, LLC (ADM), “a Caramadre nominee,” was designated as the owner and beneficiary of the annuity. No relationship existed between Buckman and ADM prior to the application for the Buckman policy. The defendant initially invested $250,000 as a premium to initiate the Buckman policy, and it specifically requested the Double Enhanced Death Benefit. Soon thereafter, it invested $750,000 as an additional premium payment. The plaintiff issued the policy, which included a clause that the policy would be “incontestable from the Policy Date.” Caramadre repeated this process many times over several years using plaintiff’s variable annuity policies and a variety of terminally ill individuals, brokerage companies, and their agents.', 'The plaintiff attempted to rescind the Buckman policy one year subsequent to its issuance, after learning that this policy was likely one of the many orchestrated by Caramadre.', '-3-', 'The plaintiff filed five separate suits in the District Court against an array of defendants, including Caramadre and one of his associates, the annuity brokerage companies that sold plaintiff’s annuity policies, individual agents of these brokerage firms, individual annuitants, and the individual or corporate policy-investors/owners/beneficiaries.', 'Relevant to the appeal currently pending in the First Circuit, plaintiff sought several forms of relief against ADM, including rescission of the annuity policy or a declaratory judgment that the policy was void because ADM lacked an insurable interest in Buckman, as well as monetary damages for fraud, civil liability for crimes and offenses, and civil conspiracy.', 'All defendants moved to dismiss the complaints for failure to state claims upon which relief could be granted. Two of the central arguments in support of these motions—that the insurable interest requirement for life insurance policies was not applicable to annuities and that the incontestability clauses in the annuity policies precluded plaintiff from litigating any of its claims—form the basis of the certified questions of law now before this Court. The District Court dismissed plaintiff’s claims against ADM, concluding that insurance and annuities are separate, distinct financial investment vehicles and that the lack of an insurable interest by ADM in Buckman did not render the Buckman policy void pursuant to Rhode Island law. The District Court also concluded that the incontestability clause in the policy—that the policy ‘“shall be incontestable from the Policy Date’”—was not in contravention of public policy and “serve[d] to deflect claims to rescind the annuities or have them declared void because of fraud.” Conreal LLC, 715 F.

The plaintiff contends that, pursuant to both common law and statutory law, a variable annuity policy with a death benefit is void ab initio if the policy’s beneficiary does not have an insurable interest in the annuitant. The', '-6- plaintiff asserts that the statutory provision codifying the insurable interest requirement applies to its variable annuity policy with a death benefit because this kind of policy should be considered an insurance policy within the meaning of the statute.', 'The defendant advocates contrariwise, contending that the variable annuity policy with a death benefit is both “structurally and functionally different from life insurance” and therefore is not subject to either the common law or the statutory insurable interest requirement that applies to life insurance policies. The defendant argues that these investment vehicles are treated differently under the law, as evidenced by Rhode Island’s treatment of annuities at common law as different from life insurance, as well as the way in which the applicable statutes define each kind of policy separately.', 'The defendant also argues that the statutory insurable interest requirement applies only to insurance contracts, and that to apply the statutory insurable interest requirement to annuities would be counter to the statute’s express language. 3', 'We establish at the outset that we consider an annuity policy with an elective death benefit to be separate and distinct from a life insurance policy. The General Assembly defines annuities as “all agreements to make periodic payments for a certain period or where the making or continuance of all or some of a series of the payments, or the amount of any payment, depends on the continuance of human life, except payments made in connection with a life insurance policy.” G.L. 1956 § 27-4-0.1(a) (emphasis added).

Fortune Financial Services, Inc., an annuity brokerage company, is one of the named defendants in one of the other cases that plaintiff filed in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. See Conreal LLC, 715 F. Supp.2d at 270, 274. The ACLI is a nonprofit corporation that represents 284 companies that are “actively working in public policy forums to combat a growing practice of using financial products as mere wagers.”', '-7- which does not make any mention of annuities. 4 Furthermore, the structure of plaintiff’s variable annuity policy is significantly different from that of a life insurance policy. With plaintiff’s variable annuity policy, the investor agrees to pay the company issuing the policy a certain premium in exchange for the company’s agreement to periodically pay the policy’s beneficiary a sum of money as long as the annuitant is alive. See ADM Associates, LLC, 737 F.3d at 137. If the investor elects to include the death benefit as part of the policy, then the investor pays an additional daily fee. Id. The advantage of electing the death benefit is that the investor’s base- level investment is protected. Essentially, the investment is guaranteed not to result in a loss to the investor because, when the annuitant dies, the beneficiary (here, the same entity as the investor) will receive at least a return of the premiums that it paid into the policy plus interest, and at most a return from a profitable investment decision. See id. Conversely, a life insurance policy provides for a guaranteed, set sum upon the death of the insured. The purpose behind the life insurance policy is to provide a benefit to a beneficiary or beneficiaries only upon the death of the insured. On the other hand, an annuity policy provides for periodic payments during the life of an annuitant, subject to various contractual provisions. Id. at 136. The elected death 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 27-4-0.1(c) defines life insurance in pertinent part as:', '“every insurance upon the lives of human beings and every', 'insurance appertaining to that life, including the granting of', 'endowment benefits, additional benefits in the event of death by', 'accident, additional benefits to safeguard the contract from lapse,', 'accelerated payments of part or all of the death benefit, or a special', 'surrender value upon diagnosis of terminal illness, defined as a life', 'expectancy of twelve (12) months or less, or of a medical condition', 'requiring extraordinary medical care or treatment regardless of life', 'expectancy, or a special surrender value upon total and permanent', 'disability of the insured, and optional modes of settlement of', 'proceeds.”', '-8- benefit simply protects the investment against loss, allowing the investor to more safely choose to invest the premiums in higher-risk securities. Id.', 'The insurable interest requirement for life insurance policies has long been settled in Rhode Island’s common law and statutory law: The beneficiary of a life insurance policy must have an insurable interest in the life of the insured. Section 27-4-27(a); Cronin v. Vermont Life Insurance Co., 20 R.I. 570, 571, 40 A. 497, 497 (1898). This Court defined “insurable interest” at common law as:', '“arising from the relations of the party obtaining the insurance,', 'either as creditor of or surety for the assured, or from the ties of', 'blood or marriage to him, as will justify a reasonable expectation', 'of advantage or benefit from the continuance of his life.” Cronin,', '20 R.I. at 572, 40 A. at 497 (quoting Warnock v. Davis, 104 U.S.', '(14 Otto) 775, 779 (1881)). In 1990, the General Assembly codified the definition of an “insurable interest” in § 27-4-27(c), as enacted by P.L. 1990, ch. 263, § 1.', '‘“Insurable interest’ as to personal insurance means that', 'every individual has an insurable interest in the life, body, and', 'health of himself or herself and of other persons as follows:', '“(1) In the case of individuals related closely by blood or', 'by law, a substantial interest engendered by love and affection;', '“(2) In the case of other persons, a lawful and substantial', 'economic interest in having the life, health, or bodily safety of the', 'individual insured continue, as distinguished from an interest', 'which would arise only by, or would be enhanced in value by the', 'death, disablement, or injury of the individual insured.” Section 27-4-27(a) sets forth the statutory insurable interest requirement:', '“No person shall procure or cause to be procured any insurance', 'contract upon the life or body of another individual unless the', 'benefits under the contract are payable to the individual insured or', 'his or her personal representatives, or to a person having, at the', 'time when the contract was made, an insurable interest in the', 'individual insured.”', '-9- This statutory requirement has colonial roots that extend across the Atlantic Ocean to England, where purchasing a life insurance policy on the life of another person for whom the policy beneficiary had no interest was prohibited as early as 1774. See Cronin, 20 R.I. at 571, 40 A. at 497. The common law of this state has long held that, “upon principle, a purely speculative contract on the life of another is * * * objectionable on the grounds of public policy * * * and such a contract may properly be held to be void.” Id. at 572, 40 A. at 497. Speculative contracts upon human life have long been prohibited as a matter of public policy because to wager on human life is to provide an incentive to shorten the human life wagered upon. See Grigsby v. Russell, 222 U.S. 149, 154 (1911) (“A contract of insurance upon a life in which the insured has no interest is a pure wager that gives the insured a sinister counter interest in having the life come to an end.”).', 'Whether this insurable interest requirement should be extended to annuity policies is a matter of first impression for this Court. Long before the General Assembly enacted § 27-4-27 in 1990, we commented that the absence of an insurable interest would not render an annuity void as a matter of public policy despite the “element of chance” encompassed by an annuity policy. Cronin, 20 R.I. at 572, 40 A. at 497. However, the structure of annuity policies has become increasingly complex since our comment in Cronin; variable annuity policies have evolved to offer a variety of elective features, including a smorgasbord of investment and payout options, as well as death benefits. ADM Associates, LLC, 737 F.3d at 136-37. But the common law has not yet been extended to cover annuity policies on the grounds of public policy, and, in our opinion, § 27-4-27 is unambiguous in its sole application to life insurance policies. Title 27 of the General Laws is broadly entitled “Insurance,” and chapter 4 comprises “Life Insurance Policies and Reserves.” We are not convinced by plaintiff’s contention that the language in', '- 10 - § 27-4-27(a) referring to “any insurance contract” should be construed to cover a variable annuity with a death benefit. In our opinion, the plain text of § 27-4-27(a) clearly indicates that the insurable interest requirement applies to life insurance only, as the phrase “any insurance contract upon the life or body of another individual” is synonymous with “life insurance.”', 'Moreover, a review of chapter 4 of title 27 in its entirety reveals that the General Assembly contemplated annuities in some sections of this chapter that governs life insurance policies, but not in others. In the other sections within chapter 4 that mention annuities, the language expressly includes annuities within each of the sections by the use of phrases such as “life insurance and/or annuities” and “all life insurance policy forms and annuity contract forms” in § 27-4-24, “life insurance contract or annuity contract” in § 27-4-26, “[a]ny policy of life or endowment insurance or any annuity contract” in § 27-4-12, and “[e]very individual life insurance policy delivered * * * and every individual annuity contract delivered” in § 27-4-6.1. We therefore conclude that, if the General Assembly intended the insurable interest requirement in § 27-4-27(a) to apply to annuity policies as well as to life insurance policies, then the Legislature would have expressly so indicated within the language of this section. See National Refrigeration, Inc., 88 A.3d at 1156 (stating that “we must consider the entire statute as a whole; individual sections must be considered in the context of the entire statutory scheme, not as if each section were independent of all other sections”); Rhode Island Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Burke, 101 R.I. 644, 647, 226 A.2d 420, 422 (1967) (“If the [L]egislature wished to include in the statute cases of the instant description, it would have said so.”). For this Court to declare that § 27-4-27(a) applies to annuity policies “would strain the clear and unambiguous language thereof and would violate well-established rules of statutory construction.” Rhode Island Dairy Queen, Inc., 101 R.I. at 647, 226 A.2d at 422.', '- 11 -', 'The plaintiff also contends that the insurable interest required by § 27-4-27(a) applies to annuity policies “indirectly” through G.L. 1956 § 27-32-8. Chapter 32 of title 27 governs “Pension, Profit Sharing or Annuity Plans.”', 'Section 27-32-1(a) authorizes life insurance companies to “establish one or more separate accounts, and may allocate to the account or accounts any amounts paid to it which are to be applied under the terms of an * * * agreement to provide annuity or life insurance benefits, * * * payable in fixed or in variable dollar amounts or in both.” Section 27-32-8 states that “[e]xcept as otherwise provided in this chapter, all pertinent provisions of the insurance laws of this state shall apply to separate accounts and agreements relating to them.”', 'Since § 27-32-8’s broad mandate directing attention to “all pertinent provisions of the insurance laws” does not provide any guidance as to which insurance laws would be pertinent to “separate accounts and agreements relating [thereto],” we must consider § 27-32-8 in the context of the “insurance laws” within title 27.', 'As discussed supra, the “insurance laws” within chapter 4 of title 27 that govern “Life Insurance Policies and Reserves” either explicitly include annuity policies within the individual section, or do not pertain to annuity policies because the individual section refers explicitly to life insurance policies only.', 'Since the General Assembly only included express language relating to annuity policies in some of the sections in chapter 4 of title 27, those sections that explicitly refer to annuity policies are the “pertinent provisions of the insurance laws” to which § 27-32-8 refers. Since § 27-4-27(a) does not explicitly include annuity policies, this section is not one of the pertinent provisions that apply to “Pension, Profit Sharing, or Annuity Plans,” and is therefore not indirectly applicable to annuity policies through § 27-32-8.', 'The Life Settlements Act (LSA), enacted in 2009 (P.L. 2009, ch. 195, § 1), also has a role in this discussion. See G.L. 1956 chapter 72 of title 27. The LSA regulates the industry whereby', '- 12 - life insurance policyholders sell their existing life insurance policies to a stranger in exchange for receiving cash payments during their lifetime. See id. Relevant to the certified question before us is that the LSA expressly prohibits stranger-originated life insurance policies (STOLIs). Section 27-72-2(9)(A)(X). A STOLI is defined in § 27-72-2(26) as “a practice or plan to initiate a life insurance policy for the benefit of a third-party investor who, at the time of policy origination, has no insurable interest in the insured.” However, the LSA does not mention annuities at all. See chapter 72 of title 27. The plaintiff argues that the LSA was simply enacted before the General Assembly was aware of Caramadre’s “stranger-originated annuity transactions” (STATs) and that STATs are prohibited “for all the reasons that STOLIs [are] prohibited.” The defendant counters that the LSA was clearly intended to only cover STOLIs because it does not refer to STATs at all. A review of the LSA reveals that it clearly and unambiguously prohibits STOLIs and is silent as to annuities and STATs.', '“When the Legislature has spoken clearly, this Court will not infer a contrary result.” Pierce v. Pierce, 770 A.2d 867, 872 (R.I. 2001). Furthermore, “[i]t is not the function of this [C]ourt to rewrite or to amend statutes enacted by the General Assembly.” Id. (quoting Rhode Island Federation of Teachers, AFT, AFL-CIO v. Sundlun, 595 A.2d 799, 802 (R.I. 1991)); see also Simeone v. Charron, 762 A.2d 442, 448-49 (R.I. 2000) (“[T]his Court will not broaden statutory provisions by judicial interpretation unless such interpretation is necessary and appropriate in carrying out the clear intent or defining the terms of the statute.”).', 'While it is our opinion that the insurable interest requirement, as codified in § 27-4-27, does not apply to an annuity policy with a death benefit, we must also consider whether this kind of annuity, absent an insurable interest, can be classified as a wagering contract and therefore considered void as a matter of public policy. The plaintiff argues that the absence of an insurable', '- 13 - interest renders the policy void because this absence “transforms the agreement into a wagering contract speculating upon the life of a stranger, with the beneficiary profiting upon that stranger’s demise.” The plaintiff further argues that “[t]he public policy considerations that support the common law insurable interest requirement compel its application to contracts that provide a financial incentive for a stranger beneficiary to terminate a person’s life prematurely.” The defendant counterargues that the policy’s “death benefit is not insurance on the life of any person, but a contract measure of the value of the investment by the annuity’s owner, which [plaintiff] has obligated itself to pay upon the annuitant’s death.” The defendant acknowledges the policy that supports the insurable interest requirement, but asserts that plaintiff’s variable annuity policy with a death benefit does not present the same risk because the structure of this annuity protects only the value of the policy owner’s investments. The defendant recommends that plaintiff “avail [itself] of the legislative process” if it wants the insurable interest requirement to apply to annuities as well as to life insurance contracts.', 'As stated supra, “a purely speculative contract on the life of another is * * * objectionable on the grounds of public policy * * * and such a contract may properly be held to be void.” Cronin, 20 R.I. at 572, 40 A. at 497. The well-established elements of a wagering contract include:', '“(1) an agreement by one party to pay another a sum of money, or', 'give something of value, if a certain event happens; (2) a reciprocal', 'agreement by the second party to pay the first a sum of money, or', 'give something of value, if a certain contrary event happens; and', '(3) that the events contemplated in the agreement shall be', 'something other than the passing of a consideration between the', 'parties.” Winward v. Lincoln, 23 R.I. 476, 492, 51 A. 106, 112', '(1902). It is our opinion that the investor/beneficiary’s lack of an insurable interest in the annuitant does not convert this investment into a wagering contract because the investor’s payment of the', '- 14 - premium does not depend on the occurrence of a certain event, and the periodic payouts to the beneficiary do not depend on the occurrence of a contrary event. See id. Both the payments by the investor and the payout by the annuity company are guaranteed by contract. The unknown variables are the timing of the annuitant’s death and whether the investor/beneficiary will either yield a large profit on the investment of its premium in the securities market or simply receive a return of its baseline investment plus interest. We cannot say, therefore, that absent an insurable interest, an annuity with a death benefit is a “purely speculative contract on the life of another.” Cronin, 20 R.I. at 572, 40 A. at 497 (emphasis added). By employing an annuitant with a terminal illness, the investor is taking a risk that its investment will be of limited duration. The benefit of the investment’s limited duration could result in a heightened chance of yielding a big profit if the investor chose to invest the premiums in a high-risk security with large projected short-term gains, with the risk to the investor hedged by the safety net of the death benefit. The investor, therefore, stood to benefit from a no-lose situation. Ultimately, the absence of an insurable interest in an annuity policy with a death benefit does not transform this kind of policy into the classic wagering contract that is prohibited by our public policy. See Winward, 23 R.I. at 492, 51 A. at 112.', 'For the reasons set forth above, this Court concludes that an annuity is not infirm for want of an insurable interest when the owner and beneficiary of an annuity with a death benefit is a stranger to the annuitant.', '- 15 -', 'B', 'Question 2', '“Does a clause in an annuity that purports to make the annuity incontestable from the date of its', 'issuance preclude the maintenance of an action based on the lack of an insurable interest?”', 'This question requires us to consider both whether (1) a clause in an annuity policy that makes the policy incontestable from the date of its issuance is enforceable as a matter of public policy and (2) if this clause is enforceable, whether it bars a cause of action that, if successful, would render the entire annuity policy void. The plaintiff’s position is that, because the policy was void ab initio for the lack of an insurable interest, the incontestability clause in the policy never existed, and therefore cannot be used to preclude plaintiff’s cause of action against defendant. The plaintiff contends that incontestability clauses that take immediate effect have been held unenforceable in other jurisdictions, but acknowledges a split of authority on the enforceability of such clauses, reflecting a policy tension between (1) “promot[ing] freedom of contract and hold[ing] parties to the terms of their agreement,” and (2) “recognizing that the proponent of fraud should not be rewarded and that insurers must be allowed a reasonable [length of] time to detect fraudulent acts.”', 'The defendant’s position is that the incontestability clause precludes plaintiff’s declaratory-judgment claim. The defendant contends that this Court has previously indicated that a term of less than two years for such a clause in an insurance contract could be reasonable and that the common law that has developed in the context of insurance policies should be applied here because plaintiff should be bound by the terms of its own “adhesion contract.” The defendant argues that the clause should also be enforceable against claims of fraud because', '- 16 - plaintiff, as the party issuing the policies, had as much time as it wanted prior to issuance to investigate the veracity of the information provided on the applications for its policies.', 'Similar to the first question certified to us, this second certified question leads us to an examination of the long-standing common law and more recently enacted statutory law. We have long recognized the validity of the two-year incontestability clause in a life insurance policy as a successful defense against any attempt by the insurer to avoid paying out proceeds under the policy, even when the insurer claims fraud. Murray v. State Mutual Life Insurance Co., 22 R.I. 524, 525-26, 48 A. 800, 801 (1901) (stating that “[i]t has repeatedly been held that an agreement limiting the time within which an action may be brought upon a policy of insurance is not against public policy, and may be enforced, though less than the usual time imposed by law has been fixed”). We also commented in Murray that:', '“[T]he parties to a contract may stipulate for a shorter period of', 'limitation than that provided by law as to all matters which might,', 'in the absence of such stipulation, be set up in avoidance of the', 'contract, would seem to be entirely reasonable; and such is the', 'well-settled rule of law.” Id. at 525, 48 A. at 800 (comparing', 'incontestability clauses to statutes of limitation and repose).', 'Section 27-4-6.2(a)(2), enacted in 2007 (P.L. 2007, ch. 134, § 3), requires every life insurance policy to have either “[a] provision that the policy shall be incontestable * * * for a period of two (2) years from its date of issue” or an incontestability provision that “the director [of business regulation] deems to be more favorable to policyholders * * *.” 5 Because the 5', 'Section 27-4-6.2(a), as enacted in P.L. 2007, ch. 134, § 3, provides, in pertinent part, that:', '“All individual life insurance policies, except as otherwise stated', 'herein, delivered or issued for delivery in this state on or after', 'January 1, 2008 shall contain in substance the following', 'provisions, or provisions which the director deems to be more', 'favorable to policyholders.', '“* * *', '- 17 - purpose of an incontestability clause is to protect the insured from the insurer attempting to avoid its obligations to pay the proceeds from a policy when due, it follows that a period of time less than two years would be more protective of the insured and therefore “deem[ed] to be more favorable to policyholders.” Section 27-4-6.2(a); 17 Couch on Insurance § 240:1 (3d ed. 2000); see Murray, 22 R.I. at 525, 48 A. at 800. This statutory section, however, applies only to life insurance policies for the same reasons articulated supra regarding the General Assembly’s explicit reference to annuity policies in some sections of chapter 4 of title 27, but not in others. See National Refrigeration, Inc., 88 A.3d at 1156.', 'Regardless of the context, however, whether an incontestability clause that takes immediate effect is enforceable is an issue of first impression for this Court. According to a leading treatise on contract law, the arguments in favor of sustaining the enforceability of such a clause include: (1) the insurer drafted the clause and so should be bound by it, and (2) the insurer had an unlimited length of time to investigate the policy applicant prior to issuing the policy and could have discovered whatever errors or misrepresentations might have existed before it accepts the risk of issuing a policy to the applicant. 16 Williston on Contracts § 49.97 at 845-46 (4th ed.', '“(2) Incontestability. A provision that the policy shall be', 'incontestable after being in force during the lifetime of the', 'insured for a period of two (2) years from its date of issue, and', 'that, if the policy provides that the death benefit provided by the', 'policy may be increased, or other policy provisions changed,', 'upon the application of the policy-holder and the production of', 'evidence of insurability, the policy with respect to each such', 'increase or change shall be incontestable after two (2) years', 'from the effective date of such increase or change, except in', 'each case for nonpayment of premiums. At the option of the', 'insurer, provisions relating to benefits for total and permanent', 'disability and additional benefits for accidental death may be', 'excepted.”', '- 18 - 2014). The argument against enforcing such a clause is that public policy strives to discourage fraud by not allowing a perpetrator of fraud to profit from the fraudulent behavior. Id.', 'This Court has previously stated, however, that an incontestability clause is effective even against a defense of fraud because:', '“Where parties enter into a contract which from its nature affords', 'an opportunity to one party to perpetrate a fraud upon another, and', 'it is stipulated therein that the party who is liable to be defrauded', 'shall have a specified time in which to make inquiry as to the acts', 'and conduct of the other party, he is on notice, by the very terms of', 'the contract itself, that fraud may be involved in it, and the duty is', 'upon him to commence at once an investigation into the acts,', 'conduct, and representations of the other party; and if the time', 'fixed is such that the information which would show that the fraud', 'had been perpetrated could have been, by the exercise of ordinary', 'diligence, obtained, then the parties are bound by their contract as', 'to time, and after the lapse of that time fraud is no longer a', 'defense. This does not violate in any way the well-settled principle', 'that fraud is to be abhorred, vitiates everything it touches, and the', 'person guilty of it is not to be countenanced in any way by the', 'courts. While all this is true, it is equally well settled that a contract', 'which has for its foundation a willful fraud may become vitalized', 'and enforceable by the negligence of the party who was the victim', 'of the fraud.” Murray, 22 R.I. at 526-27, 48 A. at 801 (quoting', 'Massachusetts Benefit Life Ass’n v. Robinson, 30 S.E. 918, 925', '(1898)). Therefore, the argument that an incontestability clause is unenforceable against a claim or defense of fraud will not prevail in this Court. See id. Whether an incontestability clause that takes immediate effect is included in an insurance policy or in an annuity policy, it is our opinion that the clause is enforceable against all attempts to escape the “deliberately assumed obligation[s]” contained within these contracts. See id. at 526, 48 A. at 801. The following comment that we made in Murray over a century ago remains salient today in the face of evolving products in the financial industry:', '“That the company holds out the [incontestability clause] as an', 'inducement to people to insure, * * * no one can, for a moment,', '- 19 -', 'doubt. It clearly gives every one to understand that, no matter', 'what mistakes may be made in the answers to the numerous', 'questions propounded in the application, which answers are', 'declared therein to be warranties, no advantage can be taken', 'thereof by the company after the expiration of the time limited in', 'the agreement; that his rights under the policy and the rights of', 'those in whose favor it is drawn will then become absolute; and', 'that the beneficiary, after the death of the insured, and perhaps', 'long after the death of all those who knew the facts relating to the', 'transaction, will not be forced into a lawsuit to determine whether', 'the policy ever had any legal force or validity. * * * To hold the', 'company bound by such an undertaking is not to violate any rule of', 'public policy, but is simply to compel it to fulfill its plain and', 'deliberately assumed obligation.” Id. We find it ironic that the plaintiff, the party who drafted the immediately effective incontestability clause, is now seeking to invalidate the clause so that it can escape its obligations under the annuity policy. We are mindful that such a clause could have harsh consequences, especially in light of the appeal currently pending in the First Circuit. Nevertheless, in light of our long-established common law regarding the effect of, and purpose behind, incontestability clauses, it is our opinion that an incontestability clause that takes immediate effect is enforceable, precluding all causes of action that seek to invalidate the policy.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we answer question one in the negative and question two in the affirmative. The papers in the case may be returned to the First Circuit.', 'Robinson, J., with whom Indeglia, J., joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I am pleased to be able to concur with the majority’s opinion with respect to the second question certified to this Court by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit—i.e.,', '- 20 - that a clause in an annuity that purports to make the annuity incontestable from the date of its issuance precludes the maintenance of an action based on the lack of an insurable interest. However, I must respectfully dissent from the majority’s opinion with respect to the first certified question. After an extensive review of this Court’s precedent, it is my firm belief that, if the owner and beneficiary of an annuity with a death benefit like the one at issue in this case is a stranger to the annuitant, the annuity is indeed infirm for want of an insurable interest. In my judgment, such an annuity would be an illegal wagering contract and, consequently, void ab initio.', 'I concede that, as a matter of both statutory and common law, the annuity at issue in this case cannot be considered the equivalent of a life insurance contract; the two are indeed “separate and distinct.” Thus, I agree with the majority that the annuity cannot simplistically be treated as our precedent and the General Laws have treated life insurance contracts. However, it is my firm opinion that the focus of this case should not be on asking whether or not the annuity at issue, which contains the “Double Enhanced Death Benefit,” is definitionally distinct from a life insurance policy; rather, the focus should be on addressing whether or not the “Double Enhanced Death Benefit” makes this annuity a wagering contract which this Court should refuse to enforce as a matter of venerable and sound public policy. 1 While the majority does address whether this annuity is a wagering contract, I simply cannot assent to its analysis or its ultimate conclusion that this annuity is not a wagering contract. 1', 'I note that, even though the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit certified only two specific questions to this Court, in its opinion certifying those questions, it stated that it was “uncertain as to whether the [annuity] constitutes an unenforceable wagering contract” and that “[w]hether an insurable interest was required for the [annuity] may * * * depend on whether it can be fairly characterized as a contract wagering on life.” Western Reserve Life Assurance Co. of Ohio v. ADM Associates, LLC, 737 F.3d 135, 141, 142 (1st Cir. 2013).', '- 21 -', 'Certain wagering contracts have long been regarded as detrimental to society—the spread of life insurance in England “led to widespread gambling by the middle class on the lives of prominent people” and “attempt[s] to hasten * * * payouts when possible,” resulting, in 1774, in the requirement of an insurable interest in the life of the insured. Maria Fleisher, Stranger Originated Life Insurance: Finding a Modern Cure for an Age-Old Problem, 41 Cumb. L. Rev. 569, 571 (2011). Likewise, courts in this country have long held that a contract for insurance upon the life of another requires an insurable interest in the person whose life is insured; the insurable interest requirement makes it “less likely tha[t] criminals at large [will] attempt to compass [the insured’s] death.” Grigsby v. Russell, 222 U.S. 149, 155 (1911); see also Cronin v. Vermont Life Insurance Co., 20 R.I. 570, 571-72, 40 A. 497, 497 (1898).', 'Furthermore, the United States Supreme Court has stated that a contract which is a “mere wager” on the death of another “ha[s] a tendency to create a desire for the event. They are, therefore, independently of any statute on the subject, condemned, as being against public policy.” Warnock v. Davis, 104 U.S. 775, 779 (1881). Our Court has also consistently taken the position that certain wagering contracts are void; in Cronin, 20 R.I. at 572, 40 A. at 497 (as the majority recognizes), we stated that “a purely speculative contract on the life of another is * * * objectionable, on the grounds of public policy, * * * and such a contract may properly be held to be void.” 2 See also Winward v. Lincoln, 23 R.I. 476, 492, 51 A. 106, 112 (1902); Flagg v. Gilpin, 17 R.I. 10, 12-13, 19 A. 1084, 1084-85 (1890); Clark v. Allen, 11 R.I. 439, 443-44 2', 'The majority notes that, in Cronin v. Vermont Life Insurance Co., 20 R.I. 570, 572, 40 A. 497, 497 (1898), this Court stated that an annuity, even though it may contain “element[s] of chance,” is not infirm for lack of an insurable interest. However, we attributed that fact to a public policy decision. Id. The annuity at issue here contains the “Double Enhanced Death Benefit” and, thus, is not governed by our general statement in Cronin; rather, as the Court in Cronin indicated, we should look to our precedent regarding contracts which are void as against public policy in order to assess the annuity at issue in this case.', '- 22 - (1877). In the course of addressing wagering contracts dealing with the price of commodities, this Court memorably stated:', '“[S]uch contracts are against public policy because they tend to', 'unsettle the natural course of trade, and tempt the parties to them to', 'work for a rise or fall in the prices of the commodities on which', 'their wagers are laid, without regard to actual values, and by', 'methods calculated to promote their own profit at the expense or', 'ruin of others, without reciprocity of benefit. And besides these', 'evils there are others, more immediate to the parties, culminating', 'from time to time in loss of fortune and character, defalcations,', 'crime, and domestic misery, evils which, though they do not', 'always follow, yet follow so often that they have not been', 'overlooked by the courts.” Flagg, 17 R.I. at 13, 19 A. at 1085', '(emphasis added); see Winward, 23 R.I. at 492, 51 A. at 112', '(stating that wagering contracts are contrary to public policy). As early as 1902, this Court recognized that “[w]agering-contracts * * * are now held to be void and nonenforcible.” Winward, 23 R.I. at 492, 51 A. at 112. We added that it was “clear that in the opinion of the [L]egislature public policy forbids the enforcement of all wagers by our courts * * *.” Id.; cf. Vogel v. Catala, 63 A.3d 519, 521 n. 3 (R.I. 2013) (referencing G.L. 1956 § 11-19-17, which states that “[a]ll * * * promises, given or made * * * for the repayment of money knowingly lent for * * * betting, shall be utterly void”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In addition to those specific statements regarding wagering contracts, in the very first opinion published by this Court, while refusing to enforce a bet on an election “as tending to debase the character,” we stated that “[i]f a contract [has] a tendency to a mischievous consequence it is void.” Stoddard v. Martin, 1 R.I. 1, 4-5 (1828); see also Peter J. Comerford, Stoddard v. Martin: A Rhode Island Tale, 62 R.I. B.J. 13, 16 (March/April 2014) (stating that the bet at issue in Stoddard was unenforceable because it tended to cause the parties to act immorally). Our jurisprudence also indicates that “a contract term is unenforceable * * * if it', '- 23 - violates public policy” and that such a contract term violates public policy if it is “injurious to the interest of the public, * * * interferes with the public welfare or safety, * * * is unconscionable[,] or * * * tends to injustice or oppression.” NV One, LLC v. Potomac Realty Capital, LLC, 84 A.3d 800, 807 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Gorman v. St. Raphael Academy, 853 A.2d 28, 39 (R.I. 2004).', 'Thus, a thorough and careful review of our precedent leads me to the conclusion that, if the annuity at issue, which significantly includes the “Double Enhanced Death Benefit,” can be said to be a wagering contract and against public policy, it is void, regardless of whether we title it an annuity or a life insurance contract. My careful review of the record has led me to the definite conviction that the annuity at issue in this case is indeed an illicit (and void) wagering contract.', 'In reaching my conclusion, I have focused on the fact that the annuity in question bears the hallmarks of a wagering contract of the type which this Court has condemned, regardless of the fact that it cannot be classified as a life insurance contract. See Winward, 23 R.I. at 492, 51 A. at 112. If one turns to the reason that certain wagering contracts were determined to be void without an insurable interest—namely, the concern that the individual who would profit from the death of the other individual involved has a motive to potentially harm that individual—it becomes clear that the annuity in this case is an impermissible wagering contract. See Grigsby, 222 U.S. at 155; Warnock, 104 U.S. at 779. The same concern for the well-being of the insured that was focused upon in Grigsby and Warnock is present in this case. This annuity allows the owner of the annuity to gamble on how well his or her investments will be doing at the time of the death of the annuitant. Due to the “Double Enhanced Death Benefit,” if the market is performing well, the owner of the annuity would have an incentive to end the life of the', '- 24 - annuitant in order to reap a larger gain. I acknowledge, however, that it could also be the case that the market is doing poorly and that the “Double Enhanced Death Benefit” would provide the owner of the annuity with just the value of what he or she has put into the annuity plus interest, upon the death of the annuitant. But the fact that there is one feasible set of circumstances under which there would be no motive to harm the annuitant does not change the fact that there are circumstances created by the “Double Enhanced Death Benefit” whereby the owner of the annuity would have a strong incentive to harm the annuitant. Such a contract is at odds with the best interest and safety of the public and, in my judgment, could lead to “injustice or oppression.” NV One, LLC, 84 A.3d at 807. Thus, it is my view that the annuity at issue cannot be reconciled with important and venerable principles of public policy. Id.; see also Grigsby, 222 U.S. at 155; Warnock, 104 U.S. at 779.', 'Moreover, I would point out that it could certainly be said that the annuity at issue, which includes the “Double Enhanced Death Benefit,” is a contract that has a “tendency to a mischievous consequence,” such as the one we struck down in Stoddard, 1 R.I. at 4. Indeed, this particular annuity scheme did lead to mischievous consequences; it led to an array of criminal charges, and it also led to a loss of “fortune and character” for Joseph Caramadre—a further indication that the annuity is against public policy. Flagg, 17 R.I. at 13, 19 A. at 1085; see also Western Reserve Life Assurance Co. of Ohio v. ADM Associates, LLC, 737 F.3d 135, 138 n. 2 (1st Cir. 2013) (noting that Mr. Caramadre had, at the time, been charged with “sixty-five counts of fraud, conspiracy, identity theft, and money laundering” and citing United States v. Caramadre, 882 F. Supp. 2d 302, 304 (D.R.I. 2012)).', 'In responding to the argument made by the majority, I find it desirable to address how to define a wagering contract and how to contextualize the particular definitional language in', '- 25 - Winward, 23 R.I. at 492, 51 A. at 112, on which the majority relies. The opinion in Winward defined a wagering contract as follows:', '“[(1)] an agreement by one party to pay another a sum of money,', 'or give something of value if a certain event happens; and [(2)] a', 'reciprocal agreement by the second party to pay the first a sum of', 'money or give something of value if a certain contrary event', 'happens; and, [(3)] that the events contemplated in the agreement', 'shall be something other than the passing of a consideration', 'between the parties.” Winward, 23 R.I. at 492, 51 A. at 112. The majority contends that the annuity before us does not fit within the parameters of the just- quoted definition. The majority also contends that the annuity at issue, which contains the “Double Enhanced Death Benefit,” is not a wagering contract because it is not “purely speculative.” Cronin, 20 R.I. at 572, 40 A. at 497. In my opinion, however, the majority errs by rather myopically focusing on the specific language in Winward and Cronin, while simultaneously disregarding our voluminous precedent, discussed supra, with respect to contracts which are against public policy. I would also point out that the definition in Winward was articulated well over a century ago, and the drafters thereof could not have foreseen and taken into account an annuity like the one at issue in this case, which so very significantly contains the “Double Enhanced Death Benefit.” Moreover, a wagering contract can also be defined as “[a] contract made entirely for sport, the performance depending on the happening of an uncertain event.” 3 Black’s Law Dictionary 399 (10th ed. 2014). That definition would arguably apply to 3', 'Following the above-quoted definition, in way of further explanation, Black’s Law Dictionary provides as follows:', '“Although wagering and gaming agreements were generally', 'enforceable under the English common law, they were condemned', 'in most American states, in part because they were thought to', 'encourage shiftlessness, poverty, and immorality, and in part[]', 'because they were regarded as too frivolous to be worthy of', 'judicial attention.

On April 5, 2012, a Providence County Superior Court jury found the defendant, Elizabeth Mendez, guilty of possession of more than five kilograms of marijuana in violation of G.L. 1956 § 21-28-4.01.2(a)(5).1 On May 24, 2012, the trial justice sentenced the defendant to twenty years imprisonment, with five years to serve and the remaining time suspended with probation.', 'On appeal, defendant contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in his supplemental jury instruction given in response to a question posed by the jury; (2) that the trial justice erred in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial; and (3) that defendant’s twenty-year sentence is violative of Article 1, Section 8 of the Rhode Island Constitution. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The cited statute provides, in pertinent part, as follows: “Except as authorized by the chapter, it shall be unlawful for any person to possess, manufacture, sell, or deliver the following enumerated quantities of certain controlled substances: * * * (5) More than five kilograms (5 kgs.) of a mixture containing a detectable amount of marijuana[.]” G.L. 1956 § 21-28- 4.01.2(a)(5).', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On January 20, 2011, defendant was charged by indictment with one count of possession of more than five kilograms of marijuana in violation of § 21-28-4.01.2(a)(5), (b) (Count 1); one count of conspiracy to possess more than five kilograms of marijuana in violation of § 21-28- 4.08 (Count 2); and one count of possession of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)2 in violation of § 21-28-4.01(c)(2)(i) (Count 4).3 In that same indictment, two co-defendants were similarly charged with possession of more than five kilograms of marijuana and conspiracy to possess more than five kilograms of marijuana.4 Those co-defendants, Osvaldo German and Jonathan Espinal, were not tried with defendant.5', 'The defendant’s criminal trial began in March of 2012, and the evidence presented therein included testimony from Trooper Marc Alboum of the Rhode Island State Police, Officer Diego Mello of the East Providence Police Department, Officer Raymond Reall of the North 2', 'Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, more commonly known as ecstasy or MDMA, is a type of psychoactive drug which “produces feelings of increased energy, euphoria, emotional warmth, and distortions in time, perception, and tactile experiences.” Vasquez v.

The Testimony of Trooper Marc Alboum', 'The state began its case with the testimony of Trooper Alboum of the Rhode Island State Police. Trooper Alboum testified that, while he was on patrol in his cruiser on the night of July 26, 2010, he heard a broadcast on his police radio about a carjacking at gunpoint in the city of Providence, specifically at the intersection of Admiral Street and Hawkins Street. Trooper Alboum stated that the broadcast described the carjacking suspects as “two dark-skinned males * * * wearing white T-shirts,” and he added that the broadcast described the car as a “light blue Kia minivan.” He further testified that he heard in a later broadcast that the carjacked vehicle had been recovered in a Walgreens parking lot. Trooper Alboum testified that he proceeded to that location; he said that, at the Walgreens, there were law enforcement officers from several police departments all “standing around.” In his testimony, Trooper Alboum estimated that there were around fifteen to twenty officers in uniform at the scene. 6', 'We omit from our discussion the testimony of Trooper Ernest Adams, Trooper Luke Shatz, and Trooper Herbert Tilson, as their testimony has no direct bearing on defendant’s contentions on appeal. In addition, we reference only where necessary the testimony of two forensic scientists, Paul Breault and Paul Steven Iwuc. The forensic testing undertaken by those scientists, performed in order to identify the substances found in defendant’s car, need not be revisited in detail here. The parties do not dispute on appeal that both MDMA and marijuana were discovered in defendant’s vehicle, nor do the parties dispute the amounts found therein.', '-3-', 'Next, Trooper Alboum testified that, while he was standing in the Walgreens parking lot, he observed a black Nissan Maxima drive past. Trooper Alboum testified that he could see that the driver of the Nissan Maxima was a woman and that in the car there were two male passengers, both dark-skinned and wearing white T-shirts. Trooper Alboum also testified that the driver of the Nissan Maxima was “staring straight ahead” as she passed the Walgreens parking lot and that her two passengers were “slouching down,” while also “looking straight ahead.” Trooper Alboum further testified that the behavior of the occupants of that car stood out in contrast to what was transpiring in the other cars passing by, in that the occupants of the latter cars were turning their heads in the direction of what Trooper Alboum testified was a “large police presence” in the parking lot.', 'Trooper Alboum then testified that, after observing the occupants of the Nissan Maxima, he proceeded to “run an inquiry” on the vehicle’s license plate and discovered that the license plate affixed to the Nissan Maxima “came back [registered to] a 2000 silver Toyota.” Trooper Alboum stated that “the registration [did not] match the vehicle.” It was Trooper Alboum’s testimony that, after that discovery, he started his cruiser and began to follow the Nissan Maxima. He further testified that he “clock[ed]” it as traveling at 45 miles per hour in a 25 mile per hour zone. Trooper Alboum stated that the Nissan Maxima proceeded to enter Route 146 and that, as it did so, it entered “right behind [another] vehicle, nearly striking it.” Trooper Alboum testified that, as he followed the Nissan Maxima onto Route 146, he activated his lights and siren; he added that the Nissan Maxima nonetheless continued without stopping. Trooper Alboum stated that it was only after another police cruiser passed the Nissan Maxima in the high speed lane, positioned itself in front of the vehicle, and slowed down, that the Nissan Maxima slowed and eventually stopped.', '-4-', 'Trooper Alboum then testified that, after exiting his cruiser, he approached the Nissan Maxima and that, as he did so, he could smell “the odor of fresh marijuana” emanating from the back of that vehicle. He further testified that he approached the driver’s side of the car and asked all of the occupants to “put their hands up;” Trooper Alboum stated that he made this request in order to “see everyone’s hands to make sure they didn’t have any weapons in their hands * * * .” He testified that, although all of the occupants initially complied, he observed that Mr. Espinal, the passenger seated behind the driver’s seat, was “starting to put his hands down.”7 It was Trooper Alboum’s testimony that he asked Mr. Espinal to step out of the car, searched him for weapons, and handcuffed him, before finally placing him in the back of the police cruiser.', 'Trooper Alboum testified that he then returned to the Nissan Maxima and approached the driver’s side. It was Trooper Alboum’s testimony that, at that point in time, he could detect the odor of burnt marijuana coming from inside the vehicle. He testified that he asked defendant, the driver of the car, for her license and that, when she began to reach toward the floor of the car, he asked her to step out of the car.8 He said that he made that request because “it’s not normal that people reach for their licenses on the floor of the vehicle.”', 'Trooper Alboum further testified that, after defendant stepped out of the car, he “sent her * * * towards the other troopers;” he added that he did not handcuff her himself, because his “set of handcuffs was on Mr. Espinal.”9 Trooper Alboum next testified that he checked under the 7', 'During his testimony at trial, Trooper Alboum identified the person seated behind the driver as co-defendant Jonathan Espinal. 8', 'During Trooper Alboum’s in-court testimony, he identified defendant as being the driver of the car on the night of July 26, 2010. 9', 'Although Trooper Alboum was not able to testify specifically as to the details of defendant’s arrest because he neither arrested defendant personally nor observed another officer effectuating the arrest, it is apparent from the record that the arrest occurred after Trooper', '-5- floor mat on the driver’s side (where defendant had been sitting) and found a “clear plastic baggy with a half a blue pill” inside.10 He added that Officer Raymond Reall of the North Providence Police Department searched the other passenger, Mr. German, and in the course of that search found a “plastic bag” containing what appeared to be marijuana.11 It was Trooper Alboum’s testimony that, following that discovery, he embarked on a more thorough search of the car with the assistance of another law enforcement officer—namely, Officer Reall, who had accompanied him in a separate cruiser in the pursuit of the Nissan Maxima onto Route 146.', 'Trooper Alboum stated that, in the course of the more thorough search, he opened the trunk of the Nissan Maxima and immediately observed “two rectangular objects that had a clearish green plastic baggy on it [sic].” In addition, Trooper Alboum noted that the odor of fresh marijuana “increased * * * significant[ly]” once he had opened the trunk. According to Trooper Alboum’s testimony, a complete search of the trunk yielded six such “rectangular objects” (which he described as “bales”) covered in “greenish clear cellophane wrap.” Later testimony at trial by one of the state’s forensic scientists was to the effect that the bales contained marijuana and that the total weight of the marijuana was approximately thirty kilograms.12', 'Trooper Alboum further testified that, on July 27, 2010 (the morning after the arrests of defendant, Mr. German, and Mr. Espinal), Mr. German agreed to make a statement, and he was Alboum asked defendant to step out of the car and sent her in the direction of the other law enforcement officers at the scene. 10', 'One of the forensic scientists who testified for the state indicated that his testing demonstrated that the blue pill contained MDMA. 11', 'When Officer Reall testified during defendant’s trial, he stated that the marijuana was found during a patdown of Mr. German’s clothing. 12', 'One kilogram is the equivalent of approximately 2.2 pounds in the system of weights commonly used in this country. See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 966 (5th ed. 2011). Accordingly, the bales referred to in the text weighed approximately sixty- six pounds.', '-6- advised of his constitutional rights at that time.', 'The trooper testified that his subsequent discussion with Mr. German lasted approximately twenty to thirty minutes; he added that the discussion was thereafter memorialized in a six-page “formal typed statement” (hereinafter “the unsigned statement”). Trooper Alboum stated that Mr. German initialed each of the first five pages of the unsigned statement, but did not sign it or check a box indicating that the “above statement was true to the best of [his] knowledge.” Trooper Alboum further testified that he (Trooper Alboum) thereafter changed the last line of the unsigned statement and that the resulting version of the statement was read and signed by Mr. German (hereinafter “the signed statement”). According to Trooper Alboum’s testimony, the two statements were substantively identical, with the exception of the last line.', 'Trooper Alboum first testified concerning the contents of Mr. German’s unsigned statement. He stated that, in the course of his conversation with Mr. German about the events leading to defendant’s arrest, Mr. German told him that defendant had come and picked up Mr. Espinal and Mr. German around 6 or 7 p.m. on what would be the night of the arrest. Trooper Alboum then testified that Mr. German said that a friend named Felix had called and told Mr. German that he had marijuana and wanted to know if Mr. German could “get rid of it.” Trooper Alboum further testified that Mr. German also told him that Felix then said that he had “something for Ellie”13 and that Mr. German should “come get it.” Trooper Alboum stated that Mr. German then said that defendant, who was in the car with Mr. German and Mr. Espinal, could hear the phone conversation between Mr. German and Felix and that Mr. German subsequently directed defendant to drive to the location where they would meet Felix. 13', 'It was Trooper Alboum’s testimony that Mr. German “specifically used the word ‘Ellie’ to refer to the defendant.”', '-7-', 'It was Trooper Alboum’s further testimony that he asked Mr. German why defendant would be the one to “get rid” of the marijuana and that Mr. German replied: “Because she [(Ms. Mendez)] is the one that sells it.” Trooper Alboum stated that Mr. German said that defendant was “fully aware” that there was a large amount of marijuana in her car on the night of her arrest. Finally, Trooper Alboum testified that, when he asked Mr. German whether he had anything to add to his first statement, Mr. German stated: “It was not my weed. It was Elizabeth’s weed.” Trooper Alboum testified that Mr. German refused to sign anything at that point in time.', 'Finally, Trooper Alboum testified that, after Mr. German opted not to sign the first statement (the unsigned statement), Trooper Alboum prepared another statement (the signed statement) in which he asked Mr. German the same series of questions, and Mr. German replied with exactly the same answers, with one exception. Trooper Alboum explained that, as he finished preparing the signed statement, he again asked Mr. German whether he had anything to add, and Mr. German replied: “The marijuana was all mine, and I am taking the hit for it all.” Trooper Alboum stated that, after the just-quoted assertion by Mr. German as to the marijuana being “all his” was added, Mr. German signed the second statement.', '2. The Testimony of Officer Diego Mello', 'Officer Diego Mello of the East Providence Police Department also testified for the state. He testified that, on the day of defendant’s arrest, he was working as the Vice Unit sergeant in the North Main Street area of Providence and that he responded to a BOLO14 concerning a “blue Kia minivan” that had been reported as having been carjacked by “two Hispanic males with guns.” Officer Mello testified that he heard on the police radio that the carjacking occurred in the Hawkins Street area of Providence and that the minivan was last seen heading towards 14', 'Officer Mello testified that the acronym “BOLO” stands for “be on the lookout.” See also State v. Austin, No. 2013-77, 2015 WL 1954726 at *8 n. 4 (R.I. May 1, 2015).', '-8- Branch Avenue. He stated that he responded to that area and “[t]ried to figure out the fastest route out of Providence,” which, in his opinion, “would be the route that they [the carjackers] would have taken.” Officer Mello testified that he determined that the fastest route would be Charles Street, heading outbound towards North Providence; he stated that he proceeded to drive along that route, eventually discovering the blue Kia minivan parked in the Walgreens parking lot. It was his testimony that, after he located the minivan, he “contacted dispatch” with the vehicle’s description, and it was confirmed that the vehicle which he had discovered was the carjacked Kia minivan.', 'Officer Mello further testified that he stayed at the scene and continued to pay attention to the ambient activity; in particular, he said that he could observe the cars that were passing by and that he “looked in every one.” He indicated that it was a “sunny summer day” and that he could see the people inside the passing cars. He also testified that he was “able to see which way the drivers of those [passing] cars were looking[.]” Officer Mello added that there was a “heavy police presence” at the Walgreens parking lot; he specified that there were “about 12 police officers, [and] maybe a half dozen police cars [with] their lights on * * *.”', 'Officer Mello next testified that he observed a Nissan Maxima pass by the parking lot and that he could see its occupants. He noted that the passengers were Hispanic males, matching the description in the BOLO that he had heard earlier. It was Officer Mello’s testimony that the occupants of the Nissan Maxima acted in a way that “raised a major red flag” for him; he said that, as the Nissan Maxima approached the Walgreens parking lot, in which there was the above- described “heavy police presence,” the occupants “were just fixated straight ahead.” Officer Mello elaborated on this observation as follows:', '“Everyone else was looking in our direction wanting to see what', 'was going on, just like [when] you pass a car accident, everyone', '-9-', 'looks to see what’s going on. In this case every single person in', 'the [Nissan Maxima] was just fixated straight ahead. They acted', 'as though we weren’t even there.” Officer Mello proceeded to testify that he observed Trooper Alboum and Officer Reall depart to follow the Nissan Maxima, while he stayed at the scene and participated in a search of the Kia minivan.', '3. The Testimony of Officer Raymond Reall', 'Officer Raymond Reall of the North Providence Police Department also testified for the state. He stated that, on the night of defendant’s arrest, he heard a BOLO concerning a stolen vehicle taken at gunpoint; he added that this information brought him to the Charles Street area in North Providence, where he was joined by Trooper Alboum. Officer Reall further testified that the stolen vehicle was recovered in a Walgreens parking lot and that he was “dispatched” to that location. It was Officer Reall’s testimony that, once there, he and Trooper Alboum made “sure there was nobody inside of [the vehicle].” He testified that, as he waited with Trooper Alboum for the arrival of Providence law enforcement, he observed “[q]uite a few” more police officers come to the scene. He stated that “every single car that * * * stop[ped] at the red light [on Charles Street] looked over to see what was going on due to the fact [that] there [were] several police cars and people running around over there.” He further testified, however, that he noticed one car whose occupants did the opposite; specifically, he testified as follows:', '“There was a vehicle that was stopped at the red light on Charles', 'Street; and I noticed that there was a person sitting in the passenger', 'seat front [of the vehicle] with a white T-shirt, and there was also', 'a[] Hispanic male in the back with a white T-shirt; and that was the', 'description given from the BOLO from Providence. * * * [T]hey', 'would not look over at the parking lot where the police were.” Officer Reall next testified that, after making that observation, he entered his police cruiser and attempted to catch up to the just-referenced vehicle so that he could stop and question its', '- 10 - occupants. His testimony mirrored that of Trooper Alboum as he recounted the details of his pursuit of the Nissan Maxima and his eventual success at pulling the Nissan Maxima over into the breakdown lane of Route 146.', 'Officer Reall stated that, once the Nissan Maxima was on Route 146, it continued to travel “at a high rate of speed;” he added that he “went into the left lane * * * passed Trooper Alboum’s car, passed the [Nissan] Maxima, and got in front of the [Nissan] Maxima and slowed it down * * *.” He said that his cruiser and the Nissan Maxima “veered off into the breakdown lane,” eventually coming to a stop. Officer Reall testified that he and Trooper Alboum exited their cruisers to approach the Nissan Maxima.', 'It was Officer Reall’s testimony that he approached the Nissan Maxima on the passenger side and told the front-seat passenger and the other occupants of the car to “put their hands on the roof.” Officer Reall testified that he later learned that the name of the front-seat passenger was Osvaldo German.', 'Officer Reall proceeded to testify that he took “the passenger [(Mr. German)] out” of the Nissan Maxima and searched him. He stated that, upon searching Mr. German, he discovered marijuana in Mr. German’s front pocket.15 Officer Reall then testified that, following that discovery, he “released [Mr. German] to the custody of the Rhode Island State Police * * * [because] [t]hey ha[d] jurisdiction.” Officer Reall stated at trial that, after releasing Mr. German to the custody of the State Police, he helped the State Police search the Nissan Maxima. He testified that he searched the front passenger area, but did not find anything; he added, however, that he became aware of a “strong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle,” which odor he stated was that of “fresh” marijuana. Officer Reall further testified that, when the trunk of the 15', 'Subsequent testimony for the state by Paul Steven Iwuc, a forensic scientist with the Department of Health, indicated that the substance discovered in Officer Reall’s search of Mr. German was, in fact, marijuana.', '- 11 - Nissan Maxima was opened, the odor of marijuana “increased.” Officer Reall concluded his testimony on direct examination by stating that, although he was not present when the contents of the trunk were unloaded, he did observe marijuana inside the trunk as he assisted in the search of the Nissan Maxima.', '4. The Testimony of Osvaldo German', 'Mr. German, one of the co-defendants, also testified as a witness for the state. He stated that defendant is the mother of his son, who was about two years old at the time of trial. Mr. German further testified about the events that took place on the night of defendant’s arrest—July 26, 2010.', 'Specifically, Mr. German testified that, on that night, he was a passenger in defendant’s black Nissan Maxima; he said that they were traveling on Charles Street towards Route 146 and that, when the car reached the highway, he observed “cops behind [them] with the lights on.” It was Mr. German’s testimony that the Nissan Maxima eventually stopped on Route 146 because they were “getting pulled over.” Mr. German stated that law enforcement officers approached the Nissan Maxima “with their guns drawn telling [him and the other occupants of the car] to get out, put [their] hands up.” Mr. German further testified that the law enforcement officers “took [them] out of the car” and that he was searched—during which search “a small amount of weed” was discovered. It was Mr. German’s testimony that, after that discovery, law enforcement officers “put the cuffs” on him and then put him into a police car.', 'Mr. German proceeded to testify concerning what took place at the Rhode Island State Police barracks, where he was taken after his arrest. He stated that, on the night of July 26, “there [were] a whole bunch of cops there [at the barracks] that [were] asking me questions;” he added, however, that he “didn’t answer them.”', '- 12 -', 'Mr. German went on to testify that, on the morning of the next day, July 27, he was brought into a room and was asked “more questions.” In particular, when asked whether he recalled speaking with any police officers, Mr. German testified that he thought he remembered speaking to Trooper Alboum, whom he identified sitting at counsel table,16 as well as another police officer who had been in the courtroom earlier that day.', 'Mr. German next stated that he did not remember what he and the officer talked about, but he added that he did remember that the officer “was typing” during their discussion. However, Mr. German added that the officer “wasn’t typing what I was saying.” Mr. German also stated that the officer “was just asking questions.” When asked what the officer’s questions “dealt with,” Mr. German responded: “[F]irst they went from a van, then they went [to] the weed.” The prosecutor’s questions then turned to the details of “the weed,” asking Mr. German: “And the five kilograms of weed, what did the [officer] ask you about it?” In response to that question, Mr. German testified that, when the officer had asked him whether the weed was his, he responded in the affirmative. However, when the prosecutor asked whether claiming the weed as his own was what Mr. German had “first told” the officer, Mr. German testified that he did not know what he first told the officer.', 'At that point in his testimony, after stating that he was not sure what he “first told” the officer, Mr. German recounted his version of events with respect to the unsigned and signed statements. Specifically, Mr. German stated:', '“[W]hen I first talked to [the officer], he went and print out [sic] a', 'paper, and when he brung the paper back, it was not what I had 16', 'It will be recalled that Trooper Alboum testified that he interviewed Mr. German on July 27. In addition, Mr. German stated that he thought he remembered talking to Trooper Alboum. Accordingly, it can fairly be inferred that the “police officer” with whom Mr. German recalled conversing at the barracks was Trooper Alboum.', '- 13 -', 'told him. And I told him I take full responsibility for everything,', 'that the weed was all mine; and I didn’t talk to him after that.”17 Yet when asked by the prosecutor about the second statement (the signed statement), which contained the above-referenced assertion by Mr. German that “the weed was all [his],” Mr. German testified that he did not remember what he (Mr. German) was talking about at that time. In addition, when asked by the prosecutor: “[I]s that exactly what you said, ‘The weed’s all mine’?” Mr. German responded: “I don’t remember what I said.” Mr. German’s testimony continued in that vein, with Mr. German frequently answering “I don’t remember” to questions with respect to his discussion with the officer and with respect to the unsigned and signed statements.', 'Mr. German was then given the opportunity to review his signed statement, and he thereafter stated that he remembered “saying that the marijuana’s all [his] and [he’ll] take full responsibility for everything,” but that he “didn’t say [he’ll] take the hit for it all.” In Mr. German’s testimony, he characterized the difference between what he said and what was reflected in the signed statement as “the same issue with the other paper [the unsigned statement], why [he] didn’t sign; because [the officer] was typing, [Mr. German would] say one thing, [and the officer would] put another.”', 'With respect to the events of the night of defendant’s arrest, Mr. German testified that it was he who put the marijuana in the car and that, as far as he knew, defendant “didn’t know anything about it.” In addition, when engaged in a colloquy with the prosecutor concerning the details of his plea agreement, Mr. German indicated that he had believed at the time that he entered into the agreement that Ms. Mendez “was out of the indictment;” he said that he “would 17', 'It is readily apparent from Mr. German’s testimony that his reference to “the paper” is meant to refer to the unsigned statement; Trooper Alboum testified that it was the first document that he drafted during their discussion, which document Mr. German did not sign.', '- 14 - have signed [the plea agreement] as long as the charges [were] dropped against her.” The following exchange between the prosecutor and Mr. German is in the same vein:', '“Q', 'What was most important to you, you would have signed', 'anything as long as the defendant, her name wasn’t brought', 'into it?', '“A', 'Yes, cause she had nothing to do with it.” In sum, Mr. German’s testimony at trial indicated that he remembered very little about the conversations that resulted in the unsigned and signed statements and that the only thing he remembered was stating that he would take “full responsibility” for the marijuana.', 'B', 'The Defendant’s Case', 'Following the conclusion of the state’s case in chief, defense counsel moved, pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, for a judgment of acquittal, in light of what defense counsel characterized as the “inconsistent testimony” proffered by the state. The state objected to the motion, citing an array of evidence presented during the state’s case in chief that provided “ample evidence” of Ms. Mendez’s “possession,” including testimony regarding the odor of marijuana emanating from her car and the unsigned statement made by Mr. German that had been brought out during the testimony of Trooper Alboum. After hearing from both parties, the trial justice denied the motion for judgment of acquittal.', 'The defense then put on its case. Jennysa Ayala was the sole witness for the defense. It was her testimony that she was with defendant at an apartment at 99 Rugby Street in Providence “all day” on the day of defendant’s arrest. Ms. Ayala did testify, however, that defendant left the Rugby Street apartment that evening and did not return at all thereafter. She stated that, “a little bit before 8 o’clock at night,” defendant had been preparing a meal when she received a phone', '- 15 - call and then left the apartment, leaving her three-month-old son in Ms. Ayala’s care for the evening. Following Ms. Ayala’s testimony, the defense rested.', 'C', 'The Jury Instructions', 'On April 4, 2012, after closing arguments were delivered by both sides, the trial justice instructed the jury. Those instructions included the following language relative to the crime of possession of a controlled substance:', '“In order to prove that first element of the offense, the State', 'must show that the defendant possessed the controlled substance in', 'question. The law recognizes two different types of possession,', 'actual and constructive. A person has actual possession of', 'something if he or she has direct physical control over it with', 'knowledge of its nature. A person has constructive possession of', 'something if she or he does not have physical control over it but', 'knowingly has both the power and the intent at a given time to', 'exercise dominion and control over it either by himself, herself, or', 'through another person.', '“The mere presence near something or mere knowledge of', 'its location by itself is not enough to prove the possession of', 'something. The State must persuade you that the defendant knew', 'the nature of what she possessed; and in this regard the very', 'possession of an item may give rise to the inference that the person', 'who possesses the item knows the nature of what he or she', 'possesses. Although you are permitted to draw that inference,', 'you’re not required to do so. As always, you decide what weight', 'to assign the evidence that you’ve already heard and seen, and', 'what inferences, if any, that you choose to draw from the evidence.', '“* * *', '“To establish the second element of this offense, the State', 'must show that the possession was knowing and intentional. The', 'person acts knowingly when he or she acts deliberately and', 'purposefully, and not because of a mistake, accident, or any other', 'innocent reason. In order to determine whether knowledge has', 'been established, you may consider, among other things, where the', 'defendant was in relation to where the drugs were found; and the', 'amount of drugs that were found.”', '- 16 - Defense counsel raised no objection to the portion of the instructions quoted above nor to any other aspect of the jury instructions given during that initial charge to the jury.', 'After having been instructed, the jury deliberated for approximately two hours and then submitted the following question to the court: “‘Is the operator of a motor vehicle responsible and/or accountable for all of the contents of that vehicle?’”18', 'Before answering the jury question, the trial justice met with counsel and proposed the following supplemental instruction:', '“‘You need to consider the Court’s instructions, find the facts,', 'accord to those the weight you deem appropriate, apply the law to', 'those facts set forth in the instructions.’” Defense counsel objected to the proposed supplemental instruction, arguing that the trial justice should read to the jury only the first seven words thereof, without going any further—such that the instruction would read as follows: “You need to consider the Court’s instructions.” The trial justice considered defense counsel’s objection, but ultimately rejected it; and he proceeded to give the supplemental instruction as he had originally proposed. The jury then returned to its deliberations.', 'The next morning, April 5, before the jury reconvened, defense counsel requested that the trial justice give an alternative instruction in response to the jury’s question; counsel contended that his newly minted alternative instruction was preferable to the supplemental instruction that had been given by the trial justice the previous day. Specifically, defense counsel requested that the jury be instructed as follows:', '“‘The State may not rely upon a defendant’s ownership and control', 'of a vehicle to prove that the defendant knew that she possessed', 'marijuana. While these are factors you may consider, the State', 'must prove that there is other evidence indicating the defendant’s', 'guilty knowledge of marijuana hidden in the vehicle.’” 18', 'The quoted question was the second that the jury posed to the trial justice. The first question asked by the jury during its deliberations is not at issue in the instant appeal.', '- 17 - The state objected, pointing to the fact that defense counsel had previously had the opportunity to review the court’s jury instructions and the fact that the supplemental instruction simply referred back to the original jury instructions, which were not objected to. The trial justice declined defense counsel’s alternative instruction, and the jury continued its deliberations.', 'D', 'The Verdict and Sentencing', 'Later on April 5, the same day that defense counsel had requested that the trial justice give the alternative instruction, the jury returned its verdict. The defendant was found guilty on the possession of marijuana charge (Count 1) and not guilty on the charges of conspiracy to possess marijuana (Count 2) and possession of MDMA (Count 4). Subsequently, the trial justice sentenced Ms. Mendez to twenty years of imprisonment, with five years to serve and fifteen years suspended with probation.', 'E', 'The Motion for a New Trial', 'On April 13, 2012, defendant moved for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. In her written submission to the trial court, she contended as follows:', '“1. Defendant was denied a fair and impartial trial because the', 'Court erred in charging the jury and in refusing to charge the', 'jury as requested.', '“2. This Court erred in denying the defense motion for a directed', 'verdict of acquittal and the conviction is based on insufficient', 'evidence of guilt in violation of defendant’s due process', 'rights;', '“3. The verdict is contrary to law; and/or', '“4. The verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence and fails', 'to do substantial justice.”', '- 18 -', 'At the hearing on the motion, defense counsel focused on the supplemental instruction that the trial justice gave in response to the jury’s question, stating that the motion for a new trial was brought “first and foremost * * * over the concern with regard to the jury instruction.” Defense counsel contended, inter alia, that the jury “may have been somewhat confused” with respect to the supplemental instruction given in response to the question concerning possession. Counsel pointed to the fact that the jury convicted defendant of possessing over five kilograms of marijuana while acquitting her of conspiracy to commit the same crime. He argued that, if the jury believed the evidence that was consistent with finding defendant guilty of the underlying crime of possession, it would not have been possible for the jury to simultaneously acquit her of conspiracy to commit that crime. Defense counsel contended that the court’s supplemental instruction caused the jury to think that “as long as drugs were in [defendant’s] car or found in that car, that’s it,” meaning that the jury would be required to find defendant guilty of the possession charge in spite of their findings with respect to the conspiracy charge. In addition, defendant argued that this Court’s decision in State v. Berroa, 6 A.3d 1095 (R.I. 2010), was authority for the proposition that the alternative instruction proposed by defendant was in fact the correct statement of the law as it related to possession (and presumably would have dispelled the jury’s confusion). In the end, however, the trial justice denied the motion for a new trial. We shall in due course describe more fully the reasoning which underlay that denial.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in failing to provide the alternative instruction, which defendant contends would have been the “correct” supplemental instruction (as opposed to the supplemental instruction that was actually given); (2) that the trial', '- 19 - justice erred in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial; and (3) that defendant’s twenty-year sentence is violative of Article 1, Section 8 of the Rhode Island Constitution. We shall address those arguments in the same order, referencing the applicable standard of review where necessary.', 'A', 'The Supplemental Jury Instruction', 'The defendant first argues on appeal that the trial justice erred in declining to give the alternative instruction that defendant proposed on the morning of April 5. The state responds that the trial justice did not err in this regard because a jury is presumed to understand instructions as given; the state further contends that, in view of the fact that the jury did not seek further clarification after having heard the trial justice’s supplemental instruction, the jury should be presumed to have understood. For the reasons set forth below, we hold that defendant has waived any argument which she may have had relative to the trial justice’s declining to give the alternative instruction because that argument was not raised in a timely manner before the trial justice.19 19', 'While defense counsel did lodge an objection to the trial justice’s proposed supplemental instruction on April 4 (the day on which the trial justice gave the supplemental instruction), he did so on grounds that are utterly different from those reflected in the alternative instruction that, on the following day, he argued was appropriate.', 'The transcript reveals that, on April 4, after the trial justice shared with counsel his proposed supplemental instruction in response to the jury question, defense counsel lodged an objection to “anything beyond” the first seven words of the instruction (i.e., anything beyond this directive to the jury: “‘You need to consider the Court’s instructions.’”) When the trial justice asked what defense counsel found “prejudicial” in the remaining portion of the trial justice’s proposed supplemental instruction, defense counsel responded as follows:', '“What I think is prejudicial, your Honor, is that they might forget', 'to consider the elements of the charges with that specific', 'instruction. If they just find the facts, associate some type of', 'weight with them, and then apply the law, I know that they’re', '- 20 -', 'We have long abided by the principle that we may not “consider[] at the appellate level issues not properly presented before the trial court.” State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 236 (R.I. 2008); see also State v. Clements, 83 A.3d 553, 564 (R.I. 2014); State v. Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 113 (R.I. 2005). That principle, commonly referred to as the raise or waive rule,20 is a “well-', 'suppose[d] to apply the elements, but without that specifically', 'being instructed to them, I think that a step in that process, so to', 'speak, may not take place and they may forget to actually -- the', 'specific elements have to be analyzed as well.” The trial justice proceeded to give a thoughtful and considered response to defense counsel’s concern, and further cited his own concern that referencing the elements specifically may result in “cut[ting] out a great deal of the 26 pages of text” that comprised the jury instructions. The trial justice referred back to his earlier admonishment to the jury during his initial instructions: that the jurors ought to “consider the instructions in their entirety” and not to single out any one instruction. Following the above statements, the trial justice added that he would send “an additional six copies” of the jury instructions up to the jury deliberation room, in addition to the six copies which had been previously sent up to the jury.', 'We recount the above exchange between defense counsel and the trial justice to illustrate that defense counsel’s objection was clearly on different grounds from those raised before this Court in the instant appeal.', 'Furthermore, to the extent that defendant argues before us that her April 4 objection on the above-referenced grounds—namely, that the trial justice erroneously gave the entire supplemental instruction, rather than just the seven words thereof as requested by defendant in her initial objection—we deem that argument to be waived. See Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n. 1 (R.I. 2002). Although defendant alludes to the issue in her briefing before this Court, she makes no meaningful argument with respect to whether the trial justice erred in giving the entire supplemental instruction; instead, she limits herself to advocating for the alternative instruction, which she proposed on the morning of April 5. Our precedent requires more than an allusion to an issue for it to become the proper subject of appellate review. See id. (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”); see also Hines Road, LLC v. Hall, 113 A.3d 924, 931 n. 6 (R.I. 2015); State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n. 19 (R.I. 2007).', 'Finally, we note that we consider the alternative instruction later proposed by defendant to act as a further objection to the supplemental instruction, see Perry v. Alessi, 890 A.2d 463, 470 (R.I. 2006) (“He then objected to the trial justice’s failure to give eleven of his proposed instructions * * *.”); Butera v. Boucher, 798 A.2d 340, 348 (R.I. 2002), and it is this latter objection that we address more fully in our analysis of defendant’s arguments on appeal. 20', 'Our cases have recognized a narrow exception to this Court’s raise or waive rule. For that exception to be applicable, however, “the alleged error must be more than harmless, and the', '- 21 - established maxim,” Thornley v. Community College of Rhode Island, 107 A.3d 296, 302 (R.I. 2014), and it “imposes upon litigants a duty to raise all their claims for relief in the trial court and properly articulate them to a judge for a ruling.” D’Alessio v. State, 101 A.3d 1270, 1278 (R.I. 2014) (emphasis added).', 'With respect to objections to jury instructions in particular, this Court has “consistently been exacting about applying the raise or waive rule.” Ferris Avenue Realty, LLC v. Huhtamaki, Inc., 110 A.3d 267, 285 (R.I. 2015); see also King v. Huntress, Inc., 94 A.3d 467, 483 (R.I. 2014) (describing this Court as being “especially rigorous in the application of the [raise or waive] rule when considering objections to jury instructions”) (internal quotation marks omitted); State v. Crow, 871 A.2d 930, 935 (R.I. 2005) (“[I]f an objection to a jury instruction is not effectively raised below, it is waived on appeal.”).', 'In addition, our law is demanding as to when an objection to a jury instruction should be made: pursuant to Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “[n]o party may assign as error any portion of the charge or omission therefrom unless the party objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which the party objects and the grounds of the party’s objection.” (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, we have emphasized that “[c]ounsel’s objection to the jury instruction must be made before the jury retires because once alerted to the perceived error in the instruction that has been given, the trial justice has an opportunity to cure the alleged deficiencies before the jury retires for exception must implicate an issue of constitutional dimension derived from a novel rule of law that could not reasonably have been known to counsel at the time of trial.” State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50, 57 (R.I. 2001); see also State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 n. 7 (R.I. 2011); State v. Texter, 896 A.2d 40, 43 (R.I. 2006); see generally Pollard v. Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429, 432, 433 (R.I. 2005). To the extent that defendant seeks an appeal on such constitutional grounds, we perceive absolutely no basis for concluding that this narrow exception could properly be invoked in this case.', '- 22 - deliberations.” State v. Viveiros, 45 A.3d 1232, 1243-44 (R.I. 2012) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758, 766 (R.I. 2009); cf. DiFranco v. Klein, 657 A.2d 145, 147 (R.I. 1995) (discussing parallel rule of civil procedure and describing the rationale for the rule as “allow[ing] the trial justice an opportunity to make any necessary corrections to his or her instructions before the jury begins its deliberations”) (emphasis added). We note that the foregoing principles are equally applicable in the context of a trial justice giving a jury a supplemental instruction as distinguished from the initial charge to the jury. See, e.g., State v. Vega, 789 A.2d 896, 898 (R.I. 2002) (“After giving both of these supplemental instructions, the trial justice asked the attorneys whether they had any objections to these charges. Both counsel replied in the negative and they also failed to suggest any different or supplemental instructions. * * * [B]y failing to object at trial to the above-referenced instructions, [the] defendant has failed to preserve any alleged inadequacies or errors relating to these supplemental instructions and he is precluded from raising such arguments for the first time on appeal.”). We now turn to the instances in which defendant claims that she has properly preserved her objections.', 'The defendant first asserts that the alternative instruction was correct and that the jury deserved to have it presented to them; in addition, she contends that it “was preserved for direct appeal by [defense] counsel’s timely objection,” in the form of the alternative instruction. Specifically, defendant contends that defense counsel “objected and requested the correct jury instruction shortly after the trial justice answered [the jury question].”', '(Emphasis added.) However, the record clearly reveals that contention to be entirely without any foundation in fact. First, and significantly, defense counsel did not contemporaneously object to the supplemental instruction on the grounds that are now presented in his brief to this Court—namely, in the form', '- 23 - of the alternative instruction. In our view, it is inaccurate for defendant to claim that his proposed alternative instruction was brought to the trial justice’s attention “shortly” after the trial justice gave his own supplemental instruction in response to the jury question. Significantly, after the trial justice gave his supplemental instruction, the jury resumed its deliberations; and it was only the next morning that counsel requested the alternative instruction. We note that our precedent emphasizes that “it is imperative that a focused objection specific enough to alert the trial justice as to the nature of [the trial justice’s] alleged error in giving any jury instruction * * * must be made on the record after the jury is instructed and before it retires to deliberate.” Berman v. Sitrin, 101 A.3d 1251, 1266 (R.I. 2014) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). In view of that clear precedent, and in light of the amount of time that elapsed between the trial justice’s supplemental instruction and defense counsel’s alternative instruction, we are not persuaded that defendant’s objection was timely.', 'The defendant argues that our opinion in State v. Fetzik, 577 A.2d 990 (R.I. 1990), supports her contention that her objection (which came in the form of an alternative instruction) which was articulated on the day after the trial justice gave his supplemental instruction was sufficient to preserve the issue for appellate review. However, we are not persuaded by that argument. In Fetzik, 577 A.2d at 992-93, the defendant proposed an instruction with respect to the defendant’s physical condition at the time of the crime to the trial justice before the trial justice charged the jury, albeit after the close of evidence. Pursuant to Rule 30 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, “when a defendant relies upon an affirmative defense or justification or a matter in mitigation he or she must advise the court no later than the close of evidence.” Fetzik, 577 A.2d at 992 (emphasis added). However, we stated in Fetzik that, “[a]lthough the instruction was technically late, the trial justice appears to have had an adequate', '- 24 - opportunity to consider this instruction” regarding the defendant’s physical condition, especially in light of extensive testimony documenting said condition, and that “[t]he requested instruction was one that could easily have been included with those that were given.” Id. at 993. Those circumstances are clearly distinguishable from those at issue in the instant case. Here, the trial justice had no opportunity to consider the substance of defense counsel’s alternative instruction because the proposal did not arrive until the next morning, after the supplemental instruction had been given and the jury had resumed deliberations. For similar reasons, defendant’s alternative instruction could not have easily been included with the supplemental instruction. Simply put, in the instant case, the objection (in the form of the alternative instruction) was not timely, and our opinion in Fetzik does not support the contention that the issue was somehow preserved.', 'The defendant argues that, even if the argument relative to the proposed alternative instruction was not preserved during the actual trial, it has been “preserved for direct appeal as it was included in the Rule 33 New Trial Motion and ruled on by the Trial Court on the merits.” But that argument flies in the face of our precedent. In State v. Flori, 963 A.2d 932, 938 (R.I. 2009), we specifically stated: “Although * * * [R]ule [33] allows the court to grant a new trial if required in the interest of justice, it does not circumvent or override contemporaneous objection rules, such as Rule 30.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) We see no reason to deviate from that principle in the instant case; defendant did not timely object because she did not timely provide her alternative instruction, and her failure to do so was not cured by her decision to raise the issue in her motion for a new trial.', 'Third, defendant claims that the issue is “properly before the Court as the State failed to object to the timing of counsel’s objection.” We are not persuaded by this argument. The state did not need to present an objection to defendant’s untimely proposal for an alternative', '- 25 - instruction where the trial justice explicitly ruled against giving that instruction; defendant’s argument in this regard is meritless, and we summarily reject it.', 'Finally, we note that a trial is one-directional in nature; it moves forward from beginning to end. And essential to the trial process is the requirement that objections be made at the time when an event occurs that counsel deems objectionable. See Rule 51 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure (“Formal exceptions to rulings or orders of the court are unnecessary; but for all purposes for which an exception has heretofore been necessary it is sufficient that a party, at the time the ruling or order of the court is made or sought, makes known to the court the action which the party desires the court to take or his or her objection to the action of the court * * *.”) (emphasis added); see also In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273, 1280 (R.I. 2011) (“An issue is properly preserved—and, as a result, may be raised before this Court on appeal—if the litigant’s objection was both ‘timely and appropriate.’”) (emphasis added) (quoting State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010)); see generally Thomas v. Ross, 477 A.2d 950, 953 (R.I. 1984) (“Trial on an installment-plan basis cannot be countenanced * * *.”). In addition, it is required that the objecting party not only voice the objection contemporaneously with the perceived error, but it is further required that all grounds for the objection be brought to the attention of the presiding judicial officer at that time. See State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1007 (R.I. 2005); see also State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1289 (R.I. 2011). In the instant case, as soon as the question posed by the jury had been addressed by the trial justice, the jury continued deliberating. For the court on the next morning to have given a further supplemental instruction might well have unduly been perceived by the jurors as a sort of red flag, causing them to infer that the trial justice was imparting some sort of cryptic message.', '- 26 -', 'Accordingly, we hold that defendant has failed to preserve her objection to the supplemental jury instruction.', 'B', 'The Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant next argues on appeal that the trial justice erred when he denied her motion for a new trial. She contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in crediting Mr. German’s unsigned statement, which was testified to by Trooper Alboum; and (2) that her conviction was based on insufficient evidence. Specifically, she claims that the jury did not find Mr. German’s unsigned statement to the police to be credible—whereas, if the jury found the statement to be credible, it could infer that defendant knowingly possessed the marijuana. Indeed, she argues that the unsigned statement was so undermined by Mr. German’s criminal record, his purported connection to the carjacking earlier that day, and his subsequent contradictory statements, that no jury could have found that the unsigned statement was worthy of credence. In addition, she claims that it was not reasonable to conclude that she could have smelled the fresh marijuana in the trunk in view of the evidence that Mr. German, sitting in the front passenger’s seat, “reeked” of burnt marijuana. Therefore, she argues it could not be properly inferred that defendant knew that there was marijuana in the trunk. We hold, for the reasons set forth below, that the trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Preliminarily, we note that defendant’s appeal utilizes the language of both a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence and a motion for a new trial based on the sufficiency of the evidence. As we have explained in State v. Perkins, 460 A.2d 1245, 1247 (R.I. 1983), the two motions are different, and each requires its own distinct legal analysis. See also State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235 (R.I. 2011); State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569-71 (R.I.', '- 27 - 2009). It is not entirely clear to this Court whether defendant intends to argue both bases for the motion. However, to the extent that she in fact seeks to raise both, we shall address each basis.', 'When a defendant moves for a new trial based on both the weight of the evidence and the sufficiency of the evidence, it is the practice of this Court to first address the motion based on the weight of the evidence. See State v. Robat, 49 A.3d 58, 72 (R.I. 2012) (stating that this Court reviews a motion for a new trial before reviewing a motion for a judgment of acquittal); State v. Richardson, 47 A.3d 305, 317 (R.I. 2012); see also Clark, 974 A.2d at 570 (“The difference in nomenclature of a motion for a new trial based on the insufficiency of the evidence and a motion for judgment of acquittal does not mean that courts must review these motions differently.”). We proceed in that manner because a defendant seeking to prevail on a motion for a new trial based on the sufficiency of the evidence bears a heavier burden than does a defendant seeking to prevail on a weight of the evidence argument; unless a defendant can demonstrate that the evidence failed to support his or her conviction based on the weight of the evidence standard, he or she will necessarily be unable to establish entitlement to a new trial based on insufficient evidence. See Robat, 49 A.3d at 72.', 'When a trial justice considers whether a verdict is against the weight of the evidence, he or she “acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Barrios, 88 A.3d 1123, 1128 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Austin, No. 2013-77-C.A., 2015 WL 1954726, at *6 (R.I. May 1, 2015); Robat, 49 A.3d at 70. In carrying out his or her role as the “thirteenth juror,” it is incumbent upon the trial justice to “(1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from', '- 28 - that reached by the jury.” State v. Silva, 84 A.3d 411, 416 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Mitchell, 80 A.3d 19, 30 (R.I. 2013). If, after carrying out that just- described analytical process, “the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or determines that reasonable minds could differ, then the analysis is complete and the verdict should be affirmed.” State v. Hie, 93 A.3d 963, 974-75 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Harrison, 66 A.3d 432, 445 (R.I. 2013); State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 232 (R.I. 2012). However, if the trial justice “does not agree with the verdict or does not agree that reasonable minds could differ, then the trial justice must determine whether the verdict is against the fair preponderance of the evidence and fails to do substantial justice.” Harrison, 66 A.3d at 445 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also State v. Gonzalez, 56 A.3d 96, 102 (R.I. 2012).', 'We have stated that the trial justice’s decision to grant or deny a motion for a new trial “should reflect a few sentences of the justice’s reasoning on each point.” State v. DiCarlo, 987 A.2d 867, 870 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Silva, 84 A.3d at 417. The trial justice “need not refer to all the evidence supporting [his or her] decision,” but need only “cite evidence sufficient to allow this [C]ourt to discern whether the [trial] justice has applied the appropriate standards.” Robat, 49 A.3d at 71 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In reviewing a motion for a new trial, this Court accords great weight to the trial justice’s decision so long as he or she has “articulated sufficient reasoning in support of the ruling.” Robat, 49 A.3d at 71 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Hie, 93 A.3d at 975. Our case law is clear that “we will not disturb a trial justice’s decision with respect to a motion for a new trial unless we determine that the trial justice committed clear error or that he or she overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence [relating] to a critical issue in the case.” Hie, 93 A.3d at 975 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Robat, 49 A.3d at 71. We defer to the', '- 29 - trial justice’s findings “because a trial justice, being present during all phases of the trial, is in an especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses.” Robat, 49 A.3d at 71 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Austin, 2015 WL 1954726 at *7.', 'In the instant case, the record makes clear that the trial justice properly performed the three-step weight of the evidence analysis. First, he considered the evidence in light of the jury charge regarding constructive possession of marijuana; he expressly noted that it was clear from his jury instruction that, “in order to find the defendant guilty * * * the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant possessed the [marijuana], * * * and did so knowingly and intentionally.” While the trial justice did not refer to every single piece of evidence, he focused on all of the evidence relevant to the issue of defendant’s knowledge. See Robat, 49 A.3d at 71. That evidence consisted of the testimony of Mr. German and Trooper Alboum, and Mr. German’s unsigned and signed police statements.', 'Proceeding to the second step of the analytical process, the trial justice independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and weighed the relevant evidence. He began this second step of the process by focusing on Mr. German’s credibility, noting that Mr. German was a “hostile” and “evasive” witness who sought to “undermine whatever he had put in writing at an earlier time.” Nonetheless, the trial justice independently concluded that there was “some credibility” to Mr. German’s unsigned statement, which indicated that the marijuana belonged to Ms. Mendez. In contrast, he stated on the record that he “specifically * * * disbelieve[d]” those portions of Mr. German’s signed statement in which he indicated that the marijuana was all his and that he would be “‘taking the hit for it.’”', '- 30 -', 'The trial justice then carried out the remainder of the second analytical step by identifying several specific facts weighing in favor of the jury’s verdict. Those facts included: (1) the “strong” smell and sheer “bulk” of the marijuana bales that the state introduced as evidence; (2) Trooper Alboum’s testimony that Ms. Mendez did not look at the large police presence surrounding the carjacked van; and (3) Trooper Alboum’s testimony regarding the efforts of Ms. Mendez to avoid being pulled over. With regard to the smell and size of the marijuana (the marijuana having been admitted as a full exhibit at trial), the trial justice noted:', '“The State’s attorney flung the marijuana around on the witness', 'stand and the boxes in front of the Court. The Court noticed it.', 'The jury noticed it. * * * This is not the same as a small package', 'of controlled substances that can be secreted in a foot locker or', '* * * under a spare tire, in a jacket, or even in a bag.” The trial justice concluded that those facts, coupled with Mr. German’s “statements [that] all allowed for a reasonable inference that [defendant] knew about the marijuana or knew that there was marijuana in the back of her car,” clearly supported the jury’s verdict.', 'Third and finally, the trial justice concluded the three-step analytical process by explicitly stating that he agreed with the jury’s verdict. In light of the trial justice’s proper execution of the three-step analysis and his agreement with the jury verdict, he was not required to do anything further. See Hie, 93 A.3d at 977.', 'The trial justice properly undertook the required steps to rule upon a motion for a new trial, but we pause to note that, in the course of making his ruling, the trial justice distinguished the instant case from two cases that defendant relied upon heavily in both her briefing and argument on the motion below and before this Court. The two cases are State v. Berroa, 6 A.3d 1095 (R.I. 2010), and United States v. Chadwick, 393 F. Supp. 763 (D. Mass. 1975), aff’d, 532 F.2d 773, 785 (1st Cir. 1976), aff’d, 433 U.S. 1, 16 (1977). The defendant cited those opinions', '- 31 - in support of her argument that the jury could not properly infer her knowledge of the marijuana because the evidence relied upon by the state to indicate that she had such knowledge was subject to equally plausible, noncriminal explanations. In the first case, Berroa, 6 A.3d at 1099, a defendant was found driving a car in which two passengers had concealed cocaine inside their purses. The defendant in that case then allegedly showed signs of nervousness while police investigated the car. Id. We vacated the judgment of conviction because the evidence “simply [was] not sufficient to affirm the conviction,” even though the facts could have led to “speculation or conjecture” regarding the defendant’s involvement with a sophisticated drug- trafficking scheme. Id. at 1102, 1104.', 'In the second case, Chadwick, 393 F. Supp. at 766, 768, a defendant was arrested on suspicion of drug trafficking because he was found in the presence of two people who possessed a footlocker containing marijuana.', 'The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts determined that the police did not have probable cause to arrest the defendant because “a non-criminal explanation * * * [was] at least as likely as one indicating that an offense [had] been or [was] being committed.” Id. at 768 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In the instant case, defendant argues that, similar to the facts in Berroa and Chadwick, the “facts and circumstances” of her case, taken together, are “consistent with a reasonable hypothesis that she is innocent”—i.e., that the facts and circumstances are consistent with ignorance of, rather than knowledge of, the presence of marijuana in her car. However, in ruling on the motion, the trial justice pointed to specific facts indicating otherwise, such as Mr. German’s unsigned statement implicating defendant’s knowledge of the marijuana, the strong smell and sheer bulk of the marijuana in the car operated by defendant, Trooper Alboum’s testimony that defendant did not look at the police presence surrounding the carjacked van, and', '- 32 - Trooper Alboum’s additional testimony that defendant attempted to avoid being pulled over. The trial justice then stated: “I am sure that lightning didn’t strike twelve times in the same place on that day when this case occurred. Any one of [the facts] by themselves might have been insignificant, but it would appear that there were a number of places here where the inferences can be drawn in light of the instructions I told the jury.” Furthermore, in her briefing to this Court, defendant concedes that only “[o]nce the incredulous [sic] statements of Osvaldo German and smell issues are set aside” would her case be “on point” with Berroa and Chadwick. As we have already discussed, the trial justice concluded that Mr. German’s incriminating original unsigned statement and the smell of the marijuana were both highly relevant to the determination of defendant’s guilt in this case.', 'We see no reason to disturb the trial justice’s findings. He considered all of the relevant evidence as he applied the three-step analytical process and he articulated sufficient reasoning to support his decision to deny the motion.', 'In light of the fact that defendant could not successfully prevail on her motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, we need not address her challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. See Richardson, 47 A.3d at 317; Clark, 974 A.2d at 570. Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'C', 'The Sentence', 'The defendant’s final argument on appeal is that her twenty-year prison sentence is “manifestly excessive” and “violates the constitutional requirement that ‘all punishments ought to be proportioned to the offense.’” See R.I.

The plaintiff, Kayak Centre at Wickford Cove, LLC (Kayak Centre), appeals from a final judgment entered in Washington County Superior Court in favor of the defendants, the town of Narragansett (the town) and Narrow River Kayaks, LLC (Narrow River). The action was precipitated because the plaintiff was unsuccessful in winning a concession contract from the town to operate a paddle sports business on town-owned land. The plaintiff’s complaint asked for (1) a declaratory judgment that the town had violated sections of the general laws controlling the award of municipal contracts, G.L. 1956 chapter 55 of title 45,1 1', 'The particular section in question is G.L. 1956 § 45-55-5, entitled “Competitive sealed bidding,” and it reads in pertinent part:', '“(a) Contracts exceeding [ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for construction', 'and five thousand dollars ($5,000) for all other purchases] shall be awarded by', 'competitive bidding unless they are professional engineering/architectural', 'services * * * and it is determined in writing that this method is not practicable.', '“(b) The invitation for bids shall state whether award shall be made on the', 'basis of the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated or responsive bid price. If the', '-1- and (2) injunctive relief against the town to prevent it from rebidding the concession contract. This appeal came before the Supreme Court for argument on March 3, 2015. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Kayak Centre is a Rhode Island limited liability company that operates paddle sports businesses at two locations, one in Charlestown and one in the village of Wickford in North Kingstown. Narrow River is also a Rhode Island limited liability company; it owns and operates a paddle sports business at 94 Middlebridge Road in Narragansett (the property). In August 2012, the town acquired a 9.5-acre parcel of land that included the property on which Narrow River’s business was located. Narrow River continued to operate its business on the land after the town took ownership of the property.', 'However, in August of 2013, the town invited competitive bidding for a five-year concession contract to operate a paddle sports business on the property. One rationale for the decision was described by Robert O’Neill, 2 the Chairman of the town’s Land Conservancy Trust, who said it was “good business sense to say ‘We’ll see what other proposals [for the paddle sports concession at the Property] people will bring forward.’” To begin the process, the town’s purchasing agent, Susan Gallagher, and the Director of the town’s Parks and Recreation Department, Steven Wright, prepared a package and advertised the invitation to bid on the concession award.', 'latter basis is used, the objective measurable criteria to be utilized shall be stated', 'in the invitation for bids, if available.', '“* * *', '“(e) The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by written', 'notice to the responsive and responsible bidder whose bid is either the lowest bid', 'price, or lowest evaluated or responsive bid price.” 2', 'Mr. O’Neill’s name is spelled differently in the various filings in the record; for consistency, we have chosen the spelling used in the Superior Court’s decision.', '-2-', 'The invitation specified a submission date of August 29, 2013, required that all bidders have a minimum of five years of experience operating a paddle sports business, and asked for references who could attest to prior experience. The invitation also stated, “[the town] reserves the right to reject any/all bids, waive any informalities in the bids received and to accept and award the bid to the highest qualified bid deemed most favorable to the interest of the [t]own.” Four bidders initially expressed an interest by attending an advertised pre-bid meeting, but, in the end, only Kayak Centre and Narrow River submitted bids to the town. Bidders were asked to state the amount of a proposed “annual payment” that they would be willing to make to the town. A minimum amount of $15,000 annually was specified in the bid package. Kayak Centre proposed $180,505 in total payments over the projected five-year period, while Narrow River’s bid proposed $100,500. In accordance with the invitation to bid, the bids were opened by the town’s Parks and Recreation Department and were then examined in order to issue a report to the town council before it awarded the concession.', 'There is no dispute that Ms. Gallagher’s report, according to the parties’ stipulated facts, “concluded that the Kayak Centre was the best and most qualified bidder and recommended that the Town Council award the municipal contract to the Kayak Centre.” 3 The report stated, in part, “[t]he Parks and Recreation Department is recommending this award based on the Kayak Centre’s 18-year experience in the paddle sports business, references[,] and total bid offering.” Also, the town’s contacts with Kayak Centre’s references resulted in “all positive comments regarding the Kayak Centre operation.” On October 7, 2013, the report was presented at a meeting of the town council and a motion was made to award the contract to Kayak Centre. 3', 'The agreed statement of facts filed with the Superior Court also included a transcript of the October 7, 2013, meeting of the Narragansett Town Council, at which the bids of plaintiff and Narrow River were debated, and ultimately rejected.', '-3- However, after some lengthy comments from the public and discussion among town councilors, the town council voted three to one to reject the motion to award the concession contract to plaintiff. 4 Following this vote, the town solicitor, who was present at the meeting, then suggested that the next course of action would be “to direct the staff to develop additional criteria and qualifications to be included in a new bid package for [the town council’s] review before it goes back out to bid * * * .” The town council, as the parties stipulate, then “voted 3-1 to reject all bids and commence the bidding process again,” following the solicitor’s recommendation.', 'On December 3, 2013, Kayak Centre initiated this action by filing a verified complaint consisting of three counts: (1) a request for a declaratory judgment that the town violated § 45- 55-5, entitled “Competitive sealed bidding”; (2) an allegation that the town committed a criminal misdemeanor by not complying with that statute; and (3) a prayer for injunctive relief alleging that it would be irreparably harmed if the town was allowed to reject its bid and rebid the concession. On February 10, 2014, the case was heard by a justice of the Superior Court on an agreed statement of facts and documents, including the invitation to bid and the bids that had been submitted by plaintiff and Narrow River.', 'The trial justice considered the parties’ submissions and arguments and issued a written decision, which was made effective by a judgment signed March 25, 2014. The trial justice’s decision found that the provisions of § 45- 55-5 were inapplicable to this particular bidding process and, further, that this Court’s standard on competitive bidding, as set forth in Gilbane Building Co. v. Board of Trustees of State Colleges, 107 R.I. 295, 299-300, 267 A.2d 396, 399 (1970), did not apply. Therefore the trial 4', 'In October 2013, the Narragansett Town Council consisted of five members: James M. Callahan, president of the council; Susan Cicilline-Buonanno, president pro tem; and Glenna M. Hagopian, Matthew M. Mannix, and Douglas E. McLaughlin, as members. On both votes in question only four members voted as Council President Callahan abstained.', '-4- justice denied plaintiff’s request for declaratory and injunctive relief, and found for defendants on all counts. The plaintiff filed a timely appeal with this Court.5', 'II', 'Standard of Review', ""“A decision to grant or deny declaratory or injunctive relief is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice and will not be disturbed on appeal unless the record demonstrates a clear abuse of discretion or the trial justice committed an error of law.” Foster Glocester Regional School Building Committee v. Sette, 996 A.2d 1120, 1124 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Hagenberg v. Avedisian, 879 A.2d 436, 441 (R.I. 2005)). Accordingly, we give great weight to the findings of fact of a trial justice when sitting without a jury in such actions. Id. (citing Casco Indemnity Co. v. O'Connor, 755 A.2d 779, 782 (R.I. 2000)). On questions of law, however, our standard is one of de novo review. Id. (citing Houde v. State, 973 A.2d 493, 498 (R.I. 2009)). Likewise, in matters of statutory interpretation, our review is also de novo. State v. Hazard, 68 A.3d 479, 485 (R.I. 2013) (citing Campbell v. State, 56 A.3d 448, 454 (R.I. 2012)). When construing a statute, this Court will apply a clear and unambiguous statute “literally and [we] must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Id. (quoting Alessi v. Bowen Court Condominium, 44 A.3d 736, 740 (R.I. 2012))."", 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, plaintiff maintains that the trial justice made two errors that warrant reversal. First, plaintiff argues that it was error for the trial justice to rule that the requirements of § 45-55- 5', 'While the appeal was pending, the town extended Narrow River’s existing lease on the property for a term that ended February 28, 2015. The status of the land and the concession lease after that date is unclear from the record.', '-5- 5 were inapplicable to the case before her and, therefore, declaratory relief should not have been denied. Second, plaintiff alleges that it was error for the trial justice to deny it injunctive relief because, it claims, the town’s actions were governed by, but violated, the standards of fairness that this Court enunciated in Gilbane. On review, we discern no error in the trial justice’s ruling that § 45-55-5 did not apply to the situation before her. It is, however, our opinion that the good faith standard of Gilbane does apply in the absence of a specific statute. In light of that conclusion, findings of fact and conclusions of law are required before this Court can properly address whether the town’s actions complied with Gilbane.', 'A. Applicability of § 45-55-5', 'We review the interpretation of a statute de novo and “when the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, this Court must interpret the statute literally and must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meanings.” Raiche v. Scott, 101 A.3d 1244, 1248 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Hazard, 68 A.3d at 485). The language of § 45-55-9 provides that the process for awarding contracts that exceed “ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for construction and five thousand dollars ($5,000) for all other purchases” is to be by competitive bidding. See § 45-55-9 (for the monetary amounts over which § 45-55-5 applies). The statute requires that “[t]he contract shall be awarded * * * to the responsive and responsible bidder whose bid is either the lowest bid price, or lowest evaluated or responsive bid price.” Section 45-55-5(e).', 'The language of the statute is clear and unambiguous. As a result, we need not delve into the intent of the General Assembly, except to say that in our opinion, in enacting § 45-55-5 the Legislature sought to regulate contracts that require the expenditure of public funds.', 'The Legislature was certainly free to include concession contracts within the ambit of § 45-55-5, but it chose not to do so. See Narragansett Food Services, Inc. v. Rhode Island Department of', '-6- Labor, 420 A.2d 805, 808 (R.I. 1980) (“The Legislature is presumed to know the state of existing relevant law when it enacts * * * a statute.”). In the years since its enactment, we have addressed § 45-55-5 on several occasions. On each occasion, we were faced with a competitive bidding case where the awarding governmental entity selected a more expensive bidder for specified reasons. See, e.g., H.V. Collins Co. v. Tarro, 696 A.2d 298, 300 (R.I. 1997) (“[T]he school committee awarded the contract to Gilbane, the third-lowest bidder. On the following day, Collins, the lowest bidder, commenced this action against the town.”). We have said that § 45- 55-5 “does not preclude an awarding authority from taking into account factors beyond price.” H.V. Collins Co., 696 A.2d at 303. The Court reasoned this to be allowable because, for example, choosing a seemingly higher initial bid from a more qualified party can lessen the risk of future unexpected expenses, fulfilling the “purpose of chapter [55] of title [45] in safeguarding public funds.” H.V. Collins Co., 696 A.2d at 303.', 'However, we note that § 45-55-9 explicitly provides that the contracts to which § 45-55-5 applies are “procurements” and “purchases.”', 'The Kayak Centre submitted a bid for the concession contract at issue in this case that would have had Kayak paying the town the sum of $180,505 in payments over the projected five-year period, while Narrow River’s bid proposed $100,500 in payments. Not all of the same considerations are at play in a concession contract as are in one for expenditures. We cannot rewrite the statute by essentially exchanging the word lowest for the word highest, as plaintiff would have us do, because we will not insert words into an unambiguous statute. See Raiche, 101 A.3d at 1248. We simply apply the words as written and the words of § 45-55-5 make it clear the statute is inapplicable to these facts. Id. In our opinion, there was no error when the trial justice refused to apply the statute to the town’s action, and we therefore affirm the denial of plaintiff’s request for declaratory relief.', '-7-', 'B. Standards for Conduct in Concession Bidding', 'As noted above, the General Assembly is presumed to know the existing state of the law. Narragansett Food Services, Inc., 420 A.2d at 808. Before the competitive bidding statute was enacted by the Legislature, there was already a standard that was used by this Court when it reviewed bid disputes. In a case involving competitive bidding for a state-issued construction contract before § 45-55-5 was enacted, we observed that, “[i]n the absence of any legislative requirement pertaining to competitive bidding, it is the duty of the appropriate public officials to act honestly and in good faith as they determine which bidder would best serve the public interest.” Gilbane, 107 R.I. at 299-300, 267 A.2d at 399. There can be no dispute that this standard results in a certain amount of deference to government officials; indeed, we have held that this Court “will not interfere with [an] award absent a showing that the board acted corruptly or in bad faith, or so unreasonably or arbitrarily as to be guilty of a palpable abuse of discretion.” Paul Goldman, Inc. v. Burns, 109 R.I. 236, 239, 283 A.2d 673, 676 (1971) (citing Gilbane, 107 R.I. at 300, 267 A.2d at 399). Thus, although § 45-55-5 does not apply to competitive bidding processes involving concession contracts, which are contracts that produce revenue and not purchases, we conclude that, even in the absence of an applicable statute, the Gilbane standard must still apply.', 'The defendants argue that this Court has not been presented with a reviewable issue because the town never completed the bidding process and never awarded the concession to any bidder. The defendants argue that because no such award exists, the propriety of the town’s conduct is unreachable by our review. We do not agree. We do not tread new ground in opining on the process of awarding, or not awarding, a competitive bid. See National Car Rental System, Inc. v. Fazzano, 112 R.I. 56, 58, 307 A.2d 770, 771 (1973) (car rental company brought action to', '-8- enjoin the awarding of a concession contract). In National, the Director of Transportation and the state’s purchasing agent advertised a bid to award three car rental concessions at T. F. Green Airport in Warwick. National, 112 R.I. at 57-58, 307 A.2d at 771. The bid stated that one of the three concessions was reserved for a “Rhode Island car rental company,” a condition to which National Car Rental, a national car rental company, objected. Id. at 58, 307 A.2d at 771. This Court reviewed and opined on the bidding process, despite the fact that National Car Rental brought the action during the time allotted for bid submission. Id. at 58-60, 307 A.2d at 771-73. In fact, the action in that case was brought on the day before bids were scheduled to be opened, when no award had been made. Id. at 58, 307 A.2d at 771. In our opinion, this case is in a proper posture for our review.', 'As noted above, in her written decision the trial justice decided that the Gilbane standard did not apply and consequently she did not address whether the town acted “corruptly or in bad faith, or so unreasonably or so arbitrarily as to be guilty of a palpable abuse of discretion.” Gilbane, 107 R.I. at 299, 267 A.2d at 400 (citing Slocum v. City of Medford, 18 N.E.2d 1013, 1015 (Mass. 1939)).', 'Because we disagree with the trial justice’s determination as to the applicability of the Gilbane standard, it follows that the case must be remanded to the trial justice for findings of fact and conclusions of law on that issue. 6 6', 'In remanding this case we remain cognizant of our earlier holdings that the bar for a potential challenger is extremely high. Corruption, bad faith, and a palpable abuse of discretion are difficult to prove, particularly in the light of our antipathy for “government by injunction.” See, e.g., Truk Away of Rhode Island, Inc. v. Macera Brothers of Cranston, Inc., 643 A.2d 811, 816 (R.I. 1994).', '-9-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the Superior Court, vacate the judgment, and remand the case for findings of fact and conclusions of law. The papers may be returned to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Goldberg, concurring in part and dissenting in part.', 'I concur with the opinion of the majority to the extent it holds that the good-faith standard of Gilbane Building Co. v. Board of Trustees of State Colleges, 107 R.I. 295, 299-300, 267 A.2d 396, 399 (1970) applies and necessitates the remand of this case in order for the trial justice to make a determination as to whether the town “acted corruptly or in bad faith, or so unreasonably or so arbitrarily as to be guilty of a palpable abuse of discretion.” Id. at 300, 267 A.2d at 399. 1 However, I must disassociate myself from the majority’s conclusion that G.L. 1956 § 45-55-5 did not apply to the actions of the town council. Rather, I am of the opinion that state law governing the award of municipal contracts as set forth in chapter 55 of title 45, including § 45-55-5 applies to the contract in this case. Therefore, I cannot join a decision that allows awarding authorities to circumvent the safeguards of Rhode Island’s bidding statutes and the state’s well-settled principles of competitive sealed bidding for leases and grants of public property and facilities. 1', 'I note that the majority signals that the “bar for a potential challenger” under the Gilbane standard “is extremely high.” However, the singular question is “whether the [town] exercised ‘sound discretion’ in rejecting” Kayak Centre’s bid. See Coastal Recycling, Inc. v. Connors, 854 A.2d 711, 715 (R.I. 2004) (citing Gilbane Building Co. v. Board of Trustees of State Colleges, 107 R.I. 295, 302, 267 A.2d 396, 400 (1970)). Reasons that underlie the town council’s decision to reject the bid certainly warrant a detailed review by the trial justice to determine whether the town exercised the good faith and sound discretion that Gilbane commands.', '- 10 -', 'Application of § 45-55-5', 'While I note that the majority’s interpretation of chapter 55 of title 45 is a plausible reading of the statute, I conclude that the statute is susceptible to another plausible reading, thus rendering the statute ambiguous; as such, it is incumbent upon this Court to engage in our traditional statutory analysis in order to give effect to the intention of the Legislature. See Town of Burrillville v. Pascoag Apartment Associates, LLC, 950 A.2d 435, 445 (R.I. 2008) (“[W]hen a statute is susceptible of more than one meaning, we employ our well-established maxims of statutory construction in an effort to glean the intent of the Legislature.” quoting Unistrut Corp. v. State Department of Labor and Training, 922 A.2d 93, 98-99 (R.I. 2007)).', 'Rather than interpreting chapter 55 of title 45 of the General Laws as a “harmonious whole[,]” the majority’s review begins and ends with a single section, § 45-55-5.', 'See Zambarano v. Retirement Board of Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 61 A.3d 432, 436 (R.I. 2013) (“[W]hen interpreting statutes, a court should construe ‘each part or section * * * in connection with every other part or section to produce a harmonious whole.’” quoting 2A Norman J. Singer & J.D. Shambie Singer, Sutherland Statutes and Statutory Construction § 46:5 at 204 (7th ed. 2014)). The majority opinion thus fails to consider the remaining sections of chapter 55 of title 45. In construing all sections of the statute, it is apparent that the statute is ambiguous. Specifically, § 45-55-1 “declare[s] that a need exists to establish a uniform system for the award of contracts by municipalities, utilizing open cooperative bids.” (Emphasis added.) It is clear, therefore, that the Legislature sought to provide a system of general applicability that requires the use of “open cooperative bids[,]” when awarding municipal contracts, and not a bifurcated system depending on whether the municipality is expending funds or leasing its properties for revenue. Section 45-55-2(1) provides that “[e]xcept as otherwise authorized by', '- 11 - law, all municipal contracts shall be awarded by * * * [c]ompetitive sealed bidding, pursuant to § 45-55-5[.]” (Emphasis added.) The term “contract” is broadly defined as:', '“all types of agreements, including grants and orders, for the', 'purchase or disposal of supplies, services, construction, or any', 'other item. It includes awards; contracts of a fixed-price, cost,', 'cost-plus-a-fixed-fee, or incentive type; contracts providing for the', 'issuance of job or task orders; leases; letter contracts, purchase', 'orders, and construction management contracts. It also includes', 'supplemental agreements with respect to any of the preceding.', '‘Contract’ does not include labor contracts with employees of the', 'municipality.” Section 45-55-4(4) (emphases added). Additionally, § 45-55-4(14) defines “[p]rocurement” as:', '“the purchasing, buying, renting, leasing, or otherwise obtaining of', 'any supplies, services, or construction. It also includes all', 'functions that pertain to the obtaining of any supply, service, or', 'construction item, including description of requirements, selection', 'and solicitation of sources, preparation and award of contract, and', 'all phases of contract administration.” (Emphases added.) The bid proposal in this case—the grant of a franchise or concession on town-owned property— does not fall within any statutory exclusion, and therefore, at the very least, falls within the purview of the broad definition of “procurement” as the town was seeking to engage a company to operate a kayaking business on its property, including a lease of that property.', 'Next, § 45-55-5 requires that contracts “exceeding the amount provided by § 45-55-9', 'shall be awarded by competitive bidding.” 2 The contract at issue here sought to generate more', 'than one hundred thousand dollars in revenue for the town and, thus, exceeds the amount 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 45-55-9, entitled “Small purchases[,]” exempts two limited procurements from its purview. “Procurements, not to exceed an aggregate amount of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) for construction and five thousand dollars ($5,000) for all other purchases may be made in accordance with small purchase regulations promulgated by the municipality.”', '- 12 -', 'provided by § 45-55-9. 3 Given the mandate of § 45-55-2(1), that “all municipal contracts shall', 'be awarded by * * * [c]ompetitive sealed bidding,” this reading is a plausible reading of the', 'statute, and furthers the declared intent of the Legislature. 4 (Emphasis added.)', 'This Court previously has held that “the purpose of chapter [55] of title [45] [is the] safeguarding [of] public funds.” H.V.

Therefore, given that the provisions of this chapter are susceptible to more than one plausible reading, the legislative intent of the statute is enormously relevant. The majority’s position however, fails to consider the legislative intent and holds that, because § 45-55-5 does not specifically mention concession contracts, the public funds generated through such contracts are not entitled to the safeguards provided in the statute. In my opinion, this decision will turn municipal competitive bidding in Rhode Island on its head.', 'Conclusion', 'In conclusion, it is my opinion that by immunizing municipal concession and lease contracts from the requirement of state law and competitive bidding, the majority embarks upon dangerous waters and relieves public officials from the requirements of this state’s longstanding statutory framework governing public contracts.

O’Brien-Auty. :",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The appeals before us emanate from the activities of three attorneys who authored pleadings, but did not disclose their respective identities, on behalf of pro se defendants in three separate debt collection cases, a practice colloquially known as ghostwriting. 1 These appeals present two issues of first impression in Rhode Island: (1) whether Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure applies to an attorney who authored a pleading but neither signed it nor entered his or her appearance in the case; and (2) whether the anonymous preparation of pleadings for self-represented litigants is a permissible practice pursuant to the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct.', 'The attorneys in 1', 'See In re Fengling Liu, 664 F.3d 367, 368 (2d Cir. 2011); Halley Acklie Ostergard, Unmasking the Ghost: Rectifying Ghostwriting and Limited-Scope Representation with the Ethical and Procedural Rules, 92 Neb. L. Rev. 655, 656 (2014).', '-1- question appeal from three separate orders entered by two hearing justices sanctioning them for their ghostwriting conduct. The hearing justices imposed sanctions on each attorney for drafting, but not signing, answers and objections to dispositive motions on behalf of the three pro se defendants. All three attorneys argue that Rule 11 does not apply because none had either signed the pleadings or entered an appearance, and that their conduct was a permissible form of limited- scope representation pursuant to Article V, Rule 1.2(c) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct. We hold that the conduct of the three attorneys did not violate Rule 11 and, accordingly, we vacate the sanctions imposed by the three Superior Court orders.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'A', 'Attorney Charles M. Vacca, Jr. (the FIA Action)', 'In May 2011, FIA Card Services, N.A. (FIA) initiated a credit card debt collection action against James D. Pichette. Pichette signed and filed an answer to FIA’s complaint, denying FIA’s allegation of outstanding debt and, in a two-count counterclaim, claimed breach of contract and violation of the “Fair Debt Collections Act.”', 'No attorney either signed the pleadings or entered an appearance on Pichette’s behalf. FIA filed a motion to dismiss both counts of Pichette’s counterclaim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, to which Pichette filed an objection and memorandum in support of his objection. At the first hearing on the motion in January 2012, FIA’s counsel told the hearing justice that Pichette’s pleadings had been drafted, but not signed, by an attorney licensed in Rhode Island. When the hearing justice inquired, Pichette stated that he was involved with a debt consolidation company called Morgan Drexen. Pichette testified that, through this company, he was referred', '-2- to attorney Charles M. Vacca, Jr., who had drafted the documents that Pichette subsequently filed pro se with the court. The hearing justice continued the motion and then issued a notice to Vacca to appear before the court:', '“to conclusively determine [Vacca’s] representation of Mr.', 'Pichette[,] * * * whether or not preparation of pleadings without', 'formally entering [Vacca’s] appearance on behalf of the litigant', '[wa]s allowed by Rhode Island law[,] whether or not Rules of', 'Professional Conduct ha[d] been violated[,] whether or not [Rule', '11] ha[d] been violated[,] and whether or not sanctions should be', 'imposed.”', 'At the hearing, Vacca testified that he was “of counsel to an attorney who is an engagement attorney that’s hired by Morgan Drexen and [he] advise[d] clients that [we]re under the jurisdiction of Rhode Island courts,” that he had prepared the pleadings Pichette had subsequently filed pro se, and that he had prepared pleadings for other litigants who had come before the court. Pichette testified that he contacted Morgan Drexen regarding some credit card debt and that Kimberly Pisinski, Morgan Drexen’s representative, had referred him to Vacca. Both Vacca and Pichette represented to the court that Pichette had declined full representation but had entered into a limited-representation agreement with Vacca. Pichette also testified, however, that he had not understood the affirmative defenses pled in his answer, the basis or substance of the counterclaims alleged, or the content of the objection to the motion to dismiss and the memorandum in support thereof. Vacca’s counsel objected several times to the hearing justice’s questions regarding Vacca and Pichette’s relationship with Morgan Drexen, but the hearing justice overruled all of the objections.', 'The hearing justice issued a written decision on July 26, 2012, finding that ghostwriting was in direct conflict with Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct and violated Rule 11 and that, even though representation that was reasonably limited in scope was allowed pursuant', '-3- to Rule 1.2, Vacca had clearly provided only partial and inadequate representation. The hearing justice entered an order on the same day to the effect that Vacca “shall cease and desist the anonymous preparation of pleadings for self[-]represented litigants[,] * * * [and] provide written notice to each and every pending file in the Rhode Island Superior Court in which he ha[d] prepared such pleadings.” The hearing justice referred the matter to: (1) Disciplinary Counsel for review of whether Vacca’s conduct violated the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct; and (2) the Rhode Island Attorney General “to determine whether or not Attorney Kimberly Pisinski [and] Morgan Drexen * * * are illegally practicing law in this state.” Vacca timely appealed from the order.', 'B', 'Attorney Wendy Taylor Humphrey (the HSBC Action)', 'In January 2011, HSBC Bank Nevada, N.A. (HSBC) initiated a debt collection action against Robert L. Cournoyer, and Cournoyer signed and filed an answer denying HSBC’s allegations.', 'Three months later, HSBC filed a motion for summary judgment, to which Cournoyer filed a pro se objection and memorandum in support thereof. At the June 3, 2011 hearing on HSBC’s motion, HSBC presented the hearing justice with a stipulation. When the hearing justice inquired whether Cournoyer understood the consequences of stipulating to a judgment against him and in favor of HSBC, Cournoyer began talking about “an agreement to pay the lawyer from California” and stated that Wendy Taylor Humphrey was the lawyer who had prepared the pleadings that he had filed with the court. Cournoyer also testified that he had not yet met Taylor Humphrey and thought she was going to be in court for the hearing that day to represent him. In response to the hearing justice’s inquiries, Cournoyer also testified that he had called Morgan Drexen after seeing an advertisement on television, and his friend Carmen', '-4- Martinez—who had accompanied him to court that day—testified that Kimberly Pisinski, an attorney with Morgan Drexen, was the one who paid Taylor Humphrey. During a brief recess, the hearing justice telephoned Taylor Humphrey. The hearing justice then continued the motion for summary judgment to June 6, 2011, told Cournoyer that Taylor Humphrey would be ordered to appear at the June 6 hearing, and asked Cournoyer to also return to court on that day so he could meet Taylor Humphrey.', 'At the June 6, 2011 hearing, Taylor Humphrey testified that Morgan Drexen had asked her “to act as an advisor of sorts” to put together pleadings on behalf of its clients because Cournoyer’s actual attorney, Kimberly Pisinski, was not licensed to practice in Rhode Island. Taylor Humphrey testified that she had spoken with Rhode Island’s Chief Disciplinary Counsel “multiple” times before she had agreed to engage in any work for Morgan Drexen and had received “his blessing * * * to be able to assist these people.” The hearing justice entered an order finding that Taylor Humphrey had ghostwritten pleadings for Cournoyer, further finding that this behavior was unethical and violated Rule 11, and imposing sanctions in the amount of $750.', 'Taylor Humphrey promptly sought review from this Court by filing a petition for writ of certiorari. After issuing the writ of certiorari, we quashed the hearing justice’s order imposing sanctions because Taylor Humphrey had not been provided with an adequate notice and opportunity to be heard prior to the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions. We ordered that Taylor Humphrey be afforded a new hearing with proper notice and an opportunity to be heard, and that the hearing justice address the applicability of Rule 11 to the circumstances of the case, as well as make findings as to whether Taylor Humphrey had violated Rule 11. The hearing justice subsequently ordered Taylor Humphrey to appear and “[s]how [c]ause as to whether sanctions', '-5- should be imposed against you by this [c]ourt for violation of Rule 11 * * *.” In the notice, the hearing justice specifically defined four issues that would be addressed at the hearing. 2 Prior to the hearing, Taylor Humphrey submitted a prehearing memorandum of law addressing these issues. At the show-cause hearing held on November 2, 2012, the hearing justice heard oral argument from Taylor Humphrey’s counsel, but did not receive any additional testimony from Taylor Humphrey.', 'The hearing justice issued a written decision on January 17, 2013, finding that an attorney-client relationship existed between Cournoyer and Taylor Humphrey as a matter of fact and law, that Taylor Humphrey’s conduct in this case violated Article V, Rule 8.4 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct, and that Rule 1.2(c) did not preclude a finding of Rule 11 violations. The hearing justice subsequently entered an order finding that Rule 11 applied to Taylor Humphrey’s “practice of preparing pleadings for pro se litigants without disclosing her identity” and that Taylor Humphrey’s conduct violated Rule 11. The hearing 2', 'The notice stated that:', '“this [c]ourt will address and you will be afforded an opportunity', 'to be heard on the following issues:', '“1. Whether your practice of ghostwriting, which is the drafting of', 'pleadings and other court documents on behalf of the', 'Defendant, who is a self-represented litigant in this matter, is a', 'violation of Rule 11 of the Rhode Island Rules of Civil', 'Procedure;', '“2. Whether your representation of the Defendant for the sole', 'purpose of preparation of pleadings and your failure to disclose', 'such representation of the Defendant to the [c]ourt is a', 'violation of Rule 11 of the Rhode Island Rules of Civil', 'Procedure;', '“3.

Whether you violated Rule 11 of the Rhode Island Rules of', 'Civil Procedure when you drafted documents for the Defendant', 'in this action or for your client, knowing that they will be', 'eventually filed with this [c]ourt.”', '-6- justice also ordered a monetary sanction in the amount of $750. Taylor Humphrey timely appealed from the order.', 'C', 'Attorney Michael Swain (the Discover Bank Action)', 'The facts and travel of the Discover Bank action closely parallel those of the HSBC action, but with a different set of parties and attorneys. Discover Bank initiated a debt collection action against Diana L. O’Brien-Auty and moved for summary judgment. Attorney Michael Swain prepared an answer and an objection to the motion for summary judgment, both of which O’Brien-Auty signed and filed in the Superior Court. A fact unique to this case compared with the other two cases currently before us is that the following statement appeared in the pleadings authored by Swain: “This document was prepared by, or with the assistance of, an attorney licensed in RI and employed by Consumer Law Associates, LLC / Consumer Law Associates, LLP (CA, MI) / Consumer Law Associates, PLLC (NC) – 972-239-4804.” At the first hearing on Discover Bank’s motion for summary judgment, O’Brien-Auty testified that she had been paying a monthly fee to Consumer Law Associates and believed that it was consolidating her credit card debt and paying that debt off, and that she had never met Swain in person—had only spoken to him on the telephone—but believed that he was her attorney. 3 The hearing justice telephoned Swain and ordered him to appear in court on June 6, 2011. The hearing justice then continued the motion for summary judgment to June 6, 2011, told O’Brien-Auty that Swain would be in court on June 6, and asked O’Brien-Auty to also return to court on that day so she could meet Swain. 3', 'Both HSBC’s motion for summary judgment and Discover Bank’s motion for summary judgment were heard on the same day by the same hearing justice.', '-7-', 'The subsequent events in the travel of this case track those of the HSBC action identically. On June 6, 2011, after Taylor Humphrey testified and was sanctioned by the hearing justice, Swain testified that he was paid by “Persels and Associates” 4 to provide “unbundled legal services,” that he had prepared the answer and objection to the motion for summary judgment pursuant to a limited-scope representation agreement, and that he “believed that what [he] was doing was a benefit to [O’Brien-Auty].” As with Taylor Humphrey, the hearing justice entered an order finding that Swain had ghostwritten pleadings in violation of Rule 11 and that this conduct had been unethical, and she imposed a sanction of $750. Swain subsequently filed an appeal with this Court, and we vacated the June 6, 2011 order on the basis that Swain had not been afforded proper notice and an adequate opportunity to be heard. We remanded the case to the Superior Court, ordered that Swain be provided a new hearing with proper notice, and we directed that the hearing justice address the applicability of Rule 11 to the circumstances of this case and make findings regarding whether Swain had violated Rule 11.', 'The hearing justice complied and issued a notice to Swain that was identical to the notice issued to Taylor Humphrey (see footnote 2, supra). Swain also filed a prehearing memorandum addressing the issues. The November 2, 2012 show-cause hearing was a joint hearing for both Attorneys Taylor Humphrey and Swain. The hearing justice heard oral argument on the issues from Swain’s attorney, but she did not receive any additional testimony from Swain. The hearing justice subsequently issued a written decision on January 17, 2013, in which she made findings similar to those concerning Taylor Humphrey: An attorney-client relationship existed between O’Brien-Auty and Swain as a matter of fact and law; Swain’s conduct in this case violated Rule 8.4; and Rule 1.2(c) did not preclude finding a Rule 11 violation. The hearing justice found a Rule 11 violation because Swain had not disclosed his specific identity. She 4', 'Swain testified that Consumer Law Associates was a member of the “Persels Group.”', '-8- stated that the fact that the ghostwritten pleadings in this case contained a written disclosure of a lawyer’s assistance was not a distinguishing factor from the case involving Taylor Humphrey. The hearing justice subsequently entered an order finding that Rule 11 applied to Swain’s “practice of preparing pleadings for pro se litigants” and that Swain’s preparation of pleadings in this case violated Rule 11. The hearing justice also ordered a monetary sanction in the amount of $750. Swain timely appealed from the order.', 'D', 'Docketed Appeals', 'After prebriefing conferences were held in all three attorneys’ appeals, we assigned each appeal to the plenary calendar for full briefing and argument. 5 We directed each attorney to address (1) the propriety of the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions under the circumstances of their respective cases; and (2) whether ‘“ghostwriting’ is permitted under Article V, Rule 1.2(c) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct.” We also invited the Rhode Island Attorney General, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel, the Rhode Island Bar Association, and any other interested parties to file briefs as amici curiae. 6', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'The first issue before us in these three appeals is the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions against three members of the Rhode Island bar for drafting papers subsequently signed and filed by pro se litigants in the Superior Court. Because the propriety of this practice is an issue of first 5', 'FIA notified us that it would not be participating in Vacca’s appeal. Neither HSBC nor Discover Bank filed either prebriefing statements or briefs; both appellees were defaulted in accordance with Article I, Rule 18A of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. 6', 'We thank the Attorney General, the Rhode Island Bar Association, and Certain Advisory Board Members of the Pro Bono Collaborative for the amici briefs and helpful insights into this rapidly evolving aspect of the legal profession. We also thank the office of the Attorney General for its participation at oral argument.', '-9- impression for this Court, our interpretation of Rule 11 lies at the heart of this matter. “Like questions of statutory construction, the interpretation of court rules of procedure is a legal question for the court.” Rosano v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 91 A.3d 336, 339 (R.I. 2014) (quoting UAG West Bay AM, LLC v. Cambio, 987 A.2d 873, 877 (R.I. 2010)). We apply a de novo review to questions of law. Id. While “a trial justice has discretionary authority to formulate what he or she considers to be an appropriate sanction,” we will reverse a sanction when it was imposed based on an erroneous view of the law. Pleasant Management, LLC v. Carrasco, 918 A.2d 213, 217 (R.I. 2007).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The three sanctioned attorneys advance similar arguments before this Court. Attorney Taylor Humphrey argues that the hearing justice erred as a matter of law when she concluded that Taylor Humphrey’s ghostwriting activities violated Rule 11. In addition, Taylor Humphrey argues that, contrary to the hearing justice’s findings, the ghostwriting performed by Taylor Humphrey was in accordance with prevailing law. Taylor Humphrey contends that the hearing justice therefore erred by sanctioning actions that did not violate Rule 11 or any other established rule. Additionally, Taylor Humphrey avers that the hearing justice erred when, after the show- cause hearing and without notice to Taylor Humphrey, she independently researched and relied upon extrinsic facts not in the record in making her decision. 7 7', 'Attorney Taylor Humphrey and Attorney Swain both argued that the hearing justice violated the Supreme Court Code of Judicial Conduct by conducting, and relying on, independent research in rendering her decisions. See Article VI, Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(B)(8) Commentary (“A judge must not independently investigate facts in a case and must consider only the evidence presented.”). After careful review of the record, we fail to see how the hearing justice erred in this respect because none of her factual findings were based solely on this outside research.', '- 10 -', 'Attorney Vacca also argues that his conduct did not violate Rule 11, but rather was in accordance with prevailing law. Furthermore, Vacca contends that the hearing justice erred in relying on “outdated federal case law” to find that his limited representation of Pichette violated Rule 11 and the Rules of Professional Conduct. Finally, Attorney Vacca argues that the hearing justice erred as a matter of law when he allegedly inquired and made findings about matters that were not included in the notice summoning him to appear. 8', 'Attorney Swain argues that the hearing justice erred in finding that Rule 11 applies to an attorney who had not signed the document in question. Furthermore, Swain contends that, even if Rule 11 did apply in this case, the hearing justice nevertheless erred in imposing a sanction against him. Attorney Swain asserts that the hearing justice erred in sanctioning counsel for conduct that was not willful misconduct and was not proscribed by any statute, rule, or decisional authority. Moreover, Attorney Swain argues that the hearing justice erred in declining to find that disclosed drafting assistance to pro se litigants is a generally accepted practice nationwide and, therefore, should not have been the basis for sanctions. In addition, Attorney 8', 'This Court has articulated that, “[a]t a minimum, due process requires that notice be reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.” Resendes v. Brown, 966 A.2d 1249, 1254 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Flynn v. Al-Amir, 811 A.2d 1146, 1151 (R.I. 2002)). Attorney Vacca received a written letter from the hearing justice, providing notice that his attendance was required to “determine [his] representation of Mr. Pichette.” Further, the letter set forth more particularized grounds for the hearing, such as:', '“whether or not preparation of pleadings without formally entering', 'your appearance on behalf of the litigant is allowed by Rhode', 'Island law; whether or not Rules of Professional Conduct have', 'been violated; whether or not the Rules of Civil Procedure (Rule', '11) have been violated; and whether or not sanctions should be', 'imposed.” This notice was sufficiently detailed that Vacca should have known that the way in which he came to represent Pichette—through Pichette’s relationship with Morgan Drexen—would be explored at the hearing. Accordingly, we are satisfied that sufficient due process was afforded to Vacca by the content in this notice and the opportunity to be heard at the hearing.', '- 11 - Swain asserts that the hearing justice also erred in conducting her own independent research outside the record and then using those results to justify the sanction. 9', 'A', 'Applicability of Rule 11', 'This Court is confronted with the question of whether an attorney who engages in ghostwriting—providing drafting assistance to a pro se litigant without disclosing his or her identity to the court either by signing the pleading or entering his or her appearance—violates Rule 11. The practice of attorney ghostwriting is one form of limited-scope representation or unbundled legal services 10 that has emerged out of the current evolving reality that many litigants necessarily proceed without counsel because they cannot afford full representation. Although much has been said concerning attorney ghostwriting by federal courts, state ethics committees, and the legal profession generally, this Court has not yet spoken on this issue. We view the ethical and procedural issues associated with ghostwriting—and, more broadly limited- scope representation—to be of great import for the bench and bar. Consequently, this Court has carefully traversed both the federal and state landscape of the law on ghostwriting before rendering this opinion.', 'The threshold issue for this Court is to determine whether, as the hearing justices concluded, the text of Rule 11 applies to counsel who may have provided some form of limited representation that did not include either their signature on a pleading or an entry of appearance 9', 'After careful review of the record, we fail to see how the hearing justice erred in this respect because she did not make any factual findings based solely on this outside research in these decisions. See discussion in footnote 7, supra. 10', 'The American Bar Association describes the “unbundling” of legal services as occurring when “a lawyer performs only specific, limited tasks instead of handling all aspects of a matter.” ABA Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Formal Opinion 07-446 at 1 (May 5, 2007).', '- 12 - filed with the trial court. Rule 11, as it was styled prior to November 2014, 11 states in relevant part:', '“Every pleading, written motion, and other paper of a party', 'represented by an attorney shall be signed by at least one attorney', 'of record in the attorney’s individual name, whose address and', 'telephone number shall be stated. * * * The signature of an', 'attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the signer that the', 'signer has read the pleading, motion, or other paper; that to the best', 'of the signer’s knowledge, information, and belief formed after', 'reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by', 'existing law or a good faith argument for the extension,', 'modification, or reversal of existing law, and that it is not', 'interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause', 'unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.', '* * * If a pleading, motion, or other paper is signed in violation of', 'this rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may', 'impose upon the person who signed it, a represented party, or both,', 'any appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the', 'other party or parties the amount of the reasonable expenses', 'incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other', 'paper, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.” This rule is based upon the 1983 version of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, rather than the more recently amended federal rule. Rule 11 Committee Notes; see Pleasant Management, LLC, 918 A.2d at 218. The plain language of Rule 11 requires that all pleadings, motions, or other papers be signed. This signature certifies to the court that the signer has made “[a] reasonable inquiry to assure that all pleadings, motions and papers filed with the court are factually well-grounded, legally tenable and not interposed for any improper purpose.” Pleasant Management, LLC, 918 A.2d at 218 (quoting Mariani v. Doctors Associates, Inc., 983 F.2d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 1993)). 11', 'Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure was slightly amended in November 2014 as this Court promulgated its Rules Governing Electronic Filing. See Article X of the Supreme Court Rules. The substantive requirements of Rule 11 have not changed; therefore, the recent amendments to Rule 11 do not affect our analysis, infra, in these appeals.', '- 13 -', 'Rule 11 indicates that this signature requirement may be satisfied by either an attorney of record or a party.', 'The difficulty that arises in the ghostwriting context, however, is that, although the party at issue is arguably represented by an attorney, the attorney has neither signed the pleadings nor entered an appearance and is therefore not, at least in the traditional sense, an “attorney of record.”', 'The pleadings or other papers, rather, are signed by the ostensibly unrepresented party. The hearing justice who sanctioned Attorneys Taylor Humphrey and Swain stated:', '“While this language might be read to suggest that a non-signing', 'attorney cannot be sanctioned under Rule 11, the [c]ourt finds that', 'this reading runs contrary to the clear intent of Rule 11, which is to', 'enforce an attorney’s ethical obligations of candor and honesty in', 'interactions with the tribunal.” The hearing justice interpreted the text of the rule as “set[ting] up a clear dichotomy between ‘the person who signed [the paper]’ and ‘a represented party.’” Thus, the hearing justice concluded that “the proper counterpart to Rule 11’s ‘represented party,’ on whom the court may impose sanctions, is not literally ‘the person who signed [the paper],’ but rather ‘the represented party’s attorney.’”', 'Although we appreciate the hearing justice’s concerns, we disagree with this expansive interpretation of Rule 11 in the ghostwriting context.', 'The plain language of Rule 11 does not implicate ghostwriting because it does not address the author or drafter of the documents. Instead, the linchpin of Rule 11 is its signature requirement. This signature provides the vehicle through which courts may reach attorneys or litigants to impose sanctions, if necessary, for misconduct in the submission of signed papers during the litigation process.', 'The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit observed that Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure does not govern the issue of ghostwriting because only the signature of the “attorney of record” is required, “not a drafting', '- 14 - attorney.” In re Fengling Liu, 664 F.3d 367, 372 n.5 (2d Cir. 2011). In Liu, the Second Circuit declined to impose any sanctions on an attorney for her ghostwriting conduct, stating that “[i]n light of this [c]ourt’s lack of any rule or precedent governing attorney ghostwriting, and the various authorities that permit that practice, we conclude that [the attorney] could not have been aware of any general obligation to disclose her participation to this [c]ourt.” Id. at 372.', 'The hearing justice in the HSBC action and the Discover Bank action cited a 1971 opinion of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (First Circuit) as providing “clear and longstanding federal authority” for the imposition of Rule 11 sanctions for ghostwriting. This 1971 opinion, however, only briefly addresses ghostwriting in dictum with a foreboding note about its concerns regarding the practice “with an eye to the future,” stating: “What we fear is that in some cases actual members of the bar represent petitioners, informally or otherwise, and prepare briefs for them which the assisting lawyers do not sign, and thus escape the obligation imposed on members of the bar, typified by [Rule 11] * * *.” Ellis v. State of Maine, 448 F.2d 1325, 1328 (1st Cir. 1971). We view the First Circuit’s acknowledgment that ghostwriting attorneys evade Rule 11 as support for our ultimate opinion that Rule 11 is not applicable to attorneys for the assistance they provided in drafting papers subsequently filed by pro se litigants. Furthermore, a thorough review of this Court’s Rule 11 jurisprudence has revealed no instance in which sanctions were imposed for a Rule 11 violation absent the filing of pleadings or other papers signed by an attorney. 12 12', 'We pause to note the distinction between the instant set of appeals, in which we are reviewing the imposition of sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, and sanctions that we have affirmed pursuant to the inherent authority of the trial courts.

Musone, 574 A.2d 1234, 1235 (R.I. 1990) (noting that the Superior Court', '- 15 -', 'Next, we turn to the issue of whether ghostwriting contravenes the spirit of Rule 11. The hearing justices endeavored to expand the reach of Rule 11 through an analysis based on the spirit of the rule in conjunction with the Rules of Professional Conduct. In our opinion, this analysis affords too broad a construction to Rule 11. The Committee Notes to Rule 11 do not give any suggestion that the rule was intended to cover the author as well as the signer of documents. As many federal courts have astutely noted, Rule 11, and the Federal Rules in general, do not contemplate limited representation. Our version of Rule 11, similar to the federal rule, envisions only a binary concept of representation: either full representation or no representation. However, this formulation of representation often conflicts with the reality of today’s legal practice. See Rule 1.2(c); see also Jessica K. Steinberg, In Pursuit of Justice?

J. on Poverty L. & Pol’y 453, 466 (2011) (“The ethical duties of competence, diligence, and zeal pose challenging issues for a lawyer providing unbundled legal services * * *.”).', 'Pursuant to our Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 1.2(c) authorizes limited-scope representation provided that it is reasonable and accompanied by informed consent. 13 We will discuss Rule 1.2(c) further below as we address the current and future state of limited-scope representation in Rhode Island.', 'Many federal courts have relied on the intent or the spirit, rather than the letter, of Rule 11 to denounce the practice of ghostwriting. The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reasoned that ghostwriting a pro se party’s brief “constitute[d] a misrepresentation to this court by litigant and attorney.” Duran v. Carris, 238 F.3d 1268, 1272 (10th Cir. 2001). In reaching that conclusion, the court emphasized the signature requirement of Rule 11, noting that relied not on Rule 11, but on “its inherent power to fashion an appropriate remedy that would serve the ends of justice in this controversy”). 13', 'Article V, Rule 1.2(c) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct provides: “A lawyer may limit the scope of the representation if the limitation is reasonable under the circumstances and the client gives informed consent.”', '- 16 - “[b]esides the imprimatur of professional competence such a signature carries, its absence requires us to construe matters differently for the litigant, as we give pro se litigants liberal treatment, precisely because they do not have lawyers.” Id.; see Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972) (noting that a pro se complaint is held to less stringent standards than those afforded to pleadings drafted by attorneys). The hearing justice in the HSBC action and the Discover Bank action also relied on In re Mungo, 305 B.R. 762, 768 (Bankr. D.S.C. 2003), in which a United States Bankruptcy Court judge described ghostwriting as frustrating the application of Rule 11 “by shielding the attorney who drafted pleadings for pro se litigants in a cloak of anonymity.”', 'Although we might agree with the sentiment expressed by the hearing justice in the HSBC action and the Discover Bank action that “the clear intent of Rule 11 * * * is to enforce an attorney’s ethical obligations of candor and honesty in interactions with the tribunal,” we draw a distinction between conduct that offends Rule 11 and that which may violate one of the Rules of Professional Conduct. The hearing justices primarily relied on federal case law that failed to specify how ghostwriting violated Rule 11 beyond general concerns with regard to this practice. For instance, the ghostwriting discussion in Johnson v. Board of County Commissioners For the County of Fremont, 868 F.Supp. 1226, 1231-32 (D. Colo. 1994), and Laremont-Lopez v. Southeastern Tidewater Opportunity Center, 968 F.Supp. 1075, 1078 (E.D. Va. 1997), highlighted two ethical concerns beyond the purview of Rule 11, such as how ghostwriting violates an attorney’s duty of candor and constitutes a misrepresentation to the court. We decline to interpret Rule 11 as applying to the drafting assistance provided by these three nonsignatory counsel and, consequently, perceive no violations thereof. Accordingly, we vacate the hearing', '- 17 - justices’ imposition of sanctions against Attorney Vacca, Attorney Taylor Humphrey, and Attorney Swain. 14', 'B', 'Ghostwriting in Rhode Island', 'When we ordered these appeals to the plenary calendar for full briefing and argument, we directed each appellant to address whether ‘“ghostwriting’ is permitted under Article V, Rule 1.2(c) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct.” The Rhode Island Attorney General and the Rhode Island Bar Association accepted our invitation to submit briefs as amici curiae, and we also allowed an amicus brief to be filed on behalf of Certain Advisory Board Members of the Pro Bono Collaborative (PBC).', 'All three appellants contend that ghostwriting is permitted pursuant to Rule 1.2(c) because most other states ruling on the issue have recognized ghostwriting as within the scope of permitted limited representation and no court in Rhode Island had previously deemed ghostwriting an unethical practice of law.', 'Swain specifically contends that “[u]nbundled representation – legal advice and the drafting of documents – may not be as effective as full representation, but for many litigants the choice is not between unbundled representation and full representation; it is between unbundled representation and no representation at all.”', 'The preparation or drafting of legal documents on behalf of a client unequivocally constitutes the practice of law and thus is subject to the ethical guidelines set forth in the Rules of Professional Conduct. As we are “responsible for promulgating rules regulating the practice of 14', 'We acknowledge that a monetary sanction was not imposed on Attorney Vacca. Instead, he was ordered to “provide written notice to each and every pending file in the Rhode Island Superior Court in which he ha[d] [anonymously] prepared * * * pleadings [for self-represented litigants]” within thirty days of the order and to provide proof of compliance with the order. Counsel for Vacca sent a letter to the hearing justice within the one-month deadline asserting that Vacca had complied with the order.', '- 18 - law and ethical standards for the conduct of attorneys admitted to the Rhode Island Bar,” In re Petition of Almond, 603 A.2d 1087, 1087 (R.I. 1992), the interpretation and application of these ethical rules fall squarely within the purview of this Court. There is no dispute that attorneys may reasonably limit the scope of their representation. We adopted Rule 1.2 of the American Bar Association (ABA)’s Model Rules of Professional Conduct in February 2007; paragraph (c) allows that “[a] lawyer may limit the scope of the representation if the limitation is reasonable under the circumstances and the client gives informed consent.” There are myriad ways in which attorneys may limit the scope of their representation pursuant to Rule 1.2, and we acknowledge the current lack of parameters in place to guide attorneys as to the boundary that separates reasonable from unreasonable limited-scope representation.', 'We also acknowledge that certain activities are currently prohibited by many federal courts, but permitted by many state courts around the country. As we discussed supra, federal courts have historically condemned ghostwriting as a violation of the spirit of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but an increasing number of state courts are permitting various forms of ghostwriting either through the text or a formal interpretation of their Rules of Professional Conduct.', 'In a formal opinion issued in 2007, the ABA’s Standing Committee on Ethics and Professional Responsibility declared that “[a] lawyer may provide legal assistance to litigants appearing before tribunals ‘pro se’ and help them prepare written submissions without disclosing or ensuring the disclosure of the nature or extent of such assistance,” concluding that the Model Rules of Professional Conduct do not prohibit “undisclosed assistance to pro se litigants, as long as the lawyer does not do so in a manner that violates rules that otherwise would apply to the lawyer’s conduct.” Formal Opinion 07-446 at 1, 4 (May 5, 2007). The ABA’s position explicitly', '- 19 - addressed some courts’ concerns that ghostwriting results in a violation of Rule 8.4 (prohibiting lawyers from engaging in conduct that involves dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation). According to the ABA, a lawyer has not been dishonest “[a]bsent an affirmative statement by the client, that can be attributed to the lawyer, that the documents were prepared without legal assistance.” Formal Opinion 07-446 at 4. The ABA also addressed the concern that pro se litigants benefit from an unfair advantage when an attorney ghostwrites the written documents filed in court:', '“We * * * believe that permitting a litigant to file papers that have', 'been prepared with the assistance of counsel without disclosing the', 'nature and extent of such assistance will not secure unwarranted', '‘special treatment’ for that litigant or otherwise unfairly prejudice', 'other parties to the proceeding. Indeed, many authorities studying', 'ghostwriting in this context have concluded that if the undisclosed', 'lawyer has provided effective assistance, the fact that a lawyer was', 'involved will be evident to the tribunal. If the assistance has been', 'ineffective, the pro se litigant will not have secured an unfair', 'advantage. * * *', '“Because there is no reasonable concern that a litigant', 'appearing pro se will receive an unfair benefit from a tribunal as a', 'result of behind-the-scenes legal assistance, the nature or extent of', 'such assistance is immaterial and need not be disclosed.” Id. at 3.', 'We note that various forms of drafting assistance for pro se litigants are currently permitted by state courts around the country. Some states have expressly provided for complete nondisclosure of attorney assistance. See, e.g., Cal. Rules of Court Title 3, chapter 3, Rules 3.35, 3.37. Some states allow the ghostwriting attorney to remain anonymous, but require a disclosure on the ghostwritten document that legal assistance was provided in the preparation of the document. See, e.g., Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct., Order In Re: Limited Assistance Representation (2009). A third variation is when states permit attorneys to assist pro se litigants with document preparation, but require the fact of assistance and the attorney’s name to be disclosed on the document. See, e.g., Colo. R. Prof. Cond. 1.2; Colo. R. Civ. P. 11(b). In Massachusetts, New', '- 20 - Hampshire, and Connecticut, attorneys are permitted to provide anonymous assistance in the preparation of documents that will be filed with the court as long as a notation that the document was “prepared with assistance of counsel” appears on the document.

The PBC contends that the current uncertainty surrounding the permissibility of ghostwriting may be inhibiting attorneys who would otherwise be willing to help a pro bono client “if their participation could be limited and targeted in a more predictable and ethically safe manner.” The PBC also asserts that allowing attorneys to provide limited drafting assistance to pro se litigants “will serve to encourage pro bono participation by more attorneys, will remove barriers and disincentives to such participation and will promote greater access to justice.” The PBC urges that “[g]reater pro bono participation by attorneys * * * will serve to reduce the number of litigants who would otherwise proceed pro se, substantially easing the burden on pro se litigants themselves as well as the burden on Rhode Island courts.”', 'We acknowledge the importance of having clear guidelines to assist practitioners navigating these murky waters.', 'This Court is also mindful of the concerns of some of the members of our legal community. In his amicus brief, the Attorney General, as “the primary enforcer of Rhode Island’s consumer protection laws,” opposes the practice of ghostwriting in general; he asserts that this area represents an “ethical minefield” for opposing counsel and unfairly leverages the 15', 'Rule 17(g) of the Rules of the Superior Court of the State of New Hampshire Applicable in Civil Actions requires the disclosure to contain the following phrase: “This filing was prepared with the assistance of a New Hampshire attorney.”', '- 21 - benefit of lenient construction that is afforded to pleadings filed pro se. Those who oppose ghostwriting express concerns in four main categories: (1) that those who appear in court pro se after filing pleadings ghostwritten by licensed attorneys may be benefiting from an unfair advantage because courts often construe the content of pleadings filed by pro se litigants more leniently; (2) that those who appear in court pro se after filing pleadings ghostwritten by licensed attorneys are left to discuss either counterclaims or defenses that they do not understand; (3) that, if ghostwriting attorneys are not required to reveal their identity, then they will not be held accountable for potential violations of the Rules of Civil Procedure and Rules of Professional Conduct; and (4) that opposing counsel are placed in a precarious position because they may not communicate directly with a party that they know is represented.

See Rule 1.2(c). Such consent shall be in writing and shall set forth the nature and extent of the attorney-client relationship. An attorney, however, shall not assist a pro se litigant with the preparation of pleadings, motions, or other written submissions unless the attorney signs the document and discloses thereon his or her identity and the nature and extent of the assistance that he or she is providing to the tribunal and to all parties to the litigation.

An attorney who helps prepare a pleading, motion, or other paper with the expectation that it will be submitted and filed in court on behalf of a pro se litigant should be held to the same standard of good faith as an attorney of record. We are mindful, however, that an attorney’s limited representation of a client may raise myriad ethical and procedural concerns. We can envision a host of Rules of Professional Conduct potentially implicated—including Article V, Rule 3.1 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct concerning meritorious claims, Rule 3.3 requiring candor toward the tribunal, Rule 3.4 concerning fairness to an opposing party and counsel, Article V, Rule 4.1 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct requiring truthfulness in statements to others, Rule 4.3 concerning interactions with unrepresented persons, and Rule 8.4 prohibiting, inter alia, conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.

7,State : v. : Reynaldo Gomez.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Reynaldo Gomez, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction after having been found guilty by a jury of second-degree sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-4(2). 1 On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in: (1) denying his motion for judgment of acquittal; 2 (2) denying his motion for a new trial; and (3) allowing the complaining witness’s statements to the police 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-37-4, as it was styled at the time pertinent to this case, provided as follows:', '“A person is guilty of a second degree sexual assault if he or she', 'engages in sexual contact with another person and if any of the', 'following circumstances exist:', '“(1) The accused knows or has reason to know that the', 'victim is mentally incapacitated, mentally disabled or', 'physically helpless;', '“(2) The accused uses force or coercion;', '“(3) The accused engages in the medical treatment or', 'examination of the victim for the purpose of sexual arousal,', 'gratification or stimulation.” This version of the statute provides the language applicable to the present case. However, the General Assembly in 2014 amended the “force or coercion” element of the statute. The amended version of § 11-37-4(2) reads: “The accused uses force, element of surprise, or coercion.” P.L. 2014, ch. 164, § 1. 2', 'We note that defendant does not explicitly frame this argument set forth in his prebriefing statement as an appeal from the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal. In defendant’s supplemental briefing memorandum submitted to this Court, however, he does express his insufficiency argument, along with an argument for the preservation thereof, in the context of his motion for judgment of acquittal. We treat it as such.', '-1- officer at the scene into evidence under the excited-utterance exception to the hearsay rule. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The incident giving rise to defendant’s conviction occurred in the early evening of September 13, 2011 in Smithfield, Rhode Island at the Blackbird Farm Stand. Following this incident, defendant was charged by a criminal information, filed in Superior Court on November 29, 2011, with one count of second-degree sexual assault pursuant to § 11-37-4. A jury trial in Superior Court took place over five days in July 2013. The following facts chronicling the unfortunate events that unfolded at the Blackbird Farm Stand came to light at trial.', 'The Blackbird Farm Stand is a small stand or, as it was described at trial, approximately “twice the size of the top of the [trial court] clerk’s desk,” with only three windows and one door. The stand offers customers a selection of goods, such as meat, produce, vegetables, cheese, and milk. Inside the farm stand, in addition to the goods, there was a refrigerator and a counter with a single stool behind it.', 'On September 13, 2011, Jessica 3 was the cashier at the Blackbird Farm Stand perched behind the counter on that lone stool. She was the sole employee working at the farm stand that 3', 'We use a pseudonym to identify the complaining witness.', '-2- day; however, she testified that the farm owner or the owner’s son would typically check on her approximately every two hours. She was eighteen years old at the time, working part-time at the farm stand as a cashier. Jessica had been on the job for about a month.', 'She testified that a male customer, defendant, walked into the farm stand at about 5:30 that evening. Jessica, however, explained that she did not notice him immediately because she had her back to the door while she restocked the refrigerator. In her testimony, Jessica stated that, when she turned around to get additional produce, it was the first time she noticed the customer behind her. At trial, she described him as being “about a foot or two” away from her. Further, she testified, “he didn’t say a word, he didn’t even say anything, which kind of spooked me I guess. * * * [N]ormally customers would say something like ‘Hi’ or ‘How are you?’” Jessica explained that she turned around and said: “Hi. Can I help you with anything?” She testified that in response defendant did not answer her question, but rather he asked her if she spoke Spanish. Next, defendant inquired about where the food products, such as the corn, came from.', 'After this exchange, defendant stepped outside the farm stand. Jessica testified that when defendant went outside, “I felt weird, I just didn’t feel right.” She explained that “I had a bad feeling -- in my stomach, I just -- I don’t particularly like to be alone at that time.” She indicated in response to the state’s question at trial that she felt nervous at that time. Jessica also testified that a female customer entered the Blackbird Farm Stand and purchased some items during this time. Jessica did have a cell phone with her that day. She explained at trial, however, that because her prepaid phone was out of minutes she could use it only to text. After the female customer departed, defendant came back into the farm stand. The defendant asked Jessica, “[d]o you have a husband or a boyfriend?” Jessica testified that she said “no,” which was a response', '-3- that “just came out.” To that response defendant replied: “[y]ou’re very beautiful and I like you. I have a crush on you.” Jessica replied with a “thanks,” which she described at trial as being uttered in a “very sarcastic, kind of angry, mean way.” Jessica detailed that these comments “made me feel worse than I did when he went in there. I felt like just -- I just had a bad feeling.” She indicated that she felt uncomfortable, nervous, and scared. In her testimony, she elaborated that, “I was just afraid that anything could happen. * * * I was just afraid that he would ask me more odd questions and he would come behind the counter or even just lock the door, I don’t -- I don’t know.”', 'At that time, the counter stood between defendant, who was standing in front of it, and Jessica, who was sitting behind it. The defendant appeared to want to purchase some corn. Jessica testified: “I was trying to just hurry up, I wanted to go home, it was six o’clock, so I was just -- I was like ‘[a]re you looking for anything else?’” She stated that defendant perused the bread stand, located at the right corner of the counter, selecting a package of bread to add to his items for checkout. Jessica described that, while ringing up defendant’s order, defendant moved to the side of the counter. After cashing out the corn, Jessica testified that she “s[aw] him closer.” She explained that “I cashed out the bread, and before I know it, he’s like not even a foot away from me.” At trial, she expressed that a customer at the farm stand had never before come that close to her. Jessica testified that, while she continued to total the cost of his order, defendant “put[] his hand on [her] inner thigh.” She was wearing a pair of shorts and was seated atop the stool behind the counter. Jessica explained at trial that, in response, she “said ‘[n]o’ and I pushed [his hand] away.” She testified further that she “felt like I was going to throw up,” was “scared,” and “wanted to cry.” She also indicated that she noticed defendant was “aroused” at that time.', '-4-', 'There was no one else around at the farm stand. Jessica testified that defendant then touched her again when he “swept [her] vagina over her shorts.” She stated that she then got the price of his order, which she told him three times, and then she “told him that I was [fourteen] as a defense to make him somewhat scared that, you know, maybe I’m a minor, maybe you shouldn’t do that, but that was a defense.” According to Jessica, defendant responded “[o]kay, okay, I’m sorry, you’re very beautiful.” She explained that defendant paid in cash and “left in a hurry” because he must have seen another customer arrive. Jessica detailed that next she went to the window and grabbed a marker to write down defendant’s license plate on her hand. When questioned about how she felt at that time, she indicated that she felt “shocked” and also “felt relieved at the same time because he left.” She also indicated that she was upset, crying, and shaking.', 'A second witness, Michael Lamoureux, testified that he decided to deviate from his usual work-to-home routine that day with a stop at the Blackbird Farm Stand.', 'This was Mr. Lamoureux’s first visit to the farm stand. He had driven past the Blackbird Farm Stand twice a day for years, but he finally decided to stop and support the local farmer. In his testimony at trial, Mr. Lamoureux described that, when he pulled into the parking lot, he noticed a red Pontiac parked right in front of the farm stand. Mr. Lamoureux was the next customer to enter the farm stand after defendant’s hasty departure. Jessica explained that she had never met Mr. Lamoureux previously, but after he asked her if she was all right, she explained what had happened. She told him that she had just been assaulted. Mr. Lamoureux testified that “[Jessica] seemed very upset, she was visibly shaken and physically shaking when I entered the building.”', 'Mr. Lamoureux explained that he immediately went outside and got a description of the car and license plate, as well as a “cursory description” of the driver of the vehicle. At the time', '-5- of trial, Mr. Lamoureux stated that he was employed as a sales executive at a computer company, but that he had the background and training of a military police officer.', 'Mr. Lamoureux explained that he utilized his military training in taking quick action to secure these descriptions and dial 9-1-1. The police arrived at the Blackbird Farm Stand approximately ten minutes later.', 'Jessica spoke briefly with Officer Michael Proulx of the Smithfield Police Department inside the farm stand. Officer Proulx testified at trial that Jessica’s demeanor at that time was “[u]pset, trembling, tearful.” When Officer Proulx questioned Jessica at the scene, she told him that she had just been assaulted. Defense counsel lodged an objection at this response, which was initially sustained. However, the trial justice entertained brief discussion at sidebar and then overruled that objection after determining that Jessica’s response qualified as an excited utterance. Officer Proulx next inquired of Jessica as to who had perpetrated the assault. In response, Officer Proulx testified that Jessica provided him with defendant’s license plate number that she had written on her hand. Officer Proulx explained that he immediately went back to his cruiser and ran the license plate number. Officer Proulx also recounted Jessica’s description of the vehicle as “an older model red Pontiac.” Subsequently, Officer Proulx drove Jessica to the police station where she proffered and he transcribed an official statement regarding the incident. The next day Jessica returned to the police station in order to view a photo array. She identified and selected defendant from the six photos presented.', 'At the conclusion of the state’s presentation of evidence, defendant made a motion for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 4 4', 'Rule 29(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure states, in pertinent part:', '“The court on motion of a defendant or on its own motion shall', 'order the entry of judgment of acquittal of one or more offenses', 'charged in the indictment, information, or complaint, after the', '-6- In arguing that motion, defendant asserted that there was insufficient evidence of intent for sexual gratification. The defendant argued that the alleged touching could be “construed in every way as an accidental sweeping.” The trial justice found sufficient evidence of intent for sexual gratification and therefore denied defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal. The defendant then rested.', 'The jury returned a verdict of guilty on one count of second-degree sexual assault. The defendant subsequently filed a motion for a new trial, and a hearing was held on the motion on November 8, 2013. The trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. The defendant was sentenced to ten years, with one year to serve and nine years suspended with probation, as conditions of which he was to cooperate with sex-offender counseling and register as a sex- offender. The judgment of conviction was entered on February 25, 2014. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Discussion', 'The defendant raises three issues on appeal. First, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial by overlooking and misconceiving material evidence. Second, defendant contends that the state failed to prove the element of “force or coercion” necessary to sustain a conviction for second-degree sexual assault. Third, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in admitting Jessica’s statements—made to Officer Proulx at the farm stand—into evidence at trial under the excited-utterance exception to the hearsay rule. We address each issue in turn, providing additional facts as necessary.', 'evidence on either side is closed, if the evidence is insufficient to', 'sustain a conviction of such offense or offenses.”', '-7-', 'A', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant avers that the trial justice “overlooked and misapprehended critical evidence” in concluding that Jessica was a “credible witness whose testimony deserves much weight.” The state, for its part, argues that there was no error in the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial.', '1. Standard of Review', '“We have oft stated that, ‘[w]hen faced, as here, with both Rule 29 and [Super. R. Crim. P.] 33 motions, this Court first conducts a review of the new-trial motion.’” State v. Storey, 102 A.3d 641, 646 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Fleck, 81 A.3d 1129, 1133 (R.I. 2014)). We employ this approach in our review because a defendant has a “higher hurdle to overcome when arguing a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal than when he seeks to prevail on a Rule 33 motion for a new trial * * *.” Id. (quoting Fleck, 81 A.3d at 1133). “[U]nless a defendant can show that the presented evidence failed to support his or her conviction upon the motion-for-a-new-trial standard, a defendant necessarily will be unable to establish he or she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.” Id. (quoting State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 640 (R.I. 2011)).', '“When a trial justice is presented with a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, he or she ‘acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” Storey, 102 A.3d at 646 (quoting State v. Watkins, 92 A.3d 172, 191 (R.I. 2014)). “[T]he trial justice must consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, then independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and also ultimately determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. (quoting Watkins, 92 A.3d at 191). “If, after', '-8- conducting this independent review, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Id. (quoting Watkins, 92 A.3d at 191). “Only when the trial justice does not agree with the jury’s verdict, [must he or she] embark on a fourth analytical step.” Id. (quoting Watkins, 92 A.3d at 191).', '“This Court’s review of a denial of a motion for a new trial is deferential because the trial justice is in an ‘especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses * * *.’” Storey, 102 A.3d at 647 (quoting Watkins, 92 A.3d at 191). “If the trial justice has articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion, his or her decision is entitled to great weight and will not be overturned by this Court unless he or she has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting Watkins, 92 A.3d at 191).', '2. Analysis', 'After a review of the record, it is clear to this Court that defendant’s arguments on appeal evince little more than a disagreement with the trial justice’s determination on the credibility of the complaining witness, Jessica. The trial justice found that “[t]he evidence in light of the jury charge was strong and consistent with this verdict.” With regard to Jessica, she found her to be “a credible witness whose testimony deserves much weight.” The trial justice also specifically rejected the contention that Jessica had an ulterior, pecuniary motive in this case. The trial justice explained that, “[a]lthough the defense attempted to portray her as a money-hungry victim trying to leverage a personal injury action, she did not in any way appear to be that person to the [c]ourt. She appeared honest and forthright.” The trial justice also observed: “[t]he fact that she said nothing to the woman who appeared in the store does not faze this [c]ourt, nor does the fact that she didn’t text anyone from her broken cell phone faze the [c]ourt. She was credible.”', '-9-', 'The defendant attempts to challenge this credibility determination made at trial on the basis of inconsistencies in Jessica’s accounts of the incident. In particular, defendant highlights the fact that Mr. Lamoureux told the police in his official statement that, upon arriving at the Blackbird Farm Stand, Jessica told him that defendant had “grabbed her leg around the counter and she told him to leave immediately.” The defendant makes the point that Jessica in her own testimony made no mention of asking defendant to leave after he touched her.', 'Further, defendant maintains that Jessica made no mention of any “‘sweeping’ of her vagina” to Mr. Lamoureux or Officer Proulx.', 'Finally, defendant contends that Jessica added additional elements of resistance in each of her subsequent accounts of the incident, which she did not describe in her testimony at trial.', 'This Court in State v. Jimenez observed that “[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for new trial.” State v. Jimenez, 33 A.3d 724, 738 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 903 (R.I. 2010)). We afford great deference to the trial justice’s determinations on a witness’s credibility because the trial justice has “had the opportunity to observe the witnesses testify ‘and therefore is in a better position [than this Court] to weigh the evidence and to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses * * *.’” Id. (quoting State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 367 (R.I. 2011)). Moreover, “if the trial justice has stated sufficient grounds for denying a motion for a new trial, we will not overturn that decision unless the trial justice ‘has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.’” State v. LaPierre, 57 A.3d 305, 311 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Bunnell, 47 A.3d 220, 233 (R.I. 2012)).', 'Here, the trial justice articulated adequate grounds to support her decision. The trial justice also determined that in addition to Jessica, Mr. Lamoureux and Officer Proulx were also', '- 10 - both highly credible witnesses. She explained that: “[a]ll of the evidence was extremely credible and worthy of belief. This Court would not have reached a different decision from that of the jury.” Ultimately, in rendering her decision to deny the motion for a new trial, the trial justice said: “[T]his Court finds that the jury’s verdict was consistent with the evidence and the instructions given to the jury, the jury charge with respect to the charge of second-degree sexual assault. The facts as testified to clearly demonstrated that a sexual assault did take place on this day.” Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice articulated adequate grounds for her decision to deny the motion for a new trial and did not overlook or misconceive material evidence in rendering her decision.', 'B', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'On appeal, defendant argues that it is clear from the record that the state failed to prove the element of “force or coercion” necessary to sustain a conviction for second-degree sexual assault under § 11-37-4(2). The state contends that defendant has waived this argument because he did not raise it below and therefore did not preserve it for review by this Court. In particular, the state avers that defendant failed to make the argument that the element of “force or coercion” was not met in either his motion for judgment of acquittal or his motion for a new trial. With regard to the motion for judgment of acquittal, the state asserts that defendant confined his argument at that time to the issue of intent for sexual gratification. 5 With regard to the motion for a new trial, the state emphasizes that defendant attacked Jessica’s credibility rather than the evidence present in the record to prove “force or coercion.” Finally, the state asserts that, even if 5', 'The trial justice asked for clarification from defense counsel as to whether the only issue being argued on the Rule 29 motion was lack of intent for sexual gratification. Defense counsel confirmed that that was correct.', '- 11 - the issue was preserved, there was sufficient evidence of Jessica’s resistance for this Court to affirm defendant’s conviction.', '1. Standard of Review', '“In reviewing the denial of a motion for a judgment of acquittal, ‘we apply the same standard as that applied by the trial justice; namely, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility to the state’s witnesses, and draw therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.’” State v. Rolon, 45 A.3d 518, 523 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Caba, 887 A.2d 370, 372 (R.I. 2005)). “If the totality of the evidence so viewed and the inferences so drawn would justify a reasonable juror in finding a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the motion for judgment of acquittal must be denied.” State v. Snow, 670 A.2d 239, 243 (R.I. 1996).', '2. Analysis', 'After conducting a careful review of the record, and particularly defendant’s arguments made before the trial justice, we have serious doubts as to whether defendant preserved his insufficient evidence of “force or coercion” argument for our review.', 'Nevertheless, we determine that, even if this argument had been properly raised, sufficient evidence of “force” exists to sustain defendant’s conviction for second-degree sexual assault. 6 The defendant was found guilty of second-degree sexual assault in violation of § 11-37-4(2), which, at the time, stated in pertinent part: “A person is guilty of a second degree sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual contact with another person and if any of the following circumstances exist: * * * (2) 6', 'With respect to defendant’s Rule 29 motion, the record reveals that defendant raised only the issue of insufficient evidence of intent for sexual gratification below. Now, on appeal, defendant raises only the issue of insufficient evidence of “force or coercion” to sustain his conviction.', '- 12 - The accused uses force or coercion.” “Force or coercion” is defined in § 11-37-1(2) as when the accused does any of the following:', '“(i) Uses or threatens to use a weapon, or any article used', 'or fashioned in a manner to lead the victim to reasonably', 'believe it to be a weapon.', '“(ii) Overcomes the victim through the application of', 'physical force or physical violence.', '“(iii) Coerces the victim to submit by threatening to use', 'force or violence on the victim and the victim reasonably', 'believes that the accused has the present ability to execute', 'these threats.', '“(iv) Coerces the victim to submit by threatening to at some', 'time in the future murder, inflict serious bodily injury upon', 'or kidnap the victim or any other person and the victim', 'reasonably believes that the accused has the ability to', 'execute this threat.” (Emphasis added.)', 'The definition applicable to the facts of the present case is set forth in § 11-37-1(2)(ii), which focuses on physical force. This Court has stated that, in order to sustain a conviction for second-degree sexual assault, the state “must prove force beyond that necessary to commit the sexual assault.” State v. Goodreau, 560 A.2d 318, 322 (R.I. 1989); see State v. Jacques, 536 A.2d 535, 537 (R.I. 1988). In order to meet that standard, the state must demonstrate that the victim did not consent to the act. Goodreau, 560 A.2d at 322. Therefore, if the state introduces evidence of the victim’s resistance to the act, then the defendant has used force beyond that necessary to commit the sexual assault. Id. We have recognized that the victim need only “offer such resistance as seems reasonable under all the circumstances.” Id. at 322-23 (quoting State v. Carvalho, 122 R.I. 461, 467, 409 A.2d 132, 136 (1979)).', 'We find that the evidence of Jessica’s resistance, which consisted of her telling defendant “no” and pushing his hand away, after he first touched her leg, and telling defendant she was fourteen was reasonable under the circumstances. Her verbal and physical reactions demonstrate her lack of consent to these offensive touchings by defendant. As such, we are of the opinion', '- 13 - that there was sufficient evidence of “force” within the meaning of § 11-37-1(2)(ii) to warrant submitting the second-degree sexual assault charge to the jury. Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal.', 'C', 'Excited Utterance', 'The final argument that defendant advances on appeal is his contention that the trial justice abused her discretion in finding that all of Jessica’s hearsay statements made to Officer Proulx at the farm stand were nevertheless admissible as excited utterances. The state argues that there was no error in the admission of Jessica’s statements to Officer Proulx at the scene.', '1. Standard of Review', 'Hearsay is defined in Rule 801(c) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence as “a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” Rule 802 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence sets forth the general prohibition against the admissibility of hearsay statements other than those well-recognized exceptions carved out by law. “[A] determination of whether an out-of-court statement meets an exception to the hearsay rule is within the trial justice’s discretion.” Watkins, 92 A.3d at 187 (quoting State v. Martin, 68 A.3d 467, 475 (R.I. 2013)). Under this standard, this Court will uphold the trial justice’s ruling unless a clear “abuse of discretion that prejudices the complaining party is shown.” Id. (quoting Martin, 68 A.3d at 475).', '2. Analysis', 'Among the well-recognized exceptions to the hearsay rule is the exception for excited utterances. State v. Torres, 787 A.2d 1214, 1222 (R.I. 2002). Rule 803(2) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence defines an excited utterance as “[a] statement relating to a startling event or', '- 14 - condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.” The rationale behind the excited-utterance exception is deeply rooted in the belief that “a startling event may produce an effect that temporarily stills the declarant’s capacity of reflection and produces statements free of conscious fabrication.” Martin, 68 A.3d at 475 (quoting State v. Oliveira, 961 A.2d 299, 314 (R.I. 2008)). Therefore, this Court has established that a particular guarantee of trustworthiness accompanies the declarant’s statement so long as it is an “instinctive outpouring” or an “effusion.” Torres, 787 A.2d at 1222 (quoting State v. Krakue, 726 A.2d 458, 462 (R.I. 1999)). In accordance with this rationale, “[t]he test is whether, from a consideration of all the facts, the declarant was still laboring under the stress of excitement caused by the event when he or she made the statement at issue.” Martin, 68 A.3d at 475 (quoting Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 315).', 'The statement at issue need not be “strictly contemporaneous with the startling event” in order to qualify as an excited utterance. Martin, 68 A.3d at 475 (quoting Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 315). Furthermore, this Court has recognized that “[t]he time requirement is more lenient in sexual assault cases * * *.” Id. (quoting Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 315). The modest relaxation of this timing requirement is based upon the understanding that, in sexual assault cases, “the shock of the event often lasts longer and the outpouring may come only later, when a parent, friend, or officer is present.” Id. at 475-76 (quoting Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 315). Nevertheless, it is the state that bears “the burden of proving that the statement is spontaneous and was made before the declarant had an opportunity to contrive or misrepresent.” Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 315 (quoting State v. Burgess, 465 A.2d 204, 207 (R.I. 1983)).', 'Here, evidence was presented at trial that reasonably supports a conclusion that Jessica was “still laboring under the stress of the nervous excitement engendered by the event” when she', '- 15 - spoke to Officer Proulx. Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 315 (quoting State v. Morales, 895 A.2d 114, 120 (R.I. 2006)). At trial, Jessica testified that defendant touched her “inner thigh” and “swept [her] vagina,” which actions occurred shortly before she spoke with Officer Proulx. The record establishes that the statements in question were made to Officer Proulx after he arrived at the Blackbird Farm Stand about ten minutes after the incident occurred. In our opinion, ten minutes is not a significant lapse of time under the circumstances. Notably, according to testimony at trial, Jessica appeared to be in physical distress following the incident. Mr. Lamoureux testified that when he arrived at the farm stand “[Jessica] seemed very upset, she was visibly shaken and physically shaking when I entered the building.” He also described her demeanor as “crying and shaking” while he called the police and waited for them to arrive. Officer Proulx described meeting Jessica in a similar “[u]pset, trembling, [and] tearful” state when he arrived at the Blackbird Farm Stand. The statements made by Jessica to Officer Proulx were not unprompted; rather her statements came in response to inquiries from Officer Proulx.', 'Their exchange consisted of a series of questions, which prompted Jessica to: (1) tell Officer Proulx that “[s]he was just assaulted;” (2) explain by whom by providing the license plate number recorded on her hand; and (3) describe the vehicle she saw exiting the Blackbird Farm Stand.', 'The fact that Jessica’s statements came in response to Officer Proulx’s questions is not dispositive as to whether the excited-utterance exception is applicable here. See Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 315; State v. St. Jean, 469 A.2d 736, 737-38 (R.I. 1983) (affirming the admissibility of victim’s statements made in response to police officer’s questioning at the scene less than five hours after the startling event under the excited-utterance exception); see also State v. Creighton, 462 A.2d 980, 982 (R.I. 1983). This Court, however, does consider “[w]hether a statement was in response to an inquiry [as] a factor in determining spontaneity.” Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 315.', '- 16 - We have held previously that “a response to a question can still be a spontaneous verbal reaction.” Id. at 316; see St. Jean, 469 A.2d at 738; Creighton, 462 A.2d at 982-83. Given that Officer Proulx, in observing Jessica, described that “[y]ou could physically see the tears and you could see her trembling” just before he spoke with her, it was not unreasonable for the trial justice to find that her responses were spontaneous and made while still laboring under the stress of the event. See Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 316.', 'In light of our holding, we take this occasion to reiterate our observation from Oliveira in that “[t]he use of such terms as ‘tears,’ ‘nervous,’ or ‘upset’ are not to be the ‘open sesame’ to having a declarant’s statement classified as a spontaneous utterance.” Oliveira, 961 A.2d at 316 (quoting St. Jean, 469 A.2d at 739).', 'We nevertheless recognize that the admissibility of evidence under the excited-utterance exception is a determination committed to the “sound discretion of the trial justice.” Id. at 314. In the present case, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in admitting Jessica’s statements made to Officer Proulx under the excited-utterance exception to the hearsay rule.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

This insurance-coverage dispute presents a novel legal question regarding an insurer’s duty to defend that arises from a set of tragic circumstances involving the alleged sexual assault of a nursing home resident.', 'The plaintiff, Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island (JUA), sought a declaratory judgment from the Superior Court to establish that it owed no duty to defend its insured, Charlesgate Nursing Center, L.P. (Charlesgate), two of Charlesgate’s general partners, and two of its employees (collectively Charlesgate defendants), 1 against the allegations set forth in a separate civil action 2 filed by the administrator of the estate of a former resident of Charlesgate (complaint or estate’s complaint). The JUA now appeals from the judgment denying its motion for summary judgment and granting the Charlesgate defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment on their counterclaim for declaratory judgment. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The defendants named in the declaratory-judgment action include: Charlesgate Nursing Center, L.P. (Charlesgate), Davenport Associates, LTD., Paul S. Davenport, Lynda Gaboriault, and Sandra James (collectively Charlesgate defendants). 2', 'The underlying civil action, docketed as PC 2012-1071, is currently pending in the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'This appeal proceeds from an alleged sexual assault that purportedly occurred at the Charlesgate Nursing Center in June 2009. From December 2008 to December 2009, the JUA insured Charlesgate under a policy (JUA policy or policy), which provided coverage for both: (1) hospital professional liability (HPL) and (2) commercial general liability (CGL). In June 2009, a fifty-six-year-old woman, suffering from Huntington’s disease and residing at and in the care of Charlesgate, claimed that she was the victim of a sexual assault perpetrated by Josiah Ajibade Olowoporoku, 3 an employee and certified nursing assistant (CNA) at Charlesgate. The resident passed away on October 17, 2011.', 'On February 28, 2012, her son, in his capacity as administrator of her estate, filed suit in the Superior Court against Charlesgate, along with its partners, Davenport Associates, LTD., Paul S. Davenport, and its employees, Lynda Gaboriault, Sandra James, and Olowoporoku.', 'To resolve this appeal, this Court must determine whether the allegations contained in the estate’s complaint bring the injury complained of within the coverage of the insurance policy. Accordingly, we confine our recitation of the facts to only those alleged in the estate’s complaint, mindful that at this stage of the proceedings no facts have been adjudicated by a judge or jury. The complaint details a terrible sequence of events occurring at Charlesgate, beginning on June 16, 2009, when Olowoporoku sexually and physically assaulted the resident in her room. At the time of the assault, defendant Sandra James, a CNA, was at the nurse’s station where she heard the resident’s cries for help, but she did not respond. Instead, James reported the resident’s screams to defendant Gaboriault, her colleague and a registered nurse at Charlesgate, but 3', 'Olowoporoku was subsequently found by a jury not guilty of all criminal charges relating to these allegations.', '-2- Gaboriault also failed to respond. At some point that day, the resident informed Sharon Scott, a medical technician at Charlesgate, that she had been raped by Olowoporoku, and Scott reported the incident to Gaboriault on June 16 and again on June 17. Also on June 17, the resident reported the assault to James. According to the complaint, Charlesgate continued to employ Olowoporoku even after the resident had informed several Charlesgate employees of his alleged misconduct.', 'In an affidavit, the administrator of the resident’s estate stated that his grandmother received a call from Charlesgate on June 18, 2009, notifying her of the alleged sexual assault of his mother. Thereafter, he went to Charlesgate on June 18 at which time he “insisted” that Charlesgate “immediately report the incident to the police department.” The same day a rape kit was administered to the resident at Women and Infants Hospital. The estate alleges that, after the assault but prior to the administration of the rape kit, the resident was given at least three bed baths and one shower at Charlesgate. The estate asserts in its complaint that the “results of the rape kit administered on June 18, 2009 revealed bruising, a laceration, excoriation, and trauma or penetration to the vaginal area.”', 'In addition to these factual allegations, the estate’s complaint contained six counts, including: negligence against Charlesgate (count 1), Davenport Associates (count 2), Davenport (count 3), Gaboriault (count 5), and James (count 6); and assault and battery against Olowoporoku (count 4). With regard to the negligence counts, the complaint set forth specific allegations against the Charlesgate defendants, including the failure: to properly supervise, train, or screen its employees; to provide proper security measures; to report that a resident had been abused or mistreated within twenty-four hours in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 23-17.8-2; 4 and to 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 23-17.8-2 provides, in pertinent part, that:', '-3- discipline its employees following the alleged sexual assault. As a direct and proximate result of this alleged negligence, the estate claims that the resident suffered “severe personal injuries, shock and injury to her nervous system, extreme pain and suffering, mental anguish, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, humiliation, embarrassment, severe emotional distress, and was otherwise injured and damaged.”', 'After receiving notice of the estate’s complaint, the JUA issued a reservation of rights letter and initiated an investigation to determine whether it had a duty to defend the Charlesgate defendants under the policy. After conducting its review, the JUA concluded that: “no defense coverage is afforded to Charlesgate or the other insureds referenced above as to the [estate’s complaint] and, thus, at this juncture, no indemnity coverage under either HPL or the CGL insurance coverage afforded by the JUA.” In reaching this conclusion, the JUA reasoned that (1) the alleged sexual assault did not constitute a “medical incident” within the ambit of HPL coverage, and (2) the alleged sexual assault “cannot be construed as an accident under any definition” and therefore is not an “occurrence” within the meaning of the CGL insurance coverage.', 'Subsequently, the JUA filed the instant declaratory-judgment action in Superior Court seeking a declaration that it has no duty to defend the Charlesgate defendants against the', '“(a) Any physician, medical intern, registered nurse,', 'licensed practical nurse, nurse’s aide, orderly, certified nursing', 'assistant * * * or any person, within the scope of their employment', 'at a facility or in their professional capacity, who has knowledge of', 'or reasonable cause to believe that a patient or resident in a facility', 'has been abused, mistreated, or neglected shall make, within', 'twenty-four (24) hours or by the end of the next business day, a', 'telephone report to the director of the department of health or his', 'or her designee for those incidents involving health care facilities', '* * *.”', '-4- allegations set forth in the estate’s complaint. 5 The Charlesgate defendants responded by filing a two-count counterclaim. In the first count, they requested a declaratory judgment establishing that the JUA has a duty to defend each of the Charlesgate defendants in the action by the estate. In the second count, they sought damages for the JUA’s alleged breach of contract based on its refusal to defend the Charlesgate defendants in the suit.', 'In January 2013, the JUA filed a motion for summary judgment in its declaratory- judgment action. In February 2013, the Charlesgate defendants filed an objection along with a cross-motion for summary judgment with regard to the first count of their counterclaim requesting the declaratory judgment. 6 A hearing on the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment occurred in the Superior Court on May 14, 2013. On May 17, 2013, an order was entered denying the JUA’s motion for summary judgment and granting the Charlesgate defendants’ cross-motion for summary judgment with respect to the declaratory-judgment count of their counterclaim. The order specified that the JUA owed a duty to defend Charlesgate, Davenport Associates, Davenport, Gaboriault, and James against the claims alleged in counts 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the estate’s complaint. The JUA filed a motion, which was joined by the Charlesgate defendants, requesting an entry of final judgment in accordance with Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. This motion was granted and subsequently a Rule 54(b) judgment was entered. 7 On July 31, 2013, the JUA filed a timely notice of appeal. 5', 'The estate was also named as a defendant in the declaratory-judgment action. 6', 'Specifically, count 1 of the Charlesgate defendants’ counterclaim requested a declaration that the JUA is contractually obligated to defend each of said defendants based on the allegations in counts 2, 3, 5, and 6 of the estate’s complaint. 7', 'After the entry of the judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, the sole count remaining in the declaratory-judgment action is the breach-of-contract claim, which is the second count of the Charlesgate defendants’ counterclaim.', '-5-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court examines an appeal from cross-motions for summary judgment de novo. Quest Diagnostics, LLC v. Pinnacle Consortium of Higher Education, 93 A.3d 949, 951 (R.I. 2014). “In reviewing the Superior Court’s judgment on the parties’ motions for summary judgment, we * * * apply the same standards as those used by the trial court.” Id. (quoting Peloquin v. Haven Health Center of Greenville, LLC, 61 A.3d 419, 424 (R.I. 2013)). “Thus, [s]ummary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the [C]ourt determines that there are no issues of material fact in dispute, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Id. (quoting Peloquin, 61 A.3d at 424-25).', '“An insurance policy is contractual in nature[.]” Derderian v. Essex Insurance Co., 44 A.3d 122, 127 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Papudesu v. Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island, 18 A.3d 495, 498 (R.I. 2011)). Accordingly, when interpreting the disputed terms of an insurance policy, we must do so in accordance with the rules of construction that govern contracts. Nunez v. Merrimack Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 88 A.3d 1146, 1149 (R.I. 2014). “It is well-settled that this Court shall not depart from the literal language of the policy absent a finding that the policy is ambiguous.” Id.

Peerless Insurance Co., 41 A.3d 647, 650 (R.I. 2012)).', 'In order to determine whether the terms of a policy are ambiguous, “we give words their plain, ordinary, and usual meaning.” Derderian, 44 A.3d at 128 (quoting Bliss Mine Road Condominium Association v.

Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 703 A.2d 608, 610 (R.I. 1997)). “Indeed, as this Court often has said, we shall ‘refrain from engaging in mental gymnastics or from stretching the imagination to read ambiguity into a policy where none is present.’” Koziol, 41 A.3d at 651 (quoting Bliss Mine Road Condominium Association, 11 A.3d at 1083).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The precise language of the JUA policy lies at the heart of this appeal. As such, all three parties’ arguments center on core terms in the CGL and HPL coverage forms of the JUA policy. On appeal, the JUA argues that the language set forth in the estate’s complaint does not trigger HPL coverage under the policy because there was no “medical incident” alleged. 8 With regard to CGL coverage, the JUA avers that the sexual assault alleged in the complaint does not constitute an “occurrence,” which is defined in the policy as an “accident.”', 'The Charlesgate defendants counter that the alleged negligence claims against them are indeed an “occurrence” under the terms of the CGL coverage in the policy. In addition, the Charlesgate defendants argue that neither the sexual act nor the criminal act exclusion applies 8', 'We do not address the arguments with respect to potential HPL coverage under the JUA policy because the Charlesgate defendants, as the insured parties under the JUA policy, do not contend that they are entitled to HPL coverage under the terms of the policy. Nevertheless, we are mindful that the estate, for its part, argues that the complaint triggers HPL coverage under the “pleadings test” because it alleged a “medical incident” as defined by the JUA policy.', '-7- because none of these defendants are alleged to have committed sexual or criminal acts. 9 In terms of CGL coverage, the estate largely mirrors the argument of the Charlesgate defendants in that the language in the complaint does allege an “occurrence,” as defined in the JUA policy, based on the proximate cause of the injuries alleged. Finally, the estate asserts that the HPL and CGL coverage exclusions for criminal and sexual acts are not applicable in this case.', 'It is well settled in Rhode Island that the “pleadings test” is applied in order to ascertain whether an insurer has a duty to defend an insured. Peerless Insurance Co. v. Viegas, 667 A.2d 785, 787 (R.I. 1995). “That test requires the trial court to look at the allegations contained in the complaint, and ‘if the pleadings recite facts bringing the injury complained of within the coverage of the insurance policy, the insurer must defend irrespective of the insured’s ultimate liability to the plaintiff.’” Id. (quoting The Employers’ Fire Insurance Co. v.

See id. (quoting Beals, 103 R.I at 631, 240 A.2d at 402). “[I]n other words, when a complaint contains a statement of facts which bring the case within or potentially within the risk coverage of the policy, the insurer has an unequivocal duty to defend.” Beals, 103 R.I. at 632, 240 A.2d at 403.', 'In its arguments, the JUA urges this Court to treat all the facts alleged in the complaint as averring only “a violent, intentional sexual assault.” We decline to take such a narrow view of 9', 'We note that we need not address the arguments made by the Charlesgate defendants with regard to the sexual and criminal act exclusions in the JUA policy. Although the JUA raised this argument in its prebriefing statement, it did not raise the argument in its full brief before this Court. In fact, the JUA explicitly acknowledged in its reply brief that it was not raising any argument that the “sexual or criminal act exclusions of the CGL policy apply.” This was confirmed by counsel for the JUA at oral argument.', '-8- the facts alleged. The complaint also includes independent factual allegations offered in support of the claims of negligence on the part of the Charlesgate defendants.', 'Furthermore, the Charlesgate defendants are the insureds seeking coverage under the JUA policy, not Olowoporoku who allegedly raped the resident in her room. As such, there are no allegations of intentional or sexual activity on the part of the Charlesgate defendants set forth in the complaint. Accordingly, in reviewing the complaint alongside the JUA policy, we focus our attention on the factual allegations of negligence with regard to each of the respective Charlesgate defendants. Under well-settled Rhode Island law, “[w]e confine our analysis to the four corners of the policy, viewing it ‘in its entirety, affording its terms their plain, ordinary and usual meaning.’” Allstate Insurance Co. v. Ahlquist, 59 A.3d 95, 98 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Casco Indemnity Co. v. Gonsalves, 839 A.2d 546, 548 (R.I. 2004)). We begin our analysis by examining the contractual language of the policy.', 'The CGL coverage is afforded to the Charlesgate defendants under an endorsement to the JUA policy. The cornerstone of the CGL policy is the term “occurrence.” 10 The policy offers coverage to Charlesgate only for the risks of “bodily injury” or “property damage” that are caused by an “occurrence.” The terms of this coverage are set forth in the policy as follows:', '“SECTION I – COVERAGES', '“COVERAGE A – BODILY INJURY AND PROPERTY', 'DAMAGE LIABILITY', '“1. Insuring Agreement 10', 'Black’s Law Dictionary defines “occurrence-based liability insurance,” such as the CGL coverage in the JUA policy, as “[i]nsurance that covers bodily injuries or property damage suffered during the policy period. Each instance of injury or damage is an ‘occurrence’ that may trigger an insured’s entitlement to benefits. The terms of occurrence-based liability insurance policies are usu[ally] broad, limited only by specific exclusion.” Black’s Law Dictionary 924 (10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added).', '-9-', '“a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes', 'legally obligated to pay as damages because of ‘bodily', 'injury’ or ‘property damage’ to which this insurance', 'applies.', '“* * *', '“b. This insurance applies to ‘bodily injury’ and ‘property', 'damage’ only if:', '“(1) The ‘bodily injury’ or ‘property damage’ is caused by', 'an ‘occurrence’ that takes place in the ‘coverage', 'territory’[.]” The “Definitions” section of the policy defines “bodily injury” as “bodily injury, sickness or disease sustained by a person, including death resulting from any of these at any time.” It also defines “occurrence” to mean “an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.”', 'The issue of whether the JUA owes the Charlesgate defendants a duty to defend them in the estate’s underlying suit hinges on whether the facts alleged in the estate’s complaint constitute an “occurrence” to which CGL coverage potentially applies.', 'By defining an “occurrence” as an “accident,” the policy’s definition offers little guidance on this inquiry because the word “accident” is not defined in the policy. Black’s Law Dictionary defines “occurrence” as “[s]omething that happens or takes place; specif[ically], an accident, event, or continuing condition that results in personal injury or property damage that is neither expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured party. This specific sense is the standard definition of the term under most liability policies.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1248 (10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added). The legal term “accident” is also defined in Black’s Law Dictionary, as “[a]n unintended and unforeseen injurious occurrence; something that does not occur in the usual course of events or that could not be reasonably anticipated; any unwanted or harmful event', '- 10 - occurring suddenly, as a collision, spill, fall, or the like, irrespective of cause or blame * * *.” Black’s Law Dictionary at 18.', 'The plain and ordinary meaning of the term “accident” as “an unintended and unforeseen injurious occurrence” invites the threshold question of from whose perspective is the unforeseen occurrence to be assessed. The Charlesgate defendants argue that an “accident” must be defined from the viewpoint of the insured.', 'The hearing justice was also persuaded that the term “accident” should be interpreted from “the perspective of the insureds.” Rhode Island law dictates that “[t]he test to be applied is not what the insurer intended * * *, but what the ordinary reader and purchaser would have understood [the language] to mean.” Ahlquist, 59 A.3d at 98 (quoting Pressman v. Aetna Casualty and Surety Co., 574 A.2d 757, 760 (R.I. 1990)). Moreover, the Black’s Law Dictionary definition of “occurrence” similarly provides that this term is often defined or interpreted from the standpoint of the insured party in the context of insurance policies.', 'Here, Charlesgate purchased an insurance policy from the JUA to secure CGL coverage against certain risks delineated under the terms of its policy. From the viewpoint of Charlesgate, the sequence of events that allegedly took place in June 2009 appears to be both unexpected and unforeseen. It was surely not the usual course of events when an employee, whom Charlesgate hired, supervised, and trained, was later alleged to have sexually assaulted one of its patients.', 'The JUA principally focuses on the intentional character of the alleged sexual assault to substantiate its position that the factual allegations set forth in the estate’s complaint do not constitute an “accident.” In support of this position, the JUA relies chiefly on three Rhode Island cases in which there was alleged intentional sexual misconduct and, ultimately, no duty to defend', '- 11 - on the part of the insurer. We observe that the factual allegations and policy language at issue in the instant matter distinguish it from these cases.', 'Moreover, in our opinion, two of the three cases, Craven v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 693 A.2d 1022 (R.I. 1997) (mem.) and Sanzi v. Shetty, 864 A.2d 614 (R.I. 2005), are inapposite. In Craven, 693 A.2d at 1022, the named insured in a homeowner’s policy sought a declaratory judgment that his insurer was required to defend him against claims of sexual assault and negligent infliction of emotional distress. This Court, however, determined that the insurer had no duty to defend because allegations of intentional sexual misconduct did not fall within the risks covered by the insured’s policy. Id. at 1023. Similarly, in Sanzi, 864 A.2d at 615-16, a pediatric neurologist and named insured sought a declaration that his insurer had a duty to defend him against claims by a former patient of alleged intentional sexual assault. This Court held that the insurer had no obligation to defend the doctor because the allegations of intentional sexual abuse did not fall within the “professional services” coverage of the doctor’s professional liability policy. Id. at 619-20. Both of these cases present factual scenarios with a notable distinction from the present matter in that it was the individual insureds who personally faced allegations of intentional sexual misconduct. Ultimately, it was the intentional character of the insureds’ actions that fell outside the covered risks in those respective policies. On the contrary, the Charlesgate defendants are not facing any allegations of intentional sexual misconduct, but rather only alleged negligence with regard to supervising, hiring, and training an employee, among other claims.', 'The JUA also relies on American Commerce Insurance Co. v. Porto, 811 A.2d 1185 (R.I. 2002), in support of its argument that the allegations of negligence—negligent hiring, training, and supervision, among others—in the complaint against the Charlesgate defendants do not', '- 12 - constitute an “accident” and therefore not an “occurrence” under the policy. The facts in Porto bear a striking resemblance to those in the present case in that the insured, Sebastian M. Porto, a Boy Scouts of America (BSA) troop leader, held a supervisory position over another troop leader who allegedly sexually assaulted a minor troop member. Porto, 811 A.2d at 1188-89. In that case, the minor victim and his parents advanced allegations in their complaint against Porto and the BSA for negligent hiring and supervision, separate and apart from their allegations of intentional sexual assault against the troop leader. Id.', 'Notwithstanding these factual similarities, the policy language at issue in Porto is quite different from the term at issue in the present case. The analysis in Porto centered on the “arising out of” policy language that delineated those bodily injuries covered and those excluded under the policy. Porto, 811 A.2d at 1197. This Court in Porto interpreted the “arising out of” language of a policy exclusion broadly and concluded that all of the allegations in the family’s complaint have “a causal connection with, and thus arise out of” the troop leader’s sexual misconduct. Id. Accordingly, in Porto, we affirmed summary judgment in favor of the insurer, concluding that it owed no duty to defend its insured. Id. at 1201-02.', 'At the summary-judgment hearing in the present case, the hearing justice declared the Porto case as “significant in the analysis of this matter” but nevertheless proceeded to distinguish the present matter from the result we reached in that case. In doing so, he reasoned that:', '“in Porto the Supreme Court said that one of the distinguishing', 'factors [in that case] was that there were no discrete injuries', 'alleged in the family’s complaint that ar[o]se solely out of Porto’s', 'alleged negligence.', '“That’s simply not the case here. The allegations in th[is]', 'case are not only creative, but there are factual allegations that are', 'made in the complaint by the plaintiffs that Charlesgate and its', 'employees acted in a particular way or failed to act in a particular', 'way that added to the injuries caused by the CNA who committed', '- 13 -', 'the sexual act. So it may be that Charlesgate is not responsible for', 'damages as great as the CNA, but there’s certainly a decision to be', 'made there.”', 'We agree with the hearing justice in this regard. 11 Furthermore, we emphasize that, in Porto, this Court examined the language of a policy exclusion specifically related to sexual molestation. Porto, 811 A.2d at 1197. In contrast, here we are confronted with the core policy coverage terms “accident” and “occurrence.” Therefore, we need not evaluate the estate’s claims of negligent hiring and supervision in the context of a policy exclusion for sexual molestation. Moreover, the JUA has made it clear that, although the policy includes sexual and criminal act exclusions, it is not arguing on appeal that either of these exclusions in the CGL policy applies. On balance, we find that the JUA’s resolute reliance on our Porto analysis in the context of a policy exclusion is misplaced. As such, this case presents us with a novel inquiry distinct from this Rhode Island precedent.', 'The hearing justice declined to adopt the JUA’s narrow reading of “occurrence” within the policy, which he dismissed as “somewhat restrictive.” Conversely, the hearing justice was persuaded that the term “accident” should not only be interpreted from the perspective of the insured party, but also that it should be interpreted more broadly than the JUA suggests. We agree. This Court does not consider the subjective intent of the parties, but rather “the intent expressed by the language of the contract.” Derderian, 44 A.3d at 128 (quoting Bliss Mine Road Condominium Association, 11 A.3d at 1083-84). In accordance with this principle, we consider 11', 'In discussing complaints drafted with both intentional and negligent allegations, we are mindful of the potential for “creative” pleadings without an appropriate factual predicate. We pause to note our concern with opening the door to such a disfavored practice. This Court echoes the point made by the hearing justice that the factual allegations set forth in the estate’s complaint are more than merely “creative.” In the instant matter, the complaint includes not only allegations of negligence with regard to the Charlesgate defendants, but also facts alleged in support of those negligence claims.', '- 14 - the term “accident” in the context of the policy as a whole. See id. In essence, the various arguments asserted by the JUA contend that, because of the intentional nature of the alleged sexual assault by a Charlesgate employee, there was no “accident” and therefore no “occurrence” under the policy. We are of the opinion that those arguments ignore other provisions—the sexual act and intended-injury exclusions 12—in the policy.', 'If we adopted the JUA’s narrow reading of “accident,” then that reading would obviate the need for some exclusions included in the policy.', 'The intended-injury and sexual act exclusions would serve no purpose if all intended injuries and injuries arising out of sexual acts were excluded in the first instance by the terms of the policy itself. See King v. Dallas Fire Insurance Co., 85 S.W.3d 185, 186, 192-93 (Tex. 2002). The JUA is effectively advocating for this result by claiming that the factual allegations of negligence in the estate’s complaint do not constitute an “accident.” This interpretation of the policy language would render both exclusions mere surplusage. We decline to endorse such a reading of the term “accident” within the context of the JUA policy.', 'We are satisfied that the JUA has a duty to defend the Charlesgate defendants against the allegations of negligence set forth in the complaint. This Court has articulated a clear mandate 12', 'The pertinent provisions in the JUA policy provide that:', '“2. Exclusions', '“This insurance does not apply to:', '“a. Expected Or Intended Injury', '“‘Bodily Injury’ or ‘property damage’ expected or intended from', 'the standpoint of the Insured.

Sexual Acts', '“‘Bodily Injury’ arising out of sexual activity, sexual misconduct,', 'sexual abuse or sexual harassment by the Insured or any person for', 'whom the Insured is legally responsible.”', '- 15 - that “any doubts as to the adequacy of the pleadings to encompass an occurrence within the coverage of the policy are resolved against the insurer and in favor of its insured.” Beals, 103 R.I. at 632, 240 A.2d at 403. Furthermore, the “pleadings test” establishes an unequivocal duty to defend on the part of the JUA when the complaint in the underlying action contains factual allegations that bring the case “within or potentially within the risk coverage of the policy.” Id. Accordingly, we affirm both the hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the Charlesgate defendants and the denial of the JUA’s motion for summary judgment with regard to the declaratory-judgment count of the Charlesgate defendants’ counterclaim.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

This case stems from the all-to-common scenario of an escalated billing dispute between property owners and a subcontractor hired to help construct a house.', 'Brian and Karen McMahon (defendants) engaged various construction companies to contribute to the project of building a house and barn on their Block Island property. The plaintiff, South County Post & Beam, Inc., is one of the subcontractors which worked on the project. The plaintiff filed a civil suit for breach of contract, book account, and unjust enrichment, seeking payment for the work it had completed but for which it had not been paid. After a bench trial, a Superior Court justice entered judgment for the plaintiff on its claim of unjust enrichment, but judgment for the defendants on the plaintiff’s claims of breach of contract and book account. The trial justice also entered an order granting the plaintiff’s posttrial “Application for Taxation of Costs” for the entire amount requested, including fees for the expert witness who testified on the plaintiff’s behalf. The defendants appealed from both the judgment and the order, and we consolidated the appeals.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', '-1- After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment, but vacate and remand the order.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2010, defendants bought approximately eleven acres of forested property on Block Island with the intention of building a house. They hired an architect who helped them select S. Heinz Construction & Design, Inc. (Heinz Construction) as the general contractor. During the process of designing the 2,500-square-foot house, defendant Brian McMahon testified that he and his wife decided to also build a barn as an “overflow room” for their three young-adult sons. At Heinz Construction’s recommendation, defendants agreed that plaintiff, a company that specialized in timber frame design, fabrication, and installation, would be engaged to build the roof for the house, as well as to design and build the timber frame of the barn. In July 2010, Heinz Construction and plaintiff signed work orders describing the scope of the work that plaintiff was to perform on the house and barn. Over the next three months, Heinz Construction and plaintiff executed five change orders relating to the scope of the work for the barn. During this time, plaintiff also performed work outside the scope of the initial work order for the roof of the house—viz., the construction of a tower and deck on the roof of the house—but this additional work was not memorialized in a change order. Throughout its work on the house and barn, plaintiff addressed all of its invoices and statements to Heinz Construction.', 'Heinz Construction sent two payments to plaintiff, and, at Heinz Construction’s request, defendants sent one payment directly to plaintiff. Between October and December 2010, plaintiff, defendant', '-2- Brian McMahon, and Heinz Construction exchanged several emails regarding the outstanding balances claimed by plaintiff.', 'In May 2011, plaintiff initiated a civil action against defendants, seeking damages for breach of contract (count 1), book account (count 2), and unjust enrichment (count 3). The defendants counterclaimed for breach of the duty to perform in a good and workmanlike manner and breach of contract. In October 2013, a two-day bench trial was held before a justice of the Superior Court. 1 Before trial, the parties filed an agreed statement of facts, which included the parties’ agreement that plaintiff’s total unpaid invoices equaled $41,549.45. During the trial, plaintiff presented testimony from two fact witnesses, Kenneth Bouvier (plaintiff’s founder and president) and Dennis Scott Heinz (Heinz Construction’s principal), and one expert witness, Robert L. Brungraber, Ph.D., a civil engineer in the field of heavy timber structures. Brian McMahon testified on behalf of defendants.', 'Kenneth Bouvier testified that plaintiff became involved in the construction of the roof tower and deck on the house—work beyond the scope of the executed work orders—through conversations with Heinz. Bouvier also testified that a change order was not created for the roof tower work because, “based on a good relationship with [Heinz], and the fact that these were areas that we were going to support him on, we just went forward, basically, on a time-and- material basis.” In October 2010, plaintiff delivered an invoice to Heinz Construction that detailed the work plaintiff performed to advance the construction of the roof tower and deck.', 'Bouvier further testified that, after receiving two payments for plaintiff’s work from Heinz Construction, he was told by Heinz that he “would be getting paid directly from 1', 'The only counts that went to trial were breach of contract (count 1) and unjust enrichment (count 3). Prior to trial, plaintiff withdrew the book account claim (count 2), and defendants dismissed their two counterclaims.', '-3- [defendants].” Bouvier recalled receiving only one payment directly from defendants. Bouvier testified that he had received compliments from McMahon on plaintiff’s work, and that he did not recall receiving any criticism about plaintiff’s work prior to the billing dispute. Bouvier also testified that plaintiff had future work with Heinz Construction scheduled and that some projects were in the proposal stage.', 'Dennis Scott Heinz, Heinz Construction’s principal, testified that he had sought defendants’ review of the work orders and change orders throughout the construction project by forwarding the documents which he had received from Bouvier by email to McMahon and then securing McMahon’s approval by email. In the agreed statement of facts, the parties stated that plaintiff had received only two payments from Heinz Construction for the work it had performed on defendants’ property: $20,000 paid on July 29, 2010, and $24,012.50 paid on August 28, 2010. Heinz testified that he was not aware of any other payments from Heinz Construction to plaintiff for the work which plaintiff performed on defendants’ house and barn. Heinz also testified that he had asked McMahon to pay plaintiff directly one time because “the scope of work changed, and they added the barn, and I was financing a lot of it myself, so I couldn’t afford to pay everything out of my pocket.” Heinz recalled that defendants had timely paid many invoices that he had submitted to them on behalf of Heinz Construction. Heinz also testified that Heinz Construction did not make any profit from the work plaintiff performed on defendants’ property because he had not added any markups to plaintiff’s work before billing defendants, so that it made no difference to Heinz Construction whether defendants paid plaintiff directly or whether defendants paid Heinz Construction, which then paid plaintiff.', 'Robert L. Brungraber, plaintiff’s expert witness, testified that he operated a company that provided structural engineering consultations, design, and analysis on traditional heavy timber', '-4- structures.', 'In preparation for his testimony in this case, Brungraber testified that he had reviewed various engineering drawings created by plaintiff as well as various work orders, change orders, purchase orders, and invoices. Brungraber repeatedly opined that the amounts plaintiff charged for each component it had designed and constructed were “very reasonable”; and, while sometimes at the low end of the reasonable price range for each component, they were always within the range that he would have charged in the twenty years that he had worked for a company that engaged in work similar to plaintiff’s work.', 'Brian McMahon testified that Heinz’s request in September 2010 that defendants make a $60,100 payment directly to plaintiff was the only time that Heinz had made this request, as well as the only time that McMahon had paid plaintiff directly. McMahon also testified that he had thought that Heinz Construction would be responsible for all of plaintiff’s charges from that point forward.', 'McMahon further testified that he had made payments directly to other subcontractors when Heinz had requested that of him, that he had not paid any of the other subcontractors in full for the entire scope of their work, and that none of the other subcontractors had approached him for payment on the final invoices prior to the termination of his business relationship with Heinz Construction.', 'McMahon also testified that, a few weeks after the $60,100 payment, Bouvier communicated by email that he was “completing the accounting for your project and [would] forward details to [you] by the end of the week.” McMahon replied: “[a]s to accounting didn’t we agree pricing [sic] already for the project both the barn and the house[.] What would the accounting be?”', 'McMahon testified that he subsequently received the “accounting” from plaintiff—which reflected over $30,000 as the balance owed—was “shocked,” and had spoken with Heinz about it. McMahon also acknowledged that, after this email exchange, he had sent', '-5- Bouvier an email that stated: “Saw how you did the tower – looks great and clever bracket as well! [Heinz] just sent me some barn pics – looks really great. Thanks for the craftsmanship.” McMahon also testified that he received a direct request from Bouvier for final payment on November 22, 2010, and that this request had prompted an “e-mail conversation” in which McMahon asked Bouvier specific billing questions.', 'The trial justice rendered her decision from the bench the day after the trial concluded. She found that each of the four witnesses were, “to a large extent,” credible. She specifically adopted each of the paragraphs in the agreed statement of facts as a finding of fact. With respect to plaintiff’s claim for breach of contract, the trial justice entered judgment for defendants because she found that the evidence did not support the existence of a contract between the parties—either express or implied-in-fact.', 'With respect to plaintiff’s claim for unjust enrichment, the trial justice found that plaintiff had established that it conferred a benefit on defendants valued at $41,549.45, that defendants had appreciated the benefit of plaintiff’s work, and that it would be unjust for defendants to “retain the benefit without paying the value thereof.” Accordingly, the trial justice entered judgment for plaintiff and awarded $41,549.45 plus costs. Final judgment entered on October 15, 2013, and defendants timely appealed.', 'The plaintiff subsequently filed an “Application For Taxation of Costs” that included the filing fee, the costs of four deposition transcripts, the service of one subpoena, and the fee for expert witness Brungraber. The defendants objected to including Brungraber’s fee, but the trial justice granted plaintiff’s application in its entirety, finding that all of the costs listed were “fair and reasonable and necessary in this particular case * * *.” The defendants timely appealed, and this Court consolidated the appeal from the order granting plaintiff’s application for costs with', '-6- the appeal from the judgment entered against defendants on plaintiff’s claim of unjust enrichment.', 'II', 'Judgment Awarding Damages for Unjust Enrichment', 'A', 'Standard of Review', 'When a trial justice presides over a nonjury trial, Rule 52(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure requires that he or she “find the facts specially and state separately [his or her] conclusions of law thereon.” “The trial justice, however, ‘need not engage in extensive analysis to comply with this requirement.’” JPL Livery Services, Inc. v.

See Fondedile, S.A. v. C.E. Maguire, Inc., 610 A.2d 87, 97 (R.I. 1992); R & B Electric Co. v. Amco Construction Co., 471 A.2d 1351, 1355-56 (R.I. 1984); Bailey v. West, 105 R.I. 61, 67, 249 A.2d 414, 417 (1969). Therefore, to recover on a claim for quantum meruit, a plaintiff must prove the same three elements as in a claim for unjust enrichment. See Dellagrotta, 873 A.2d at 113. While plaintiff in this case styled', '-9- its cause of action as one for unjust enrichment, we undertake this brief discussion of the distinction between quantum meruit and unjust enrichment to point out that plaintiff is actually seeking to recover the value of the services rendered for which defendants have thus far declined to pay, i.e., to recover in quantum meruit. See Process Engineers & Constructors, Inc., 93 A.3d at 1052. The issue here is whether defendants would be unjustly enriched if they did not have to compensate plaintiff for the value of the services rendered, and not whether it would actually be proper for defendants to retain the benefit of plaintiff’s work on their new house and barn.', 'The defendants’ appeal from the judgment entered against them does not challenge the trial justice’s findings and conclusions with respect to the first two elements of plaintiff’s claim, i.e., that defendants had appreciated the work that plaintiff performed in constructing portions of the house and barn. The defendants raise issues only with respect to the trial justice’s conclusion on the third element that it “would be unjust for the [d]efendant to retain the benefit conferred by the [p]laintiff without paying the value thereof,” arguing both that the trial justice failed to make any findings of fact specific to this third element and that plaintiff failed to prove defendants’ enrichment was unjust. The plaintiff counters simply that the trial justice “correctly recited, and found, the three elements that a Rhode Island plaintiff must prove to recover on a claim of unjust enrichment.”', 'We can easily dispense with defendants’ argument that the trial justice did not make any factual findings that demonstrated defendants’ enrichment from plaintiff’s work was unjust. The trial justice rendered a comprehensive decision from the bench, in which she specifically acknowledged the requirements set out in Rule 52(a), recited plaintiff’s burden of proof and the elements of each claim, listed the evidence on which she based her decision, made findings with respect to the credibility of the witnesses, made conclusions with respect to each element, and', '- 10 - specifically referred to the facts that supported her conclusion on each element. Specific to the third element, the trial justice recounted ample evidence to support her finding that it would be inequitable for defendants to retain the work plaintiff performed without paying the undisputed value thereof—including the timing and content of the emails exchanged between the parties and McMahon’s testimony that he was aware that plaintiff continued to perform work on the property even as the parties were discussing account and billing questions in email correspondence.', 'We have previously acknowledged that “[s]imply conferring a benefit upon a landowner by a subcontractor is not sufficient to establish a claim for unjust enrichment.” Emond Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 105 A.3d at 90 (quoting R & B Electric Co., 471 A.2d at 1356). “[T]he third prong of the analysis is the most important.” Id. “[T]he court must look at the equities of each case and decide whether it would be unjust for a party to retain the benefit conferred upon it without paying the value of such benefit.” R & B Electric Co., 471 A.2d at 1356. “Determining what constitutes a just or unjust result requires a trial justice to examine the facts of the particular case and balance the equities.” Emond Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 105 A.3d at 90 (quoting Dellagrotta, 873 A.2d at 115).', 'In the case under review, there are facts that weigh on both sides of the equity balance. The existence of a contract between plaintiff and Heinz Construction is a factor that weighs against plaintiff recovering the value of its work from defendants. It appears to this Court that the only reason plaintiff has not attempted to collect the outstanding balance for its work on defendants’ property under its contract with Heinz Construction is the undisputed fact that', '- 11 - plaintiff wants to maintain a good business relationship with Heinz Construction. 2 On the other side of the equity scale is the undisputed fact that, upon request by Heinz Construction, defendant made a direct payment to plaintiff in the amount of $60,100, one of only three payments received by plaintiff before commencing this civil action. In addition, the trial justice referenced the exchange of emails between McMahon and Bouvier, as well as McMahon’s testimony that he was aware that such work was ongoing at the time of these communications. We are persuaded, therefore, that competent evidence exists in the record to support the trial justice’s conclusion that “it would be unjust for [defendants] to retain the benefit conferred by [plaintiff] without paying the value thereof.”', 'The defendants also argue that the trial justice erred as a matter of law when she ruled that plaintiff did not have to prove that it lacked an adequate remedy at law before finding that defendants were unjustly enriched. The defendants assert that plaintiff’s adequate remedy at law was a cause of action against Heinz Construction, with whom it had established express contracts for its work—a remedy that plaintiff has not made any attempt to pursue. The defendants also remind us that the parties agree that Heinz Construction remains an active, going concern; there is no evidence that Heinz Construction has either gone out of business or lacks the resources to pay its subcontractors. The plaintiff counterargues that the trial justice was correct to reject this argument because Rhode Island recognizes unjust enrichment as a distinct cause of action for which money damages may be awarded to eliminate an unjust imbalance created by the conferral of a benefit to one party without compensation to the conferring party. 2', 'We note that, in response to one of this Court’s questions at oral argument, plaintiff’s counsel stated that plaintiff had made a strategic decision not to include Heinz Construction as a defendant in its civil action because it wanted to continue working with Heinz Construction in the future.', '- 12 -', '“It is well established that ‘[r]ecovery for unjust enrichment is predicated upon the equitable principle that one shall not be permitted to enrich himself at the expense of another by receiving property or benefits without making compensation for them.’” Emond Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 105 A.3d at 90 (quoting Narragansett Electric Co. v. Carbone, 898 A.2d 87, 99 (R.I. 2006)); see also Multi-State Restoration, Inc., 61 A.3d at 418 (acknowledging plaintiffs’ claims for quasi-contract and unjust enrichment as “equitable claims”); United Lending Corp. v. City of Providence, 827 A.2d 626, 632 (R.I. 2003) (“[i]t is true that claims for unjust enrichment sound in equity”). This Court has also held, however, that unjust enrichment “can stand alone as a cause of action in its own right.” Dellagrotta, 873 A.2d at 113. Accordingly, as unjust enrichment and quantum meruit are treated as standalone causes of action, the presence or absence of an adequate remedy at law is simply one of the factors considered in the third element’s balancing of the equities and is not determinative of whether plaintiff can or will prevail as a matter of law. 3', 'In her decision, the trial justice rejected defendants’ argument that plaintiff was required to prove the absence of an adequate remedy at law, stating:', '“In the absence of privity between the parties, a party is', 'permitted to seek equity through this quasi-contractual theory of 3', 'According to the Restatement (Third) Restitution and Unjust Enrichment § 4(2) at 27 (2011), “[a] claimant otherwise entitled to a remedy for unjust enrichment, including a remedy originating in equity, need not demonstrate the inadequacy of available remedies at law.” The comment to this Restatement section provides:', '“there is no requirement that a claimant who seeks any of the', 'remedies described in this Restatement must first demonstrate the', 'inadequacy of a remedy at law.

It is the request for some form of equitable relief that', 'warrants consideration of whether there’s an adequate remedy at', 'law, not simply whether the cause of action itself seeking money', 'damages is founded upon equitable principles.” We agree with the trial justice. That a civil action for unjust enrichment is predicated upon an equitable principle does not convert this standalone cause of action into one for which only equitable remedies may apply.', 'The plaintiff sought, and was awarded, a legal remedy permissible under Rhode Island law, i.e., monetary compensation for the value of the services it had rendered to defendants. The three elements for unjust enrichment and quantum meruit are well settled in our jurisprudence and do not include a requirement that the proponent of the claim prove that it lacks an adequate remedy at law.', 'Finally, defendants urge us to consider the potential public policy ramifications of affirming the trial justice’s decision, arguing that “permitting the subcontractor to recover against the homeowner under this circumstance would render every property owner a de facto party to subcontracts executed by the general – the general and sub could substitute the homeowner as the obligor at their whim, at any time, without notice.” We are mindful of these policy concerns, but we emphasize that proving a claim for restitution sounding in either quantum meruit or unjust enrichment involves a fact-specific balancing process in order to determine whether it would be unjust for the benefit recipient to retain either the benefit or the value of the benefit without making compensation therefor. See Emond Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 105 A.3d at 90; R & B Electric Co., 471 A.2d at 1356. Here, most of the facts were undisputed at trial, defendants had already paid plaintiff directly one time, and there was much direct communication between plaintiff and defendants regarding the billing statements and defendants’ questions about these statements. As we stated above, the trial justice was not', '- 14 - incorrect as a matter of law in her analysis and conclusion that the third element of plaintiff’s claim was met. The judgment in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $41,549.45 is, therefore, affirmed.', 'III', 'Taxable Costs', 'On defendants’ appeal from the order awarding costs to plaintiff, they argue that the trial justice erred as a matter of law when she ruled that Brungraber’s fee could be taxed as a cost of the cause of action. The defendants contend that the expert’s fee was precluded as a recoverable cost by G.L. 1956 § 9-17-22. The defendants further contend that § 9-17-22, which specifically prohibits expert fees as a part of costs, should have been given precedence over G.L. 1956 § 9- 22-18, which deals with the taxation of costs generally. The plaintiff counters that its application for costs was based on §§ 9-22-5 and 9-22-18 and that, pursuant to these statutes, the trial justice simply exercised her discretion in allowing Brungraber’s fee as a recoverable cost.', 'A', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews questions of statutory construction and interpretation de novo.” National Refrigeration, Inc. v.

Kottis, 612 A.2d at 669. While we affirmed the judgment, we specifically noted that the award of any amount that encompassed the expert witnesses’ fees would have been improper. Id. This dictum is consistent with § 43-3-26 because it gives precedence to § 9-17-22, which specifically prohibits recovering the fee of an expert as a cost (except as provided in the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence), over § 9-22-18, which provides general parameters for when a trial justice must “strike out and disallow” a cost to be taxed relating to the expense of witnesses. 6', 'In the case before us, there is no doubt that the trial justice granted the plaintiff’s application for costs for the full $2,535.80 requested, and that the order awarding costs explicitly included $1,365.20 for Brungraber’s fee.

10,State : v. : Justin Prout.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Justin Prout, appeals from a judgment declaring him to be in violation of the terms of his probation and sentencing him to serve thirteen years of a previously imposed suspended sentence. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On February 10, 2006, a Superior Court jury found defendant guilty of breaking and entering, assault with a dangerous weapon, and simple assault. 1 On April 28, 2006, defendant was sentenced to ten years to serve on count 1 for breaking and entering; two years to serve and thirteen years suspended, with probation, on count 2 for felony assault, to run concurrently with the sentence for count 1; and one year to serve on count 3 for simple assault, to run concurrently 1', 'These convictions were affirmed on appeal. State v. Prout, 996 A.2d 641, 643 (R.I. 2010).', '-1- with the sentences for counts 1 and 2. On June 19, 2012, while defendant was incarcerated at the High Security Center of the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), in an area known as the “E Module,” an altercation occurred between defendant and a correctional officer, Christian Torres, which resulted in significant injuries to Officer Torres. As a result of this altercation, the state initiated probation-violation proceedings seeking to invoke the suspended portion of defendant’s sentence for felony assault. A hearing was conducted in the Superior Court on February 20 and 21, 2013. The following facts are adduced from the testimonies of three correctional officers as well as from the testimony of defendant, whose recollection of the altercation that occurred on June 19, 2012 differs significantly from the version put forth by the officers.', 'The first witness to testify at the hearing was Adam Klaus, a correctional officer who observed the altercation involving defendant on June 19, 2012. On that day Officer Klaus had been assigned to the control center of the E Module unit. This unit contains twelve single- occupancy cells; defendant was being housed at that time in cell number eleven. Officer Klaus testified that, from his post at the control center, he could see all twelve cells, as well as the shower area and the inmates’ cosmetics lockers. Officer Klaus explained that, when inmates in the E Module are retrieved from their cells, they normally are handcuffed with their hands behind their backs; in certain circumstances, however, such as when they are being taken to the showers, the inmates are handcuffed with their hands in front of their bodies. According to Officer Klaus, inmates are handcuffed in the front when taken to the showers because they may need to use their hands to retrieve items from their cosmetics lockers.', 'Officer Klaus testified that, each morning in the E Module, inmates are fed breakfast in their cells at 7:05 a.m. and then they are taken either for recreation time or to the showers,', '-2- depending on the day. On June 19, 2012, the inmates were scheduled to take showers. From his position in the control center that morning, Officer Klaus saw Officer Torres approach defendant’s cell to take him to the shower. Officer Klaus observed Officer Torres open a “trap” in the cell door; the trap is a small hole used for passing food and for accessing the inmate’s hands to be cuffed before opening the door. According to Officer Klaus, Officer Torres cuffed defendant’s hands together in front of his body, through the trap in the cell door. Officer Torres then signaled to Officer Klaus, who controlled the doors in the unit from his post in the control center, to open the door to defendant’s cell. Officer Klaus opened the door, and then he observed that defendant asked Officer Torres if he could retrieve something from his cosmetics locker. 2 Officer Klaus then witnessed Officer Torres bend down to unlock defendant’s locker, at which time defendant raised his cuffed hands above his head “and struck Officer Torres in the back of the head, knocking him to the ground.” Officer Klaus further testified that defendant “kept kicking, punching. He put his hands around [Officer Torres’s] neck, tried to choke him.”', 'When Officer Klaus saw defendant strike Officer Torres in the back of the head, he radioed a “Code Blue,” which is the code used when there is a fight and an officer needs assistance. It took approximately twelve to fifteen seconds for additional officers to arrive, during which time Officer Klaus saw defendant “striking Officer Torres in the head, in the face, kicking him, trying to choke him.” Three officers initially responded and tackled defendant, who was on top of Officer Torres. Ultimately, eight officers, as well as a lieutenant and a captain, responded to the scene and were able to gain control of defendant. The defendant was then taken 2', 'During direct examination, Officer Klaus testified that defendant had “asked Officer Torres if he could retrieve cosmetics from his cosmetics locker * * *.” On cross-examination, however, Officer Klaus explained that he did not actually hear defendant make this request; from his position inside the control center, Officer Klaus saw defendant point to the locker, “saw [defendant’s] mouth move” and “could hear mumbling,” but was not able to “catch every word.”', '-3- to the “dispensary” to be evaluated by medical staff. Other officers helped Officer Torres up from the floor, escorted him to the bathroom in the control center, and then took him to the dispensary as well.', 'The second witness to testify at the hearing was Edward Sousa, a correctional officer who responded to Officer Klaus’s radio call for assistance on the morning of June 19, 2012. Upon arriving at the E Module, Officer Sousa witnessed defendant “being wrestled away from Officer Torres.” Officer Sousa explained that Officer Torres was lying “limp” on the ground, apparently unconscious, and that defendant “had a grasp” of Officer Torres’s pants.', 'Officer Sousa corroborated Officer Klaus’s testimony that defendant’s hands were cuffed in front of his body during the fight, and he further testified that he did not see defendant handcuffed in the back at any point during that day.', 'After responding to the radio call for assistance, Officer Sousa helped gain control of defendant and then escorted him to the dispensary. Although Officer Sousa was not sure whether defendant had been injured, he recalled that “[i]t looked like he had some blood on his lips.” Upon arriving at the dispensary, a nurse asked defendant what had brought him to the dispensary. Officer Sousa testified that “[t]he first half of [defendant’s response] was inaudible and the second part of it was out of line so I grabbed him and slammed him.” Officer Sousa identified a photograph of defendant, taken while he was at the dispensary, which showed his hands cuffed in front of his body. Officer Sousa also testified that, although the general policy of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) is for inmates to be handcuffed in the back, there are certain circumstances in which, for practical reasons, inmates are cuffed in the front.', '-4-', 'After defendant was evaluated by the nurse, he was placed in a cell in the rear of the medical area. Officer Sousa returned to the E Module, where he helped take Officer Torres to the bathroom and then to the dispensary. Officer Torres was briefly evaluated by a nurse at the dispensary, and then, pursuant to the orders of the shift supervisor, Officer Sousa took Officer Torres to the Garden City Treatment Center for further medical care.', 'Officer Torres was the third correctional officer to testify at the hearing. He testified that he was assigned to the E Module on June 19, 2012; however, his memory of that day was extremely limited. He recalled being present at roll call at the beginning of his shift, and then he had a vague memory of being taken to the treatment center. He had no recollection of the altercation with defendant. Officer Torres testified that, as a result of this altercation, he was treated for a concussion, a back injury, and a knee injury. At the time of the hearing, he was still being treated for the knee injury; and, as a result, he had not been back to work at the High Security Center since the date of the incident. Officer Sousa, who had worked with Officer Torres for approximately ten years, testified that Officer Torres was a “nonchalant officer” who “[went] by the book” and did not have an aggressive demeanor.', 'Three exhibits introduced at the hearing provided RIDOC’s policies regarding the handcuffing of inmates behind, rather than in front of, their bodies.', 'First, a “Policy and Procedure” document was introduced into evidence, which provided “procedures for controlling and supervising inmates who are classified to ‘C’ category.” 3', 'Under a subheading titled “Handcuffs,” this document provided: “‘C’ category inmates are cuffed behind their backs, palms facing out prior to their cell doors’ being opened.” Next, another “Policy and Procedure” 3', 'According to Officer Klaus, defendant was classified at the time of the altercation as a “C” category inmate, which was “the lowest grade an inmate can have” and meant that he had to be handcuffed whenever he was outside of his cell.', '-5- document was introduced into evidence, which set forth “specific guidelines for the use of restraining devices by Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) employees.” This document', 'provided,', 'under', 'a', 'heading', 'titled', '“Handcuffs”:', '“Whenever', 'possible, inmates / offenders should be cuffed in back.”', 'Finally, a “High Security Center Inmate Handbook” provided: “All segregation unit inmates will be cuffed behind their back prior to the opening of cell door. When departing the segregation unit inmates will be cuffed behind their back, shackled and escorted by a minimum of one officer.', 'No exception other than a documented medical order.”', 'Despite these guidelines suggesting that inmates should generally be handcuffed in the back, Officer Klaus testified that it was standard operating procedure for inmates to be handcuffed in the front when they were being taken to the showers. He explained that inmates were handcuffed in front so that they could use their hands to retrieve their cosmetics and towels, which they were not permitted to keep inside their cells. Officer Klaus explained that the guidelines were not absolute and required correctional officers to “use a little common sense.” When asked whether officers would ever switch the handcuffs from back to front outside a secure cell, Officer Klaus explained that this was not done, because it would make the officer vulnerable to attack by the uncuffed inmate.', 'Officer Torres also testified that, in his twelve years as a correctional officer, he had brought inmates to showers “[t]housands of times,” and he had always handcuffed the inmates in the front. Regarding the policy documents introduced into evidence, Officer Torres explained that “[t]here’s [sic] some occasions where [inmates] should be cuffed in the back and there’s [sic] other occasions where you cuff them in the front.”', '-6-', 'The defendant also testified at the hearing, and he provided a significantly different version of the events that occurred on the morning of June 19, 2012. He testified that, at approximately 7:30 a.m., Officer Torres approached his cell to take him to the shower. According to defendant, Officer Torres cuffed his hands behind his body, through the trap in the cell door. Contrary to the officers’ testimonies, defendant asserted that it was normal for him to be cuffed in the back when taken to the shower. The defendant testified that, within seconds after his cell door opened, Officer Torres “jumped” on him. This action was preceded by defendant asking Officer Torres a question about toilet paper. The defendant explained that he had a documented medical problem and that, as a result, Officer Klaus had authorized him to receive three rolls of toilet paper per week instead of the usual two rolls allotted to each inmate. The defendant testified that, after Officer Torres took him from his cell on the morning of June 19, 2012, defendant told Officer Torres that he needed toilet paper. Officer Torres responded that he was not going to give it to him, and that defendant was only going to get two rolls per week.', 'Then, according to defendant, Officer Torres attacked him. The defendant testified that, after Officer Torres initially “jumped” on him, defendant stumbled but did not fall, and then Officer Torres “charged,” causing him to fall. According to defendant, when the other officers came to the scene, he was on the ground, face down, and Officer Torres was on top of him. The defendant testified that, when the other officers arrived, Officer Torres was “putting pressure on [his] arms,” and that the other officers then began to strike him. When asked where the officers struck him, defendant responded: “My face, my fingers, they was [sic] breaking my fingers, punching me in the face a couple of times. They was [sic] putting pressure, pulling my hair out.” The defendant stated that he did not assault, strike, or choke Officer Torres.', '-7-', 'Two photographs of defendant, taken at the dispensary after the altercation, show that he was bleeding from the mouth. A third photograph shows defendant’s hands cuffed in front of his body; according to defendant, his handcuffs were switched from back to front on the way to the dispensary. The defendant also stated that he was treated for a broken finger. The defendant further testified that, a few days after the altercation with Officer Torres, while he was being held in a cell in the medical area, he had a conversation with another inmate about the handcuffing policy. According to defendant, this is when he learned that it would be against policy to be handcuffed with his hands in front of his body.', 'The defendant also provided testimony regarding a previous dispute that he had had with Officers Torres and Klaus concerning magazines. This incident had occurred in 2011, and it had related to the number of magazines that defendant was permitted to possess at one time. The defendant ultimately filed a grievance, in which he named Officer Torres and requested that he be reimbursed for certain magazines that had been destroyed.

Ultimately, the hearing justice found that defendant “was the aggressor in this case,” and that he had violated the terms of his probation by engaging in conduct “that amounted to a breach of the peace and the failure to remain of good behavior.” As a result, the hearing justice ordered defendant to serve the entirety of his thirteen-year suspended', '-8- sentence.

The defendant maintains that the hearing justice arbitrarily disregarded his testimony and the evidence that he had sustained serious injuries on June 19, 2012, and also overlooked the significance of the RIDOC’s handcuffing policies.', 'According to defendant, the officers’ acknowledged violation of the handcuffing policies undermined their credibility because it was “simply not believable” that they, as “officers entrusted with maintaining safety and order in the ACI’s High Security Center,” would disregard or be ignorant of a “clearly written standard procedure.”', 'The defendant also contends that the record does not support the hearing justice’s determination that defendant’s testimony was not as candid as that of the officers. The state, for its part, argues that the hearing justice was entitled to make credibility determinations and that he did not err in accepting the officers’ version of the events over the version presented by defendant.', 'We have often stated that “the standard employed in probation-violation hearings is considerably lower than that which applies in criminal prosecutions; ‘the state need only show that reasonably satisfactory evidence supports a finding that the defendant has violated his or her probation.’” Raso, 80 A.3d at 42-43 (quoting Ford, 56 A.3d at 468-69). Here, the hearing justice issued a thorough, well-reasoned bench decision, in which he explained that the determination of this case hinged on the credibility of the officers versus that of defendant. The witnesses presented two competing versions of the events that transpired on June 19, 2012; according to', '- 10 - the officers, defendant was the first aggressor and was handcuffed with his hands in front of his body, while defendant maintained that he was handcuffed in the back and that he was attacked by Officer Torres. After summarizing the testimonies of Officers Klaus, Sousa, and Torres, as well as the testimony of defendant, the hearing justice found that defendant had been handcuffed with his hands in front of his body, and that he had been the aggressor in the altercation with Officer Torres. Thus, the hearing justice made a credibility determination that the correctional officers’ view of the events was more plausible than defendant’s version.', 'Regarding the RIDOC’s handcuffing policy, the hearing justice found that the applicable policy documents provided that inmates were supposed to be handcuffed in the back; he also noted, however, that while most complex organizations have policies, these particular guidelines were not rules or regulations, and “deviation from policy may not even be actionable.” He noted that the correctional officers had acknowledged the existence of the handcuffing policy but had “indicated it’s just a policy and sometimes they do things differently because of common sense consideration.” The hearing justice also accepted Officer Klaus’s rationale as to the reason why inmates are handcuffed in the front when taken to the shower, as well as the reason why a correctional officer would not switch the cuffs from back to front after the inmate had exited his cell.', 'The hearing justice further noted that Officers Sousa and Torres had independently corroborated Officer Klaus’s testimony regarding the procedures for handcuffing inmates.', 'In contrast, the hearing justice found that defendant had not provided satisfactory answers to the questions that had been asked of him during the hearing and, specifically, that his answers regarding the magazine incident and his knowledge of the handcuffing policy had been', '- 11 - somewhat vague and confusing. 5 The hearing justice credited defendant’s testimony that he had spoken to another inmate about the handcuffing policy, but he noted that defendant had difficulty answering more specific questions about this interaction. Ultimately, the hearing justice found:', '“[T]he [c]ourt accepts the correctional officer[s’] testimony as the', 'most plausible story. They’ve presented testimony that makes the', 'most sense to this [c]ourt and is the most likely to be true in light', 'of all the facts that have occurred, some of which are uncontested,', 'but the most meaningful ones are the ones that have to do with the', 'handcuffs. And I make a finding that [defendant] was handcuffed', 'in the front on that particular day, and I decline to accept', '[defendant’s] version of the story because I don’t believe that his', 'answers and his responses to the [c]ourt’s questions were as candid', 'as the other officers.”', 'Thus, the record reveals that the hearing justice thoroughly assessed the testimonial and documentary evidence presented at the hearing, and he issued a bench decision explaining why he was reasonably satisfied that the defendant had failed to keep the peace and remain in good behavior. See Raso, 80 A.3d at 44. As this Court has often stated, “we will not ‘second-guess supportable credibility assessments of a hearing justice in a probation-revocation hearing * * * .’” Id. (quoting Ford, 56 A.3d at 469). After observing the witnesses’ words, demeanors, and actions during the hearing—firsthand from his position at the bench—the hearing justice in this case found that the officers presented a more credible version of the events that unfolded on June 19, 2012. We see no reason to question his findings in this regard. Accordingly, we are convinced that the hearing justice acted neither arbitrarily nor capriciously, and we affirm his adjudication of probation violation. 5', 'The hearing justice had initiated a direct line of questioning of defendant, after defendant had been questioned by defense counsel and by counsel for the state.', '- 12 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The defendant, Ramon Virola, appeals to this Court from a “Judgment of Conviction and Commitment”1 dated July 3, 2013, which was entered after a jury found him guilty of four criminal counts related to a murder committed during the course of an attempted robbery. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial and in admitting certain witness testimony. Specifically, he posits that the testimony of three of the key witnesses at trial—David Mercado, Martin “Malik” White, and Patricia “Vicky” Gallardo—was not credible. The defendant further argues that the trial justice erred in admitting certain testimony by Ms. Gallardo because the testimony was not relevant and, even if it were relevant, the unfairly prejudicial nature of that testimony greatly outweighed its probative value, in violation of Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction and its denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial. 1', 'Some of the documents referenced in this Court’s discussion have headings which use all capital letters, are underlined, or employ bold-face type.

In exchange, the remaining counts in the indictment against him were dismissed in accordance with Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Mr. Martinez was eventually sentenced to fifty years to serve with twenty years suspended and twenty years of probation on the second degree murder count; he was sentenced to ten years to serve on the conspiracy to commit robbery count, to be served concurrently.

We summarize below the salient aspects of what transpired at that trial.', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial', '1. The Testimony of Floyd Johnson', 'Floyd Johnson, who was present at the time of the attempted robbery, testified at trial for the prosecution.', 'Mr. Johnson, who testified that he had been a friend of the decedent, Christopher Nelson, testified that on August 16, 2004, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Nelson, and two mutual friends, Courtenay Penn and Jerel James, were watching the Olympics on television and playing video games in Mr. Nelson’s second floor Knight Street apartment in Providence. Mr. Johnson testified that, after hearing a knock on the door, Mr. Nelson answered the door, but then appeared to be “trying to close the door” as he “struggle[d]” with someone. It was the testimony of Mr. Johnson that an intruder wearing a mask then stepped into the room, pointed a gun at Mr. Nelson, and repeatedly asked: “Where is the money?” Mr. Johnson stated that, after Mr. Nelson serve on the conspiracy to commit robbery count, to be served concurrently. Martin White’s plea and sentencing are discussed infra. 3', 'The defendant was also an alleged probation violator, pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The alleged probation violation was heard at trial, in conjunction with the other criminal allegations, but the witnesses from the Department of Probation testified outside the presence of the jury. Although the trial justice ultimately determined that defendant was a probation violator, defendant did not appeal that finding of violation.', '-3- replied that he did not have any money, “the gun went off[.]” According to Mr. Johnson, the intruder was then “brandishing” the gun in the “general direction” of him, Mr. Penn, and Mr. James, again demanding to know where the money was. Mr. Johnson testified that, after he, Mr. Penn, and Mr. James stated that they did not have any money and did not live at the apartment, the intruder left. It was the testimony of Mr. Johnson that during the encounter he saw Mr. Nelson “leaning on the fridge” and “holding his chest.” He further stated that, after the intruder left, he, Mr. Penn, and Mr. James called for help and attempted to assist Mr. Nelson. It is undisputed that, although rescue services were called and arrived soon thereafter, Mr. Nelson was later pronounced dead.', '2. The Testimony of Christina Stanley, M.D.', 'Doctor Christina Stanley, the Chief Medical Examiner for the State of Rhode Island, testified at trial for the state. Doctor Stanley testified that the autopsy of Mr. Nelson had been performed by assistant medical examiner Dr. Dorota Latuszynski, and Dr. Stanley acknowledged that Dr. Latuszynski was no longer employed by the Rhode Island Medical Examiner’s Office. Doctor Stanley stated that Dr. Latuszynski had concluded that Mr. Nelson had “died of internal hemorrhage due to injuries of the heart, aorta, and left lung” caused by a “single gunshot wound that perforated his chest.” It was her testimony that Mr. Nelson’s death was a homicide.', '3. The Testimony of David Mercado', 'David Mercado, one of the accomplices in the attempted robbery and the murder of Mr. Nelson, testified at trial pursuant to a cooperation agreement, in which he agreed to assist in the murder investigation and to testify for the state.

It was Mr. Mercado’s testimony that Jeff Keltz was the roommate of Mr. Nelson. He stated that Mr. Nelson was not involved in Mr. Keltz’s drug activity; that fact is undisputed by the parties. Mr. Mercado testified that, after Mr. Martinez taunted him about his reluctance to participate in the robbery, he agreed to provide transportation to and from the crime scene.', 'It was further the testimony of Mr. Mercado that, later that night, before the robbery, he drove Mr. Martinez to Almy Street in Providence. Mr. Mercado stated that, while they were parked on Almy Street, he observed three men, whom Mr. Mercado had never seen before, arrive on Almy Street. According to Mr. Mercado, Mr. Martinez introduced two of the men as “Malik” and “Kev.” It is undisputed that the men who were introduced to Mr. Mercado as “Malik” and “Kev” were Mr. White and Mr. Turner, respectively. Mr. Mercado testified that the third man, whom Mr. Mercado later identified at trial as defendant, introduced himself to Mr. Mercado as “R.” Mr. Mercado stated that he also heard Mr. Turner refer to defendant as “Ray.” It was the further testimony of Mr. Mercado that, after lingering on Almy Street for ten to fifteen minutes, he drove Mr. Martinez to the corner of Penn and Knight Streets while Mr. White, Mr. Turner, and defendant drove separately to Penn Street in Mr. White’s vehicle. Mr. Mercado testified that he drove away as the other four men started walking toward the apartment of Mr. Keltz and Mr. Nelson.', 'It was next Mr. Mercado’s testimony that, after approximately ten to fifteen minutes, Mr. Martinez called to ask Mr. Mercado to pick him up near the Knight Street apartment.

It was then Mr. Mercado’s testimony that, after he learned that Mr. Nelson had been killed, he drove Mr. Martinez to meet with Mr. Turner on Almy Street and that Mr. Turner gave Mr. Martinez the gun, telling Mr. Martinez to dispose of the weapon.', 'It was Mr. Mercado’s testimony that, two days later, on August 19, 2004, in an attempt to potentially dispose of the gun in Pawtucket, he was driving with Mr. Martinez while the gun was in a shoebox on the floor of the front passenger seat. However, Mr. Mercado further testified that, while he and Mr. Martinez were en route to Pawtucket, the police pulled his car over, arrested them, and seized the weapon.', 'Mr. Mercado admitted during his testimony that, while he had initially denied involvement in the crime, he eventually gave a statement implicating defendant, Mr. Martinez, Mr. White, Mr. Turner, and himself in the murder of Mr. Nelson.

The Testimony of Martin “Malik” White', 'Like Mr. Mercado, Martin “Malik” White, another one of the accomplices in the attempted robbery and the murder of Mr. Nelson, testified at trial pursuant to a cooperation agreement with the state. In return for agreeing to testify for the state, Mr. White pled guilty to charges of assault with intent to commit robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery. He was sentenced to twenty years on the assault charge with fifteen years to serve, the balance suspended with probation, and he was given a ten-year suspended sentence with ten years of probation on the conspiracy charge, to be served consecutively.', 'Mr. White testified that, on August 16, 2004, Mr. Turner, whom Mr. White had known for approximately twenty years, called to tell him about a “lick” that was planned for later that day. Mr. White explained in his testimony that he understood a “lick” to mean a robbery. He then testified that Mr. Turner had learned of the planned robbery from Mr. Martinez. According to the testimony of Mr. White, he next met with Mr. Turner and Mr. Martinez later that day at Mr. Turner’s house on Almy Street to further discuss the robbery. He stated that the group decided that they needed a weapon for the robbery, and he volunteered to attempt to acquire one.', 'It was then Mr. White’s testimony that he called defendant in an attempt to obtain a gun for the planned robbery. He stated that he then drove Mr. Turner and defendant to a rendezvous with an unidentified individual. Mr. White testified that at that rendezvous Mr. Turner and defendant obtained a “silver” “automatic” weapon from the unidentified individual, who was in a dark-colored SUV.', 'With respect to the actual attempted robbery, Mr. White testified that, when the group of men eventually arrived at the Knight Street apartment, Mr. Turner, followed by defendant and Mr. White, entered the building through the back entrance. According to the testimony of Mr.', '-7- White, Mr. Turner, who was wearing gloves as well as a brown “mask” composed of “a sock or some kind of nylon,” went up the stairs to the second floor of the building while Mr. White and defendant remained at the bottom of the stairs. Mr. White testified that he witnessed Mr. Turner knock on the door and that he heard the door open. He stated that, before the door opened fully, he heard a “scuffle.” He also stated that he then heard a gunshot. It was Mr. White’s testimony that, after the gunshot, he saw Mr. Turner exit the apartment and that he, Mr. Turner, and defendant all ran back to Mr. White’s car and fled the scene.', 'Mr. White stated that he eventually surrendered to the police because he “knew the police were looking for [him].” He also stated that he learned that Mr. Turner had implicated him in the attempted robbery and the murder of Mr. Nelson. It was Mr. White’s further testimony that, after he was indicted for the murder of Mr. Nelson, among other charges, he entered into the previously mentioned cooperation agreement with the state.', 'During cross-examination, Mr. White conceded that, when he gave his statement to the police, he was aware of the contents of Mr. Mercado’s earlier statement to police implicating defendant, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Turner, and Mr. White himself in the attempted robbery and the murder of Mr. Nelson. Mr. White also conceded that, “in order to get the best deal,” he had to “give consistent information to that which [Mr.] Mercado had provided.”', '5. The Testimony of Detective Sergeant Michael Sweeney', 'Detective Sergeant Michael Sweeney testified for the prosecution that, in 2004, he was a member of the Providence Police Department investigating the murder of Christopher Nelson. Detective Sweeney further testified that he drafted an arrest warrant for defendant. It was then his testimony that, after being unable to locate the defendant for several weeks, he contacted the Rhode Island State Police, who had “a fugitive task force that strictly searches for individuals', '-8- that are wanted for a period of time * * *.” Detective Sweeney stated that he provided the “fugitive task force” with defendant’s “identifying information” and “photographs.”', '6. The Testimony of Patricia “Vicky” Gallardo', 'Patricia “Vicky” Gallardo testified at trial for the state with respect to her relationship with defendant while he was living in Arizona as “Benny Delgado.” Ms. Gallardo stated that, in 2008, she met defendant through an “online dating service” called “Mocospace.” Ms. Gallardo testified that, during their online conversations, defendant told her that his name was “Benny;” she further testified that she later learned that his last name was “Delgado.” Ms. Gallardo stated that she eventually began a romantic relationship with defendant. It was her testimony, however, that by 2009 she had temporarily ended her romantic relationship with defendant because he “kind of became controlling.” She specified that defendant “wanted to know everything [she] was doing” and “who [she] was talking to.” She also added that defendant “would not let [her]” take his photograph.', 'Ms. Gallardo testified that she resumed her romantic relationship with defendant a few months after the above-referenced hiatus, around the time when she discovered that she was pregnant with their child. Ms. Gallardo stated that, when she was four months pregnant, she moved into the house defendant was already sharing with a roommate and his roommate’s family in Glendale, Arizona. According to Ms. Gallardo, during this time, she overheard defendant identify himself as “Ray” during phone calls.', 'Ms. Gallardo testified that she and defendant eventually moved into a rented house in a gated community in the Glendale area shortly before the birth of their son Aaron4 in January of 4', 'In order to respect the privacy of the child and of Ms. Gallardo’s subsequent significant other (see infra), we have used pseudonyms in referring to them.

Ms. Gallardo stated that, a year later, in January of 2011, she learned that defendant’s first name was “Ramon” and that he was “wanted” by law enforcement authorities in Rhode Island. Ms. Gallardo indicated that, when she confronted defendant with that information, he initially denied the allegations in their entirety.', 'It was the subsequent testimony of Ms. Gallardo that, in the Spring of 2011, her relationship with defendant deteriorated due to the fact that she considered him to be “controlling, possessive, [and] obsessive.” She testified that, when she confronted defendant about his controlling behavior, he blamed his actions on being “wanted” by law enforcement. According to Ms. Gallardo, in June of 2011, she and defendant ended their romantic relationship and defendant moved out of their house in the Glendale area. Ms. Gallardo stated that, after defendant moved out, she found an envelope of documents among his belongings and that one of those documents bore the name “Ramon Virola.” She added that, when she told defendant that she had those documents, he asked her to give them back. Ms. Gallardo testified that, after she refused to give them back, he offered to pay her money in exchange for their return. However, Ms. Gallardo stated that she refused defendant’s offer and eventually lost the documents when she moved out of the house in the Glendale area shortly thereafter.', 'It was next Ms. Gallardo’s testimony that she moved to Chino Valley, Arizona, with her son and her new significant other, Alice.5 She stated that she specifically did not tell defendant where she was moving. Nonetheless, Ms. Gallardo further testified that, in November of 2011, she came to believe that defendant knew where she was living. It was her testimony that, in that month, defendant sent her a text message stating that he “knew where [she] was” and that “he was coming;” according to Ms. Gallardo, defendant included a photograph of a “highway sign,” 5', 'See footnote 4, supra.', '- 10 - which sign she testified she recognized. It was her testimony that the “highway sign” read “Prescott, Arizona. Chino Valley.” It was the further testimony of Ms. Gallardo that she was “really, really scared;” she added that, consequently, she contacted the Chino Valley Police Department and told the police that defendant was wanted by law enforcement in Rhode Island. Ms. Gallardo stated that she was then contacted by United States Marshals, and she eventually learned that defendant had been apprehended.', 'On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Ms. Gallardo as to why she had not moved out of the rented home which she shared with defendant sooner if, in the words of defense counsel, defendant “was preventing [Ms. Gallardo] from being independent and enjoying [her] own life * * *.”', 'Ms. Gallardo answered that she “wasn’t allowed” to move out because defendant “blackmailed [her].” Ms. Gallardo further stated that she continued to live with defendant because she felt that she “didn’t have a choice.” Additionally, in response to defense counsel’s questioning, Ms. Gallardo stated that she had met her then-current significant other, Alice, in 2011, “[a] little bit before the incident of where he -- where it got physical.” Ms. Gallardo went on to state that defendant “moved out after he got physical with [her].”', 'On redirect examination, Ms. Gallardo clarified that defendant had struck her and that his striking her was what caused both the end of their relationship and defendant’s move out of their home in the Glendale area. She further stated that, after defendant had moved out but before she moved out, she returned to the home one day to find that much of her property had been vandalized.', '7. The Testimony of Officer Jimmy Carlo', 'Jimmy Carlo, a police officer with the City of Glendale, testified for the state that, on November 16, 2011, he participated in the arrest of defendant in Phoenix. Officer Carlo stated', '- 11 - that, at the time of his arrest, defendant was carrying a driver’s license which bore the name “Benny Delgado Martinez.” Officer Carlo testified that defendant initially denied that he was Ramon Virola. However, Officer Carlo stated that, once he told defendant that “he was going to get fingerprinted,” which would reveal his identity, defendant said: “‘You know who I am.’”', 'B', 'The Jury Verdict and Subsequent Motion for a New Trial', 'After the state rested, defendant opted to rest without calling any witnesses. On March 6, 2013, after approximately two hours of deliberation, the jury found defendant guilty of all four counts of the indictment, including the first degree felony murder of Mr. Nelson.6 Subsequently, defendant moved for a new trial; defendant argued that, Mr. Mercado, Mr. White, and Ms. Gallardo were, in his view, all “compromised witnesses,” and that, therefore, the court should refuse to credit their testimony; defendant consequently requested that “the [c]ourt grant the motion for a new trial in the interest of justice * * *.” On April 23, 2013, the trial justice denied the motion. The defendant filed a timely appeal to this Court.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, defendant contends: (1) that, in denying his motion for a new trial, the trial justice inappropriately credited the testimony of Mr. Mercado, Mr. White, and Ms. Gallardo; and (2) that the trial justice erred in permitting Ms. Gallardo to testify as to defendant’s purportedly “controlling” behavior during their romantic relationship. 6', 'After the jury found defendant guilty of the four criminal counts referenced in the text, supra, defendant thereafter entered a plea of guilty to the charge of being a habitual criminal.

When reviewing a trial justice’s denial of a motion for a new trial, “we do not focus on whether this Court simply agrees or 7', 'It is important to note that, in addition to arguing that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence, defendant states that the testimony at trial was “legally insufficient to support a verdict of guilt * * *.” This Court has explained that there are important differences between a motion for a new trial based on the insufficiency of the evidence and a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence. See State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569-71 (R.I. 2009); see also State v. Karngar, 29 A.3d 1232, 1235 (R.I. 2011). However, the just-quoted statement by defendant is his only reference to a motion for a new trial based upon the insufficiency of the evidence. Moreover, he proceeds to provide the Court with only the standard of review relevant to a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence. Accordingly, this Court deems any argument regarding the sufficiency of the evidence waived and will focus solely on whether the trial justice properly denied defendant’s motion for a new trial based upon the weight of the evidence. See Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n. 1 (R.I. 2002) (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”); see also Horton v.

Especially relevant to the instant case, we note that “[t]his Court affords a great deal of respect to the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the judicial officer who has actually observed the human drama that is part and parcel of every trial and who has had an opportunity to appraise witness demeanor and to take into account other realities that cannot be grasped from a reading of a cold record.” State v.

Discussion', 'Mr. Virola contends that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial “because Patricia Gallardo, David Mercado and Martin White were all biased witnesses with motivation to lie * * *.” With respect to Ms. Gallardo, he argues that “[i]t was clearly in her interest to do anything to make sure Virola never again saw the light of day, as he was the one impediment to her enjoying the rest of her life with [Alice] and [Aaron].” As for Mr. Mercado’s testimony, defendant avers that Mr. Mercado’s testimony was not credible for two reasons: (1) the fact that Mr. Mercado entered into a cooperation agreement with the state in exchange for a', '- 15 - particularly light sentence; and (2) the fact that Mr. Mercado admitted to repeatedly using marijuana on the day of the robbery and, according to defendant, being “stoned at the time of the commission of the crime.” Moreover, defendant states that Mr. Mercado’s testimony was also unreliable because he initially lied to the police about his own involvement in the crime and was “coming off the effects of marijuana” when he finally told the police about the crime and identified the other individuals involved, including defendant. Lastly, when addressing Mr. White’s testimony, defendant claims that it too was unworthy of credence because Mr. White entered into a cooperation agreement with the state. Moreover, according to defendant, Mr. White had access to all of the discovery in the case, including Mr. Mercado’s statement, before making his statement to police; defendant posits that it was in Mr. White’s best interest to be sure his statement matched the other evidence and accounts of the crime. Thus, it is defendant’s overall contention that “[n]one of these witnesses were worthy of belief.”', 'Our review begins by analyzing the decision of the trial justice to determine whether he followed the proper procedure in addressing defendant’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice began with the first step in a new trial analysis and analyzed the evidence in light of the jury charge. After detailing the jury charge, the trial justice then discussed the fact that the state had called twelve witnesses, and he added that the state had never set out to prove that defendant personally shot Mr. Nelson; rather, it was the trial justice’s observation that “[w]hat the State intended, and what the proof of the State targeted, was to prove that Defendant Virola was vicariously responsible for the offenses, either as a co-conspirator or as an aider and abettor.” The trial justice stated that there was “no question that the State easily proved that a felony murder was committed during the course of the attempted robbery.” Moreover, he noted that', '- 16 - there was also “no question that the State easily proved that a conspiracy was afoot in connection with these individuals to commit that robbery.”', 'Next, the trial justice moved on to the second step in the analytical process relative to a motion for a new trial and independently assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence. With respect to the three above-referenced witnesses, it was the opinion of the trial justice that “[t]heir credibility was severely tested by cross-examination, and all of their warts and wrinkles were clearly exposed.” He proceeded to state:', '“It’s clear * * * that this jury accepted the testimony of all', 'three [of the witnesses at issue]. The credibility issues are, after', 'all, quintessentially entrusted to jurors. I cannot at all fault the', 'jurors for having found all three of these witnesses credible. As a', 'front-row observer, I did too. Frankly, the testimony of [Mr.]', 'White and [Mr.] Mercado was sufficient and credible by itself to', 'convict the defendant.', '“When one adds to that Vicky Gallardo’s testimony, there', 'simply was no way that this defendant was going to escape', 'conviction[;] * * * and his later acknowledgment to Vicky that, ‘I', 'am the way I am because I’m wanted,’ was damning evidence', 'indeed.” The trial justice went on to discuss the fact that evidence of defendant’s flight and living under an assumed name was admissible as evidence of “consciousness of guilt.”', 'Finally, moving on to the third step in the new trial analysis, the trial justice concluded as follows:', '“There is no question in my mind that Defendant Ramon', 'Virola, aka Benny Delgado, was a key participant in this fatal', 'escapade that resulted in the shooting death of Christopher Nelson.', 'In fact, from the credible evidence before me, it was Defendant', 'Virola who orchestrated obtaining the pistol that ultimately caused', 'Mr. Nelson’s death. The evidence against Mr. Virola was indeed', 'overwhelming.', '“The jury’s verdict, which was returned with alacrity, is not', 'a reflection of their giving short shrift to defendant’s interests in', 'this case. Rather, it is a testament to the mountainous credible', '- 17 -', 'evidence that proved Virola’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on', 'all counts.” Thus, the trial justice agreed with the jury’s verdict and, consequently, denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. See State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1028 (R.I. 2007) (“If the trial justice concludes that he or she would have reached the same result as the jury did or that reasonable minds could differ as to the result, the motion for a new trial must be denied.”).', 'On appeal, defendant is essentially asking this Court to second-guess the credibility determinations of the trial justice. The defendant points specifically to the following: (1) the fact that Ms. Gallardo had reason to want defendant out of her life and that of her son; (2) the fact that Mr. Mercado testified in exchange for a light sentence and was under the influence of marijuana when the crime occurred; and (3) the fact that, according to defendant, it was in Mr. White’s best interest to make a statement consistent with that of Mr. Mercado. However, as the trial justice aptly noted, all of those facts about the witnesses were known to the jury.', 'Ms. Gallardo acknowledged that she considered defendant to be a “bad guy,” but she also testified to the fact that defendant loved his son and provided for both her and Aaron during the time when she was living with defendant; she stated that she stayed with defendant despite his “possessive” behavior and did not seek help from the police or family. She further testified that she went to the police about defendant only after she and Aaron had moved in with her new significant other in Chino Valley. In fact, on cross-examination, she acknowledged that she just “wanted [defendant] to stay * * * far away from [her] happy family that [she was] developing.” Thus, the jury was aware of the alleged credibility issues with respect to Ms. Gallardo’s testimony that defendant raises on appeal.', 'Likewise, the jury was aware of the facts that defendant raises on appeal that weigh against Mr. Mercado being found to be a credible witness. Mr. Mercado testified that he had', '- 18 - smoked marijuana multiple times on the day of the crime and was “stoned” at the time the crime took place. Moreover, he acknowledged in his testimony that, when he gave his statement to the police and identified defendant as a participant in the crimes at issue, he was, in defendant’s words, “coming off the effects of marijuana.” Additionally, not only did Mr. Mercado testify regarding his agreement with the state and regarding the relatively lenient sentence that he received, but also, on direct examination, the prosecutor took him through that agreement paragraph by paragraph, asking whether he had agreed to each “paragraph.” Furthermore, on cross-examination, Mr. Mercado acknowledged that he “agreed to cooperate ultimately to save [his] own neck” and “minimize the harm” that would befall him.', 'Lastly, with respect to Mr. White’s testimony, the jury was aware of the fact that he was testifying in exchange for a more lenient sentence pursuant to an agreement with the state. Just as the prosecutor had done with Mr. Mercado, he walked Mr. White through every paragraph of his agreement in front of the jury, asking him if it accurately reflected the agreement he had made.8 On recross-examination, Mr. White testified that, prior to giving his statement, he had the opportunity to review “supplemental discovery,” which included Mr. Mercado’s statements. Mr. White then responded in the affirmative when he was asked: “And you decided that in order to get the best deal, you better give consistent information to that which [Mr.] Mercado had provided; right?” Thus, the jury was aware of all the information which defendant argues demonstrated the lack of credibility of Mr. White’s testimony.', 'In spite of the just-discussed testimonial evidence that potentially could raise doubts in the minds of the jurors as to the credibility of Ms. Gallardo, Mr. Mercado, and Mr. White, the jury nonetheless convicted defendant. What is more, the trial justice found all three witnesses to 8', 'We further note that Mr. White’s extensive criminal record was also brought to the attention of the jury.', '- 19 - be credible and agreed with the jury’s verdict. We have “repeatedly stated that ‘[t]he mere fact that [a] defendant disagrees with the trial justice’s conclusions about credibility is not a sufficient basis to warrant the granting of a motion for [a] new trial.’” Silva, 84 A.3d at 418 (quoting State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 367 (R.I. 2011)). Accordingly, given the fact that we have no reason to quarrel with the trial justice’s execution of the correct three-step analytical approach to a motion for a new trial and his ultimate agreement with the jury’s verdict, it is clear to us that he did not overlook or misconceive material evidence and was not otherwise clearly wrong in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'B', 'The Admissibility of Ms. Gallardo’s Testimony', '1. Standard of Review', 'As we have reiterated on numerous occasions, “[d]ecisions about the admissibility of evidence on relevancy grounds are left to the sound discretion of the trial justice [and] this Court will not disturb those decisions on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.” State v. Moreno, 996 A.2d 673, 683 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted); see State v. Thomas, 936 A.2d 1278, 1281 (R.I. 2007); State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 504 (R.I. 2004). Additionally, we have stated that this Court “will not reverse a trial justice’s ruling admitting evidence over a Rule 403 objection unless it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.” State v. Brown, 42 A.3d 1239, 1242 (R.I. 2012). Furthermore, it is well settled that we will not hold that a trial justice has “abused his or her discretion as long as some grounds supporting his or her decision appear in the record.” State v. Evans, 742 A.2d 715, 719 (R.I. 1999); see Thomas, 936 A.2d at 1283 (“Although [the abuse of discretion standard] is a stringent test, our jurisprudence illustrates that it does not insulate every ruling made by a trial justice.”). When reviewing a ruling under the', '- 20 - abuse of discretion standard, we “examine the ruling to ensure that the trial justice’s discretion has been soundly and judicially exercised, * * * with just regard to what is right and equitable under the circumstances and the law.” Selwyn v.

Discussion', 'The defendant contends that Ms. Gallardo’s testimony with respect to defendant’s behavior during their relationship was admitted in error because “the unfair prejudice of [the] testimony greatly outweighed its slight probative value.” The defendant has provided this Court with a list of statements in which he contends Ms. Gallardo inappropriately testified to his “controlling behavior;” specifically that she testified that defendant “wanted to know everything she was doing and who she was talking to,” was “possessive,” and never let her take his photograph.9 The defendant avers that the evidence was not relevant under Rule 401 of the 9', 'The following is the full list of statements by Ms. Gallardo which defendant, in his brief to this Court, contends are at issue:', '“(1) That Mr. Virola wanted to know everything she was doing and', 'who she was talking to * * * ;', '“(2) That Mr. Virola never let Ms. Gallardo take a photograph of', 'him * * * ;', '“(3) That Mr. Virola would not let Ms. Gallardo move out of their', 'home, and that he was blackmailing her to prevent this * * * ;', '“(4) That Ms. Gallardo told Mr. Virola that she was ending their', 'relationship because he was being possessive and paranoid * * * ;', '“(5) That the reason Mr. Virola moved out of their apartment', 'during the summer of 2011 was because he struck her during an', 'argument * * * ;', '“(6) That she returned home to [the house she had previously', 'shared with defendant] one evening to find her property', 'destroyed * * * ; [and]', '“(7) That on the night she decided to go to the police to reveal Mr.', 'Virola’s status as being ‘wanted,’ she was receiving text messages', 'and photographs from Mr. Virola indicating that he knew where', 'she lived and that he was coming for her * * *.”', '- 21 - Rhode Island Rules of Evidence “as it did not make it more or less likely that [defendant] participated in the conspiracy to rob” Mr. Nelson’s apartment. The defendant further posits that, even if the testimony were relevant, its admission should have been barred by the provisions of Rule 403 because “[t]he distinct possibility existed that the jurors would be so disturbed by learning that Mr. Virola exhibited possessive, controlling or manipulative behaviors that they would reach an impermissible conclusion about his character and find him guilty based on improper character evidence.”10 The defendant claims that the only purpose served by the statements at issue was “to depict Mr. Virola as a violent individual who engaged in a pattern of domestic abuse during his relationship with Ms. Gallardo.” In response, the state argues that', 'Of the seven statements, the ones numbered (1), (2), and (4) were made during Ms. Gallardo’s direct testimony; the statement numbered (3) was made on cross-examination; and the statements numbered (5), (6), and (7) were made on redirect examination. The statements numbered (1) and (2) were properly preserved, as was the use of the word “possessive” to describe defendant in statement number (4). However, the remaining statements are not properly before us. With respect to statement number (4), defendant objected to the use of the word “paranoid” and that word was stricken from the record by the trial justice. See State v. Payano, 528 A.2d 721, 726 (R.I. 1987). After statement number (3), defendant did not move to strike Ms. Gallardo’s response to his questions or request a cautionary instruction; therefore, defendant’s appeal as to that statement was not properly preserved. See State v. Lyons, 725 A.2d 271, 275 (R.I. 1999) (holding that when, during cross-examination, “[d]efense counsel made no motion to strike the response nor requested any cautionary instruction * * * the trial justice committed no error” in allowing the testimony). Addressing statement number (5), defendant specifically stated at trial: “I don’t object to this. It’s fine. I’m not raising an objection.” See State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1107 (R.I. 1999) (“Another basic rule of our appellate practice is that this [C]ourt will not review objections that were not raised at trial.”). With respect to statement number (6), defendant did not object. See id. Therefore, part of statement number (4) and the statements in numbers (3), (5), and (6) are not appropriately before us.', 'Accordingly, we shall address only those statements, referenced in the text (and reflected in the statements numbered (1), (2), and (4)), which are properly before us for review. We shall discuss the statement numbered (7) in more depth in the text, infra. 10', 'The above quotation contains the only passing reference in defendant’s brief to Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, which rule governs the admission of character evidence. The state, in its brief, does address a Rule 404(b) argument; however, defendant’s mere reference to character evidence is not sufficient to raise the issue on appeal. Accordingly, any argument with respect to Rule 404(b) is deemed to be waived. See Wilkinson, 788 A.2d at 1131 n. 1; see also Horton, 22 A.3d at 1130; Chase, 9 A.3d at 1256.', '- 22 - “the admission of [Ms.] Gallardo’s testimony represented a sound exercise of the trial justice’s discretion.”', 'Rule 401 defines relevant evidence as “evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Rule 402 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence further states that “[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by * * * other rules applicable in the courts of this state.” Finally, Rule 403 sets forth the criteria for the exclusion of relevant evidence; it provides as follows:', '“Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative', 'value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,', 'confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by', 'considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless', 'presentation of cumulative evidence.” We shall address defendant’s contentions under Rule 401 and Rule 403 in turn.', 'i. Rule 401', 'The defendant first contends that the specific statements of Ms. Gallardo regarding his controlling behavior and refusal to be photographed were not relevant under Rule 401. This Court has stated that “[i]nherent in Rule 401 are two basic facets of relevant evidence-materiality and probativeness * * * [and] [i]f the evidence is offered to help prove a proposition that is not a matter in issue, the evidence is immaterial * * * [and] should be excluded.” Thomas, 936 A.2d at 1282 (internal quotation marks omitted). We are unable to detect any abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s decision to admit Ms. Gallardo’s testimony. Ms. Gallardo specifically stated that defendant told her that his behavior was a result of being “wanted” by the State of Rhode Island. That fact had an obvious tendency to show that the individual living as “Benny Delgado” in Arizona was in fact defendant, Ramon Virola. Moreover, it helped illustrate defendant’s', '- 23 - consciousness of guilt. Therefore, we hold that defendant’s contention that Ms. Gallardo’s statements were not relevant is not persuasive.', 'ii. Rule 403', 'The defendant next contends that, even if Ms. Gallardo’s statements were relevant, the trial justice erred in failing to exclude them pursuant to Rule 403. Rule 403 requires a balancing test; the trial justice must weigh the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial nature. See Brown, 42 A.3d at 1244. However, “there exists no precise formula for determining the prejudicial effect of a statement.” State v. Dyer, 813 A.2d 71, 74 (R.I. 2003). Moreover, the discretion to exclude evidence pursuant to Rule 403 “must be exercised sparingly,” Brown, 42 A.3d at 1244 (internal quotation marks omitted), and “only when [the] evidence demonstrate[s] mere marginal relevance and enormous unfair prejudice should the trial justice exclude it.” State v. Bishop, 68 A.3d 409, 422 (R.I. 2013); see also State v. DeJesus, 947 A.2d 873, 883 (R.I. 2008); Wells v. Uvex Winter Optical, Inc., 635 A.2d 1188, 1193 (R.I. 1994). This Court has applied a standard which “asks whether [the evidence] will inflame the jurors and therefore prejudice them beyond the ordinary prejudice that is always sustained by the introduction of relevant evidence intended to prove guilt.” State v. O’Brien, 774 A.2d 89, 107 (R.I. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Grayhurst, 852 A.2d at 507 (“Although the testimony at issue was certainly prejudicial, [a]ll of the evidence that tends to prove that [the] defendant is guilty of a crime might be said to be prejudicial.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'In the instant case, the trial justice stated on the record that some of the issues surrounding Ms. Gallardo’s testimony about defendant’s purportedly controlling behavior had been “air[ed]” in chambers, but he noted that Ms. Gallardo’s testimony, including the statements', '- 24 - properly at issue on appeal, was admissible as it was evidence of flight. The trial justice specifically pointed to the fact that Ms. Gallardo testified that defendant actually attributed his controlling and possessive behavior to his being “wanted.” Finally, the trial justice stated: “This is all evidence of guilty knowledge and very, very relevant. And to the extent that there’s any prejudice involved, it is minimal, indeed, compared to the high relevance, and I will certainly permit this kind of evidence to be adduced.” The trial justice cited to State v. Reyes, 705 A.2d 1375 (R.I. 1998), which supports the proposition that evidence of flight can be considered by a jury, “not because it raises a legal presumption of guilt, but because it is a circumstance bearing upon the question of the [defendant’s] guilt which may be presented for the consideration of the jury.” Id. at 1375 n. 2 (quoting State v. Falcone, 41 R.I. 399, 401, 103 A. 961, 961 (1918)).', 'After reviewing the trial justice’s decision, we are satisfied that he soundly exercised his discretion and properly articulated the grounds on which he was permitting the testimony. See Selwyn, 879 A.2d at 887; Evans, 742 A.2d at 719. In addition to testifying that defendant exhibited controlling, “possessive” behavior, Ms. Gallardo also testified that defendant stated that the reason he behaved in such a way was because he was “wanted.” As evidence of flight, consciousness of guilt, and the fact that “Benny Delgado” was Ramon Virola, this testimony was extremely probative. Though there may have been some prejudice in portraying defendant as “possessive” and as unwilling to be photographed, that possible prejudice could not outweigh such high probative value; this is certainly not a situation where the evidence at issue exhibited marginal relevance and enormous prejudice. See DeJesus, 947 A.2d at 883. Actually, it is quite the opposite—the evidence in the instant case was enormously relevant and marginally prejudicial. As such, we hold that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion under Rule 403 when he admitted Ms. Gallardo’s statements over defendant’s objections.', '- 25 -', 'iii. Statement Number (7) by Ms. Gallardo', 'The defendant lists the following as the seventh statement by Ms. Gallardo with which he takes issue on appeal: “That on the night she decided to go to the police to reveal Mr. Virola’s status as being ‘wanted,’ she was receiving text messages and photographs from Mr. Virola indicating that he knew where she lived and that he was coming for her * * *.” See footnote 9, supra. The defendant did object to Ms. Gallardo’s just-referenced testimony at trial; however, he “opened the door” to the issue during his cross-examination of Ms. Gallardo. Consequently, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s overruling of defendant’s objection.', 'On cross-examination, the defendant asked Ms. Gallardo questions regarding her reasons for moving out of the home which she had shared with the defendant, without informing the defendant, in order to move to Chino Valley with Alice. That questioning elicited the fact that she acted in that way even though she had stated that the defendant loved and provided for his son. It also elicited the fact that the defendant called and asked about their son and that she continued to communicate with the defendant by text message regarding their son even after she had moved. It is the contention of the state, with which this Court agrees, that the state was free, on redirect examination, to elicit the testimony at issue in order to illustrate what the state was contending was Ms. Gallardo’s reason for moving without informing the defendant—that she was afraid of him. That testimony counteracted the attempts on cross-examination to suggest that Ms. Gallardo’s motives in moving had to do solely with pursuing her new relationship. Therefore, the defendant’s arguments on appeal with respect to statement number (7) are unavailing. See, e.g., State v. Mastracchio, 112 R.I. 487, 495, 312 A.2d 190, 195 (1973) (holding that “[o]nce [the] defendant opened up the door to [certain] evidence in an attempt to impeach [a witness’s] credibility, he could not complain when the state followed with further', '- 26 - testimony of a like character in clarification of what had been brought up on cross- examination”).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction and its denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial.

After considering the record, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and the oral arguments of counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court. 1', 'We refer to respondent by his first name; in so doing, we intend no disrespect.

We summarize below the salient aspects of that testimony.', 'A', 'The Testimony of Cheryl Csisar', 'Cheryl Csisar testified as a witness for DCYF. She stated that she became responsible for Max’s case in June of 2013, after Nicole Guglielmetti, the original caseworker, departed. 2', 'DCYF simultaneously filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of Max’s mother, Amanda M. (who is also Eric’s wife), on the same grounds that it relied upon in seeking to terminate the parental rights of Eric. In addition, DCYF cited Amanda’s unfitness by reason of chronic substance abuse as grounds for termination of her parental rights pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7(a)(2)(iii). Amanda failed to appear for the initial hearing on the petition and was defaulted. Subsequently, her parental rights were terminated, and she did not appeal from that determination.', '-2-', 'Ms. Csisar described in her testimony how Max came to be placed with DCYF. She stated that, in May of 2012, DCYF was notified about “child care concerns” with respect to Max because his mother, Amanda, was “abusing heroin * * * [and] leaving [Max] with relatives for extended periods of time and not providing for his care.” Ms. Csisar further testified that, at the same time, Eric was “unable to care for his son as well because he was already serving time at the [Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI)] for breaking and entering * * *.”3 She testified that, on May 23, 2012, Max was placed in foster care with his maternal aunt and uncle and that he had remained in their care since that time.', 'Ms. Csisar next testified that her predecessor at DCYF, Nicole Guglielmetti, had created two case plans for Eric, each with the goal of reunification. Ms. Csisar further testified that, in July of 2013, soon after she took over Max’s case and approximately a month after Eric’s release from the ACI (in June of 2013), she created a third case plan for Eric in pursuit of the same goal. It was Ms. Csisar’s testimony that the just-referenced case plan contained expectations that Eric develop parenting skills, attend substance abuse treatment programs, address anger management issues, obtain housing, and refrain from “any and all” illegal activities. She added, however, that she was unable to take any further steps with Eric in terms of executing that case plan because she and Eric “had several discussions about the case planning, and [Eric] felt because he completed some programs at the ACI that he didn’t need to do any further case planning upon his release * * *.” Ms. Csisar specifically stated: “[Eric] had informed me that he completed a parenting program at the ACI * * * and he said he also attended an anger management group * * *.” 3', 'According to Eric’s filing before this Court, he was incarcerated at the ACI for a period of sixteen months, beginning on February 2, 2012 and ending on June 7, 2013. Ms. Csisar also testified to at least two other sentences that Eric served at the ACI, including one for felony assault with a dangerous weapon and another for felony shoplifting.', '-3-', 'With respect to the anger management program in which Eric participated at the ACI, Ms. Csisar stated that “anybody could go to a group.” She added that she would “still need a therapist, a qualified professional[,] to tell [her that Eric had] learned something and mastered some skill and ability to cope in life.” Similarly, with respect to the parenting program in which Eric participated at the ACI, she testified that the course was not sufficient; she stated: “[Eric] has to be able to demonstrate * * * change, and I never saw during my visits with him and his son [that he demonstrated] any parenting abilities. So he would have needed much more than just that class that he attended.” In addition, Ms. Csisar testified that Eric told her that “when the child comes home to his care * * * his wife [(whose parental rights had been terminated)] and his family members would take care of the child; that he didn’t feel like he was going to be the primary caretaker.”', 'With respect to Eric’s efforts in connection with other aspects of the case plan, Ms. Csisar testified that, while the home in which Eric lived would be “suitable” for a child to reside in, Eric’s wife Amanda (Max’s mother), who also lived in the home, would not be “an appropriate caretaker for Max,” in light of the fact that her parental rights to the child had been terminated. Later in her testimony, Ms. Csisar acknowledged that, because Amanda lived in the home, the housing situation would not in fact be adequate for Max. Furthermore, Ms. Csisar testified that, when she visited, in March of 2014, the home where Eric lived with his wife and grandmother, “[e]verything really felt stone cold;” she further stated that “there was no heat * * * or hot water” available in the home.', 'It was also Ms. Csisar’s testimony that, since Eric’s release from the ACI in June of 2013, he “had the opportunity to visit with his son weekly[.]” However, it was her further testimony that, from the time of Eric’s release from the ACI until the time of the trial, which took', '-4- place in May of 2014 (a time period of eleven months), there had been a total of five visits between Eric and Max, all of which took place at McDonald’s fast-food restaurants.4 The last visit between Eric and his son was in January of 2014. Ms. Csisar added that Eric had never requested that the frequency or the one-hour length of the visits be increased, nor had he ever requested make-up visits. Moreover, when asked whether she knew why Eric had not seen Max since January of 2014, Ms. Csisar referenced the fact that she would “call and * * * call [Eric] and his phone gets shut off, and the voicemail is never set up.” Ms. Csisar added that then she would try calling the house phone number and that she would “call there and leave messages to his wife and his grandmother,” but that she would never receive a response from Eric.', 'Ms. Csisar testified that, during visits between Eric and his son, she observed that Max “really doesn’t know [Eric];” she added that Max “sometimes cries when he has to get out of the van and leave his foster mother [Max’s maternal aunt].” She added that, although she did recall that Eric gave Max “a gift and * * * a game, a toy or something” and that he fed Max during their visits, she had also noted that, when Max would “fuss[],” Eric would get “flustered;” she further commented that “he doesn’t know what to do.” Ms. Csisar testified that Eric “looked very uncomfortable, like he [did not] know what he [was] doing, how to care for [Max] * * *.” Ms. Csisar also stated that, during visits, Eric would not check Max’s diaper; she added that Eric “feeds [Max] and then he leaves.”', 'It was also Ms. Csisar’s testimony that she had several conversations with Eric regarding the termination of his parental rights. She first testified that, when she informed Eric that DCYF had filed the petition for termination of parental rights, he was “very angry about it.” Ms. Csisar further testified that, in March of 2014, she attempted to meet with Eric to have him sign some 4', 'Ms. Csisar did note on the record that Eric had been available for one additional visit, which she had to cancel as a result of illness on her part.', '-5- paperwork concerning a special education evaluation for Max. She stated that she went to the home of Eric’s grandmother, where Eric lived, and she happened upon Eric there. Ms. Csisar testified that Eric signed the necessary paperwork, and she summarized as follows what Eric said at that point:', '“[H]e said to me that he decided he knew he couldn’t parent and', 'that he just wanted to sign the direct consent [adoption]. He did', 'not want to go forward with the trial. That he knew there was no', 'point in it. That he felt he would lose and that he couldn’t parent.”', 'In sum, Ms. Csisar testified that, in her opinion, Eric did not successfully meet the goals of the case plan that had been created in July of 2013. She added that, around October of that year, after the filing by DCYF of a petition for the termination of Eric’s parental rights, a new case plan—with the goal of adoption—was undertaken. Ms. Csisar further testified that Max was “doing very well” in his placement at his maternal aunt’s home and that Max was “very bonded” and “very healthy and happy.” She added that Max’s placement in that home was considered a pre-adoptive placement, and that Max’s aunt and uncle had expressed a willingness to adopt Max if Eric’s parental rights were terminated.', 'On cross-examination, Ms. Csisar admitted that she did not call the facilitators of the programs attended by Eric at the ACI in an attempt to ascertain whether they met DCYF standards. She also conceded that she did not make any referrals for any services for Eric. However, Ms. Csisar testified on redirect examination that she had never, in any of her cases, called the ACI and inquired about the curricula relative to the various programs offered at that facility. With respect to the fact that she did not make any referrals for Eric, Ms. Csisar stated on redirect examination that she did tell Eric that he needed additional anger management classes and parenting classes and that he responded that he did not view such classes as necessary. It was her testimony that she would not make a referral for someone who did not want one.', '-6-', 'B', 'The Testimony of Eric M.5', 'Eric was also called as a witness during DCYF’s presentation of its case. (The trial justice granted DCYF permission to treat him as a hostile witness approximately halfway through his testimony.) Although Eric was incarcerated at the time of trial, he stated that he was living with his wife, Amanda. Eric then testified with respect to the case plan given to him by DCYF. He stated that the goals of his case plan were discussed with him while he was incarcerated at the ACI (from February of 2012 to June of 2013) and that those goals were “reunification, drug counseling and visits.” His testimony then turned to the most recent case plan (the third) developed for him by Ms. Csisar and the various requests made by DCYF with respect to achieving his case plan goals after his release from the ACI.', 'Eric testified that DCYF requested that he attend a parenting class, and he stated that he “did that while [he] was in jail.” When asked whether he was told by DCYF that the parenting class that he completed while at the ACI was not sufficient, Eric did not directly answer the question, but instead responded: “Why isn’t it sufficient, though?” He also stated: “I’m not going to give you the answer you want”—at which point, the trial justice allowed DCYF to treat Eric as a hostile witness. Eric continued his testimony, stating that he did not take any parenting class beyond the one offered by the ACI “[b]ecause [he] felt [he] already did the class that [he] already did.” He again asked: “What’s the problem with the class that I took?”', 'Similarly, Eric also testified that he did not recall whether or not he was asked by DCYF to attend domestic violence counseling; he added that, regardless, he felt that domestic violence was not “something [he] currently [had] a problem with in [his] life.” Eric further testified that 5', 'Eric was being detained at the ACI on a warrant at the time of his testimony (May 12, 2014).', '-7- he was asked by DCYF to attend anger management counseling. Significantly, when asked what he had done with respect to obtaining custody of his son, Eric’s blunt answer was: “Nothing.” Eric further testified that DCYF asked him to complete a substance abuse program, which he had not done, although he stated that he was at that time in a substance abuse program at the Kent Center.', 'It was Eric’s further testimony that, since the time that Max had been in DCYF care, he had not provided financially for his son. He also conceded that he had not called the caseworker on a weekly basis to see how his son was doing. With respect to visits with Max, Eric testified that, when he was released from the ACI in June of 2013, he wanted to “make sure [he] was stable” before he visited with Max for the first time after his release; he cited that as the reason why his first visit with his son did not occur until August of 2013, nearly two months after his release. He also stated that, at the time of trial, he was not sure when was the last time that he had visited with his son Max. Eric testified that he believed that it was “over a month ago” or perhaps “two months ago.”', 'Eric also testified with respect to statements that he made to Ms. Csisar concerning his willingness to sign a direct consent adoption for Max. It was Eric’s testimony that, at the time that he spoke to Ms. Csisar about the subject, he “had a bunch of mixed feelings about what was going on in this case;” he added that, although he may have been willing to sign a direct consent adoption at the time, “nothing was set in stone.”', 'On cross-examination by his own counsel, Eric offered two exhibits in support of his testimony that he attempted to cooperate with the case plan while incarcerated—viz., a certificate evidencing completion of a program entitled “Cognitive Reconstruction/Anger Management” and a certificate evidencing completion of a program entitled “Parenting Inside Out.” He also', '-8- testified that he had completed a domestic violence program and another anger management program while at the ACI; he did not provide certificates evidencing his participation in the latter two programs during his testimony before the Family Court.6 Eric also admitted that he received “good time” credit as a consequence of the completion of each class that he took, but he added that receiving a sentence reduction “wasn’t the motivation” for his enrollment and completion of those courses.', 'C', 'The Testimony of Susan Carlson', 'The final witness called by DCYF was Susan Carlson. Ms. Carlson testified that she was a casework supervisor for DCYF and had held that position for twelve years. She stated that she supervised Nicole Guglielmetti, the initial social caseworker in Max’s case, as well as Cheryl Csisar, the caseworker who took over when Ms. Guglielmetti departed.', 'Ms. Carlson testified that she reviewed Max’s file to determine whether Eric had “successfully completed any of the case plan goals or tasks[.]” She described the materials that she reviewed as follows:', '“I reviewed the case activity notes that were entered during the', 'time of Nicole working with the family, as well as court letters and', 'court documents, the summary of facts for the original petition [for', 'termination of parental rights], and the termination petition.” Ms. Carlson testified that she also discussed with Ms. Csisar whether or not the parents had successfully completed any of the tasks in their case plan. She stated that, after she had undertaken those steps, her review of the file indicated that Eric had not completed the necessary tasks in his case plan. 6', 'After being granted leave by this Court to supplement the appellate record, Eric did later provide evidence that he completed the courses, entitled “Domestic Violence Prevention Group” and “Learning to Live Initiative: Anger Management.”', '-9-', 'D', 'The Trial Justice’s Decision', 'After the testimony of the three just-referenced witnesses, DCYF rested its case, and respondent then rested without presenting any witnesses. In July of 2014, the trial justice issued a written decision, including twenty-eight separate factual findings, culminating in the conclusion that Eric was unfit to parent Max.7 (We shall delve further into several details contained in those findings in Part IV, infra.) On August 21, 2014, a final decree entered terminating Eric’s parental rights. A timely appeal ensued.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We have long held that “[n]atural parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the ‘care, custody, and management’ of their children.” In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273, 1279 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982)); see also In re Gabrielle D., 39 A.3d 655, 666 (R.I. 2012). Accordingly, it is important to remain “mindful that that fundamental interest does not evaporate simply because [the natural parents] have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child.” In re Steven D., 23 A.3d 1138, 1154 (R.I. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). To that end, we have acknowledged that, “[a]bsent a finding of unfitness, the natural parents [sic] right to bear and raise their child in a less than perfect way remains superior to the rights of foster parents who may be exemplary nurturers.” In re Amber P., 877 A.2d 608, 615 (R.I. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). We recognize that, in light of the “drastic and irreversible” nature of a decree terminating parental rights, “due process requires that, before the state may terminate a parent’s rights in his or her children, the state must 7', 'The trial justice did not address the alternate ground for termination that was set forth in DCYF’s petition—viz., abandonment.', '- 10 - support its allegations by clear and convincing evidence.” In re Steven D., 23 A.3d at 1154, 1155 (emphasis in original).', 'We bear in mind these weighty considerations in our review of a decree terminating parental rights, while also acknowledging that “[t]he findings of fact made by a Family Court justice in this context are accorded great weight on appeal and will not be disturbed unless it can be shown that they are clearly wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” In re Caleb W., 990 A.2d 1225, 1228 (R.I. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). That deferential standard of review requires only that we determine “whether any legally competent evidence exists to support the trial justice’s findings.” In re Robert S., 840 A.2d 1146, 1149 (R.I. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have established that, in order to make this determination, it is appropriate for this Court to engage in a three-step analytical process, which we have described as follows:', '“[W]e (1) examine the trial justice’s finding of parental unfitness;', '(2) review the finding that reasonable efforts at reunification were', 'made by the state agency charged with that duty; and (3) review', 'the finding that termination is in the children’s best interests.” In', 're Steven D., 23 A.3d at 1155. With the foregoing standards in mind, we turn to the merits of the instant appeal.', 'III', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, Eric contends that the trial justice erred in finding that DCYF had proven, by clear and convincing evidence: (1) that Eric was unfit to parent Max; and (2) that DCYF had made reasonable efforts at reunification between Eric and Max. We note that Eric has presented no argument to this Court with respect to whether or not DCYF had proven, by clear and', '- 11 - convincing evidence, that the termination of Eric’s parental rights was in the best interests of the child.', 'IV', 'Analysis', 'A', 'Finding of Parental Unfitness', 'This Court has long held that, before parental rights may be terminated, a specific finding of parental unfitness must be made. See In re Amber P., 877 A.2d at 615; see also In re Steven D., 23 A.3d at 1161. In order to properly assess the findings of a trial justice with respect to parental unfitness, we begin by acknowledging the principle that “a parent whose child is in the care of DCYF has an obligation (1) to maintain contact with the child and (2) to plan for the child’s future.” In re Rosalie H., 889 A.2d 199, 205 (R.I. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). We have further stated that “a parent’s lack of interest in his or her child evidenced by an unwillingness to cooperate with DCYF services can be a basis for a finding of unfitness.” Id.; see also In re Robert S., 840 A.2d at 1149; In re Anthony M., 773 A.2d 878, 881 (R.I. 2001) (holding that the trial justice did not err in finding parental unfitness on the part of a mother where she “demonstrated a fundamental unwillingness and/or inability to participate in the plethora of services provided to her”).', 'In the instant case, we first note that the trial justice made several specific findings in support of her conclusion that Eric is unfit to parent Max. For example, the trial justice found that Eric “refused to cooperate with case planning” and instead continued to state that he did not require any further programs in anger management or parenting because he had taken courses in those subjects while at the ACI. As we have previously stated, a refusal to cooperate with case', '- 12 - planning can evidence a parent’s lack of interest in a child and, as such, can serve as a basis for a finding of parental unfitness. See In re Rosalie H., 889 A.2d at 205. Accordingly, we agree with the trial justice’s findings with respect to Eric’s lack of cooperation with the case plan developed by DCYF as constituting an adequate indication that Eric is unfit to parent Max.', 'While acknowledging that comparisons in this realm are inherently imperfect, we nonetheless view Eric’s behavior in this case as comparable to that of the parents whose rights were at issue in In re Rosalie H., wherein we affirmed a decree terminating parental rights after recognizing that the parents’ continual “refusal to engage in evaluations or participate in recommended treatment was the sole cause of the lack of success in reunifying this family.” In re Rosalie H., 889 A.2d at 205, 210 (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the record indicates that Eric consistently refused to participate in recommended programs—including, most distressingly, parenting programs—because, according to his own testimony, he “did that” while he was in prison. Moreover, according to Ms. Csisar’s testimony, Eric expressly admitted that he did not plan to be Max’s primary caretaker.8', 'In a similar vein, Eric’s behavior is comparable to that of the respondent father in In re Robert S., 840 A.2d at 1150. In that case, we upheld the termination of parental rights in view of findings by the trial justice that the father had failed to comply with two case plans; had failed to provide “an appropriate place to reunite with the children;” and had not cooperated with DCYF’s recommendation that he receive “additional parental [aid] services.” Id. at 1149-50. That case constitutes a clear parallel to the instant case, in which the trial justice made explicit factual findings with respect to Eric’s “refusal to engage in further services” through DCYF and his 8', 'It should be recalled that Ms. Csisar testified that Eric told her that his wife and his “family members,” presumably including his elderly grandmother, would serve as the primary caretakers for Max. It should also be recalled that the parental rights of Eric’s wife as to Max had been terminated. See footnote 2, supra.', '- 13 - “refus[al] to take any further steps to complete his case plan goals.” In a further similarity to the situation in In re Robert S., the trial justice said of Eric’s housing situation that he was “currently living with [Max’s] [m]other, whose parental rights over Max have been terminated;” the trial justice also noted that, during a visit by a DCYF caseworker, the house “had no heat or hot water.”', 'In addition to pointing to evidence that Eric refused to cooperate with DCYF, the trial justice made further findings in support of her conclusion that Eric is unfit to parent Max. She cited Eric’s “inconsistent and infrequent visits with Max; his failure to support Max emotionally or financially; * * * his lack of interest in Max’s well-being; and his intent to allow [Amanda], whose parental rights over Max have been terminated, to be Max’s primary caretaker” as evidence that Eric did not have “the desire or ability to keep and care for Max.” She also found that Eric “admitted that since his initial release from the ACI in June, 2013, he has done nothing to work towards reunification with Max.” It is virtually self-evident that, as was the case in In re Robert S., 840 A.2d at 1149-50, those facts, based on undisputed testimony, constitute clear and convincing evidence to support the trial justice’s finding of parental unfitness on Eric’s part “based on his overall lack of interest” in his child. Accordingly, we hold that the trial justice was not clearly wrong, nor did she overlook or misconceive material evidence, in finding Eric unfit to parent Max.', 'B', 'Finding of Reasonable Efforts at Reunification', 'This Court has previously stated that, “[w]hen [DCYF] seeks to terminate parental rights, subsequent to presenting sufficient evidence to support [a finding of parental unfitness], DCYF must additionally demonstrate to the Family Court that it has made reasonable efforts to', '- 14 - strengthen the parent-child relationship in accordance with the provisions of § 15–7–7(b)(1).”9 In re Gabrielle D., 39 A.3d at 665 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, we have recognized that “[w]hat constitutes reasonable efforts will vary with the differing capacities of the parents involved, and it is determined by looking at the totality of the circumstances of each case.” In re Steven D., 23 A.3d at 1156 (internal quotation marks omitted). Furthermore, this Court has noted that the “reasonable efforts” standard is a subjective one and that it is “subject to a case-by-case analysis,” id. (internal quotation marks omitted), taking into account, among other things, “the conduct and cooperation of the parents.” In re Gabrielle D., 39 A.3d at 667 (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'We have more specifically described as follows what DCYF must point to as being demonstrative of reasonable efforts at reunification: “[T]he department must show that it has satisfied certain requirements, including case planning with the parent, arrangements for visitation, and keeping the parent informed of the child’s well-being.” In re Lyric P., 90 A.3d 132, 141 (R.I. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Accordingly, there is sufficient evidentiary support for the trial justice’s finding that DCYF had satisfactorily engaged in the efforts required by our precedent, including case planning and providing the opportunity for visits between parent and child. See In re Lyric P., 90 A.3d at 141.', 'The trial justice further found that, although DCYF had not made “specific referrals for [Eric] for parenting or anger management,” the decision not to make referrals was based upon the fact that Eric had “clearly and repeatedly stated that he will not engage in further programs or services to attain his case plan goals.” Moreover, the trial justice found that Eric’s “voluntary refusal to engage in case planning or further services make it impossible for DCYF to provide him with any services.” In accord with that finding, both Ms. Csisar and Eric testified that Eric believed that he did not need any further programs such as parenting classes or anger management courses in view of the programs in which he participated at the ACI.', 'Eric’s refusal to participate in DCYF’s case plans stands in stark contrast to the facts in In re Natalya C., 946 A.2d at 204, in which the respondent mother did not receive any mental health treatment, a service which was necessary to overcome one of her “primary barriers” to reunification with her daughter. Here, Eric was told that he needed further parenting and anger management classes, among other services. However, Eric flatly refused to engage in those', '- 16 - services.', 'In light of that fact, this is a case in which “a parent’s recalcitrance precluded reunification.” Id.; see also In re Rosalie H., 889 A.2d at 208 (stating that DCYF does not have the burden of “holding the hand of a recalcitrant parent”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, we perceive no basis for disturbing the finding of the trial justice that DCYF made reasonable efforts at reunification, and we hold that, on this record, there was clear and convincing evidence of the same.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'We affirm the Family Court’s judgment terminating the parental rights of the respondent.

Home is a shelter from storms—all sorts of storms.1 Unfortunately for the plaintiffs, Joseph and Elizabeth McNulty, that was not the case with the dwelling they purchased from Kristen Chip at 5 Meadowbrook Road, Lincoln (the property). Within weeks of purchasing their new home, the plaintiffs experienced significant flooding in the driveway, garage, and basement. The flooding and water-penetration issues persisted over the next several years, culminating in March 2010, when the plaintiffs experienced extensive flooding of the property. As a result, the plaintiffs filed suit against the defendants, seeking to recover under the theories of breach of contract, negligence, and fraud. Before this Court, the plaintiffs appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court granting the defendants’ motions for summary judgment. After hearing the arguments of the parties and examining the memoranda that they submitted, we are of the opinion that the merger and disclaimer clause contained in the purchase and sales agreement was not drawn with sufficient specificity to bar the plaintiffs’ claim for fraud.

Chip herself lived there during her childhood and until she relocated for college in 1987. In 1998, more than ten years after Chip moved away, her parents experienced flooding that was significant enough to be the subject of a local newspaper article. The article included a picture during the 1998 flood that showed Chip’s father walking through standing water that had pooled in front of the house. At their respective depositions, Chip and her father each testified that Chip was not living at the property at the time of the 1998 flood. Further, Chip testified that she had no knowledge of the 1998 flood until plaintiffs’ counsel mailed a copy of the newspaper article to her after the commencement of this suit. When he was deposed, Chip’s father was asked whether he had told his daughter about the flood. He testified as follows:', '“I don’t recall. 1998, I don’t even know where she was. She wasn’t living at', 'home. I’m sure she knew about it, but I didn’t make a specific effort to tell her', 'about the flood. It’s just common sense that the discussion had to have taken', 'place at some point.” Chip’s father also explained that the 1998 flood did not cause significant damage to the property and that only about one or two inches of wallboard in the basement became wet.', 'In 2002 Chip purchased the property from her parents. At her deposition, Chip testified that, during the course of this transaction, she was not represented by a real estate agent, did not receive a real estate disclosure form from her parents, and did not inspect the property before she bought it. In addition, Chip testified that she had no knowledge of previous flooding at the property and asserted that she never spoke with her parents about any flooding issues. However,', '-2- Chip did indicate that she was aware that periodic flooding had occurred at the adjacent properties, 3 and 7 Meadowbrook Road.', 'In 2004 Chip became interested in selling the property and she retained Michael Pinelli (Pinelli) to serve as her real estate agent in that effort. With the assistance of Pinelli, Chip completed and executed a real estate disclosure form, in which she indicated that there had been no previous flooding or water penetration at the property. Pinelli testified at his deposition that Chip did not personally fill out the disclosure forms; rather, he read each question on the forms to Chip and she provided him with a response, which he marked on the forms himself.', 'The plaintiffs became interested in purchasing the property and eventually they entered into a dual-agency agreement with Pinelli that allowed him to act as an agent for both plaintiffs and Chip. The plaintiffs visited the property on several occasions, both with and without Pinelli. They also retained Answer Home Inspection to inspect the premises.', 'On July 16, 2005, the inspection was conducted.', 'Present during the inspection were the home inspector, Tom Lenahan; the plaintiffs; Elizabeth’s parents; and Pinelli. Significantly, during the course of the inspection, Pinelli allegedly told Elizabeth’s mother, in response to a specific inquiry about water incursion, that there previously had been “maybe an inch or so” of water in the basement. 2', 'The inspection report that was generated by the home inspector was eventful; it noted that the “moisture level in the basement [is] very high, caution advised.” The inspection report also indicated that there was evidence of water penetration, dampness, water stains, and 2', 'At his deposition, Pinelli adamantly denied that he had discussed previous flooding or water penetration in the basement with any member of the McNulty family. However, in viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, as required when reviewing a motion for summary judgment, we will assume that Pinelli did in fact make the “maybe an inch or so” of water comment during the home inspection. See Sola v. Leighton, 45 A.3d 502, 506 (R.I. 2012) (citing National Refrigeration, Inc. v. Standen Contracting Co., 942 A.2d 968, 971 (R.I. 2008)).', '-3- efflorescence 3 in the basement. Lastly, the report recommended that a new sump pump be installed and that plaintiffs consult with the owner of the property for a historical perspective on the issue of water penetration. It is undisputed that, despite the recommendations contained in the inspection report, plaintiffs took no corrective action, nor did they seek additional information from Chip concerning previous water damage.', 'On July 25, 2005, plaintiffs executed a purchase and sales agreement, under the terms of which they agreed to buy the property for $390,000. Section 15 of the purchase and sales agreement contained the following disclaimer: “The Property is being sold in ‘AS IS’ condition and Buyer represents that it has not relied on the oral representations of the Seller, or the Broker(s) or their agents as to the character or quality of the Property.” Further, section 19 of the agreement, pertaining to inspections, stated that “Buyers have already completed thier [sic] inspection of the property and are buying it in as in [sic] condition all other conditions stated in this contract remain in force.” Finally, plaintiffs initialed the following statement: “Having been informed of the right to test/inspect, the Buyer elects not to have any test(s)/inspection(s) performed. (Inspection performed 7/16/05.)”', 'On September 30, 2005, Chip conveyed the property to plaintiffs by deed. In October 2005, after the sale was finalized, but before plaintiffs were able to move into the property, a heavy rainstorm caused the driveway, garage, and basement to flood to a significant degree. At her deposition, Elizabeth estimated that between two or three feet of water accumulated in the basement during the flood. She further testified that when she looked into the basement, she saw that “the water was very high. I saw things floating by.” As a result, plaintiffs called upon the 3', 'The inspection report explained that efflorescence is a “white powdery substance often evident on concrete walls and floors” that is “usually an indication that dampness or water penetration has occurred at some time.”', '-4- Albion Fire Department to pump the water out of the basement. In the aftermath of the October 2005 flood, plaintiffs received a letter from Greg Jergensen, the son of the developer of the neighborhood. The letter explained that, since 1968, the area had been susceptible to significant flooding.', 'Elizabeth also testified that, from 2006 to 2007, there were “situations where if it rained hard or if it rained, we would experience water coming in through some foundational cracks, and it wasn’t just like seepage, it was shooting from the wall and, you know, landing between one and two feet away from the wall.” As a result, plaintiffs retained Pioneer Basements to perform waterproofing services, including the installation of five sump pumps in the basement and a water drainage system around the perimeter of the property. Nonetheless, in March 2010, another heavy rainstorm, of an admittedly historic proportion, caused significant flooding of the property, with two feet of water accumulating in the basement.', 'B. Travel', 'The journey of this case has been somewhat circuitous as it has made its way to this Court. On June 24, 2010, plaintiffs filed suit in Providence County Superior Court naming Chip, Pinelli, RPZ Realty, Inc. (RPZ), RE/MAX, LLC, and RE/MAX of New England, Inc. (collectively RE/MAX), as defendants.', 'On October 5, 2010, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that contained seven causes of action: fraudulent misrepresentation against all defendants (count 1); negligent misrepresentation against all defendants (count 2); deceptive trade practices against Pinelli, RE/MAX, and RPZ (count 3); breach of the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing against Pinelli and Chip (count 4); breach of contract against Chip (count 5); negligence against all defendants (count 6); and breach of fiduciary duty against Pinelli (count 7).', '-5-', 'Hearings of June 19 and 26, 2012', 'On September 1, 2011, Pinelli and RPZ moved for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiffs’ negligence claims were time-barred and that the claim of fraudulent misrepresentation was barred by the disclaimer, or, in the alternative, that plaintiffs could not satisfy the elements of that cause of action. On June 19, 2012, after approximately one year, and four continuances that had been requested by plaintiffs’ counsel and consented to by defendants, the motion for summary judgment finally was heard by a justice of the Superior Court.', 'At the hearing, plaintiffs conceded that summary judgment should enter on the contract claims, counts 4 and 5, as well as the deceptive trade practices claim, count 3. Further, the hearing justice determined that the negligence claims, counts 2, 6, and 7, were subject to a three-year statute of limitations and that “the discovery rule” should not toll the limitations period because plaintiffs knew, or should have known, of the water problems as early as 2005 or 2006. 4 Therefore, based on the statute of limitations, the hearing justice granted summary judgment on counts 2, 6, and 7. Lastly, the hearing justice took the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation under advisement. Later, on June 26, 2012, the justice granted summary judgment on that claim because of the merger and disclaimer clause contained in the purchase and sales agreement. 5 At this point, only Pinelli and RPZ had been dismissed from the case. 4', 'The discovery rule provides that “the applicable statute of limitations will be tolled and will not begin to run until, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the plaintiff should have discovered the injury or some injury-causing wrongful conduct.” Martin v. Howard, 784 A.2d 291, 299 (R.I. 2001). 5', 'Because the hearing justice granted Pinelli and RPZ’s motion for summary judgment on all counts of plaintiffs’ amended complaint, their pending motion to amend their answer to include the statute of limitations affirmative defense was passed.', '-6-', 'Hearings of December 4 and 7, 2012', 'On July 20, 2012, RE/MAX filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that RE/MAX could not be held liable because the court had determined that there was no underlying liability for their franchisee, RPZ, and its alleged agent, Pinelli. On December 4, 2012, the RE/MAX motion for summary judgment was argued before a different hearing justice than had heard the earlier summary judgment motions. On December 7, 2012, the second hearing justice issued a bench decision, in which he found that all the claims against RE/MAX were derivative of the claims against RPZ and Pinelli. The second hearing justice determined that there could be no liability against RE/MAX as a matter of law because the first hearing justice had previously granted RPZ and Pinelli’s motion for summary judgment; therefore, the second hearing justice expressed his opinion that RE/MAX’s motion was rendered moot and he did not decide it on the merits. The second hearing justice did express concern that issues of fact existed with respect to the existence, or non-existence, of an agency relationship between Pinelli, RPZ, and RE/MAX. Nonetheless, the hearing justice did not specifically rule on RE/MAX’s motion; instead, he instructed RE/MAX to file a subsequent motion asking the court to rule that it no longer faced liability in this case.', 'Hearings of February 26, 2013, April 16, 2013, and May 31, 2013', 'On December 7, 2012, Chip filed a motion for summary judgment. On February 26, 2013, a hearing was held on Chip’s motion for summary judgment, at which the second hearing justice indicated that he was concerned that issues of fact existed with respect to Chip’s knowledge, or lack thereof, about previous flooding and water penetration at the property. However, the second hearing justice also stated that the law of the case doctrine might be implicated by the first hearing justice’s decision on Pinelli and RPZ’s motion for summary', '-7- judgment with respect to the disclaimer. 6 Accordingly, the second hearing justice reserved his ruling on the law of the case doctrine, and he denied Chip’s motion on the ground that factual issues remained concerning Chip’s knowledge of prior flooding at the property.', 'On April 16, 2013, the parties reconvened, and the second hearing justice explained that he remained uncertain about the applicability of the law of the case doctrine to Chip’s motion. The hearing justice requested supplemental memoranda from the parties on that issue. On May 31, 2013, after reviewing those written submissions, the second hearing justice issued a bench decision on the motions for summary judgment filed by Chip and RE/MAX. The second hearing justice explained that, pursuant to their supplemental memorandum, plaintiffs were no longer opposing the preclusive effect of the first hearing justice’s decision under the law of the case doctrine. Accordingly, the second hearing justice ruled that the first hearing justice’s decision granting Pinelli and RPZ’s motion for summary judgment established that the merger and disclaimer clause contained in the purchase and sales agreement was valid and, further, that it barred plaintiffs from pursuing their claims for fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and negligence against Chip as well. Further, the second hearing justice ruled that, based upon plaintiffs’ acquiescence in the dismissal of the claim for breach of contract against Chip, the claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing must also be dismissed because it is not an independent cause of action; rather, it is inextricably connected to the claim for breach of contract. Finally, the second hearing justice granted 6', '“The law of the case doctrine holds that, ‘after a judge has decided an interlocutory matter in a pending suit, a second judge, confronted at a later stage of the suit with the same question in the identical manner, should refrain from disturbing the first ruling.’” Chavers v. Fleet Bank (RI), N.A., 844 A.2d 666, 677 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Paolella v. Radiologic Leasing Associates, 769 A.2d 596, 599 (R.I. 2001)). We have explained that the law of the case doctrine is “particularly applicable when the rulings under consideration pertain to successive motions for summary judgment * * * .” Ferguson v. Marshall Contractors, Inc., 745 A.2d 147, 151 (R.I. 2000).', '-8- RE/MAX’s motion for summary judgment holding that RE/MAX could not be held vicariously liable because Pinelli and RPZ were found not to be liable on the basis of the disclaimer. On June 3, 2013, final judgment entered in favor of all defendants. On June 13, 2013, plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews de novo a trial justice’s decision granting summary judgment.” Sola v. Leighton, 45 A.3d 502, 506 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Lynch v. Spirit Rent-A-Car, Inc., 965 A.2d 417, 424 (R.I. 2009)). “Summary judgment is appropriate only when the ‘pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as [a] matter of law.’” Id. (quoting Plunkett v. State, 869 A.2d 1185, 1187 (R.I. 2005)). “Only when a review of the admissible evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party reveals no genuine issues of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, will this Court uphold the trial justice’s grant of summary judgment.” Id. (quoting National Refrigeration, Inc. v. Standen Contracting Co., 942 A.2d 968, 971 (R.I. 2008)).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, plaintiffs advance two arguments with regard to the statute of limitations. First, plaintiffs argue that defendants waived the statute of limitations defense because it was not raised in their answer as an affirmative defense. In addition, plaintiffs contend that genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to whether plaintiffs timely commenced suit because of the applicability of the discovery rule. Lastly, plaintiffs argue that genuine issues of material', '-9- fact exist with respect to the fraudulent misrepresentation claim; therefore, the grant of summary judgment should be reversed.', 'Conversely, defendants argue that summary judgment was properly granted on the negligence claims based on the statute of limitations because plaintiffs knew, or should have known, about any flooding and water penetration issues that may have occurred in 2005 or 2006. The defendants also contend that the claim for fraudulent inducement was properly dismissed because the “as is” disclaimer clause in the purchase and sales agreement was sufficiently specific to demonstrate that plaintiffs could not have justifiably relied on any alleged misrepresentation as a matter of law. Further, Chip argues that the claims for misrepresentation lodged against her must fail because there is no evidence that she had knowledge of previous flooding or water penetration at the property. In addition, Pinelli and RPZ argue that, as a matter of law, plaintiffs’ reliance on any alleged misrepresentations was not justifiable; therefore, the claims for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation were properly dismissed.', 'A. Negligence Claims: Counts 2, 6, and 7', '1. The Failure to Raise the Statute of Limitations Defense', 'The plaintiffs alleged three negligence-based claims: negligent misrepresentation against all defendants (count 2); negligence against all defendants (count 6); and breach of fiduciary duty against Pinelli (count 7). 7 At the outset, plaintiffs argue that defendants failed to plead the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense; therefore, it was waived. Although the statute of limitations was not raised in the answer, we have “unequivocally held that the expiration of a statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that must be raised at or before trial or it is waived.” Brown v. State, 32 A.3d 901, 913 (R.I. 2011) (citing State v. Lambrechts, 585 A.2d 7', 'It is undisputed that the negligence claims are subject to a three-year statute of limitations. See G.L. 1956 §§ 9-1-14 and 9-1-14.1.', '- 10 - 645, 648 (R.I. 1991) (emphasis added)); see also Industrial National Bank v. Peloso, 121 R.I. 305, 308, 397 A.2d 1312, 1313-14 (1979) (allowing an affirmative defense to be raised by way of summary judgment).', 'Here, defendants raised the statute of limitations defense well in advance of trial, by way of their motions for summary judgment. Further, it does not escape us that almost a year passed between the filing of the motion for summary judgment and the day that it was argued. In addition, at the time of the summary judgment hearing, there was a pending motion to amend defendants’ answer to include the statute of limitations defense, which was rendered moot by the first hearing justice’s decision to grant summary judgment to Pinelli and RPZ. Accordingly, there was no surprise to plaintiffs and defendants were not precluded from arguing the statute of limitations defense.', '2. Application of the Discovery Rule', 'Next, plaintiffs argue that the statute of limitations should be tolled because they did not know, nor in the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known, that they were injured as a result of defendants’ negligence until March 2010. The plaintiffs contend that it was reasonable that they did not discover their injuries until 2010 because they were justified in relying upon the representations of their fiduciary, Pinelli. However, a review of the record belies plaintiffs’ contentions.', 'This Court has explained that “[s]tatutes of limitation ‘are designed to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.’” Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 181 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 321 U.S. 342, 348-49 (1944)). “Generally, a cause of action accrues and the applicable statute of limitations begins to run at the time of the', '- 11 - injury to the aggrieved party.” Martin v. Howard, 784 A.2d 291, 299 (R.I. 2001) (citing Plouffe v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., 118 R.I. 288, 293, 373 A.2d 492, 495 (1977)). However, in certain “narrowly circumscribed factual situations,” this Court has explained that “when the fact of the injury is unknown to the plaintiff when it occurs, the applicable statute of limitations will be tolled and will not begin to run until, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, the plaintiff should have discovered the injury or some injury-causing wrongful conduct.” Id. (citing and quoting Renaud v. Sigma-Aldrich Corp., 662 A.2d 711, 714 (R.I. 1995)). “The reasonable diligence standard is based upon the perception of a reasonable person placed in circumstances similar to the plaintiff’s, and also upon an objective assessment of whether such a person should have discovered that the defendant’s wrongful conduct had caused him or her to be injured.” Id. at 300.', 'In Lee v. Morin, 469 A.2d 358, 359 (R.I. 1983), the plaintiffs filed a negligence action more than six years after purchasing a house, seeking to recover for undiscovered latent defects in the property. This Court was asked to determine when the statute of limitations began to run in a case involving improvements to real property. Id. After considering three different tolling theories, we held that the limitations period “begins to run when the evidence of injury to property, resulting from the negligent act upon which the action is based, is sufficiently significant to alert the injured party to the possibility of a defect.” Id. at 360. That holding was consistent with prior decisions of this Court that “have consistently held that in situations in which a reasonable person would not have discovered the legal action prior to the time of injury, the statute begins to run at the time the injury manifests itself.” Id.', 'In the present case, even before executing the purchase and sales agreement, plaintiffs had inspected the property and had been informed about water issues relating to the basement', '- 12 - and that corrective action should be taken. Then, almost immediately after purchasing the property, indeed, even before they moved into it, plaintiffs experienced significant flooding that resulted in two to three feet of water accumulating in the basement. Shortly thereafter, plaintiffs were informed by the developer’s son that, since 1968, the area was susceptible to significant flooding because of increased water flow. This certainly proved true because, over the next several years, they experienced multiple instances of flooding or water penetration. Finally, in March 2010, plaintiffs experienced another major flood, comparable to the October 2005 flood, that Elizabeth testified caused two feet of water to enter the basement.', 'Despite the repeated flooding of the property, plaintiffs argue that it was not until they had a conversation with their neighbors, the Blaises, after the March 2010 flood, that they were put on notice of defendants’ alleged misstatements. The plaintiffs contend that the Blaises informed them that, in their opinion, Chip had to have known about previous flooding at the property.', 'Therefore, plaintiffs conclude that the statute of limitations applicable to their negligence claims should be tolled because, until their conversation with the Blaises, they had no reason to believe that they had suffered an injury.', 'However, in light of the repeated instances of flooding and water penetration, we cannot agree. Our case law makes clear that the pertinent inquiry is “whether, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, [the] plaintiff should have discovered the alleged [misconduct].” Canavan v. Lovett, Schefrin and Harnett, 862 A.2d 778, 784 (R.I. 2004) (citing Richmond Square Capital Corp. v. Mittleman, 689 A.2d 1067, 1069 (R.I. 1997) (mem.)). When confronted with numerous instances of flooding and water problems during the years that followed the purchase of the property, as well as information that the area has been flood-prone since 1968, a reasonable person would have been put on notice more than three years before suit was filed that a potential', '- 13 - claim existed. Therefore, plaintiffs are not entitled to avail themselves of the protection of the discovery rule. 8', 'B. Fraud Claim: Count 1', 'The plaintiffs’ next argument on appeal is that genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment from entering on their claim for fraudulent misrepresentation.', 'The defendants, on the other hand, aver that count 1 was properly dismissed because the disclaimer clause in the purchase and sales agreement was sufficiently specific to demonstrate that plaintiffs could not have justifiably relied on any alleged misrepresentation as a matter of law. Chip argues that count 1 fails because the record is bare of any evidence that she had knowledge of previous flooding or water penetration at the property. In addition, Pinelli and RPZ argue that, as to them, plaintiffs’ reliance on any alleged misrepresentations was not justifiable as a matter of law; therefore, the claims for fraudulent misrepresentation were properly dismissed.', '“To establish a prima facie fraud claim, ‘the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a false representation intending thereby to induce [the] plaintiff to rely thereon and that the plaintiff justifiably relied thereon to his or her damage.’” Parker v. Byrne, 996 A.2d 627, 634 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Bitting v. Gray, 897 A.2d 25, 34 (R.I. 2006)). “‘[A] party who has been induced by fraud to enter into a contract’ may elect either to rescind the contract, or ‘to affirm the contract and sue for damages in an action for intentional deceit or misrepresentation.’” 8', 'The plaintiffs also argue that the statute of limitations should be tolled, pursuant to § 9-1-20, because defendants fraudulently concealed their alleged misconduct. We have explained that “[t]he key consideration is whether or not the defendant fraudulently misrepresented material facts, thereby misleading the plaintiff into believing that no cause of action existed.” Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 183 (R.I. 2008). In sum, the record is devoid of any evidence that defendants affirmatively “conceal[ed] from [plaintiffs] the existence of the cause of action[;]” therefore, plaintiffs are not entitled to the protections afforded by § 9-1- 20.', '- 14 - Stebbins v. Wells, 766 A.2d 369, 372 (R.I. 2001) (quoting Travers v. Spidell, 682 A.2d 471, 472 (R.I. 1996)).', 'In LaFazia v. Howe, 575 A.2d 182, 183 (R.I. 1990), the parties discussed, at length, the profitability of a delicatessen before it was sold to the plaintiff-buyers. The buyers sought tax returns, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and other records so that they could intelligently assess the profitability of the business. Id. The sellers indicated to them that they were always paid in cash and, as a result, they “did not keep very good books,” but they nonetheless provided their tax returns for buyers’ inspection. Id. When they reviewed the documents provided to them, the buyers at first decided that the business was not viable. Id. However, after further reassuring representations were made by the sellers as to the profitability of the enterprise, the buyers entered into an agreement to purchase the business. Id. Significantly, the agreement included a merger and disclaimer clause that went to the heart of the matter at issue during trial, providing that “[t]he Buyers rely on their own judgment as to the past, present or prospective volume of business or profits of the business of the Seller and does [sic] not rely on any representations of the Seller with respect to the same.” Id.', 'Shortly after the sale was finalized, the buyers realized that the business was not as profitable as they claimed that they had been led to believe and, as a result, they failed to pay the balance due on the promissory note. LaFazia, 575 A.2d at 183-84. The sellers initiated suit for breach of contract, seeking to collect the remainder of the promissory note, and the buyers filed a counterclaim seeking to recover for fraudulent misrepresentation. Id. at 184. The Superior Court granted summary judgment to the sellers on the buyers’ fraud claim, and that judgment was appealed to this Court. Id. We affirmed the grant of summary judgment, holding that “the merger and disclaimer clauses preclude [the buyers] from asserting that [the sellers] made', '- 15 - material misrepresentations regarding the profitability of the business * * * prevent[ing the buyers] from successfully claiming reliance on prior representations.” Id. at 185. The Court explained that it was significant that the merger and disclaimer at issue was “not a general but a specific disclaimer” that contained “specific language regarding the very matter concerning which [the buyers] now claim they were defrauded.” Id. at 185, 186.', 'In Travers, 682 A.2d at 472, this Court was tasked with determining whether a general merger and disclaimer clause contained in a purchase and sales agreement barred the buyers’ fraud claim based on the sellers’ alleged misrepresentations. The buyers alleged that the sellers misrepresented that a home’s well was located within the boundaries of the conveyed property when, in actuality, the well was on a neighbor’s property. Id. The purchase and sales agreement in that case also contained a merger and disclaimer clause, which provided that “[w]e, the parties hereto, each declare that this instrument contains the entire agreement between the parties, and that it is subject to no understandings, conditions or representations other than those expressly stated therein.” Id. On appeal, we explained that, unlike LaFazia, the disclaimer clause at issue was general in nature and was not specific because it “specifically addresses neither the well’s location nor the boundaries of the property.” Travers, 682 A.2d at 473. For that reason, we held that the general merger and disclaimer language did not bar the buyers’ fraud claim as a matter of law. Id.', 'Here, defendants aver that the “as is” disclaimer clause in the purchase and sales agreement was sufficiently specific to the extent that, as a matter of law, plaintiffs could not have justifiably relied on any alleged misrepresentation. The merger and disclaimer clause at issue in this case provides, in pertinent part, that “[t]he Property is being sold in ‘AS IS’ condition and Buyer represents that it has not relied on the oral representations of the Seller, or the Broker(s) or', '- 16 - their agents as to the character or quality of the Property.”', 'With respect to inspections, the parties added a provision that provided that “Buyers have already completed thier [sic] inspection of the property and are buying it in as in [sic] condition all other conditions stated in this contract remain in force.” The defendants contend that the above-referenced portions of the purchase and sales agreement, when combined with the fact that plaintiffs had previously had a professional inspection performed on their behalf, obviates any claim of reasonable reliance.', 'However, unlike the disclaimer in LaFazia, 575 A.2d at 183, which explicitly stated that buyers were relying on their own knowledge concerning the very issue at trial, profitability of the business, the instant disclaimer provides only that plaintiffs have not relied on oral representations “as to the character or quality of the Property.” In our opinion, the disclaimer more closely resembles the more general disclaimer addressed in Travers, 682 A.2d at 472, which provided that the purchase and sales agreement embodied the entire agreement and was “subject to no understandings, conditions or representations other than those expressly stated therein.” Id. The defendants contend, however, that, when combined with the waiver of the right to inspect, as well as the inspection report that was issued prior to entering into the agreement, the disclaimer is sufficiently specific as to the very nature of plaintiffs’ fraud claim. But, it is significant to us that neither the disclaimer clause nor the provisions concerning plaintiffs’ waiver of their right to inspect, contains any reference to the issues of flooding and water penetration. Because the disclaimer clause was general, as opposed to specific, with respect to the nature of the claim at issue, it is our opinion that the first hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment as to count 1 was improper.', 'Notwithstanding the absence of an effective disclaimer, Chip argues that the claims for fraud still must fail as to her because there is no evidence that she had any knowledge of', '- 17 - previous flooding at the property. However, Chip’s father testified at a deposition that, even though he was unsure if he told Chip about the 1998 flood, “I’m sure she knew about it,” and that “[i]t’s just common sense that the discussion [about the 1998 flood] had to have taken place at some point.” Therefore, and in the context of a summary judgment proceeding, genuine issues of material fact exist with respect to Chip’s knowledge, or lack thereof, of the 1998 flood.', 'Lastly, Pinelli and RPZ argue that plaintiffs’ claim for fraudulent inducement fails as a matter of law as to them because plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that they reasonably relied on any statement Pinelli may have made or that Pinelli intended to induce them to purchase the property. However, in light of the allegation that Pinelli said that “maybe an inch or so” of water entered the basement previously and the fact that he was financially interested in finalizing the sale as an agent for both plaintiffs and Chip, it is our opinion that issues of fact exist as to the fraud claim against Pinelli and RPZ. Moreover, because the dismissal of the fraud claim against RE/MAX was based upon the first motion justice’s ruling that the purchase and sales agreement’s disclaimer clause was effective to bar the fraud claim, a ruling that we have reversed, and because of the existence of an agency relationship sufficient to allow vicarious liability to attach to RE/MAX is an issue of fact, count 1 also survives as to RE/MAX.', 'C. Remaining Contract Claim: Count 4', 'The plaintiffs’ last argument on appeal is that they have a viable cause of action against Chip under count 4, breach of the implied warranty of good faith and fair dealing, because it is a separate and independent cause of action. 9 This Court has explained that “[v]irtually every contract contains an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing between the parties.” 9', 'During the course of the summary judgment proceedings, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed count 5, and conceded that summary judgment should be granted on count 4 in favor of Pinelli because he was not a party to the purchase and sales agreement. Therefore, the only remaining contract claim is count 4 against Chip.', '- 18 - Dovenmuehle Mortgage, Inc. v. Antonelli, 790 A.2d 1113, 1115 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Centerville Builders, Inc. v. Wynne, 683 A.2d 1340, 1342 (R.I. 1996)). The implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing ensures that “contractual objectives may be achieved,” Ide Farm & Stable, Inc. v. Cardi, 110 R.I. 735, 739, 297 A.2d 643, 645 (1972), and that “neither party shall do anything which will have the effect of destroying or injuring the right of the other party to receive the fruits of the contract.” 17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts § 370 at 356 (2004). However, we have explained that a claim for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing does not create an independent cause of action separate and apart from a claim for breach of contract.

Accordingly, the hearing justice properly granted Chip’s motion for summary judgment with respect to count 4.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the grants of summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ contract claims, counts 4 and 5, and the negligence claims, counts 2, 6, and 7. However, we vacate the grant of summary judgment on the plaintiffs’ fraud claim, count 1, and remand the case to the Superior Court for further proceedings.', '- 19 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Joseph McNulty et al. v.

14,: Association v. : Manuel Rosario et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This appeal arose from an interpleader action filed by the plaintiff, Rhode Island Joint Reinsurance Association (RIJRA), against multiple defendants to determine the proper disposition of insurance proceeds. 1 The defendants, Manuel Rosario (Rosario) and Reyna Bernard (Bernard), appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court in favor of Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC (Ocwen) as agent for HSBC Bank, USA, N.A. (HSBC), granting Ocwen’s motion for summary judgment with regard to the interpleader claim as well as all other claims asserted by the defendants in this action. 2 After considering the record below and the memoranda submitted by the parties, and for the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The interpleader defendants were: Manuel Rosario, Reyna Bernard, Alias, McCauley & L’Europa, LLC, and Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC as agent for HSBC Bank, USA, N.A. 2', 'The record reflects that Rosario and Bernard were the only defendants who filed a notice of appeal in this action. Accordingly, this Court will not consider the prebrief filed by McCauley & L’Europa.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The pertinent facts are as follows. On March 16, 2006, Bernard purchased property at 265 Union Avenue in Providence. On the same day, Bernard executed a promissory note to Delta Funding Corporation d/b/a Fidelity Mortgage (Fidelity Mortgage) in the principal amount of $236,000 that was secured by a mortgage on the property. 3 The mortgage identified Bernard as the borrower and mortgagor, Fidelity Mortgage as the lender, and Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (MERS) as the mortgagee and nominee for the lender. The note was endorsed to HSBC by an undated allonge and, on July 21, 2008, MERS, acting in its capacity as nominee of the lender, assigned the mortgage to HSBC.', 'On February 17, 2009, a fire destroyed the property, and it was determined that repair was not feasible. The following day, Rosario entered into an insurance adjusting agreement with McCauley & L’Europa, LLC (McCauley & L’Europa). The agreement provided that McCauley & L’Europa would assist with the adjustment of the loss in return for a fee of 8 percent of the total recoverable loss.', 'Bernard subsequently defaulted on payments due under the note and foreclosure proceedings were initiated. On July 28, 2009, the property was sold at a foreclosure sale at which HSBC was the high bidder with a bid of $81,375. Thereafter, on September 10, 2009, HSBC executed a quitclaim deed to a third party, Brian Justiniano, for the sum of $31,000. As of January 2011, there was an unpaid deficiency on the note in the amount of $246,072.80. 3', 'According to Ocwen, Bernard claims to have transferred her interest in the property to Rosario and contends that both she and Rosario were residing at the premises prior to the fire. Ocwen describes the parties’ interests in the property as “convoluted,” but it insists that the purported transfer does not affect Ocwen’s rights to the insurance proceeds.', '-2-', 'On June 18, 2009, RIJRA issued a check payable to Rosario, Bernard, McCauley & L’Europa, and Ocwen in the amount of $232,232, in payment for the insurable loss under the policy. According to RIJRA, this check was not endorsed and Rosario and Bernard have “demanded a new check without the name of a mortgagee thereon.” On April 16, 2010, RIJRA initiated an interpleader action in the Superior Court to determine the respective rights of Ocwen, McCauley & L’Europa, Rosario, and Bernard with regard to the insurance proceeds.', 'On December 14, 2010, RIJRA’s motion to deposit $232,232 into the Registry of the Superior Court was granted and RIJRA was discharged from any further liability arising from the insurance policy it had issued.', 'Rosario and Bernard answered RIJRA’s interpleader action, and they also filed a cross- claim against Ocwen, seeking declaratory relief and to quiet title to the property. 4 Specifically, Rosario and Bernard asked the court to declare that they were entitled to the entirety of the insurance proceeds from RIJRA. Further, Rosario and Bernard sought declarations that: (1) Ocwen and HSBC were strangers to the title of the property; (2) the assignment of the mortgage was void; (3) the foreclosure sale was invalid; and (4) they owned the property as a matter of law.', 'On July 6, 2010, Ocwen, as agent for HSBC, answered the cross-claims of Rosario and Bernard.', 'Ocwen also filed an answer to RIJRA’s interpleader complaint, wherein Ocwen alleged that it was entitled to the entire balance of the insurance proceeds. On September 1, 2010, McCauley & L’Europa answered the interpleader complaint and alleged that, pursuant to 4', 'The record also reflects that Bernard filed a separate answer and cross-claim in response to the interpleader action, wherein she admitted that she was in arrears of her mortgage; however, Bernard did not pursue her individual claim or allegations in the Superior Court. As such, we shall limit our review to those issues raised by the joint filings of Rosario and Bernard, and we will not address the answer and cross-claim filed by Bernard individually.', '-3- the agreement it entered with Rosario, it was entitled to recover 8 percent of the insurance proceeds in payment for its adjustment services.', 'On June 30, 2011, Ocwen filed a motion for summary judgment on RIJRA’s interpleader claim and against the cross-claims of Rosario and Bernard. Ocwen argued that, pursuant to the clear and unambiguous terms of the mortgage deed, Bernard had agreed that any insurance proceeds would be distributed to the lender and its successors and assigns—in this case, HSBC. 5 Therefore, Ocwen averred, that the insurance proceeds should be distributed to it on behalf of HSBC. In support, Ocwen submitted a declaration of Nichelle Jones, a loan analyst at Ocwen, detailing the history and travel of the note and mortgage.', 'Rosario and Bernard objected to Ocwen’s motion for summary judgment, raising several arguments regarding the travel of the note and mortgage. Specifically, Rosario and Bernard argued that: (1) Ocwen had no interest in the insurance proceeds because it is not the lender, mortgagee, or holder of the note; (2) Ocwen had no standing to assert any rights in the insurance proceeds; (3) there was no proof of the validity of the allonge; (4) the foreclosure sale was invalid; and (5) no proof existed that Ocwen or HSBC ever held the note or had the right to 5', 'Section 5 of the mortgage, signed by Bernard, provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under [the statutory power of', 'sale] or otherwise, Borrower hereby assigns to Lender (a) Borrower’s rights to', 'any insurance proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the', 'Note or this Security Instrument, and (b) any other of Borrower’s rights (other', 'than the right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by Borrower) under all', 'insurance policies covering the Property, insofar as such rights are applicable to', 'the coverage of the Property.

In support, they submitted an affidavit of Alberta Nota contesting the validity of the signatures that appear on the assignment of the mortgage.', 'After a hearing, a justice of the Superior Court found that Ocwen was entitled to the entirety of the insurance proceeds pursuant to the language contained in the mortgage.

Most notably, for our purposes, defendants contend that the mortgage executed by Bernard was void because it was not duly', '-5- acknowledged as required by G.L. 1956 § 34-11-1. 6 It is significant that this Court has very recently addressed the issue of the proper disposition of insurance proceeds resulting from a dwelling fire in Rhode Island Joint Reinsurance Association v. Santana-Sosa, 92 A.3d 192, 194- 95 (R.I. 2014). In Santana-Sosa, a borrower executed a mortgage that specified that “any insurance proceeds would be distributed to the lender and its successors and assigns.” Id. at 194, 196. Thereafter, a fire occurred at the property and the borrower defaulted on payments under the note and mortgage, culminating in the sale of the property at foreclosure. Id. at 195.', 'An interpleader action was initiated by the plaintiff-insurer in order to litigate the parties’ respective rights with regard to the insurance proceeds. Santana-Sosa, 92 A.3d at 195. The loan servicer moved for summary judgment and argued that, pursuant to the mortgage documents, the borrower agreed that “any insurance proceeds would be distributed to the lender and its successors and assigns.” Id. at 196. The borrower objected and asserted that the mortgage at issue was void and that the foreclosure sale was invalid. Id. A justice of the Superior Court granted the motion for summary judgment and the borrower appealed to this Court. Id.', 'On appeal, this Court held that “no conceivable resolution of this dispute would result in * * * the borrower[], having a legitimate claim to the funds.” Santana-Sosa, 92 A.3d at 197. We explained that the borrower failed to “explain how an invalid foreclosure would entitle her to receive the insurance proceeds at issue in this interpleader action.” Id.', 'Both the facts and the arguments raised in this case are strikingly similar to those presented in Santana-Sosa.', 'Bernard’s mortgage similarly directed that, when repair to the premises was not economically feasible, the insurance proceeds were to be distributed to the 6', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-11-1 provides in pertinent part that “[e]very conveyance of lands * * * by way of mortgage * * * shall be void unless made in writing duly signed, acknowledged as hereinafter provided, delivered, and recorded in the records of land evidence in the town or city where the lands * * * are situated * * * .”', '-6- lender and its successors and assigns. Further, the mortgage provided that public insurance adjusters “shall not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and shall be the sole obligation of [Bernard].” Accordingly, as was the case in Santana-Sosa, defendants have failed to demonstrate any scenario that would lead to their entitlement to the insurance proceeds.', 'Further, we discern no merit in defendants’ contention that the mortgage executed by Bernard was void because it was not duly acknowledged as required by § 34-11-1. Black’s Law Dictionary defines “acknowledgment” as “a formal declaration made in the presence of an authorized officer, such as a notary public, by someone who signs a document and confirms that the signature is authentic.” Black’s Law Dictionary 27 (10th ed. 2014). A review of the record reveals that Bernard signed the last page of the mortgage, acknowledging that she “accepts and agrees to the terms and covenants contained in this [mortgage].” The signature of a notary public appears below Bernard’s, and the notary’s name is typed immediately beneath her signature. Accordingly, it is our opinion that the mortgage was duly signed and acknowledged in accordance with § 34-11-1.', 'Finally, the defendants contend that the documents attached to the Jones declaration were inadmissible, the assignments of the note and mortgage are void, and the foreclosure was invalid because Ocwen failed to establish that it was an agent for the noteholder or mortgagee. However, because we have previously explained that, in our opinion, “no conceivable resolution of this dispute would result in * * * [the defendants] having a legitimate claim to the funds,” there is no need to address these arguments.

15,: v. : William G. Bremer. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. Before the Court are three appeals filed by Valerie L. Bremer from various proceedings in the Family Court surrounding her divorce from William G. Bremer. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that these appeals may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court in all respects.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The parties’ divorce was granted from the bench on May 30, 2008, and a final judgment of divorce was ultimately entered on February 19, 2010. However, that was not the end of the matter—because, on June 9, 2010, Valerie filed a complaint in Superior Court contending that', '-1- she had an interest in two businesses that she and William had operated during their marriage.1 William then filed two motions in the Family Court seeking clarification of the division of assets, specifically as to the businesses. On March 26, 2012, the Chief Judge of the Family Court issued an order assigning William’s motion for clarification to the Family Court justice who had presided over the original divorce hearings. Valerie’s first appeal is from that assignment order. Subsequently, on June 8, 2012 (after rendering a bench decision on April 4, 2012), the Family Court justice to whom the matter was assigned entered an order clarifying the final judgment of divorce and awarding the businesses to William. That order forms the basis of Valerie’s second appeal.', 'Quite apart from the issues involving the businesses, William moved, in Family Court, to have Valerie adjudged in contempt due to her failure to meet the terms of the February 19, 2010 final judgment of divorce. On June 27, 2013, the Chief Judge of the Family Court entered an extremely thorough and well-thought-out order adjudging Valerie in contempt and ordering her to comply with the final judgment of divorce or face incarceration. Also included in the order was an award of interest against Valerie. Valerie’s third appeal is an appeal from the order adjudging her in contempt.2 We shall address each of Valerie’s appeals in turn. 1', 'William states in his filings before this Court that the Superior Court action was stayed pending a decision in Family Court regarding the businesses. We have been unable to discern from the Superior Court docket sheet whether or not a stay was in effect. However, from the entire record before us, it appears to this Court that the Superior Court action had been stayed. Regardless, the Family Court was the most appropriate court to deal with the ownership of the businesses since that court had divided the assets during the divorce litigation. Additionally, we note that there was no decision in the Superior Court during the pendency of this action in the Family Court. 2', 'It is worth stating that the parties do not dispute that Valerie did eventually comply with the terms of the order adjudging her in contempt and was never incarcerated in connection therewith.', '-2-', 'II', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The Assignment Order', 'We turn first to the appeal from the order by the Chief Judge of the Family Court assigning the motion for clarification to the Family Court justice who had presided over the original divorce action. This appeal is utterly baseless. This Court does not review such interlocutory orders.', 'See Coit v. Tillinghast, 91 A.3d 838, 843 (R.I. 2014) (noting that “[i]nterlocutory orders are those that are provisional or temporary, or that decide some intermediate point or matter but are not a final decision of the whole matter” and further stating that “[g]enerally, interlocutory orders are not subject to review”) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, even if we were to address the merits, it would be our conclusion that the Chief Judge acted appropriately in view of the administrative powers granted to her under G.L. 1956 § 8-10-14.3 We consider it to be particularly admirable that the Chief Judge did everything in her power to move the motion for clarification forward in a manner that ensured the greatest judicial efficiency and fairness to the parties. Thus, Valerie’s first appeal is unavailing.', 'B', 'The Clarification Order', 'Like her appeal of the assignment order, Valerie’s appeal from the order clarifying the division of assets is unconvincing. We apply a deferential standard of review to a decision of the Family Court. Ruffel v. Ruffel, 900 A.2d 1178, 1184 (R.I. 2006). We will not “disturb the trial 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 8-10-14 provides in pertinent part as follows: “The [C]hief [J]udge of the [F]amily [C]ourt shall be the administrative judge of the court. He or she shall be the head of the court and have supervision and control of the calendars and of the assignment of the justices.”', '-3- justice’s findings of fact unless it can be shown that he or she has overlooked or misconceived relevant and material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Valerie contends that a decision was improperly rendered on the motion for clarification before she was able to enter evidence. However, after a thorough review of the record in this case, it is clear to this Court that she never asked the Family Court justice presiding over the motion for clarification for an evidentiary hearing; nor did she ask to make an offer of proof, despite the fact that the Family Court justice specifically asked if she had anything that she “wish[ed] to present.” Valerie makes an additional claim that the order clarifying the division of assets varied from what the Family Court justice stated from the bench; however, this Court perceives no material difference between the bench decision and the order. We would add that the Family Court justice expressly approved the order as being in accordance with his bench decision after hearing argument from both parties on the subject.', 'With respect to any challenge by Valerie on appeal to the actual substance of the order clarifying the division of assets, we once again find her assertions unpersuasive. The decision on the motion for clarification simply reflected what was decided as a part of the original divorce. The transcript from the May 30, 2008 decision—which divided the parties’ marital assets as a part of the original divorce—indicates that the Family Court justice did, at that time, assign value to the businesses.4 As the Family Court justice recognized in his decision on the motion for clarification, he assigned a value to the equipment owned by the companies, a house titled to one of the companies, accounts in the name of the companies, and the companies’ goodwill. 4', 'We note that the Family Court justice, while ruling on the motion for clarification, stated the following with respect to the original May 30, 2008 bench decision in the parties’ divorce action: “The parties * * * rested at about 3:15 on a Friday afternoon, and I asked if I could reserve decision and work on the case and both attorneys begged me to issue a decision that day. I did. I took a short recess and came back on the bench and gave a bench decision * * *.”', '-4- Moreover, the Family Court justice, in his original division of assets and again when he clarified that division, stated that he was “assign[ing] 50 percent of [the assets] to each of [the parties].” It is clear, as a matter of fundamental arithmetic, that the total assets of the parties could only be divided on the basis of 50 percent going to Valerie and 50 percent going to William if William was awarded the businesses. Consequently, the ruling on the motion for clarification did no more than explicitly state what the Family Court had already decided; it did not break any new ground. Accordingly, it is our conclusion that the Family Court justice did not commit any error in issuing a decision on William’s motion for clarification. No argument raised by Valerie on appeal has convinced us otherwise.5', 'C', 'The Contempt Order', 'Lastly, we must address Valerie’s appeal of the order adjudging her in contempt. This Court has recognized that “[t]he authority to find a party in civil contempt is among the inherent powers of our courts.” Now Courier, LLC v. Better Carrier Corp., 965 A.2d 429, 434 (R.I. 2009). Therefore, “[a] hearing justice’s [f]indings of fact in a contempt hearing will not be disturbed unless they are clearly wrong or the [hearing] justice abused his or her discretion. * * * Nor will we substitute our reading of the evidence for that of the [hearing] justice if the record supports the hearing justice’s findings.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Valerie contends that the Family Court did not have jurisdiction to decide the motion to adjudge her in contempt because the two just-discussed appeals were pending in this Court; it is her argument that, under Rule 62 of the Family Court Rules of Domestic Relations Procedure, there is an automatic stay of all actions in the Family Court when an appeal is pending in this Court. We 5', 'At oral argument before this Court, Valerie’s attorney opted not to pursue his jurisdictional contentions.', '-5- need not even discuss that argument because this Court issued an order on August 16, 2012, remanding the case to the Family Court “for hearing on motions to * * * adjudge [Valerie] in contempt * * *.”', 'Valerie also argues that she should not have been held in contempt because the decision on the motion for clarification effectively reset the clock; she claims that instead of having three years from the final judgment of divorce to pay William what he was owed, she had three more years from the date of the decision clarifying the division of assets. Since the decision clarifying the division of assets was simply a more explicit statement of what was set forth in the original final judgment of divorce, this argument is also unavailing.', 'Valerie makes yet another argument to the effect that it was improper for the Chief Judge to require that she pay interest, given that the original final judgment of divorce did not provide for interest. However, it is plainly within the discretion of the court, in ruling on a motion to adjudge a party in contempt, to impose interest; such interest was to compensate the opposing party and ensure compliance with the order of the court. See Trahan v. Trahan, 455 A.2d 1307, 1312 (R.I. 1983) (“[T]he majority rule is that the amount of a fine imposed in a contempt proceeding may be the actual damage sustained by the injured party. * * * Therefore, in order to indemnify the aggrieved party, interest may be awarded as part of the fine where necessary to compensate the injured party for waiting for funds to which he was entitled.”); see also Pontbriand v. Pontbriand, 622 A.2d 482, 486 (R.I. 1993) (“A contempt order * * * relates to the power of the Family Court to vindicate the authority of its decrees by coercing a respondent into obedience thereto.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). The interest awarded in the context of the motion to adjudge Valerie in contempt is unrelated to any interest which may or may not have been awarded in a final judgment of divorce.', '-6-', 'Accordingly, we are not favorably impressed by any of Valerie’s arguments on appeal with respect to the motion to adjudge her in contempt. She consented to the entry of that final judgment of divorce, and she has admitted that she owed William certain sums of money pursuant to the final judgment. She simply quibbles as to when payment of those funds was due. However, given the fact that she was found in contempt over three years after the final judgment of divorce (in which she was granted only three years within which to take the actions ordered), we are all the more convinced that the Chief Judge did not abuse her discretion in holding Valerie in contempt. We would note, as well, that the Chief Judge made explicit and numerous findings with regard to Valerie’s unclean hands, “vengeful” attitude, “manufactured” testimony, dishonesty before the Court, and lack of credibility. Therefore, we perceive absolutely no valid basis, and Valerie has pointed to none, for disturbing the contempt finding. In fact, we are of the opinion that, in the instant case, the Chief Judge acted with a commendable amount of thought, dedication, and fairness.', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit in any of Valerie’s three appeals. Accordingly, we affirm the actions of the Family Court and order that this record be returned to that tribunal.', '-7-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Valerie L.

This case came before the Supreme Court on April 29, 2015, on appeal by International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Local 301 (union), from a Superior Court order granting the City of Cranston’s (city) motion to vacate an arbitration award in the union’s favor. The union asserts that the Superior Court justice erred in vacating the award and that the judgment should be vacated and the arbitration award confirmed. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'The material facts in this case are not in dispute. On August 20, 1990, Officer Tori-Lynn Heaton (Officer Heaton) was hired as a civilian dispatcher for the city. On June 6, 1994, Officer Heaton became a police officer. In 1995, approximately one year after she was hired as a police officer, Officer Heaton opted out of the city’s pension system and into the State of Rhode Island’s pension system—the Municipal Employee Retirement System (MERS). The parameters and specifics relating to MERS were codified by the Rhode Island General Assembly in G.L. 1956 title 45.', '-1-', 'In 2009, Officer Heaton contacted the city, contending that she was eligible to retire on February 21, 2010, in accordance with the “round-up rule” in section 24.4 of the collective bargaining agreement (CBA). 1 The so called round-up rule allowed for “[a]ny year in which a[n officer] completes over six (6) months of service [to] be credited with a complete year of credited service.” Id. Accordingly, for pension purposes, this rule would allow an officer to retire with a full twenty years of service credit with only nineteen years, six months, and one day of service. On June 11, 2009, the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island (ERSRI) advised the city that, under G.L. 1956 § 45-21.2-5(8), 2 Officer Heaton was not entitled to credit for twenty years of service after completing only nineteen years, six months, and one day of service. 3 The city subsequently notified the union that Officer Heaton was not eligible to retire and receive her full twenty-year pension benefit pursuant to the round-up rule.', 'On September 9, 2009, Officer Heaton filed a grievance with the city seeking “[t]o be made whole in every way, but not limited to; being allowed to retire from the Cranston Police Department at 19 years, 6 months, plus one day * * * with [her] full 20 year pension * * *.” Officer Heaton alleged that she was entitled to the credit in accordance with the round-up rule, as specified in the CBA and a memorandum of agreement (MOA) dated July 26, 2000, and entered into between the city and the union. The city denied the grievance on the basis that ERSRI “is 1', 'Officer Heaton was the first officer who opted into MERS and sought to take advantage of the round-up rule. 2', 'General Laws 1956 § 45-21.2-5(8), as amended by P.L. 2007, ch. 482, § 2 states the following:', '“Any member of the Cranston police department hired after July 1, 1995,', 'or any member of the Cranston police department with five (5) years or less of', 'service effective July 1, 1995, may retire pursuant to this subdivision upon written', 'application to the board * * * provided, that the member at the specified time for', 'retirement has earned a service retirement allowance of fifty percent (50%) of', 'final compensation for at least twenty (20) years service * * *.” 3', 'ERSRI administers municipal pensions under MERS.', '-2- governed by [t]itles 36 and 45 of the Rhode Island General Laws * * *, and, as such, supersede[s] any local ordinances and/or memorandums.” Specifically, § 45-21.2-22(1)—which governs the years of service necessary to retire under MERS—states that “[a]ny member may retire pursuant to this section upon his or her written application to the board stating * * * [he or she] has completed at least twenty (20) years of total service * * *.” The city determined that, according to state law, Officer Heaton must complete the full twenty years of service to be eligible for her pension.', 'Although she pursued her grievance all the way to arbitration, Officer Heaton nonetheless elected to serve the full twenty years rather than risk any adverse consequences to her pension. As a result, she deferred her retirement until August 20, 2010. At the arbitration hearing, the issue in dispute was framed as follows: “Did the City violate the [CBA] when it refused to credit [Officer] Heaton with a year of service for pension purposes, notwithstanding that she had not completed a full year of service for the period immediately preceding the requested retirement?” 4 The union asserted that the contractual agreement between the parties was clear and unambiguous and that the benefits in the city’s pension system—which included the round-up rule—had been promised to the employees who opted into the state’s pension system (MERS), and were promised again in subsequent agreements. The union pointed to three sources that purportedly transferred the city’s pension benefit plan to MERS, while specifically preserving 4', 'At oral argument, the parties were at a loss as to explain whether a remedy had been requested, and if not, why not.', '-3- the round-up rule: the CBA, 5 the MOA, 6 and a Cranston City Ordinance. 7 In response, the city asserted that the “failure to include [the round-up] rule in the special [s]tate statute[ 8] authorizing the City to participate in MERS is fatal to the Union’s case” because, according to the city, “[i]n the absence of such a rule in the special legislation, the remaining provisions of the [s]tate 5', 'The relevant portion of section 24.4 of the CBA states: “Vested members shall in both plans earn a pension payment of two and one-half (2 1/2) percent per year of service * * *.

Specifically, § 45-21.2-5(8) states:', '“Any member of the Cranston police department hired after July 1, 1995,', 'or any member of the Cranston police department with five (5) years or less of', 'service effective July 1, 1995, may retire pursuant to this subdivision upon written', 'application to the board * * * provided, that the member at the specified time for', 'retirement has earned a service retirement allowance of fifty percent (50%) of', 'final compensation for at least twenty (20) years service * * *.” This provision was enacted in 1996. P.L. 1996, ch. 374, § 1. Also, § 45-21.2-22(1) states that “[a]ny member may retire pursuant to this section upon his or her written application to the board stating * * * [he or she] has completed at least twenty (20) years of total service * * *.”', '-4- statutes remain applicable” and those provisions clearly and explicitly provide that “eligibility for a state- administered pension under MERS requires a full 20 years of service.” Therefore, the city asserted that it was correct in notifying Officer Heaton that she was not eligible to retire and qualify for a pension with less than twenty years of service.', 'The arbitrator issued a written decision. First, he conducted a contractual analysis into whether the city had violated the CBA when it concluded that Officer Heaton could not reap the benefit of the round-up rule and receive her pension after completing nineteen years, six months, and one day of service. The arbitrator determined that, when the union and the city reached their agreement to transition employees into MERS, “they explicitly agreed that the pension rights of unit members would have three sources[,]” the CBA, city ordinances, and state statutes. Therefore, the arbitrator found that, “[e]ven though the [round-up rule] benefit was omitted from the [statute], the City remains contractually obligated to provide that benefit to unit members,” pursuant to the CBA, “as well as the broad language of the [MOA],” which the arbitrator declared was incorporated by reference into the CBA.', 'Next, the arbitrator conducted a statutory analysis. The arbitrator noted that, although it was with “trepidation” that he “enter[ed] the world of statutory interpretation[,]” he nonetheless proceeded to conduct his own analysis into whether the contractual obligations of the city violated any state law. According to the arbitrator, because the round-up rule “may be provided by ERSRI via special legislation, there appears to be no reason why it may not be provided by a municipality, such as [the city], on the basis of an independent contractual commitment.” The arbitrator determined that', '-5-', '“[t]he City’s arrangements with ERSRI are based upon the', 'Cranston special legislation, rather than a private contract.', 'However, due to the omission of one of the agreed-upon benefits', 'from the legislation (the ‘round-up’ rule), the City stands as a self-', 'insurer as to that benefit.” The arbitrator declared that the city “must either provide the benefit, on its own, or, it may endeavor to secure an amendment of the special legislation to include that benefit.”', 'The arbitrator concluded that the round-up rule did not directly conflict with § 45-21.2-22—which allows for retirement only after a member “has completed at least twenty (20) years of total service”—because he was “unable to see how any state pension statute is violated by requiring the City to honor this portion of its agreement with the Union,” concluding, therefore, that the city “violated the ‘round-up’ rule of the contract when it declined to credit [Officer Heaton] with a full additional year of service on or about February 21, 2010 * * *.”', 'The arbitrator also declared that there was no remedy available to the grievant because she in fact completed a full twenty years of service before she retired. He noted that, because Officer Heaton was not “certain of the outcome of her grievance * * * [and] work[ed] the extra six months or so[,] * * * she will have to be content with knowing that ‘she was right’ and/or that she made it easier for the next generation of similarly-situated employees to retire under the ‘round-up’ rule.” Specifically, the arbitrator stated that Officer Heaton “will have to be content with the ‘declaration of rights’ provided in the foregoing portions of this opinion.” In essence, because there never was a remedy available to the grievant in this case, the arbitrator transmuted the arbitration award into a declaratory judgment.', 'On September 18, 2012, the city filed a motion to vacate the arbitration award in Superior Court, asserting that the arbitrator had exceeded his authority. On February 14, 2013, the union', '-6- responded and objected to the city’s motion. 9 After a hearing before the Superior Court, the trial justice, in a written decision, concluded that the award was irrational and that the arbitrator exceeded his authority when he fashioned an award on a dispute that was not arbitrable. Accordingly, the trial justice granted the city’s motion to vacate. The union appeals.', 'Issues on Appeal', 'Before this Court, the union assigns error to the trial justice’s conclusion on the following grounds: (1) the trial justice erred because there is no direct conflict between the MERS statute and the city’s CBA; (2) the trial justice improperly substituted his judgment for that of the arbitrator; and (3) the trial justice misinterpreted the remedy given in the arbitration decision. In response, the city contends that the trial justice did not err and that his decision must be affirmed because: (1) the arbitrator exceeded his authority in deciding an issue not submitted to him; (2) the arbitrator exceeded his authority by “effectively adding terms to the parties’ CBA to remedy the issue that he improperly decided”; and (3) the arbitrator rendered an illegal award.', 'Standard of Review', '“Generally, ‘[a]bsent a manifest disregard of a contractual provision or a completely irrational result,’ the award of an arbitrator will be upheld.” State (Department of Administration) v.

Although no remedy was available in this case, we nonetheless are satisfied that in the context of this case, the dispute warrants our review.

The trial justice correctly observed that “[t]he reasoning behind this rule is that ‘in a CBA, governmental employers may not bargain away authority that has already been delegated to management or to other governmental agents by state law or other paramount public policy.’” The trial justice found that there was “a direct', '- 10 - conflict between the round-up rule and state law” because the authority to determine what constitutes a year of service is statutorily assigned to a state agency. He held “that the round-up rule in the CBAs contravenes state law and, consequently, the arbitrator’s decision to the contrary was patently irrational and exceeded his authority.” The trial justice found that the round-up rule:', '“specifically provides that, for the purposes of determining', 'credited service for a pension, any year in which more than six', 'months have been served will be considered a complete year of', 'service. However, § 45-21-14 specifically provides ‘[t]he', 'retirement board fixes and determines, by appropriate rules and', 'regulations, how much service in any year is equivalent to a year', 'of service.’ (Emphasis added.)” Significantly, the trial justice held that “[t]he City and the Union cannot dictate what amount of time served in a year will be credited as a year when that duty is given to the retirement board. Allowing anyone but the retirement board to make such a determination would be in direct conflict with § 45-21-14.” The trial justice also held that “[i]n addition to contravening the [s]tate’s right to determine how much service in a year will be deemed a year of service, the round-up rule, and the [a]ward enforcing it, further contravene state law because they are in direct conflict with §§ 45-21.2-22 * * * (1) and 45-21.2- 5* * * (8).” Specifically, he stated:', '“Section 45-21.2-22 * * * (1) allows local legislative bodies of', 'cities and towns to permit the retirement of a member of MERS,', 'provided that the member has completed at least twenty years of', 'total service. The special legislation passed by the General', 'Assembly to incorporate Cranston police officers into MERS, as', 'codified in § 45-21.2-5, also states that any member of the', 'Cranston Police Department may retire under MERS, provided he', 'or she has earned a service retirement allowance for twenty years', 'of service. However, the round-up rule would allow retirement at', 'only nineteen years, six months, and one day.

Pawtucket Teachers Alliance, 610 A.2d 1104, 1106 (R.I. 1992). In Pawtucket School Committee, a union sought to arbitrate whether a school committee violated a collective-bargaining agreement when, after a full hearing, the school committee voted to change a student’s biology grade. Id. at 1105. We held that “[t]he union’s claim of right under the collective-bargaining agreement to seek, by arbitration, relief from the school committee’s decision to change the student’s grade directly conflicts with a statutorily created right” because “[u]nder [G.L. 1956] § 16-39-2 the commissioner, not an arbitrator, has the power to provide relief from the school committee’s decision to change the student’s grade.” Pawtucket School Committee, 610 A.2d at 1107.', 'Further, we also have declared that “labor disputes and grievances that seek to modify applicable state law are not subject to arbitration because the arbitrator has no power to do so even if the parties to a CBA have [allegedly] agreed to such a modification * * *.” Rhode Island Alliance of Social Services Employees, Local 580, SEIU, 747 A.2d at 469.', 'Although we have recognized that cities and towns may enter into contracts designed to give greater benefits than state law provides, that authority is not without limitation. See Chester v. aRusso, 667 A.2d 519, 522 (R.I. 1995) (stating that the Court does not “prohibit parties from entering into a legally enforceable contract that provides greater benefits than are set out in the relevant statute”). Cities and towns may not contract to provide benefits that conflict with state law or seek to usurp authority that is vested in a state agency.', 'Before this Court, the union asserts that the dispute is arbitrable because, it contends,', '- 12 - there is no direct conflict between the MERS statute and the CBA, MOA, and Cranston City Ordinance. The union asserts that, “given that the statute concerning computation of a year of service does not contain a term that prohibits or is inconsistent with the round-up rule, it certainly cannot be a source of a ‘direct conflict’ * * *.” The union also argues that the trial justice improperly confused the concepts of “work” and “service credit,” asserting that “there is nothing within the retirement system that indicates that a year of service always means a full year of actual worked performed * * *.” According to the union, “the round-up rule cannot be inconsistent with MERS if the rule itself is permitted for other participants.” This argument misses the mark. We are not confronted with a statutory prohibition, but rather a statutory requirement of twenty years of service and an allocation of authority to a state agency to determine what constitutes a year of service. 10', 'The dispute before the Court centers on § 45-21.2-22, under which an employee in MERS will be eligible for a pension after completing twenty years of service. The round-up rule, cited in the CBA, MOA, and Cranston City Ordinance purports to define twenty years of service as anything more than nineteen years, six months and one day and provides that an employee is eligible for a pension after completing less than twenty years, in direct contravention of the statute. In 1995, Officer Heaton made the decision to opt into MERS. Section 45-21.2- 5(8) was enacted in 1996 and did not provide for the round-up rule for purposes of calculating retirement eligibility. Neither the city nor the union had any authority to adopt a contract provision, an MOA, or an ordinance that was in conflict with state law. See Pawtucket School Committee, 610 A.2d at 1106 (noting that state statutes preempt ordinances and contracts). 10', 'General Laws 1956 § 45-21-14(a) states that “[t]he retirement board fixes and determines, by appropriate rules and regulations, how much service in any year is equivalent to a year of service * * *.”', '- 13 -', 'Finally, we recognize that the General Assembly has enacted other legislation that included the round-up rule in limited circumstances. 11 We are of the opinion that, by adopting the round-up rule for some, but not all, members of the retirement system, the General Assembly elected to define a year of service for certain retirees and not for anyone in MERS; that authority remains with the retirement board. See G.L. 1956 § 45-21-14. The city is not a self-insurer for this computation. Therefore, the decision of the arbitrator that a MERS member can utilize provisions in the CBA that contradict state law was improper and exceeded his authority and properly was vacated.', 'Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the trial justice’s decision was correct, and we affirm it.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.

The defendant, Raymond A. Peltier (defendant or Peltier), appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury trial of one count of simple domestic assault. The trial justice subsequently denied the defendant’s motion for a new trial and sentenced Peltier to one year’s probation. Before this Court, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he allowed into evidence the fact that Peltier resisted arrest in this case, a complaint to which the defendant had entered a plea of nolo contendere immediately before the start of trial. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. We affirm the judgment of conviction entered by the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'A criminal complaint was filed against Peltier on September 19, 2012. After a bench trial in District Court, defendant was found guilty of one count of simple domestic assault and one count of resisting arrest. The defendant appealed these convictions to the Superior Court and exercised his right to a jury trial.', 'Prior to the commencement of the jury trial in Superior Court, Peltier entered a plea of nolo contendere to the complaint of resisting arrest. The trial justice continued the matter for sentencing after accepting the plea. During the course of the prosecutor’s opening statements, defense counsel objected and moved for a mistrial when the prosecutor referenced the resisting arrest. The defense counsel contended that this was evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts by defendant that was irrelevant and inadmissible in accordance with Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. The trial justice overruled defense counsel’s objection and denied his motion for a mistrial. The record of this case discloses that defense counsel was notified of the state’s intention to introduce evidence that Peltier resisted arrest before defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere.', 'The state first called the complaining witness, Kelly Thurber (Thurber), to testify. Thurber recounted that she had known Peltier for almost twenty years and that he is her daughter’s father.', 'Thurber testified that Peltier typically cared for their daughter on Wednesdays. Thurber stated that on Tuesday, September 18, 2012, she attempted, without success, to call Peltier numerous times in order to finalize their plans for the next morning. Thurber testified that on the morning of Wednesday, September 19, 2012, when Peltier did not come to pick up their daughter, she first called defendant repeatedly and then drove to his home in West Warwick with the child. At approximately 8 a.m., Thurber and her daughter walked up', '-2- a flight of stairs to Peltier’s second-floor apartment, and Thurber began knocking on the window and door. After about five minutes, Peltier answered the door. Almost immediately, a verbal spat ensued. According to Thurber, when she extended her hand to separate herself from Peltier, she was pushed back by defendant and fell down a few stairs. Peltier then began to punch her and kick her. Once Peltier saw that his twenty-month-old daughter was crying and throwing herself on the floor, he abandoned Thurber and took the child inside his apartment. Thurber then called 9-1-1.', 'Officer Joshua D. Kennedy (Officer Kennedy) of the West Warwick Police Department arrived at the location, and Thurber recounted the events to him.', 'The second, and final, witness was Officer Kennedy. Officer Kennedy testified that at 8:16 a.m. on September 19, 2012, he was dispatched to defendant’s apartment for a domestic disturbance. Upon arriving at the scene, Officer Kennedy encountered a visibly upset Thurber standing in the driveway. Officer Kennedy called for backup when he learned that the child was inside with Peltier. Moments later three other officers arrived. Officer Kennedy testified that he made contact with defendant and told him to “calm down because he was pacing throughout inside the house.” Defense counsel interposed an objection on the same grounds raised during the state’s opening statement—that the testimony regarding the facts surrounding the charge of resisting arrest was inadmissible under Rule 404(b). The objection was overruled by the trial justice. Thereafter, Officer Kennedy testified that Peltier was not listening to the officers’ instructions and was breathing and sweating heavily. Peltier was then advised that he was being placed under arrest for domestic simple assault and domestic disorderly conduct. Officer Kennedy instructed Peltier to place his hands behind his back, but Peltier did not comply. As the officers began to place Peltier in handcuffs, he actively resisted and tried to pull the officers to the ground. Peltier continued his resistance as the officers walked him down the stairs, and at', '-3- one point he pulled all four officers against an adjoining building—causing one officer to fall down.', 'Throughout Officer Kennedy’s testimony, defense counsel continuously objected to the line of questioning detailing the circumstances of Peltier’s arrest, and he eventually moved to pass the case. After hearing argument, outside the presence of the jury, the trial justice denied defense counsel’s motion, but did grant him a continuing objection to that line of questioning. Additionally, after Officer Kennedy concluded testifying, the trial justice gave the following instruction to the jury:', '“[T]o the extent that you’ve heard testimony that on the morning in', 'question relating to Mr. Peltier’s, the defendant’s, alleged', 'misconduct during the attempt by the West Warwick Police to', 'investigate the complaint by Miss Thurber and to effectuate an', 'arrest, that conduct, of course, goes beyond the charge for which', 'Mr. Peltier is on trial here, which is, of course, simple assault,', 'domestic in nature.

During closing arguments, attorneys for both the state and defendant referenced the fact that Peltier had resisted arrest. 1 When the prosecutor suggested that Peltier’s “demeanor [was not that] of an innocent man[,]” defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the same grounds that he had previously 1', 'Defense counsel posited to the jury that:', '“Raymond Peltier resisted arrest. He did resist arrest. An innocent person may', 'very well resist arrest when they are falsely accused of a crime. Is it right? No,', 'it’s not right. Is it legal? It’s not legal. Does it mean he’s guilty of this? No. He', 'is not guilty of assaulting her.” Also, although Peltier did not testify at trial, defense counsel argued to the jury that defendant “resisted arrest because he was angry for being arrested for something he didn’t do.”', '-4- argued. The trial justice denied the motion. 2 Peltier was found guilty of simple domestic assault.', 'On July 22, 2013, defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied by the trial justice. Defense counsel indicated that one of the bases of the motion was the fact that the circumstances of his conduct in resisting arrest came before the jury and that he was “incorporating into my argument the arguments I made throughout the trial.” In response, the trial justice informed defense counsel that “the [c]ourt incorporates the rulings I made throughout the trial on those issues.” The trial justice then sentenced Peltier to one year of probation and required him to participate in the batterer’s intervention program and substance-abuse counseling and complete forty hours of community service. 3 The defendant timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', '“In reviewing the admission or exclusion of evidence, it is well settled that ‘[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is apparent.’” State v.

When performing this abuse of discretion analysis in the context of Rule 404(b), this Court first looks to the scope of allowable proof under the rule. See Clay, 79 A.3d at 838.', '“Rule 404(b) states that ‘[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of 2', 'Defense counsel also requested that another cautionary instruction be given. The trial justice declined to do so, stating: “I already gave them the instruction. I don’t want to insult their intelligence. I told them how to consider it.” Moreover, the trial justice instructed the jury during his charge that “remarks and statements or personal opinions expressed by counsel during the trial or during their opening statements and final arguments are not evidence and are not to be considered by you as evidence during your deliberations.” There was no objection to the jury charge. 3', 'The defendant was also sentenced at this time for the charge of resisting arrest. He received an additional consecutive year of probation, also conditioned upon his engaging in the batterer’s intervention program, substance-abuse counseling, and community service.', '-5- a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.’” Clay, 79 A.3d at 838 (quoting Rule 404(b)). Conversely, if the evidence is offered “for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident,” it is admissible. Rule 404(b). “This Court has stated that ‘[t]he admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of discretion is apparent.’” State v. Gautier, 950 A.2d 400, 411 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Brown, 900 A.2d 1155, 1159 (R.I. 2006)). “In reviewing a trial justice’s admission of Rule 404(b) evidence, this Court is ‘disinclined to perceive an abuse of discretion so long as the record contains some grounds for supporting the trial justice’s decision * * *.’” Clay, 79 A.3d at 838 (quoting State v. Ciresi, 45 A.3d 1201, 1211 (R.I. 2012)).', 'Additionally, “[e]vidence that may otherwise be admissible under Rule 404(b) is still subject to the Rule 403 [of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence] balancing test, which excludes otherwise relevant evidence ‘if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury * * *.’” Clay, 79 A.3d at 838. This is because “Rule 403 cuts across the rules of evidence and is always a consideration in a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence.” State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 152 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 148 (R.I. 2009)).', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant’s assignment of error solely relates to the admission of testimony and argument regarding the resisting-arrest charge to which defendant entered a plea of nolo contendere prior to the commencement of trial. The defendant argues that, because the assault on Thurber was completed at the time he resisted arrest, that evidence had no bearing on', '-6- defendant’s state of mind when the alleged assault occurred; he further argues that the two crimes were not so interwoven as to lead to the admissibility of evidence surrounding his arrest. Accordingly, defendant asserts that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial justice to allow introduction of facts relating to the resisting-arrest charge and that this error warrants a new trial.', 'Specifically, defendant argues that because the conduct in this case occurred after the alleged crime—as opposed to being evidence of a defendant’s prior conduct—it does not bear on the accused’s “motive, opportunity, intent, plan, common scheme, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake” when committing the charged offense. However, “we have treated the list contained within the second sentence of Rule 404(b) as examples, rather than a complete enumeration, of permitted purposes.” Rodriguez, 996 A.2d at 150.', 'Evidence of prior acts is admissible when the “prior acts are interwoven or in instances when introduction is necessary for a trier of fact to hear a complete and, it is to be hoped, coherent story so as to make an accurate determination of guilt or innocence.” Clay, 79 A.3d at 838 (quoting Rodriguez, 996 A.2d at 150-51); see also State v. Colangelo, 55 R.I. 170, 173-74, 179 A. 147, 149 (1935) (“[E]vidence of other acts * * * may be received when they are interwoven with the offense for which the defendant is being tried * * *.”). In this case, the record discloses that from the time Thurber arrived at defendant’s apartment until the time of his arrest, less than thirty minutes had elapsed. In State v. St. Jean, 554 A.2d 206, 209 (R.I. 1989), this Court held that evidence of acts which occurred twenty-three minutes before an alleged crime was admissible because it “demonstrate[d] that [the defendant] was in a particular frame of mind.” See also State v. Morey, 722 A.2d 1185, 1189 (R.I. 1999) (“Because the uncharged acts were related so closely in both time and place to the charged acts * * * committed by the defendant and were so intricately interwoven with the charged acts, their admission was proper.”', '-7- citing State v. Gomes, 690 A.2d 310, 316 (R.I. 1997); State v. Jalette, 119 R.I. 614, 627-28, 382 A.2d 526, 533-34 (1978)); and United States v. Wright, 392 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir. 2004) (“[E]vidence of [defendant’s resistance to arrest] prior to the discovery of the firearm gives the jury the body of the story, not just the ending. Such evidence was ‘inextricably intertwined’ with the charged offense.”). Simply because the challenged testimony occurred moments after Peltier assaulted Thurber does not change the fact that the acts were related “closely in both time and place” and were “intricately interwoven” with the crime on trial. See Morey, 722 A.2d at 1189.', 'Furthermore, this Court declared admissible evidence that is “related to the defendant’s consciousness of guilt with respect to the crime charged.” State v. Graham, 941 A.2d 848, 861 (R.I. 2008). In fact, consciousness of guilt is incorporated within the term “state of mind.” State v. Santos, 122 R.I. 799, 821, 413 A.2d 58, 70 (1980) (“This statement clearly manifests [the] defendant’s consciousness of guilt, which is incorporated within the term ‘state of mind.’” (emphasis added)). “[W]e have held that activities inconsistent with the defendant’s claim of innocence, such as flight, constitute circumstances bearing on the question of guilt.” State v. Acquisto, 463 A.2d 122, 129 (R.I. 1983) (concluding that threatening a witness had “independent relevance to prove a circumstance indicating consciousness of guilt on the part of the defendant caus[ing] it to be admissible in evidence”). We are satisfied that evidence that defendant resisted arrest likewise is indicative of his consciousness of guilt and is therefore admissible as evidence of an accused’s state of mind.', 'Although this Court has not had the occasion to address whether evidence of resisting arrest is indicative of consciousness of guilt, other state supreme courts have dealt with the issue. In State v. Williams, 919 A.2d 90 (N.J. 2007), the defendant was charged with reckless manslaughter in connection with a shooting death. Id. at 91. The prosecution sought to introduce', '-8- evidence of the defendant’s post-shooting cover-up, specifically hindering apprehension, tampering with a witness, tampering with evidence, and fabricating physical evidence. Id. at 91- 92. The defendant previously had been convicted of these charges in an earlier jury trial that had resulted in a mistrial on the count of reckless manslaughter. Id. The defendant argued that any post-shooting conduct would be irrelevant to the subsequent retrial on the singular charge of reckless manslaughter. Id. at 92. The New Jersey Supreme Court disagreed and concluded that conduct that occurs after the charged offense can circumstantially support inferences about the defendant’s consciousness of guilt. Id. at 96. Thus, the court determined that the defendant’s post-shooting conduct was admissible to demonstrate his consciousness of guilt. Id. at 96-97 (citing 2 John H. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law, § 276 at 122 (Chadbourn rev. 1979)); see also State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758, 769 (R.I. 2009) (“It is universally conceded today that the fact of an accused’s flight * * *, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself.” quoting 2 Wigmore, § 276 at 122 (emphasis added)); People v. Sustak, 153 N.E.2d 849, 854 (Ill. 1958) (concluding that evidence of resisting arrest was properly admitted as probative of guilt).', 'In the case before this Court, the responding officers initially were met with a distraught victim in the driveway of defendant’s apartment. The defendant was inside the apartment with his twenty-month-old daughter. When the officers first made contact with defendant, they were confronted with an agitated individual. When they attempted to effectuate an arrest, defendant actively and continuously struggled to thwart their attempts and resist arrest. The defendant continued his behavior even as the officers were escorting him down the stairs of his apartment building. This behavior is indicative of defendant’s consciousness of guilt. See Palmer, 962', '-9- A.2d at 769. The fact that resisting arrest is an independent criminal act does not negate the relevance of defendant’s action with respect to his state of mind at the time of the assault.', 'As we said in Acquisto, “a defendant has no right to be insulated from relevant truths ‘even if such truths might lead the jury to draw less favorable inferences concerning [the] defendant than if they were not exposed.’” Acquisto, 463 A.2d at 129 (quoting State v. Cline, 122 R.I. 297, 331, 405 A.2d 1192, 1210 (1979)). Additionally, “[t]he defendant is not entitled to a sanitized version of the state’s evidence against him [or her] * * *.” State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 468 (R.I. 2013). The defendant’s plea of nolo contendere to the charge of resisting arrest does not insulate him from conduct that is inextricably linked to the crime on trial. Criminal conduct need not be compartmentalized into separate categories; nor can a defendant choose which category can be excluded from trial by strategically entering a plea before trial. See State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 579 (R.I. 2009) (“A criminal trial is a search for the truth; it is not a game of chess.” quoting State v. Oster, 922 A.2d 151, 163 (R.I. 2007)). The defendant’s conduct in resisting arrest was relevant both because it was interwoven with the charged offense and because it was probative of defendant’s earlier state of mind. The jury could logically infer from such evidence that defendant’s conduct in resisting arrest was indicative of his consciousness of guilt. Allowing a defendant to preclude this relevant evidence by entering a plea of nolo contendere would be tantamount to allowing a defendant to sanitize the evidence that the state may present to a jury. See State v. Marmolejos, 990 A.2d 848, 852 (R.I. 2010) (declaring that the state has the right to present evidence establishing its case in chief).', 'The trial justice concluded that the evidence was admissible because it was interwoven with the charged offense, offered the complete story, and was indicative of the defendant’s state of mind the morning of the offense. Additionally, the trial justice in this instance offered a', '- 10 - cautionary instruction to the jury on the use of the testimony regarding the resisting arrest. “The Court presumes that members of the jury follow the trial justice’s instructions.” State v. Whitfield, 93 A.3d 1011, 1022 (R.I. 2014) (citing State v. LaRoche, 683 A.2d 989, 1000 (R.I. 1996)). It is our opinion that any prejudice to the defendant was cured by the comprehensive cautionary instruction issued by the trial justice, which was timely, appropriate, and a model of clarity. 4 For these reasons, we see no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s decision to admit evidence of the facts regarding the charge of resisting arrest.', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of conviction of the Superior Court and return the papers thereto. 4', 'In a passing reference, defendant contended that the evidence was admitted in violation of Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. We have consistently held that “[a] mere passing reference to an argument * * * without meaningful elaboration, will not suffice to merit appellate review.” State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n.19 (R.I. 2007) (citing and quoting Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n.1 (R.I. 2002) (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”)). Accordingly, defendant’s contention that the trial justice admitted the evidence in violation of Rule 403 has not been sufficiently developed for review by this Court. See id.', '- 11 -', 'Justice Robinson, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I am pleased to concur in the opinion of the majority to the extent that it holds that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting evidence of the defendant’s resisting arrest as constituting evidence of the defendant’s agitated state of mind at the time of the alleged assault. In view of the very close temporal connection between the alleged simple domestic assault and the act of resisting arrest, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in admitting the evidence for this limited purpose. However, I respectfully disassociate myself entirely from the majority’s statement that the defendant’s act of resisting arrest is “indicative of his consciousness of guilt” and its suggestion that consciousness of guilt and state of mind are largely indistinguishable concepts.', 'In the first place, I am both mystified and troubled by the choice of the majority to address an issue that is entirely unnecessary to reach—viz., the issue of consciousness of guilt. Significantly, there was no discussion provided by the parties to support any contention that defendant’s act of resisting arrest should have been admitted as evidence of his consciousness of guilt. Moreover, although the trial justice admitted evidence of defendant’s resisting arrest, he did so with an appropriately focused instruction, which simply directed the jury to consider the resistance as revealing defendant’s state of mind at the time of the alleged offense; the trial justice made no mention of consciousness of guilt. The trial justice’s instruction deftly and correctly straddled the competing interests at hand—allowing the prosecution to present its case in an understandable way, while simultaneously cautioning the jury not to draw improper and unjust inferences. As a result of that instruction, the jury had ample information upon which to reach a verdict without the necessity of considering whether the act of resisting arrest was somehow indicative of defendant’s consciousness of guilt. By unnecessarily addressing the issue of consciousness of guilt, the majority has disregarded our strong and oft articulated policy', '- 12 - favoring judicial restraint. See, e.g., Grady v. Narragansett Electric Co., 962 A.2d 34, 42 n. 4 (R.I. 2009) (explicitly adhering to “our usual policy of not opining with respect to issues about which we need not opine”); 1 Barone v. State, 93 A.3d 938, 939 n. 1 (R.I. 2014); State v. Keenan, 68 A.3d 588, 594 (R.I. 2013). It is especially disconcerting to me that the majority chooses to address this issue—which was not the basis of admission of the evidence in Superior Court according to the trial justice’s instruction—after expressly stating in its opinion that “this Court has not had the occasion to address whether evidence of resisting arrest is indicative of consciousness of guilt * * *.”', 'It is even more distressing that, in its entirely unnecessary discussion of consciousness of guilt, the majority seems to suggest that state of mind and consciousness of guilt are close to being synonymous. Unquestionably, when a person takes an action prompted by his or her consciousness of guilt, that consciousness of guilt can rightly be said to be part of that person’s state of mind. See State v. Santos, 122 R.I. 799, 821, 413 A.2d 58, 70 (1980). But state of mind is a broad and generic umbrella covering many different mental stances in addition to consciousness of guilt—including, simply by way of brief example, fear, jealousy, malice, or agitation. Moreover, a person resisting arrest could be in one of many different states of mind at the moment when he or she resists arrest. It is self-evident to me that, as a precondition to admissibility, there must be evidence from which a jury could infer that the state of mind of the person resisting arrest was consciousness of guilt and not one of the other myriad possible states of mind. 1', 'That “usual policy” of ours is consistent with the following jurisprudentially sage observation of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit: “Discretion is often the better part of valor, and courts should not rush to decide unsettled legal issues that can easily be avoided.” United States v. Gonzalez, 736 F.3d 40, 40 (1st Cir. 2013).', '- 13 -', 'Although I feel strongly that the majority has rushed in unnecessarily and imprudently in reaching the issue, in view of the fact that the majority has now opined that the act of resisting arrest is indicative of a consciousness of guilt in the instant case and not simply of an agitated state of mind, I feel compelled to forcefully state that the facts of this case do not lead me to draw the same conclusion. I am not even remotely persuaded by the majority’s argument, which in a conclusory manner treats the act of resisting arrest as the equivalent of fleeing from a crime scene. In reaching its conclusion, the majority cites two cases from jurisdictions that have addressed the issue, neither of which do I find convincing—viz., State v. Williams, 919 A.2d 90 (N.J. 2007), and People v. Sustak, 153 N.E.2d 849 (Ill. 1958). After thoroughly reviewing these cases, I am not at all persuaded that the act of resisting arrest as occurred in the instant case is indicative of consciousness of guilt. First, the defendant in Williams, 919 A.2d at 99, engaged in a cover-up after a shooting in which he was involved; the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that evidence of that cover-up was admissible to show a consciousness of guilt. In the instant case, however, without meaningful analysis, the majority treats defendant’s act of resisting arrest as somehow being factually similar to the cover-up in Williams and thereby deserving of the same evidentiary treatment. In Sustak, 153 N.E.2d at 854, the Supreme Court of Illinois admitted evidence of resisting arrest as being indicative of consciousness of guilt, but it failed to provide a meaningful explanation as to why the act of resisting arrest was actually demonstrative of that mental state.', 'There are myriad reasons, which the majority in the instant case does not acknowledge, and which Sustak, 153 N.E.2d at 854, does not discuss, that could inform a particular defendant’s resisting arrest, including that a defendant simply felt he was being unjustly arrested or because he harbored a deep and long-standing dislike for police officers in general. Therefore, in my view, Williams and Sustak are not instructive in the instant case.', '- 14 -', 'After long and careful perusal of the record, I can find no basis therein for the majority’s inference that defendant resisted arrest because he was conscious of his own guilt. Nor have we ever opined that resistance to arrest alone is sufficient to be indicative of consciousness of guilt. It is clear to me that a person may resist arrest for a variety of reasons unrelated to consciousness of guilt.', 'The majority cites to this Court’s opinion in State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758 (R.I. 2009), to support its contention that resistance to arrest is admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt in the instant case. 2 Specifically, it points to the following language in Palmer, which is actually a quotation from a treatise on the law of evidence:', '“It is universally conceded today that the fact of an accused’s flight', '* * *, resistance to arrest, concealment, assumption of a false', 'name, and related conduct, are admissible as evidence of', 'consciousness of guilt, and thus of guilt itself.” Id. at 769 (quoting', '2 John H. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law, § 276 at', '122 (Chadbourn rev. 1979)). I do not believe that my position is inconsistent with what this Court said in Palmer. The quoted language does not state that resistance to arrest, by itself, is evidence of consciousness of guilt. I readily acknowledge that resistance to arrest coupled with flight or concealment or such related conduct might, in a different case, be sufficient to be admitted to show that a defendant was conscious of his or her guilt. However, such facts are strikingly absent from the case at bar.', 'What the evidence in the record in this case does disclose is that defendant was in an agitated state of mind 3 while he was engaged in very actively resisting arrest just a very few 2', 'It should be borne in mind that the behavior of the defendant that was at issue in this Court’s evidentiary discussion in State v. Palmer, 962 A.2d 758, 768-69 (R.I. 2009), was his engaging in flight and concealment. 3', 'I note that the majority specifically recognizes that “[w]hen the officers first made contact with defendant, they were confronted with an agitated individual.” I have been unable to', '- 15 - minutes after the confrontation with his child’s mother. I perceive no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s allowance of evidence of defendant’s having resisted arrest in the agitated manner that was testified to—from which evidence the jury could infer that he was in the same agitated state of mind at the time of the temporally proximate alleged simple assault for which he was on trial. Indeed, it is clear to me that the only logical and proper inference the jury could have reached from defendant’s actions was that he was in an agitated state of mind, not that he was conscious of his guilt.', 'For the foregoing reasons, I concur in the judgment of the majority with respect to the defendant’s resisting arrest being admissible to show his agitated state of mind, but I respectfully, yet very vigorously, dissent from every jot and tittle of the majority’s discussion of consciousness of guilt. find in the record any evidentiary basis for a conclusion that defendant’s agitated state of mind and resistance to arrest are, as the majority states, “indicative of his consciousness of guilt.”', '- 16 -', 'Justice Flaherty, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the opinion of the majority in this case. I do so because it is my opinion that the evidence that defendant resisted arrest was admitted in contravention of the provisions of Rules 404(b) 1 and 403 2 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. For the reasons that follow, I would vacate the judgment of conviction and remand this case for a new trial.', 'Rule 404(b) Should Have Barred Admission', 'In my opinion, this case stretches, beyond its limits, the admittedly elastic characteristics of Rule 404(b). At trial, evidence of defendant’s resistance to arrest, which took place both after the alleged assault had occurred and after the complaining witness had left the scene, was admitted over defendant’s objection. The mere fact that defendant may have resisted the police’s efforts to arrest him fits neither into the illustrated examples that are delineated in Rule 404(b) nor the spirit of other permitted purposes. This evidence, I submit, is the classic type of evidence that Rule 404 deems inadmissible because it tends to shed light only on a defendant’s character or disposition.', 'This evidence invited the jury to reach the forbidden inference: because 1', ""Rule 404(a) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence stands for the general proposition that “[e]vidence of a person's character or a trait of the person's character is not admissible for the purpose of proving that he or she acted in conformity therewith on a particular occasion * * * .” Rule 404(b) sets forth:"", '“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character', 'of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.

This, in my opinion, is pure propensity evidence and it is exactly the type of evidence Rule 404 was promulgated to exclude.', 'In the majority’s opinion, the evidence of resisting arrest should be admitted because it tended to show a relevant fact, defendant’s state of mind, citing to State v. St. Jean, 554 A.2d 206, 208-09 (R.I. 1989), and because it tended to tell the complete story, citing to State v. Colangelo, 55 R.I. 170, 173-74, 179 A. 147, 149 (1935), and others. 3 There can be no argument that this Court has not been entirely consistent on the question of whether Rule 404(b)’s list of acceptable “other purposes” is exhaustive or not. Compare State v. Garcia, 743 A.2d 1038, 1050 (R.I. 2000) (noting the “general exclusionary rule of Rule 404(b)”), with State v. Rodriguez, 996 A.2d 145, 150 (R.I. 2010) (“we have treated the list contained within the second sentence of Rule 404(b) as examples, rather than a complete enumeration, of permitted purposes”). However, there is no question that this Court has invariably allowed evidence of other crimes or bad acts when those acts are “interwoven with the charged offense,” and when it would “allow a trier of fact to hear a complete and, it is to be hoped, coherent story so as to make an accurate determination of guilt or innocence.” State v. Gomes, 690 A.2d 310, 316 (R.I. 1997). 3', 'The majority’s opinion equates the term “state of mind,” with “consciousness of guilt,” to justify the admissibility of defendant’s alleged resistance to arrest. To support this, the majority cites cases, whose facts I believe are far removed from this case: State v. Williams, 919 A.2d 90, 92-93 (N.J. 2007) (after a homicide, the defendant attempted to make the scene appear to be a suicide and instructed witnesses to lie to police); and People v. Sustak, 153 N.E.2d 849, 854 (Ill. 1958) (the defendant fled police and entered a tavern where he drew a weapon and wounded a responding officer). Both of these cases involved intricate post-crime conduct that was deemed admissible under the guise of “consciousness of guilt.” While I need not agree or disagree with those holdings, it is my opinion their applicability to this case is marginal. Further, I agree with Justice Robinson’s separate opinion that this issue was not part of the trial record.', '- 18 -', 'In its opinion, the majority relies on St. Jean, 554 A.2d at 208. In that case, the trial justice approved the admission of evidence that, twenty-three minutes before an accident giving rise to a charge of reckless driving, an offense that has an element of mens rea, the defendant had been involved in a ‘“tire squealing’ episode,” and had come within inches of striking another vehicle. 4 Id. The Court reasoned that the temporally proximate prior incident was relevant to the defendant’s state of mind with respect to the charge of reckless driving. Id. at 209. Although this Court has never said that it is only prior bad acts that are contemplated by Rule 404, the timing should be a consideration in the analysis of whether evidence is relevant. In the matter before us, the fact that defendant may have resisted arrest after the alleged assault is, in my opinion, less probative of whether he was similarly agitated at the time of the alleged assault. As defense counsel argued to the trial justice, “[a]n innocent person who is falsely accused of a crime * * * sometimes resists arrest.” 5', 'Further, I am not persuaded that the state needed the evidence of resisting arrest to tell a “complete and, it is to be hoped, coherent story” of the simple domestic assault. Gomes, 690 A.2d at 316. The defendant’s interaction with the police happened after the alleged assault, after the complaining witness retreated to the safety of her car in the driveway, after she called 9-1-1, and after defendant had reentered his apartment. The jury had the facts before it necessary to determine defendant’s guilt or innocence of simple assault, G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3, without being informed that defendant had not cooperated with the arresting officers. At trial, the complaining 4', 'Mens rea, Latin for “guilty mind,” is “[t]he state of mind that the prosecution, to secure a conviction, must prove that a defendant had when committing a crime * * * .” Black’s Law Dictionary 1134 (10th ed. 2014). 5', 'The trial justice went on to reply, “[i]f that’s the case, maybe that’s an explanation that can be offered by the defense.” Defense counsel then correctly stated that “the defense shouldn’t have to [offer an explanation]”; however, once the evidence was admitted he felt obligated to address it. In closing argument defense counsel said, “[a]n innocent person may very well resist arrest when they are falsely accused of a crime.”', '- 19 - witness testified, as did the responding officer who testified as to the “red marks” he saw on the complaining witness’s “arms and her face.” There was sufficient evidence before the jury and, even if Rule 404(b) is best described as an inclusive rule, “it is not all-inclusive.” United States v. Briley, 770 F.3d 267, 276 (4th Cir. 2014) (holding that admission of evidence was error because “in this instance [the contested evidence] came too close to pure propensity evidence”). 6', 'Indeed, it is instructive to see how the state made use of the contested evidence once it was determined to be admissible; in my opinion, it was argued that this evidence reflected on defendant’s character. In the prosecutor’s opening remarks he referred to the resistance to arrest and said that it would show that on the day of the incident “[the police] met with a combative person,” and, in his closing argument, the prosecutor reiterated that this conduct showed defendant lacked the “demeanor of an innocent man.” It is my opinion that these remarks were intended to cast light on defendant’s character. Because this is prohibited by Rule 404, the evidence should not have been admitted.', 'Alternatively, Rule 403 Should Have Barred the Evidence', ""In a case where there was only one witness to the alleged assault, the complaining witness, it is my opinion that this evidence was enormously prejudicial and should not have been admitted under Rule 403. It is axiomatic that “Rule 403 cuts across the rules of evidence and is always a consideration in a trial justice's ruling on the admissibility of Rule 404(b) evidence.” State v. Mlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 997 (R.I. 2011) (quoting State v. Gaspar, 982 A.2d 140, 148 (R.I. 2009)). Here, despite defendant’s explicit and repeated arguments that Rule 403 barred any 6"", 'The majority cites United States v. Wright, 392 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir. 2004), but I do not believe that case supports its opinion. The defendant’s resistance to arrest is not a key piece of evidence that “gives the jury the body of the story,” it is instead the opposite; as Wright advises, it is “just the ending.” Id. (holding admission of contested evidence appropriate because it was not simply the end of the story but “inextricably intertwined”).', '- 20 - evidence of resisting arrest, there is nothing on the record that would support any conclusion that the trial justice performed a Rule 403 balancing test. Because we have consistently maintained that Rule 403 is implicated in a Rule 404(b) determination, it is my opinion that the failure to perform that analysis, in and of itself, is fatal. 7 See Mlyniec, 15 A.3d at 997.', 'It is my further opinion that, had the analysis been completed, Rule 403 nonetheless should have barred the admission of the contested evidence. Clearly, this is not an easy burden to meet. We have said that it is only “when evidence is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that a trial justice must exclude it.” State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 950 (R.I. 2008) (citing State v. Silvia, 898 A.2d 707, 717 (R.I. 2006)). However, we have held such evidence to be inadmissible when “its utility was clearly outweighed by the danger that it would confuse, mislead, and unfairly prejudice the jury.” Gaspar, 982 A.2d at 149. In Gaspar, we found that evidence of prior consensual sexual encounters had little bearing on an alleged sexual assault and it “was very likely to confuse the jury and invite an emotional response.” Id. Here, the defendant’s resistance to arrest cast very little light on whether he had earlier assaulted the complaining witness.', 'Instead, in my view, it encouraged the jury to make an emotional response, to associate the defendant with violent behaviors, and to agree with the state’s characterization of the defendant as a “combative person” who lacked the “demeanor of an innocent man.” In a case that featured limited testimony and very little physical evidence, the fact that the defendant may have been violent during the process of his arrest was, in my opinion, enormously prejudicial. 7', 'I disagree with the majority’s characterization that defendant did not properly develop his Rule 403 argument. From the record, it is clear that Rule 403 was raised and argued before the trial justice. Even though defendant’s written argument on Rule 403 before this Court was sparse, it was raised in his Rule 12A statement. See Article I, Rule 12A of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. Because the analysis of Rule 404(b) evidence is always bifurcated with Rule 403 considerations, I believe that it was sufficiently raised to this Court.', '- 21 -', 'For the reasons set forth above, I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion of this Court.', '- 22 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

18,:,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. This case is but another example of the great tragedy of child abuse that plagues our society. The respondent-father, Christopher Jimenez, was indicted for inflicting numerous injuries over the span of several weeks on his five-week-old daughter Christina, resulting in the infant’s death. In response to the allegations lodged against the respondent with respect to his daughter, the Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) filed a petition to terminate his parental rights to his other child, a one-year-old son named Kristopher.', 'After an eight-day trial, a justice of the Family Court terminated the respondent’s parental rights. The respondent timely appealed. The matter came before the Supreme Court for argument on April 29, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we conclude that cause has not been shown and we shall proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Family Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On August 23, 2012, DCYF filed a petition to terminate the parental rights of Mayra Gonzalez (Mayra or mother) 1 and respondent-father to their son, Kristopher J. The petition alleged two grounds to support the termination of respondent’s rights: (1) “The parents are unfit by reason of conduct or conditions seriously detrimental to the child, in that the parents have committed or allowed to be committed, conduct toward any child of a cruel or abusive nature,” and (2) that the father, specifically, was unfit because he committed a criminal act, namely the murder, manslaughter, or assault, of his daughter, Christina. However, because respondent’s criminal charges were still pending at the time of trial, DCYF withdrew the second ground during trial. 2', 'Trial on the Petition', 'In March and April of 2014, a trial was held before a justice of the Family Court. Eight witnesses testified during the trial: respondent, a first responder who treated Christina, a doctor who treated Christina at Hasbro Children’s Hospital, a Providence Police detective assigned to Christina’s death, three DCYF employees assigned to the family, and Mayra’s mother, grandmother to both Christina and Kristopher. At the time of Christina’s death, respondent and his girlfriend, Mayra, were the parents to two children, Kristopher and Christina. The respondent 1', 'Ms. Gonzalez participated in the termination process and was represented by counsel, but she voluntarily consented to the termination of her parental rights at a pretrial hearing on December 17, 2013. The respondent proceeded to trial, and he is the only parent before this Court on appeal. 2', 'On April 29, 2015, respondent’s counsel represented to this Court that the criminal matter stemming from respondent’s alleged involvement in Christina’s death remained in pretrial proceedings.', '-2- and Mayra shared, with their two children, one bedroom in a home on Congress Avenue in Providence. Mayra’s parents also resided in this home with their own children, Mayra’s siblings.', 'In the early morning of June 20, 2012, the Providence Fire Department was dispatched for an emergency call at respondent’s home in connection with a report of a child not breathing. Lieutenant Dennis R. Tucker of the Providence Fire Department testified that, when he arrived at the home, he observed respondent and the child’s mother in the driveway holding Christina in a blanket. When Lt. Tucker inquired of the mother what was the matter with the child, “she just said [Christina had] had difficulty breathing in the past.” At that time, the child had no pulse and no signs of respiration. Lieutenant Tucker testified that, based on his experience, it was his opinion that the demeanor of the two parents “was not consistent with parents whose child may or may not have died or would die in the immediate future.” Lieutenant Tucker immediately began performing emergency cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on the child, and the emergency vehicle transported her to Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence.', 'After Lt. Tucker completed his testimony, DCYF called respondent to the witness stand. The respondent was asked numerous questions about the events of June 20. However, beginning with the first question, respondent answered, “I would like to practice my Fifth Amendment.” The respondent would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege to refuse to provide self- incriminating testimony in response to each and every question posed by DCYF’s counsel, a total of sixty-seven times. At the outset, when it became clear that respondent would exercise his Fifth Amendment right, the trial justice asked respondent’s counsel if he had advised his client of the consequences he might expect, to which counsel answered, “I explained to [respondent] in this case, the [c]ourt could draw adverse inferences from his exercising his Fifth Amendment right. So, yes, he does understand that, Your Honor.”', '-3-', 'Doctor Christine Barron then testified that the infant came under her care when she arrived at the hospital. Doctor Barron, who is the director of the hospital’s child protection program, testified that the child was resuscitated and intubated upon admission to the hospital. However, from the time of her admission on June 20, 2012, until her tragic death, on July 7, she never regained consciousness. The injuries to Christina were so numerous that Dr. Barron testified, “I actually made a list of [Christina’s] injuries * * * because there were so many injuries, to make sure I did not miss any of them.” Chest X-rays revealed twenty different rib fractures, some older and some newer, at different stages of healing, which Dr. Barron testified could not have been caused by the CPR techniques employed by Lt. Tucker. The C.T. scans of the baby’s head revealed a large degree of soft tissue swelling, four skull fractures, and a subdural hemorrhage, which is bleeding between the brain and the dura, the brain’s protective membrane. Doctor Barron opined that these injuries, particularly the rib fractures, would have been “exceedingly painful.” Further X-rays showed numerous fractures, including to the left and right wrist, left lower leg, right ankle, right femur bone above the knee, and to the left pubic bone. Lastly, Dr. Barron noted a scar under the infant’s chin and severe retinal bleeding in both eyes.', 'In Dr. Barron’s opinion, these injuries could not be adequately explained by the medical history provided by respondent or the child’s mother to treating physicians. The medical records admitted at trial indicated that the mother suggested that maybe she and respondent “were burping the baby too hard,” and that respondent had said that “accidentally sitting on the child’s head or banging the child’s head against a piece of furniture or dropping the child accidentally” may have been the cause of Christina’s injuries. Doctor Barron dismissed these explanations, asserting that they were not at all consistent with the severity and the various stages of healing', '-4- that the injuries presented. The medical history also contained statements by the baby’s paternal grandmother, who lived in New Bedford, Massachusetts, but often saw her son, respondent, and her grandchildren. Doctor Barron testified that the grandmother had said, “[Christina] always seemed to be moaning, seemed to be in pain whenever [the grandmother] picked up [Christina] * * * [the grandmother] was constantly telling [respondent] to take [Christina] to the doctor’s,” but respondent and Mayra “never sought medical care for [Christina].” Doctor Barron testified that “[t]he injuries to the infant would have and should have been obvious to all caregivers because of her injuries, her multiple rib fractures would have caused what we call paradoxical crying. * * * [U]sually when an infant is crying, you pick them up to console them, and they console, but when children or infants have multiple rib fractures * * * they cry more when you pick them up.” Due to the seriousness of the injuries to Christina, and the fact that “Kristopher remained at risk if he remained in [respondent and his mother’s] care,” the doctors issued a “hold” on her brother Kristopher, and proceeded to examine him. Kristopher was examined at the hospital the same day Christina arrived, and he was found to have no injuries.', 'Next, Michaela Dolan, a child protective investigator for DCYF, testified about her interview with respondent at the hospital regarding the injuries to Christina. Ms. Dolan testified that respondent told her that “[h]im and his woman were the only two [caretakers of the children], that they don’t work, and that nobody else cared for the children.” When asked how Christina’s injuries had occurred, Ms. Dolan testified, respondent said that during a 4 a.m. feeding, “he dropped her, and her head hit the dresser on the way down.” Ms. Dolan said that this explanation “didn’t make any sense” to her because it provided no insight as to who or what caused Christina’s broken ribs. Ms. Dolan testified that she followed up on this line with respondent, who told her that “he lifts weights, sometimes doesn’t know his own strength * * *', '-5- like if [he] picked the baby up to curl her, he might have cracked her ribs.” Ms. Dolan further testified that there was a lack of consistency between the two parents’ statements at their respective interviews.', 'At the time of trial, the criminal proceedings arising from Christina’s death were continuing in the Superior Court and the trial justice explicitly made no findings regarding the criminal matter. 3 However, Kristopher had been placed with a nonrelative foster family, who had expressed a desire to adopt him. Tamara Guimond, a social worker with DCYF, testified that Kristopher had been in this same foster home since she first was assigned to the case. 4 In the care of this family, Ms. Guimond testified, Kristopher “has been developing and blossoming, flourishing, just really doing well in this home.” It was Ms. Guimond’s opinion that the best interests of Kristopher would be served if he were to be adopted by his foster family.', 'Decision of the Family Court', 'After hearing testimony from the witnesses, the trial justice took the matter under consideration and issued a written decision on May 23, 2014. In that forty-five-page decision, the trial justice made thirty-four findings of fact, by clear and convincing evidence, to support her determination as to the parental unfitness of respondent. The trial justice drew from the testimony of the witnesses, noting their credibility, and the adverse inferences she made against respondent, who chose to exercise his Fifth Amendment right and refused to answer any questions at trial. Specifically, the trial justice found, “Dr. Barron’s medical testimony, to be 3', 'The trial justice’s decision said, “[respondent] has been criminally indicted and is awaiting trial on charges relating to Christina’s death. The [c]ourt makes no findings regarding the [respondent’s] pending criminal matter.” See note 2. 4', 'At oral argument, Kristopher’s guardian ad litem represented to the Court that he remains with this family.', '-6- most compelling and extremely persuasive.”', 'The trial justice also “dr[ew] reasonable inference[s] from [respondent’s] testimony in light of all the other evidence.”', 'The trial justice found that respondent was the sole and primary caretaker of Christina on the night of June 19 and morning of June 20, when the infant was admitted to the hospital. The trial justice also found that it was “uncontradicted and clearly substantiated that Christina’s tragic death was a result of child abuse and was not caused by accidental means * * * .” These non- accidental injuries were also sustained at different times in the course of her short life. The failure to seek medical treatment for Christina “constitute[d] neglect and cruel and abusive conduct.” Specifically, the trial justice stated, “[a] caring parent would have known the source of [her] injuries or would have reported the source if he had not caused them himself or permitted them to happen.”', 'In making these findings, the trial justice relied on In re Chester J., 754 A.2d 772, 777-78 (R.I. 2000), and In re Frances, 505 A.2d 1380, 1384-85 (R.I. 1986), for the proposition that, even if respondent himself had not caused Christina’s injuries, because he and the child’s mother were the primary caretakers at the time of the injury, he was responsible for the unexplained injuries. Because respondent was found to be an unfit parent, due to the cruel and abusive nature of his conduct towards his daughter Christina, the trial justice concluded that the best interests of respondent’s son Kristopher would be served by a termination of respondent’s parental rights. A decree terminating respondent’s parental rights to Kristopher was entered on May 30, 2014.', '-7-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“When reviewing cases involving the termination of parental rights, this Court examines the record to determine whether legally competent evidence exists to support the trial justice’s findings.”', 'In re Chester J., 754 A.2d at 776 (citing In re Ryan S., 728 A.2d 454, 457 (R.I. 1999)). “Such findings are entitled to great weight, and this Court will not disturb them on appeal unless the findings are clearly wrong or the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence.” Id. (quoting In re Ryan S., 728 A.2d at 457).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, respondent argues that it was error for the trial justice to terminate his parental rights because, even though he concedes that the trial justice had “compelling evidence before her that Christina suffered fatal injuries,” she nonetheless lacked clear and convincing evidence of the culpability of respondent as the cause of those injuries. The process of terminating parental rights is not to be undertaken lightly, but it is our opinion that, in our deferential review of the record, we cannot say that the trial justice misconceived or overlooked material evidence in making her findings and ultimate decree. We shall address respondent’s argument below and note the reasons for which we must affirm the decree of the Family Court.', 'We have said that “[n]atural parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the ‘care, custody, and management’ of their children.” In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273, 1279 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 753 (1982)). Therefore, a parent has a right to due', '-8- process before the Family Court and may forfeit his or her parental rights only when the State can show by clear and convincing evidence that the parent is unfit. Id. Such a finding of parental unfitness is “the first [and] necessary step before any termination of parental rights can be initiated.” In re Steven D., 23 A.3d 1138, 1161 (R.I. 2011) (quoting In re Antonio G., 657 A.2d 1052, 1057 (R.I. 1995)). The authority to request a termination of parental rights is given to DCYF by statute. See G.L. 1956 § 15-7-7. When a termination petition is filed on the basis of § 15-7-7(a)(2)(ii), “[c]onduct toward any child of a cruel or abusive nature[,]” the statute dictates that “the department has no obligation to engage in reasonable efforts to preserve and reunify a family.” Section 15-7-7(b)(1). Finally, once a determination of unfitness has been made, “the best interests of the child outweigh all other considerations.” In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d at 1279 (quoting In re Destiney L., 21 A.3d 279, 283 (R.I. 2011)).', 'The respondent, quoting In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d at 1282, acknowledges in his brief that “cruel or abusive conduct towards one child in a household can serve as a basis for terminating a parent’s rights with respect to another child in the household.” The legal argument respondent makes instead urges us to consider a recent case from this Court in which we vacated, for insufficient evidence, a termination of parental rights: In re Adner G., 925 A.2d 951, 960-62 (R.I. 2007). The child in In re Adner G. had injuries that were not readily apparent, “not visible to the naked eye,” and “someone other than the parents had significant access to the child during the time when the injuries probably were inflicted * * * .” Id. at 960. Because of these facts, we said that it was not reasonable, and therefore legal error, to infer that it must have been the parents who inflicted or who allowed others to inflict the injuries. Id. But here, and in contrast to In re Adner G., the trial justice noted that Christina’s injuries should have been apparent to respondent. Indeed, respondent was told by his own mother that he should take Christina to the', '-9- doctor because there was obviously something wrong with the infant, and Christina’s paradoxical crying behavior should have raised a concern. Significantly, the trial justice also found that respondent was the sole and primary caretaker on the evening when Christina’s fatal injuries were inflicted. Therefore, this case is readily distinguishable from In re Adner G..', 'On the other hand, it is our opinion that the case of In re Chester J. is almost entirely on point. In re Chester J., 754 A.2d at 773. In that case, there was also horrific child abuse, and the parents “were unable or unwilling to adequately explain the massive trauma suffered by th[e] infant.” Id. at 777. We said that there was a reasonable inference that the parents caused or allowed the injuries to be caused to the child because the parents were the child’s sole caregivers. Id. at 778 (“As the parents and primary caregivers of [the child], ‘the law holds [them] to a greater level of substantial responsibility and awareness concerning the well-being of their children than it otherwise might in the case of an adult relative or a stranger.’”).', 'Here, respondent was Christina’s sole caregiver on the evening in question. The respondent was living and sleeping in the same room as Christina for the entirety of her life before her hospitalization, during the time when the medical testimony established that numerous serious injuries were inflicted upon the helpless child. There were no other caregivers and no daycare facilities in question. See In re Adner G., 925 A.2d at 954 (discussing the child’s daycare arrangements).', 'The trial justice’s findings that Christina’s injuries should have been apparent to her caretakers and that the respondent was the sole caretaker on the night of June 20 were critical in the decision to terminate the respondent’s parental rights.', 'We can glean no oversight or misconception of the evidence by the trial justice in her decision that these facts were proven by clear and convincing evidence.

The defendant, John Whiting, appeals from a judgment of conviction for felony larceny in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-41-1 and 11-41-5 and criminal solicitation in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-9. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The critical facts surrounding defendant’s convictions are not in dispute in this appeal. We therefore proceed to trace only the series of events necessary to the disposition of the legal issue at hand.', 'On November 22, 2011, defendant was charged by information with stealing over $500 in violation of §§ 11-41-1 and 11-41-5 (count 1) and soliciting another to receive stolen goods in violation of § 11-1-9 (count 2). 1 The information was later amended on May 11, 2012, to reflect the appropriate dates and locations when and where the alleged criminal activity took place. Subsequently, on June 8, 2012, the Governor signed into law an act amending § 11-41-5 to increase the threshold for felony larceny from $500 to $1,500. See P.L. 2012, ch. 176, §§ 1, 3. 1', 'A third count, soliciting another to obstruct the judicial system in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11- 1-9, was dismissed by the trial justice after the state’s case-in-chief.', '-1-', 'Soon afterwards, defendant’s case proceeded to a bench trial in the Providence County Superior Court starting on June 18, 2012, without either party or the trial justice being aware of the amendment to the statute. After the close of both the state’s and defense’s cases-in-chief, but before the trial justice rendered his decision, defense counsel apprised the trial justice of the amendment to the statute. Defense counsel then sought to have the larceny count amended and the solicitation charge dismissed or, in the alternative, amended. The state demurred, arguing that any change in the law should be applied only prospectively and that defendant, who had already been charged by the time the law was amended, should not benefit from the legislative change.', 'The trial justice agreed with the state and proceeded with the counts as charged. Both parties gave their closing arguments, and the trial justice rendered his decision from the bench on July 2, 2012.

Accordingly, the trial justice found that defendant was guilty of having committed larceny over $500 (count 1) and having solicited another to commit a felony (i.e., receive stolen goods over $500) (count 2).', 'Just prior to sentencing on September 14, 2012, the trial justice entertained a motion to reconsider his decision denying defendant’s request to amend the charges in light of the changes to § 11-41-5. The motion was denied, and the trial justice proceeded to sentencing. The defendant was sentenced to five years imprisonment, with six months to serve, the remaining four and one-half years suspended with probation on count 1, and the same sentence to run concurrently on count 2. 2 A final judgment of conviction was later entered, and thereafter defendant timely appealed. 2', 'The sentences were stayed pending appeal.', '-2-', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the legislative intent behind the amendment to § 11-41- 5, increasing the threshold for felony larceny from $500 to $1,500 was to reclassify offenses under $1,500 from felonies to misdemeanors. Further, he argues that the amendment was ameliorative in nature and should inure to the benefit of defendants, including those whose cases were still pending on appeal when the statute was amended. The state counters, arguing that the general savings clause, G.L. 1956 § 43-3-23, 3 permits the prosecution and sentencing of defendant in accordance with the pre-amendment version of § 11-41-5.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that “we review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.” State v.

Accordingly, this Court quashed the indictment.', 'In response to the application of the rule of abatement, the General Assembly enacted a general savings clause set forth in § 43-3-23. The effect of Rhode Island’s general savings clause was first examined in State v. Lewis, 91 R.I. 110, 114, 161 A.2d 209, 212 (1960). In Lewis, 91 R.I. at 112, 161 A.2d at 210, the defendant allegedly operated an automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of G.L. 1956 § 31-27-2 on May 22, 1959. On September 1, 1959, § 31-27-2 was amended. In light of this amendment, on September 23, 1959, the defendant moved to dismiss the case arguing that the provisions of the new statute were different from what he had been charged with and pointing out that the repealing act did not contain a specific savings clause. Lewis, 91 R.I. at 112, 161 A.2d at 211. The state argued that the amendment did not create a new and different offense and that, alternatively, § 43-3-23 authorized maintenance of the prosecution under the pre-amended form of the act. Lewis, 91 R.I. at 113-14, 161 A.2d at 211-12.', 'The Court found that the state’s second argument regarding the general savings clause was dispositive and therefore, only addressed that argument. Lewis, 91 R.I. at 114, 161 A.2d at 212. The Court stated that the purpose of a savings clause was to abrogate the common law rule of abatement such that a savings clause “authorize[s] the continuance of prosecutions that were pending at the time of the repeal of the prior act.” Id. at 115, 161 A.2d at 212. In particular, the Court stated that the general savings clause was enacted “to save the necessity of the burdensome formality of attaching an identical saving[s] clause to all repealing legislation.” Id. (quoting State ex rel. Ackerly v. Shepherd, 210 N.W. 476, 476 (Iowa 1926)).', '-4-', 'While we have recognized that certain ameliorative statutes may be applied retroactively, such retroactive application may occur only if applying the general savings clause “would be clearly repugnant to the express provisions of the repealing statute.” Lewis, 91 R.I. at 115, 161 A.2d at 212. We have further clarified that such a determination “should be considered on a case-by-case basis.”', 'State v. Mullen, 740 A.2d 783, 786 (R.I. 1999).', 'In making that determination, we must consider the language of the repealing statute and the nature of the amendment.', 'Additionally, we must always be cognizant of the general presumption that “statutes will be given prospective application unless otherwise provided.” State v. Briggs, 58 A.3d 164, 168 (R.I. 2013) (quoting In re Alicia S., 763 A.2d 643, 646 (R.I. 2000)).', 'In State v. Babbitt, 457 A.2d 1049, 1055 (R.I. 1983), the defendant was charged in January of 1980 with transporting another for indecent purposes in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11- 34-5. While his charges were pending, the statute was amended “by adding the requirement that the proscribed conduct be conducted ‘for pecuniary gain.’” Babbitt, 457 A.2d at 1055 (quoting § 11-34-5). Because the scope of the amended statute did not cover the defendant’s conduct, his convictions on those counts were vacated. Id. at 1056.', 'Similarly, in Mullen, 740 A.2d at 784, the defendant was charged with committing abominable and detestable crimes against nature “with mankind” pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-10- 1. While his charges were pending, the statute was amended to remove the “with mankind” component from the ambit of proscribable conduct, thereby effectively decriminalizing sodomy. Mullen, 740 A.2d at 784-85. On appeal, the majority4 held that “the trial justice was correct in determining that it was the manifest intention of the Legislature to decriminalize the act of 4', 'A vigorous dissent by two justices of this Court was put forth in State v. Mullen, 740 A.2d 783 (R.I. 1999). The dissent posited that application of the general savings clause would not have been “inconsistent with nor repugnant to the General Assembly’s manifest intention to decriminalize sodomy as of the effective date of the repeal * * *.” Id. at 787 (Flanders, J., with whom Bourcier, J., joins dissenting).', '-5- sodomy between consenting adults.” Id. at 786. Accordingly, the majority reasoned that it would be “inconsistent with the intent of the Legislature to prosecute acts that are no longer criminal offenses,” and upheld the dismissal of the counts arising under the repealed statute. Id. At bottom, the majority opined that it would be “fundamentally unfair to prosecute an individual for prior conduct that would now not constitute a violation of law.”', 'Id.', 'Unlike the circumstances in Babbitt and Mullen, here, at all relevant times, defendant’s conduct was, and remains, criminal. There was no intention to pardon the type of act committed by defendant.', 'The defendant’s reliance on State v. Macarelli, 118 R.I. 693, 375 A.2d 944 (1977), also misses the mark. In Macarelli, 118 R.I. at 694, 375 A.2d at 945, the defendant had been found guilty by a Superior Court jury of conspiring to corrupt horse trainers.', 'The underlying substantive offense, G.L. 1956 § 11-7-9 “Corruption of sports participant or official,” carried a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment or a fine of $1,000. Macarelli, 118 R.I. at 695, 375 A.2d at 946. Notwithstanding this maximum, the defendant was sentenced to five years imprisonment under G.L. 1956 § 11-1-1, which at the time provided:', '“Every act and omission which is an offense at common law, and for', 'which no punishment is prescribed by this title, may be prosecuted and punished', 'as an offense at common law. Every person who shall be convicted of any such', 'offense at common law shall be imprisoned for a term not exceeding ten (10)', 'years or be fined not exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000).” Macarelli, 118', 'R.I. at 695, 375 A.2d at 945 (quoting § 11-1-1). Section 11-1-1 is a catchall that preserves common law offenses thereby “mak[ing] every act which is an offense at common law punishable in Rhode Island.” State v. LaPlume, 118 R.I. 670, 678, 375 A.2d 938, 942 (1977).', 'At the time the defendant completed the unlawful agreement giving rise to the conspiracy charge, conspiracy was recognized as an offense at common law. See State v. Giorgi, 115 R.I. 1, 5, 339 A.2d 268, 271 (1975). However, because the offense had not been specifically codified, “an indictment for common law conspiracy could', '-6- be obtained only pursuant to the statutory authority set forth in § 11-1-1.” LaPlume, 118 R.I. at 678, 375 A.2d at 942.', 'In 1975, while the defendant’s appeal in Macarelli was pending before this Court, § 11-1- 6 was enacted by P.L. 1975, ch. 283, § 2 which provides:', '“Except as otherwise provided by law, every person who shall conspire with', 'another to commit an offense punishable under the laws of this state shall be', 'subject to the same fine and imprisonment as pertain to the offense which the', 'person shall have conspired to commit, provided that imprisonment for the', 'conspiracy shall not exceed ten (10) years.” Not only did the enactment specifically codify conspiracy offenses, but it also fundamentally altered the sentencing scheme for conspiracy prosecutions. In light of the enactment, the Court determined that “it is apparent that the Legislature thought it inequitable to punish a conspiracy to commit a crime more harshly than the underlying substantive offense itself.” Macarelli, 118 R.I. at 699, 375 A.2d at 947. Consequently, the Court reasoned that the defendant should be afforded “the more lenient treatment.” Id.', 'It is evident that our opinion in Macarelli hinged on equitable considerations unique to the circumstances present in that case. That is, the legislative judgment that as a general matter, it would be “inequitable to punish a conspiracy to commit a crime more harshly than the underlying substantive offense itself.” Macarelli, 118 R.I. at 699, 375 A.2d at 947. Such considerations are not present here, wherein the amendment in question concerns a mere increase in the monetary threshold. There is no general equitable principle embodied in the amendment. Neither was the amendment a seismic, qualitative shift altering the fundamental essence of larceny prosecutions such that applying the old statute would be “clearly repugnant to the express provisions of the repealing statute.” Lewis, 91 R.I. at 115, 161 A.2d at 212.', '-7-', 'Additionally, our determination that the amendment to § 11-41-5 should not be applied retroactively 5 is bolstered by our observation that recently, in State v. Kalil, 107 A.3d 343 (Conn. 2014), the Connecticut Supreme Court addressed a nearly identical issue arising out of facts substantially similar to the case presently before us. 6 There, the defendant committed larceny on January 27, 2009. Id. at 356. The value of the stolen goods was approximately $8,000, which at the time of the offense would have qualified as second-degree larceny. Id. Before the defendant was convicted or sentenced, however, the larceny statute was amended to raise the minimum value for second-degree larceny from $5,000 to $10,000, which would reduce the defendant’s crime from second to third-degree larceny. Id.', 'The court rejected the defendant’s argument that the amended statute should apply. Kalil, 107 A.3d at 361. The court noted that the amended law had an effective date after the time when the defendant committed the larceny. Id. at 360. Additionally, the court pointed out that the amended law did not contain “any express language in the provision referring to its retroactive application.” Id. at 360-61. Further, the court expressed its concern that inequities could result if defendants who commit crimes on the same day, but whose cases proceed to trial at different times, might be subject to varying laws. Id. at 359.', 'We find the reasoning of the Connecticut Supreme Court in Kalil persuasive, especially given the similarities to the case under review.

This case requires us to answer two questions of first impression relating to G.L. 1956 § 9-1-14.1(1), 1 which contains the statute of limitations for the medical malpractice claims of minors. The plaintiffs, Jean and Bunsan Ho-Rath, initiated a medical malpractice suit in 2010, twelve years after their daughter, Yendee, was born with a genetic disorder. The plaintiffs brought suit on behalf of Yendee against numerous medical organizations and professionals, alleging negligence in the diagnosis and treatment relating to Yendee’s genetic disorder. The plaintiffs also asserted their own claims for loss of consortium.', 'Certain defendants filed motions to dismiss, on the basis that plaintiffs’ claims were untimely pursuant to the applicable statute of limitations.', 'The Superior Court granted 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-1-14.1 provides in pertinent part as follows:', '“Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 9-1-13 and 9-1-14,', 'an action for medical * * * malpractice shall be commenced within', 'three (3) years from the time of the occurrence of the incident', 'which gave rise to the action; provided, however, that:', '“(1) One who is under disability by reason of age * * * and', 'on whose behalf no action is brought within the period of three (3)', 'years from the time of the occurrence of the incident, shall bring', 'the action within three (3) years from the removal of the', 'disability.”', '-1- defendants’ motions to dismiss, finding that all of plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the statute of limitations set forth in § 9-1-14.1 because they were filed more than three years after the incident that gave rise to the cause of action. In light of Yendee’s status as a minor, the hearing justice found that the tolling provision in § 9-1-14.1(1) would allow Yendee to file suit in the future on her own behalf upon reaching the age of majority. The hearing justice also concluded, however, that Yendee’s parents would not be permitted to attach their loss-of-consortium claims to Yendee’s future suit. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court granting defendants’ motions to dismiss. As explained below, however, we disagree with the hearing justice’s conclusion regarding the future loss-of-consortium claims of Yendee’s parents.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'This Court is familiar with the facts of this case, as pleaded in plaintiffs’ amended complaint, from our recent decision, Ho-Rath v. Rhode Island Hospital, 89 A.3d 806 (R.I. 2014) (Ho-Rath I). Jean and Bunsan Ho-Rath are the parents of Yendee Ho-Rath, who was born on January 9, 1998. Yendee was born with alpha thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder. On July 16, 2010, when Yendee was twelve years old, Jean and Bunsan filed suit, per proxima amica Yendee, against numerous parties, including Rhode Island Hospital, Miriam Hospital, Women & Infants’ Hospital of Rhode Island, and various associated medical professionals. The plaintiffs alleged negligence, lack of informed consent, corporate liability, and vicarious liability for injuries sustained by Yendee in connection with her genetic disorder. Jean and Bunsan also asserted individual claims against each of the defendants for the loss of consortium of Yendee. The plaintiffs alleged that, although genetic testing for thalassemia was conducted on Jean,', '-2- Bunsan, and Yendee’s older brother as early as 1993, defendants had failed to correctly test, diagnose, and treat plaintiffs, resulting in Yendee being born with a debilitating genetic disorder. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on September 17, 2010, in which they added additional defendants, including Corning Incorporated (Corning) and Quest Diagnostics, LLC (Quest).', 'On February 8, 2011, Rhode Island Hospital, Miriam Hospital, and four associated medical professionals 2 (collectively, RIH defendants) moved pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure to dismiss Jean’s and Bunsan’s individual claims, on the ground that these claims were untimely according to the applicable statute of limitations set forth in § 9-1-14.1. On February 28, 2011, Women & Infants’ Hospital of Rhode Island and three associated medical professionals 3 (collectively, W&I defendants) moved to dismiss plaintiffs’ individual claims as well as those brought on behalf of Yendee, also on the ground that these claims were barred by § 9-1-14.1. Quest and Corning also filed motions to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims, supported by the same reasoning.', 'The various motions to dismiss were heard together on June 27, 2011. The plaintiffs argued that, pursuant to § 9-1-14.1(1), Yendee’s claims could be brought at any time until three years after she reached the age of majority. The plaintiffs further argued that their individual loss-of-consortium claims were derivative of Yendee’s claims and that, therefore, they too were tolled pursuant to § 9-1-14.1(1).', 'Regarding Corning and Quest, plaintiffs argued that the applicable statute of limitations for these claims was set forth in § 9-1-19 rather than § 9-1-14.1. 2', 'These medical professionals are: Lewis Glasser, M.D., William Ferguson, M.D., Fred Schiffman, M.D., and B.E. Barker, Ph.D. 3', 'These medical professionals are: Calvin E.

The hearing justice determined that § 9-1-14.1(1) affords two options regarding the medical malpractice claims of injured minors. First, “an action may be commenced on behalf of the minor’s interest by next of friend within three years of the injury or reasonable discovery of the injury.” Alternatively, “the injured minor may commence an action on his or her own behalf within three years after reaching the [age of] majority.” The hearing justice found that, because plaintiffs had brought their claims more than three years after the most recent occurrence of alleged malpractice, these claims were time-barred by § 9-1-14.1(1). The hearing justice also found, however, that because no action had been commenced on behalf of Yendee within three years of the incident that gave rise to the claims, Yendee retained the right to file suit on her own behalf after reaching the age of majority.', 'Final judgments were subsequently entered in favor of the W&I defendants, the RIH defendants, Corning, and Quest.', 'The plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal; the W&I defendants, Quest, and Corning filed notices of cross-appeal.', 'The four appeals were consolidated, and the matter was assigned to this Court’s show-cause calendar.

We shall address each of these issues in turn.', '-6-', 'A', 'Medical Malpractice Claims Brought on Behalf of Minors', 'Section 9-1-14.1, the statute at issue in this case, was enacted in 1976. See P.L. 1976, ch. 244, § 8. This statute provides the following with regard to the medical malpractice claims of minors:', '“[A]n action for medical * * * malpractice shall be commenced', 'within three (3) years from the time of the occurrence of the', 'incident which gave rise to the action; provided, however, that:', '“(1) One who is under disability by reason of age * * * and', 'on whose behalf no action is brought within the period of three (3)', 'years from the time of the occurrence of the incident, shall bring', 'the action within three (3) years from the removal of the', 'disability.” Section 9-1-14.1. Also contained in chapter one of title nine of the General Laws is the general provision for the tolling of statutes of limitation for the personal injury claims of minors, which has been in existence, without significant change, for over one hundred years. See § 9-1-19; Bliven v. Wheeler, 23 R.I. 379, 380, 50 A. 644, 644 (1901). Section 9-1-19 provides in pertinent part: “If any person at the time any such cause of action shall accrue to him or her shall be under the age of eighteen (18) years, * * * the person may bring the cause of action, within the time limited under this chapter, after the impediment is removed.” This Court has previously held that § 9-1- 19 “operates for the protection of the minor” and that “the tolling provision obtains until he or she attains the age of eighteen years.” Rachal v. O’Neil, 925 A.2d 920, 924 (R.I. 2007). Thus, pursuant to § 9-1-19, a suit may be brought on behalf of a minor plaintiff in a personal injury action at any time until the minor reaches the age of majority, after which time the minor has', '-7- three years to file suit on his or her own behalf. 5 See Bishop v. Jaworski, 524 A.2d 1102, 1102- 03, 1104 (R.I. 1987); Bliven, 23 R.I. at 380, 50 A. at 644.', 'On appeal, plaintiffs argue that § 9-1-14.1(1) should also be interpreted to allow a tolling of the statute of limitations for malpractice claims until a minor’s eighteenth birthday. According to plaintiffs, “[t]he tolling provision of * * * § 9-1-14.1(1) identifies the maximum time limit on filing a minor’s claim for professional malpractice.” The plaintiffs further allege that “[n]othing in the statute states that a minor is required to wait until the ‘disability’ of age is removed prior to filing a lawsuit.” Thus, according to plaintiffs, § 9-1-14.1(1) allows a medical malpractice claim to be brought on behalf of a minor at any time before the minor reaches the age of majority, after which time the minor has three years to file suit on his or her own behalf. The plaintiffs therefore believe that their suit was timely because, although the suit was not filed within three years of the incident that gave rise to the claims, it was filed before Yendee reached the age of twenty-one. 6', 'The W&I defendants, on the other hand, argue that § 9-1-14.1 provides a limitation on the general tolling provision of § 9-1-19, and that this limitation requires any suit on a minor’s behalf to be brought within three years of the incident giving rise to the claims. According to the W&I defendants, plaintiffs’ proposed interpretation of § 9-1-14.1(1) renders it identical to § 9-1- 19 by allowing a minor’s suit to be brought at any time until he or she reaches the age of twenty- one. The W&I defendants further argue that, because Yendee’s parents brought a claim on her behalf more than three years after the alleged incident, “she is no longer entitled to take 5', 'Pursuant to § 9-1-14(b), the statute of limitations for personal injury claims is three years. 6', 'The plaintiffs do not dispute that this lawsuit was filed more than three years after the alleged occurrence of malpractice, nor do they contend that the discovery rule applies to their case. See § 9-1-14.1(2).', '-8- advantage of the tolling provision in § 9-1-14.1” and is, therefore, precluded “from being able to bring a claim on her own behalf after she reaches the age of majority * * * .”', 'We believe that the language of § 9-1-14.1(1) is clear and leads to only one rational result; nevertheless, we shall indulge in a brief analysis of this Court’s relevant precedent and the historical context of the statute in order to provide a backdrop for the holding that we adopt today. This Court’s most informative case to date regarding § 9-1-14.1(1) is Bakalakis v. Women & Infants’ Hospital, 619 A.2d 1105 (R.I. 1993). In that case, parents filed suit against medical professionals alleging negligent care at the time of the birth of their son. Id. at 1106. The suit was filed within three years of the son’s birth. Id. Subsequently, more than three years after the birth, the plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to add two additional doctors as defendants. Id.', 'The central issue before this Court in Bakalakis was “whether § 9-1-14.1(a)[7] allows a minor to amend a pending complaint to include new defendants more than three years after occurrence of the incident that gave rise to the cause of action.” Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1106. In order to reach this issue, however, we had to answer the threshold question of “whether the general disability tolling statute, § 9-1-19, affects or in effect supersedes the provisions of § 9-1- 14.1(a).” Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107. We held that, because the Legislature had not been silent, it had not intended § 9-1-19 to supersede § 9-1-14.1(a). 8 Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107. Next, regarding § 9-1-14.1(a), we opined: 7', 'The portion of the statute previously set forth in subsection (a) of § 9-1-14.1 is now set forth, in nearly identical fashion, in subsection (1). See Bakalakis v. Women & Infants’ Hospital, 619 A.2d 1105, 1106-07 (R.I. 1993) (citing § 9-1-14.1(a)); see also § 9-1-14.1(1). 8', 'Specifically, we discussed the holding in Bishop v. Jaworski, 524 A.2d 1102 (R.I. 1987), a case that was factually analogous to Bakalakis, in which this Court addressed the issue of whether the statute of limitations for bringing an action against the state pursuant to § 9-1-25 is tolled during a child’s minority. Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107. Unlike § 9-1-14.1, § 9-1-25 does not address', '-9-', '“The plain language suggests that if no action on behalf of one', 'who is under a disability is brought within three years of the', 'occurrence of the incident, then the statute of limitations is tolled', 'until the maximum of three years after the disability is removed. It', 'would also follow, then, that if an action is brought within three', 'years of the occurrence of the incident, the minor does not benefit', 'from the tolling of the provision once the disability is removed. It', 'appears to us that if the Legislature did not intend to limit a', 'minor’s ability to initiate medical malpractice actions, subsection', '(a) of § 9-1-14.1 would be unnecessary.” Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at', '1107.', 'The plaintiffs in Bakalakis argued that § 9-1-14.1 did not preclude the addition of the proposed two doctor defendants more than three years after the incident because no other action had been filed against these particular defendants; the plaintiffs maintained that these doctors could have been sued at any time until three years after the removal of the minor’s disability. Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107. We rejected this argument, noting that “the language in [§ 9-1-14.1(a)] is plain and compelling, and, to hold otherwise would bring about the unwelcome situation where the action brought within the three-year period would be merely preliminary to the main event when the minor brought suit on his or her own behalf.” Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107. Thus, Bakalakis stands for the following two propositions: (1) § 9-1-14.1(1) is not superseded by § 9-1-19 and is, therefore, the only statute of limitations applicable to medical the effects of any disabilities on the time periods set forth for bringing actions against the state. Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107. We quoted this Court’s previous holding:', '“Section 9-1-19 provides for tolling of statutes of limitation in', 'general. Since the Legislature is presumed to know the law, and', '§§ 9-1-25 and 9-1-19 are contained within the same title and', 'chapter of the General Laws, it seems likely that the Legislature', 'intended § 9-1-19 to toll the § 9-1-25 statute of limitations. If the', 'Legislature did not intend § 9-1-19 to affect § 9-1-25 it could have', 'easily provided otherwise.” Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107 (quoting', 'Bishop, 524 A.2d at 1104). We reasoned that, because the Legislature had not been silent in the instant situation—it had enacted the tolling provision in § 9-1-14.1(a)—it did not intend § 9-1-19 to supersede § 9-1-14.1. Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107.', '- 10 - malpractice actions; and (2) if a suit is filed on behalf of a minor plaintiff within three years of the alleged occurrence of malpractice, the plaintiff may not then add additional defendants after that three-year period has expired. Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107.', 'After this Court decided Bakalakis, we commented on the legislative purpose behind § 9- 1-14.1 in Dowd v. Rayner, 655 A.2d 679 (R.I. 1995):', '“Section 9-1-14.1 was enacted in 1976 * * * as a legislative', 'response to a medical malpractice crisis in the state. * * * Faced', 'with the crisis, the Legislature had legitimate interests in limiting', 'the number of medical malpractice suits but, at the same time, in', 'providing victims of medical malpractice with a fair opportunity to', 'have their claims adjudicated in the courts. In the case of minors', 'on whose behalf suit has not been brought within three years of the', 'alleged malpractice, § 9-1-14.1 permits such individuals up to', 'three years after reaching the age of majority to initiate a suit. This', 'provision ensures that minors are not disadvantaged by their', 'disability during minority. * * * The rational purpose of this', 'provision is the restriction of multiple suits or amended complaints', 'filed against additional defendants on a serial or piecemeal basis.', '* * * [T]he limitation applies only in cases where a suit has been', 'brought on behalf of the minor.” Dowd, 655 A.2d at 681-82.', 'More recently, in Rachal, we reaffirmed that § 9-1-14.1(1) is a legislatively carved-out exception to the general tolling provision for minors contained in § 9-1-19; under § 9-1-14.1(1), “a parent or next friend’s institution of a suit on behalf of a child for certain types of professional malpractice removes that child’s malpractice claims from the protection a tolling statute would otherwise offer.” Rachal, 925 A.2d at 925.', 'We further recognized that “[t]he Legislature specifically removed certain malpractice claims from the reach of § 9-1-19 when it enacted § 9- 1-14.1 * * * .” Rachal, 925 A.2d at 927. Thus, it is clear from our precedent that § 9-1-14.1(1) was intended to streamline the litigation of medical malpractice cases involving minors, and that this statute acts as a limitation on the general tolling provision for minors set forth in § 9-1-19.', '- 11 -', 'With this background in mind, we now hold that § 9-1-14.1(1) provides a minor plaintiff in a medical malpractice action with two options. First, the minor’s parent or guardian may file suit on the minor’s behalf within three years of the occurrence or reasonable discovery of alleged malpractice. Alternatively, if the minor’s parent or guardian fails to file suit on the minor’s behalf within those three years, then the minor may file suit on his or her own behalf, but not until he or she reaches the age of majority. Upon reaching the age of majority, he or she has three years within which to file the action.', 'In our opinion, this holding is consistent with the clear language of § 9-1-14.1(1), as well as with the well-established principle of statutory construction that we “presume[] that the General Assembly intended every word of a statute to have a useful purpose and to have some force and effect.” Peloquin, 61 A.3d at 425 (quoting Curtis v. State, 996 A.2d 601, 604 (R.I. 2010)). If we were to interpret § 9-1-14.1(1) to allow a minor plaintiff to have a suit brought on his or her behalf at any time through reaching the age of majority, there would have been no need to include the language “on whose behalf no action is brought within the period of three (3) years from the time of the occurrence of the incident.” Section 9-1-14.1(1).', 'Pursuant to plaintiffs’ proposed interpretation, this three-year period would be functionally meaningless; a parent or guardian could file suit on the minor’s behalf at any time until the child reaches the age of majority. 9', 'Furthermore, our holding is consistent with this Court’s precedent relating to § 9-1- 14.1(1), as well as with the legislative landscape as it existed when this statute was enacted. As 9', 'In an apparent effort to contend with our holding in Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107, plaintiffs assert that § 9-1-14.1(1) does act as a limitation on § 9-1-19, but only in the sense that when a suit is brought on behalf of a minor, the minor’s claims do not continue to toll for the purpose of adding new defendants. We do not see how this interpretation could reasonably be extracted from the language of § 9-1-14.1(1).', '- 12 - explained above, we have held unequivocally that § 9-1-14.1(1) acts as a limitation on the general tolling statute contained in § 9-1-19. See Rachal, 925 A.2d at 925; Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107. Indeed, if the Legislature had intended § 9-1-14.1(1) to toll the statute of limitations on a minor’s malpractice claim until he or she reached the age of majority, then this provision would be functionally identical to § 9-1-19, which already accomplishes the same result in a general manner for personal injury actions. When § 9-1-14.1 was enacted in 1976, the general tolling provision for the claims of minors set forth in § 9-1-19 was a longstanding, well- established law. 10 See, e.g., Bliven, 23 R.I. at 380, 50 A. at 644. Moreover, as explained in Dowd, 655 A.2d at 681-82, the Legislature was especially concerned during this time period with limiting and streamlining medical malpractice litigation. Given this context, we have no doubt that § 9-1-14.1(1) was intended to be “an express statutory exception” to § 9-1-19 rather than a mere redundancy. Rachal, 925 A.2d at 925.', 'Additionally, we are of the opinion that our present construction of § 9-1-14.1(1) provides the most sensible result in light of the dual purposes of this statute: to “promote certainty and finality and avoid stale claims,” while also “provid[ing] temporary shelter from those limitations for plaintiffs who cannot protect their legal rights while under certain impediments.” Roe v. Gelineau, 794 A.2d 476, 485 (R.I. 2002). The initial three-year statute of limitations in § 9-1-14.1(1) encourages the minor’s parent or guardian to file suit promptly upon the occurrence or reasonable discovery of alleged malpractice; this restraint serves the purpose of 10', 'In 1976, § 9-1-19 was substantively identical to its current iteration, except that the age of majority has since been changed from twenty-one years to eighteen years. See § 9-1-19 and reenactments of 1956 and 1985. Section 9-1-14.1(1) has also not been substantially altered since its enactment in 1976, save for changing the limitation period from two years to three, removing a provision that deemed the minor free from disability at age sixteen, and expanding the provision’s reach from solely medical malpractice to include legal, veterinarian, accounting, and insurance or real estate agent or broker malpractice as well. See P.L. 1988, ch. 392, § 1; P.L. 1984, ch. 236, § 1; P.L. 1981, ch. 101, § 2; P.L. 1976, ch. 244, § 8.', '- 13 - providing a fair but appropriately limited opportunity for the litigation of the minor’s claims. If the parent or guardian fails to file suit on the minor’s behalf, however, the three-year window opens upon the age of majority; this ensures that the minor is not permanently prejudiced by his or her parent or guardian’s failure to timely assert his or her rights.', 'Accordingly, we affirm the hearing justice’s decision granting defendants’ motions to dismiss plaintiffs’ claims brought on behalf of Yendee. We also agree with the hearing justice that Yendee may file suit on her own behalf after she attains majority. Pursuant to the plain language of § 9-1-14.1(1), Yendee is a minor “on whose behalf no action [was] brought within the period of three (3) years from the time of the occurrence of the incident.” Therefore, she retains the benefit of the tolling statute, which allows her to file suit on her own behalf upon reaching the age of majority.', 'B', 'Loss-of-Consortium Claims of Parents', 'In addition to the claims brought on behalf of Yendee, Jean and Bunsan have also asserted claims on their own behalves, for “the loss of services, companionship, comfort and consortium” of Yendee. The hearing justice dismissed these claims with prejudice on the ground that they had not been asserted within three years of the incident giving rise to the cause of action. On appeal, plaintiffs argue that their individual claims are derivative of the claims brought on behalf of Yendee and that, accordingly, the applicable statute of limitations is the same statute that applies to Yendee’s claims—§ 9-1-14.1(1).', 'Thus, plaintiffs argue, their individual claims should receive the benefit of the tolling statute and should not be dismissed.', 'The RIH defendants also assert that plaintiffs’ individual claims are governed by the statute of limitations set forth in § 9-1-14.1(1), but they argue that these claims were nevertheless', '- 14 - untimely because they were brought more than three years after the alleged occurrence of malpractice. According to the RIH defendants, “§ 9-1-14.1 applies to both Yendee’s and the Ho- Rath Parents’ claims, but with different results.” The RIH defendants assert that Yendee “can claim the benefit of an extended statute of limitations as set forth in [§ 9-1-14.1(1)]” because she is under a disability due to her age; Yendee’s parents, however, cannot claim this same benefit because they are not under a disability. The RIH defendants maintain that loss-of-consortium claims are “separate and distinct” from the underlying tort claims and that, accordingly, they must be analyzed separately for purposes of the statute of limitations.', 'The W&I defendants, for their part, also argue that plaintiffs’ individual claims are not tolled by § 9-1-14.1(1). The W&I defendants explain that because Jean and Bunsan are not disabled, they are “specifically excluded from the protected class of individuals by the clear language of the statute.”', 'Thus, the W&I defendants assert that for Jean’s and Bunsan’s individual claims to have been brought properly, they would have had to file suit on Yendee’s behalf, with their individual claims included, within three years of the alleged occurrence of malpractice. According to the W&I defendants, “[a]pplying a tolling provision that was intended to be used only by minors to adults is contrary to the explicit purpose of the tolling provision and allows stale claims to be litigated when adults have no impediment to bringing the claims at an earlier time.”', 'Pursuant to § 9-1-41, parents are permitted to recover damages for the loss of consortium of a minor child caused by tortious injury. This statute provides in pertinent part:', '“(c) Parents are entitled to recover damages for the loss of', 'their unemancipated minor child’s society and companionship', 'caused by tortious injury to the minor.', '“(d) Actions under this section shall be brought within the', 'time limited under § 9-1-14 or 9-1-14.1, whichever is applicable,', 'for actions for injuries to the person.” Section 9-1-41.', '- 15 - Thus, it is clear—in a general sense—that Jean and Bunsan were entitled to assert claims for the loss of Yendee’s consortium, and that these claims are governed by the three-year statute of limitations for medical malpractice actions set forth in § 9-1-14.1. What is not clear, however, is whether the tolling provision in § 9-1-14.1(1) applies to the parents’ individual loss-of- consortium claims as well as to the claims brought on behalf of Yendee. This Court has yet to resolve the specific issue raised in this case: whether, in a malpractice case, a parent’s loss-of- consortium claim concerning an injured minor child must be brought within three years of the incident giving rise to the cause of action; or, in the event that no suit is filed within three years, whether the parent’s loss-of-consortium claim can be brought alongside the child’s own claim within three years after the child reaches the age of majority.', 'A brief exploration of our relevant precedent provides useful guidance in resolving this question. In Sama v. Cardi Corp., 569 A.2d 432, 433 (R.I. 1990), this Court held that the enactment of § 9-1-41 did not alter the common-law rule that loss-of-consortium claims are derivative in nature and depend on the underlying injured party’s right to recover. We held:', '“[A]n action for loss of consortium under § 9-1-41, although a', 'separate cause of action * * * , is not an independent action but a', 'derivative one that is attached to the claim of the injured spouse. It', 'arises from the injured spouse’s physical injury and is dependent', 'upon the success of the underlying tort claim.” Sama, 569 A.2d at', '433. We have since reiterated this holding in numerous cases. See, e.g., Malinou v. Miriam Hospital, 24 A.3d 497, 511-12 (R.I. 2011) (“[A] claim for loss of society and companionship depends on the injured party’s ability to recover in a claim against the same defendant.”); Fiorenzano v. Lima, 982 A.2d 585, 591 (R.I. 2009) (“A claim for loss of consortium by a spouse or parent or child depends on the injured party’s ability to recover in a claim against the same defendant; the', '- 16 - claim remains essentially inchoate until the injured party in fact recovers.”); Desjarlais v. USAA Insurance Co., 824 A.2d 1272, 1277 (R.I. 2003) (Loss-of-consortium claims “are inextricably linked to the underlying claims because their success depends on the success of those underlying claims.”); Normandin v. Levine, 621 A.2d 713, 716 (R.I. 1993) (Loss-of-consortium claims are “derivative in nature and inextricably linked to the injured spouse’s action.”).', 'In Normandin, 621 A.2d at 714-15, this Court addressed the issue of whether an adult plaintiff in a personal injury case could “amend his timely filed complaint to add his spouse’s loss-of-consortium claim” after the three-year statute of limitations for his own claim had expired. In declining to allow this amendment, we explained:', '“Although [a loss-of-consortium] claim is derivative in nature and', 'inextricably linked to the injured spouse’s action, * * * each', 'spouse maintains an entirely unique cause of action under the law', 'and the assertion of one spouse’s right within the statutory period', 'of limitations will not excuse the failure of the other spouse to', 'assert within the statute of limitations his or her own separate', 'right.” Id. at 716. Thus, we held that the uninjured spouse was not permitted to join her claims to the lawsuit after the', 'expiration', 'of', 'the', 'three-year', 'limitation', 'period', 'for', 'the', 'injured', 'spouse’s claim. Id.; see also Balletta, 823 A.2d at 295 (same); Soares v. Ann & Hope of Rhode Island, Inc., 637 A.2d 339, 353 (R.I. 1994) (same).', 'More recently, in Desjarlais, 824 A.2d at 1278, this Court addressed the important issue of whether loss-of-consortium claims must be joined to the principal dispute. We noted that, “though they constitute separate and distinct claims, loss-of-consortium and loss-of-society claims still are subject to the applicable statutes of limitation for the impaired party’s underlying claims. Indeed, they are inextricably linked to the underlying claims because their success depends on the success of those underlying claims.” Id. at 1277. We opted to join the “growing', '- 17 - number of jurisdictions” that “refused to permit a separate action for loss of consortium and require[d] joinder of the consortium claims with the principal dispute * * * .” Id. at 1278 (quoting Leonard v. McDowell, 824 A.2d 1266, 1272 (R.I. 2003)). We found persuasive as a rationale “the desire to avoid duplicative litigation—obviating the need for a party * * * to defend against the same basic claim twice or thrice over—and thereby reducing the risk of multiple recoveries and inconsistent results.” Id.', 'Accordingly, in Desjarlais we held that derivative loss-of-consortium claims must be joined with the underlying claims of the injured party, unless the derivative claimants can demonstrate that joinder was not feasible under the circumstances. 11 Desjarlais, 824 A.2d at 1278. We also extended this holding to encompass a child’s claim for the loss of consortium of a parent; recognizing that, although § 9-1-19 tolls the statute of limitations for injuries incurred by minor children, “the children’s claims for loss of society remain derivative claims.” Desjarlais, 824 A.2d at 1281. Thus, we held that a child’s claim for loss of consortium could not be maintained in a separate lawsuit absent a showing that joinder with the underlying claim was not feasible. Id. at 1282.', 'In our opinion, it follows from this Court’s precedent and from the language of § 9-1- 41(d) that a parent’s claim for loss of consortium in a medical malpractice case should be tolled alongside the minor’s claim from which it is derived. Our precedent regarding parents’ loss-of- consortium claims clearly establishes that these claims are derivative in nature and must be joined with the child’s claims if it is feasible to do so. See Desjarlais, 824 A.2d at 1278; Sama, 569 A.2d at 433. The sound rationale for this joinder rule is to prevent duplicative litigation, 11', 'Additionally, we held that “[t]his requirement of mandatory joinder recognizes that family members asserting derivative claims for loss of consortium, society, or companionship constitute ‘persons needed for just adjudication’ within the scope of Rule 19 [of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure].” Desjarlais v. USAA Insurance Co., 824 A.2d 1272, 1278 (R.I. 2003).', '- 18 - multiple recoveries, and inconsistent results. Desjarlais, 824 A.2d at 1278. Consistent with this reasoning, we are of the opinion that § 9-1-41(d) exhibits an intent to apply to derivative claims the statute of limitations for the underlying injury. In the instant case, Yendee’s claims are tolled pursuant to § 9-1-14.1(1); thus, her parents’ derivative claims are tolled as well.', 'This holding is in harmony with the various policy interests at play in the realm of minors’ medical malpractice claims, as discussed in more detail above. Pursuant to § 9-1- 14.1(1) and Desjarlais, 824 A.2d at 1277, the parents of an injured minor are encouraged to bring suit—direct and derivative claims included—within three years of the minor’s injury. In the event that the parents fail to file a timely suit, ownership of the underlying claim shifts to the injured party upon reaching the age of majority. Although the parents retain the right to append their derivative claims to the injured party’s action, they no longer possess control over the underlying claim. Thus, the tolling provision in § 9-1-14.1(1) remains in existence for the sole benefit of the injured minor; but, because the loss-of-consortium claims are dependent upon the minor’s underlying claims, the parents are permitted to avail themselves of the benefit of the statutory tolling period. 12', 'Furthermore, this conclusion is consistent with our holding in Normandin, in which we established that the timeliness of a loss-of-consortium claim does not rise and fall solely on the timeliness of the underlying claim. See Normandin, 621 A.2d at 716. Hypothetically speaking, if Jean and Bunsan choose to append their derivative claims to Yendee’s future direct suit, assuming she elects to bring suit within three years after reaching the age of majority, their claims will be timely. The reason for this timeliness, however, will not be that the parents’ 12', 'Moreover, allowing the parents to pursue their claims alongside the minor’s claims imposes no additional prejudice on the defendants, who should already be prepared to defend against a potential suit brought by the minor upon reaching the age of majority.', '- 19 - claims were appended to Yendee’s timely suit; rather, the claims will be timely because the applicable statute of limitations, set forth in § 9-1-14.1(1), allows the claims to be filed within three years after the removal of Yendee’s disability.', 'Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of Jean’s and Bunsan’s loss-of-consortium claims, but we disagree with the hearing justice’s conclusion that these claims cannot be brought at a later time along with Yendee’s claims. The parents’ derivative claims may be asserted alongside Yendee’s claims if she elects to file suit upon reaching the age of majority.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The record of this case shall be returned to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Goldberg did not participate.', 'Justice Flaherty, dissenting. I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority’s opinion that holds that the plaintiffs, Jean and Bunsan Ho-Rath, are precluded from bringing a lawsuit on behalf of their minor daughter, Yendee, and that Yendee must wait until she reaches the age of eighteen to file suit for the medical negligence that she alleges she suffered at the hands of the defendants.', 'I do not agree with the majority that the statute is clear and unambiguous.', 'In my opinion, G.L. 1956 § 9-1-14.1(1) can be fairly read as either: (1) prohibiting, until he or she reaches the age of majority, the initiation of a lawsuit by a minor on whose behalf no suit has been brought within three years of the incident giving rise to the claim,', '- 20 - as the majority construes it, or, (2) as setting an outside limit for the initiation of such an action.1 It is well settled that, if a statute can be reasonably read in more than one way, it is ambiguous, and the intent and purpose of the Legislature in enacting the statute must be divined. See Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of New England, Inc. v. Rossi, 847 A.2d 286, 290 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Direct Action for Rights and Equality v. Gannon, 819 A.2d 651, 659 (R.I. 2003) (“When a statute is ambiguous, however, we must apply the rules of statutory construction and examine the statute in its entirety to determine the intent and purpose of the Legislature.”)). In arriving at its conclusion, the majority leans heavily on three prior decisions of this Court: Rachal v. O’Neil, 925 A.2d 920, 924 (R.I. 2007); Dowd v. Rayner, 655 A.2d 679, 681-82 (R.I. 1995); and Bakalakis v. Women & Infants’ Hospital, 619 A.2d 1105, 1106 (R.I. 1993). However, in my view, none of these cases reaches the precise issue that we decide today.', 'In Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1106, unlike the present case, the plaintiffs did initiate suit prior to the expiration of the three-year clock. But then, while the lawsuit was ongoing, and after more than three years had passed from the alleged malpractice, the plaintiffs attempted to amend the complaint by adding new defendants. Id. On appeal, this Court framed the issue presented as “whether § 9-1-14.1[(1)] allows a minor to amend a pending complaint to include new defendants more than three years after occurrence of the incident that gave rise to the cause of action.” Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1106. Relying on the language of § 9-1-14.1, this Court held 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-1-14.1 reads in pertinent part:', '“[A]n action for medical * * * malpractice shall be commenced within three (3)', 'years from the time of the occurrence of the incident which gave rise to the', 'action; provided, however, that:', '“(1) One who is under disability by reason of age, mental incompetence,', 'or otherwise, and on whose behalf no action is brought within the period of three', '(3) years from the time of the occurrence of the incident, shall bring the action', 'within three (3) years from the removal of the disability.”', '- 21 - that adding new defendants was not permissible and “to hold otherwise would bring about the unwelcome situation where the action brought within the three-year period would be merely preliminary to the main event * * * .” Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107. It is my view that Bakalakis stands for the proposition that, if a parent or guardian has filed suit within three years, he or she has effectively asserted the minor’s rights, and, in the interest of bringing forth all claims in a timely manner, no amendments naming new defendants can be made after that three-year limit has passed. Here, because the minor Yendee Ho-Rath’s rights were not exercised by her parents within three years, the statute’s tolling provision should apply, a fact that Bakalakis acknowledges. Id. (“if no action on behalf of one who is under a disability is brought within three years of the occurrence of the incident, then the statute of limitations is tolled”).', 'In Rachal, 925 A.2d at 921, an entirely different scenario presented itself. There, an injured minor plaintiff attempted to add a defendant to a pending lawsuit for personal injury. Id. Citing Bakalakis, a justice of the Superior Court denied the plaintiff’s motion to amend the complaint and granted summary judgment for the defendant. Id. at 923, 926. However, we vacated that judgment because the plaintiff’s claims did not sound in medical malpractice. Id. at 928. The Court reasoned that because § 9-1-14, the statute of limitations for personal injury, was the applicable statute, not § 9-1-14.1, which is specific to professional negligence actions, the tolling provisions of § 9-1-19 applied. Rachal, 925 A.2d at 927. We relied on Bakalakis, which we said implicitly stands for the proposition that § 9-1-19 tolls the running of the statute of limitations in personal injury actions, and held, therefore, that the Rachal plaintiff’s amendments were proper. 2 Rachal, 925 A.2d at 927. Rachal notes the “unique tolling paradigm set forth in 2', '“Ultimately, it is Bakalakis that cements—albeit by implication—the reversal of the', ""denial of the Rachals' motion to amend the complaint and add parties. * * * [T]his"", ""Court's formulation of the threshold issue in Bakalakis gives rise to an unmistakable"", '- 22 - § 9-1-14.1[(1)],” and we characterized that “exception carved out by § 9-1-14.1[(1)]” as one that concerns amendments of minors’ claims. Rachal, 925 A.2d at 927. I can discern no conflict between my reading of the statute and Rachal.', 'Finally, in Dowd, the Court discussed the rationale for § 9-1-14.1 and the “medical malpractice crisis” that precipitated its enactment. Dowd, 655 A.2d at 681 (“[f]aced with the crisis, the Legislature had legitimate interests in limiting the number of medical malpractice suits”). In deciding against the plaintiffs’ constitutional challenge of the statute, the Court held that “[t]he rational purpose of [§ 9-1-14.1] is the restriction of multiple suits or amended complaints filed against additional defendants on a serial or piecemeal basis.” Dowd, 655 A.2d at 682. The Court today is not confronted with “serial or piecemeal” suits, and none of the above cases can, in my opinion, serve as support for the majority’s decision. Id.', 'It is my view that in enacting § 9-1-14.1, the General Assembly intended to bar the serial addition of defendants long after litigation had been initiated and long after the alleged acts of malpractice had occurred. Indeed, that is precisely what occurred in Bakalakis. In other words, the Legislature required plaintiffs in medical negligence cases to lay all their cards on the table at the time suit is brought, and, thereby, in the professional malpractice context, somewhat restrict suits brought by minors, as compared to those under the ordinary tolling provision in § 9-1-19. Thus, a minor plaintiff in a medical malpractice action could no longer interminably string out litigation for years on end by adding new defendants at will until three years after reaching the age of majority. Ironically, however, the opinion of the majority may well portend a similar', 'inference that but for the exception carved out by § 9-1-14.1[(1)], § 9-1-19 would', ""allow the amendment of a minor's claim at any time before [she] turns twenty-one.”"", 'Rachal v. O’Neil, 925 A.2d 920, 927 (R.I. 2007) (Suttell, J.) (citing Bakalakis v.', 'Women & Infants’ Hospital, 619 A.2d 1105, 1107 (R.I. 1993)).', '- 23 - undesirable result: a long wait simply for litigation to begin. In the case of a three-year-old plaintiff, that wait could be as long as eighteen years.', 'It well settled that the Legislature is presumed to know the state of the law when it enacts new legislation. See, e.g., Narragansett Food Services, Inc. v. Rhode Island Department of Labor, 420 A.2d 805, 808 (R.I. 1980) (“The Legislature is presumed to know the state of existing relevant law when it enacts * * * a statute.”). That being the case, I have confidence that the Legislature knew, when it enacted § 9-1-14.1, that the policy of the law was to protect the rights of those laboring under a legal disability. See Rivers v. American Commerce Insurance Co., 836 A.2d 200, 204 (R.I. 2003) (“this Court has recognized * * * [tolling provisions for minors and other disabilities] * * * are based on clearly defined public policy and equity concerns”). This policy is nearly universal among the states and has profound common-law origins; just one example notes the “deep and long recognized principle of the common law,” that “children are to be protected during their minority from the destruction of their rights by the running of the statute of limitations.” Williams v. Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority, 440 P.2d 497, 499 (Cal. 1968).', 'I have confidence as well that the Legislature was fully aware of and appreciated the policy encouraging the prosecution of claims before they are stale. Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 181 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Order of Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 321 U.S. 342, 348-49 (1944) (“Statutes of limitation ‘are designed to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.’”)); Rivers, 836 A.2d at 204 (quoting Roe v. Gelineau, 794 A.2d 476, 485 (R.I. 2002) (“[s]tatutes of limitation promote certainty and finality and avoid stale claims”)). In my', '- 24 - opinion, to ascribe an intent to the General Assembly to institute a moratorium as lengthy as between the ages of three and eighteen in which a minor cannot avail herself of redress through the courts, as the majority holds here, would require a conclusion that the Legislature dispatched these time-honored principles. There is nothing in § 9-1-14.1 that remotely suggests they did.', 'The language in § 9-1-14.1(1) says that minors on whose behalf no suit is brought within the three-year period normally applicable to adults “shall bring the action within three (3) years from the removal of the disability.” This language is strikingly similar to that in the general tolling provision, § 9-1-19, which says that a plaintiff suffering under a disability “may bring the cause of action, within the time limited under this chapter, after the impediment is removed.” There can be no doubt that the language in § 9-1-19 has been interpreted as setting an outside limit for the filing of the claim. See Bliven v. Wheeler, 23 R.I. 379, 380, 50 A. 644, 644 (1901) (interpreting the statute then in effect analogous to today’s § 9-1-19). In Bliven, this Court reasoned, “the statute of limitations in this case extends the right of this infant plaintiff to sue until six years after she shall attain the age of [majority],” therefore the plaintiff’s suit, filed while still a minor, was “brought in good time, it having been brought several years earlier than it needed to have been.” 3 Id. Nothing in our century of law since has held that a minor is barred from suing while he or she remains a minor. The majority’s opinion takes the similar language of § 9-1-14.1(1) and uses it to create a legal vacuum that does not permit a minor to sue in what would otherwise be “in good time,” albeit early, leaving only the three years after the age of majority is reached in which to file. Bliven, 23 R.I. at 380, 50 A. at 644. Such an intent by the Legislature would not be rational, because it does nothing to limit or mitigate the risk to 3', 'We agreed with the argument that “the statute merely accords minors the privilege of waiting until they become of age before bringing a suit, and that it does not preclude them from instituting a suit while under age if they choose to do so.” Bliven v. Wheeler, 23 R.I. 379, 380, 50 A. 644, 644 (1901).', '- 25 - insurance carriers and medical professionals from malpractice suits. Indeed, it merely prolongs their periods of exposure.', 'When it addressed the medical malpractice crisis of the 1970s, the General Assembly could have adopted any of a wide array of approaches, including eliminating any tolling provision and treating minors as adults, a system some states resorted to when addressing their own crises.', 'See Schroeder v. Weighall, 316 P.3d 482, 489 (Wash. 2014) (holding unconstitutional, on state constitutional grounds, Wash. Rev. Code Ann. § 4.16.190(2) (West 2015), which eliminated the tolling of the statute of limitations for minors in medical malpractice actions). However, and with all due respect to my colleagues in the majority, it defies common sense to determine that the Legislature would have stymied protections for minors that had been part of the law for centuries.', 'Respectfully, I cannot agree with the majority’s assertion that its construction of the statute will lead to the promotion of our ideals of “certainty and finality and avoid[ance of] stale claims.” Roe v. Gelineau, 794 A.2d 476, 485 (R.I. 2002). In my opinion, the result today invites just the opposite scenario: a blameless minor on whose behalf suit was not brought within three years must wait, perhaps up to fifteen years, to prosecute a claim. It takes little imagination to conclude that, during this period, doctors may relocate, retire, or die; hospitals may close or merge; and records may become misplaced or lost. See Ryan, 941 A.2d at 181 (quoting Order of Railroad Telegraphers, 321 U.S. at 348-49 (lamenting a situation where “evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared”)).', 'This, in my opinion, works an irremediable injustice upon a minor and cannot be what the General Assembly intended when it enacted the statute.', '- 26 -', 'It is my opinion that the better interpretation of the statute would be to provide minors on whose behalf no suit has been filed within three years of an act of negligence the benefit of the tolling provision inherent in § 9-1-14.1(1) and allow them to file suit at any time up until three years after they attain the age of majority. We essentially said as much in Bakalakis: “[t]he plain language suggests that if no action on behalf of one who is under a disability is brought within three years of the occurrence of the incident, then the statute of limitations is tolled until the maximum of three years after the disability is removed.” Bakalakis, 619 A.2d at 1107 (emphasis added). Conversely, and consistent with Bakalakis, if a suit is brought on behalf of a minor within three years of the incident, 4 the minor would have no further right to bring claims against additional defendants in the future because, “if an action is brought within three years of the occurrence of the incident, the minor does not benefit from the tolling of the provision once the disability is removed.” Id. Further, I find it noteworthy that this case deals with just one legal disability contemplated by § 9-1-14.1(1), minority, which has a finite end. Applying the majority’s reasoning to a plaintiff whose disability has no known set terminus, such as mental incompetency, would leave no guaranteed saving provision for that plaintiff. There is no known time when the disability of incompetence may be removed, thus opening the “window” that the majority’s opinion creates. The majority’s opinion leaves this complication for another day. In my view, the statute should apply broadly to plaintiffs laboring under any legal disability, thus avoiding the possibility of parsing the legislation among plaintiffs having various disabilities.', 'The import of Bakalakis, and the Legislature’s intent in passing § 9-1-14.1, is, in my opinion, that where suit has not been brought on a minor’s behalf within three years of the 4', 'Alternatively, as the statute clearly states, suit is also proper “within three (3) years of the time that the act or acts of the malpractice should, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been discovered.” Section 9-1-14.1(2).', '- 27 - incident of professional malpractice, once the minor does bring suit, she is expected to join all defendants to the action within a three-year period, even if she may remain a minor for many years.

21,State of Rhode Island : Department of Corrections v. : Rhode Island Brotherhood of : Correctional Officers.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on appeal, by the defendant, Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers (RIBCO), from a Superior Court order granting a motion by the plaintiff, State of Rhode Island Department of Corrections (DOC), to vacate an arbitration award. The RIBCO contends that the Superior Court erred in vacating the arbitration award. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 2, 2009, the DOC Chief Inspector Aaron Aldrich (Inspector Aldrich) and Warden Stephen Boyd received information that two officers, Gene Davenport (Officer Davenport) and James Maddalena (Officer Maddalena), were smoking marijuana in a department vehicle while on duty. When Inspector Aldrich approached the vehicle, he saw that Officer Davenport was alone; he noticed a strong odor of marijuana smoke emanating from the vehicle; and he observed that Officer Davenport’s eyes were bloodshot. Officer Davenport subsequently confessed to smoking marijuana while assigned to perimeter security—one of the few posts at', '-1- the DOC where a correctional officer is armed with a weapon—and was escorted to a captain’s office for questioning. 1 Officer Davenport admitted that Officer Maddalena had been in the vehicle while he smoked the marijuana, but he said that Officer Maddalena had not done so.', 'The Rhode Island State Police were contacted and conducted an investigation. After interviewing Officer Davenport, the police questioned Officer Maddalena. He was not truthful. Initially, Officer Maddalena, an officer with approximately twenty-eight years of experience, admitted to being in the vehicle with Officer Davenport but denied seeing him smoke marijuana. Inspector Aldrich also interviewed Officer Maddalena, who continued to deny that he had seen his fellow officer smoke marijuana that day. It was not until Inspector Aldrich informed Officer Maddalena that a witness had observed Officer Davenport smoking marijuana while Officer Maddalena was in the vehicle that Officer Maddalena finally admitted the truth—that Officer Davenport was smoking marijuana, in his presence, while on duty.', 'Officer Maddalena was placed on administrative leave with pay, and a pre-disciplinary hearing was held on April 8, 2009. Officer Maddalena was charged on his failure to report a fellow correctional officer smoking marijuana on duty, his dishonesty during an interview with the Rhode Island State Police, and his dishonesty during an interview by the DOC’s Office of Inspections.', 'Director Ashbel T. Wall, II (Director Wall) subsequently notified Officer Maddalena, in writing, that he was being terminated from employment with the DOC. Director Wall stated that Officer Maddalena’s “conduct [was] contrary to the standards of conduct required by the State of Rhode [Island] and the [DOC]. [His] actions call[ed] into question [his] judgment and ethical standards and, therefore, [his] ability to perform [his] job with integrity.” The RIBCO immediately filed a grievance on behalf of Officer Maddalena, in accordance with 1', 'It is undisputed that Officer Davenport had, in fact, been armed with a loaded shotgun and handgun while smoking marijuana on duty.', '-2- its Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), contending that he was terminated without just cause.', 'More than one year later, the matter proceeded to arbitration on July 26, 2010. At the arbitration hearing, the issue in dispute was the following: “Was [Officer] Maddalena terminated with just cause? If not, what shall be the remedy?” At the hearing, Officer Maddalena declined to testify; however, RIBCO submitted a document that, according to the arbitrator, “purport[ed] to be a summary of applied discipline for ‘dishonesty’” seeking to demonstrate that the DOC’s history of discipline for dishonesty has not included termination. Inspector Aldrich, Rhode Island State Police Sergeant Benjamin Barney (Sergeant Barney), and Director Wall testified at the arbitration hearing on behalf of the DOC. Inspector Aldrich and Sergeant Barney testified to the substantive facts. Additionally, Inspector Aldrich and Director Wall testified about the critical importance of safety and security of perimeter posts and the extensive training officers receive on the need to report threats to the institutions’ security promptly and the duty to report any on-duty criminal conduct. Director Wall also testified that the DOC must have trust and confidence in the honesty, judgment, and reliability of its officers. Specifically, Director Wall noted that any lapse in areas relating to safety and security can lead to serious, if not deadly, consequences.', 'In analyzing the document submitted by RIBCO, the arbitrator proceeded to determine whether Officer Maddalena’s punishment—termination—was “reasonable.” The arbitrator noted that', '“[i]f, over an extended period of time, management has', 'responded to a particular type of offense with a range or band of', 'discipline based on the individual circumstances and severity of a', 'case, an arbitrator would be hard[-]pressed to go outside that', 'defined spectrum of penalties unless the offense itself is', 'significantly outside said spectrum.”', '-3- The arbitrator then proceeded to compare and contrast the cases contained in RIBCO’s document with the conduct of Officer Maddalena. After rejecting most of the cases in the document, the arbitrator focused on a single incident concerning Captain Michael Martufi, an officer who had been aware that a co-worker had engaged in criminal activity, lied to a DOC inspector about the criminal activity on two occasions, warned the co-worker of the DOC’s investigation, and was not terminated. The arbitrator also credited the testimony of the DOC witnesses and specifically found Director Wall’s testimony to be “compelling” and “convincing.”', 'Nevertheless, the arbitrator determined that “there was not just cause for the termination of [Officer] Maddalena[,]” because terminating an officer for dishonesty was not in concert with the DOC’s history of discipline. Instead, the award provided that Officer Maddalena be suspended without pay for sixty days and “be made whole for lost wages and benefits less the sixty * * * day suspension without pay * * *.”', 'On November 19, 2010, the DOC filed a petition in Providence County Superior Court, seeking to vacate the arbitration award. The RIBCO responded on November 29, 2010, with a motion to confirm the arbitration award. The DOC argued that the arbitrator exceeded his powers by substituting his judgment for that of the director of the DOC and that the trial justice was not precluded from vacating the award due to a recent amendment to G.L. 1956 § 42-56-10, (P.L. 2007, ch. 523, § 1), the section of the General Laws that enumerates the powers of the director of the DOC. The RIBCO countered that the arbitrator’s determination that the dispute was arbitrable was supported by statutory and contractual authority and that the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions were rationally based on the arbitrator’s evaluation of the evidence and pertinent law.', '-4-', 'After reviewing the memoranda of the parties, a justice of the Superior Court granted the DOC’s motion to vacate the arbitration award and denied RIBCO’s motion to confirm. 2 The trial justice determined (1) that the dispute was arbitrable—in accordance with § 42-56-10(24); and (2) that the arbitrator exceeded his authority and reached an irrational result because his “decision was based upon a manifest disregard of the [CBA].” The RIBCO timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', 'In Rhode Island, there is “a strong public policy in favor of the finality of arbitration awards.” Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC v.

The RIBCO asserts that the DOC did not properly raise the issue of arbitrability because it did not appeal from that part of the trial justice’s decision declaring the dispute to be arbitrable, and it further contends that, if the issue properly was raised, the trial justice’s decision on substantive arbitrability was correct. The DOC responds that it did properly raise the issue of arbitrability, and it contends that the trial justice’s decision on substantive arbitrability was, however, incorrect.', 'We note at the outset that, “like subject matter jurisdiction, the question of arbitrability may be raised by the parties at any time * * *.” Woonsocket Teachers’ Guild, Local 951, AFT v.

We, therefore, are satisfied that the question of arbitrability is appropriately before us. See id.', 'Next, we turn to the issue of whether the trial justice erred in determining that the grievance was substantively arbitrable. “A duty to arbitrate a dispute arises only when a party agrees to arbitration in clear and unequivocal language, and even then, the party is only obligated to arbitrate issues that it explicitly agreed to arbitrate.” State Department of Corrections v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 866 A.2d 1241, 1247 (R.I. 2005). This Court reviews arbitrability determinations de novo. See Sacco v. Cranston School Department, 53 A.3d 147, 150 (R.I. 2012).', 'Here, in concluding that the dispute was substantively arbitrable, the trial justice determined that § 42-56-10(24), which purports to limit the judiciary’s review of arbitration awards involving the authority of the director of the DOC, was, in fact, a clear mandate that this dispute was arbitrable. This Court is of the opinion that the trial justice improperly relied on subsection (24) of § 42-56-10 when determining arbitrability. Nevertheless, although the trial justice’s reliance on subsection (24) was improper, we affirm the trial justice’s arbitrability determination on other grounds. 3 See State v. Covington, 69 A.3d 855, 867 n.10 (R.I. 2013) (recognizing this Court’s authority to affirm a trial justice on alternate grounds). 3', 'As this Court ruled in State Department of Corrections v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 64 A.3d 734, 741 n.9 (R.I. 2013), “[b]ecause our conclusion on arbitrability has a different basis, and because of the well-settled doctrine of constitutional avoidance, we need not decide whether [G.L. 1956] § 42-56-10(24) violates the principle of separation of powers. See In re Brown, 903 A.2d 147, 151 (R.I. 2006) (‘Neither this Court nor the Superior Court should decide constitutional issues unless it is absolutely necessary to do so.’).”', '-7-', 'The RIBCO contends that the grievance in this case was arbitrable because § 28-9-1 4 and the CBA provide that grievances regarding termination are subject to arbitration. The DOC responds and asserts that, pursuant to § 42-56-10, the DOC’s responsibility for the security of the Adult Correctional Institutions takes “precedence over the authority of an arbitrator to modify a penalty where such central issues as safety and security and employee discipline are concerned” and that the trial justice erred in finding this dispute arbitrable.', 'Article XVI, section 16.1 of the CBA specifically states that “[i]t is agreed that [the DOC] may dismiss, demote or suspend an employee for just cause.” Section 16.4, which must be read in conjunction with section 16.1, states that “[i]f * * * the employee or [RIBCO] so affected notifies the [DOC,] * * * he may have his case reviewed in accordance with the grievance and arbitration procedure set forth in this Agreement.” It is therefore apparent that the parties have agreed in the CBA that a grievance regarding the DOC’s just-cause determination is arbitrable.', 'Although § 42-56-10(2) declares that the DOC is responsible for “[m]aintain[ing] security, safety, and order at all state correctional facilities” and that the DOC may discharge employees, the statute does not specify that employee disciplinary decisions are not arbitrable in accordance with the terms of the CBA. Accordingly, we turn to the merits of this controversy. 4', 'General Laws 1956 § 28-9-1 states, in pertinent part, the following:', '“Unless the parties agree otherwise in writing that the arbitrator shall have no', 'authority to modify the penalty imposed by the employer in the arbitration of', 'matters relating to the disciplining of employees, including, but not limited to,', 'termination, suspension, or reprimand, the arbitrator shall have the authority to', 'modify the penalty imposed by the employer and/or otherwise fashion an', 'appropriate remedy.”', '-8-', 'The Arbitration Award', 'The next issue on appeal is whether the trial justice erred in her conclusion that the arbitration award was irrational and in granting the DOC’s motion to vacate. The RIBCO contends that the trial justice improperly relied on the management-rights clause, Article IV, section 4.1 of the CBA in determining that the DOC director’s authority to discharge employees trumped the just-cause provision of the CBA and that the trial justice erred in finding that the arbitration award was irrational. In response, the DOC argues that the trial justice did not err in concluding that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the contract language of the management- rights clause in the CBA and that the trial justice did not err in determining that the arbitration award was irrational.', 'After a thorough review of the record, we are of the opinion that the arbitrator substituted his judgment as to the appropriate disciplinary action for that of the director of the DOC. The arbitrator’s conclusion, therefore, is inconsistent with § 42-56-10, which outlines the powers of the director “in light of the director’s nondelegable authority to maintain security, safety, and order at all state correctional facilities.” State Department of Corrections v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 725 A.2d 296, 298 (R.I. 1999) (Riel). Importantly, section 4.1B. of the CBA grants the DOC director “the exclusive right * * * to suspend, demote, discharge or take other disciplinary action against such employees[.]”', 'In this case, the arbitrator was asked to resolve two issues: (1) whether the DOC had just cause to terminate Officer Maddalena; and (2) if the DOC did not have just cause, determine an appropriate remedy. The arbitrator decided that the DOC did not have just cause to terminate Officer Maddalena and that a sixty-day suspension without pay, rather than termination, was an adequate remedy. First, the arbitrator addressed the level of discipline in a just-cause review and', '-9- noted that, generally, arbitrators utilize the reasonableness standard when determining whether a “punishment fit[s] the crime.” Specifically, the arbitrator stated that arbitrators “give due/significant deference to what the Employer has, through its history of applied discipline, defined as an appropriate level of discipline.”', 'Next, the arbitrator found it necessary to look outside of the CBA and referred to the RIBCO document which purported to be a summary of some of the DOC’s past disciplinary cases involving dishonesty. Before undertaking a comparison of those cases to the case at hand, the arbitrator noted numerous limitations to the usefulness of utilizing prior DOC disciplinary cases, including the fact “that the sketchy facts contained in [the document submitted by RIBCO] about each [case] are insufficient to draw a conclusion as to the comparability with the case of Officer Maddalena.” Undaunted by these drawbacks, however, the arbitrator focused on a single instance of past discipline and anchored his conclusion on this singular incident.', 'The arbitrator declared that he was “convinced that there is no doubt that Officer Maddalena knew exactly what Officer Davenport was smoking[, marijuana].” The arbitrator went on to find Director Wall’s testimony “compelling where he described the need for the [DOC] to take action against any threat to safety and security of the institution.” Further, the arbitrator noted that', '“Director Wall spoke convincingly of the need for the [DOC] to be', 'able to place trust in the honesty, judgment, and reliability of its', 'employees. The nature of the [DOC’s] business is that lapses in', 'any of those areas relating to safety and security can lead to', 'serious, if not deadly consequences.” Despite the credence the arbitrator assigned to the unrebutted and overwhelming evidence submitted by the DOC, the arbitrator concluded that there was no just cause for termination and proceeded to formulate his own remedy.', '- 10 -', 'This Court has stated that “the authority of an arbitrator is not ‘unbridled[,]’” and “[a]n arbitrator has a duty to resolve a dispute based on the relevant provisions in the CBA.” Woonsocket Teachers’ Guild, Local 951, AFT, 770 A.2d at 839 (quoting Rhode Island Council 94, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v. State, 714 A.2d 584, 588 (R.I. 1998)). An arbitration award will be vacated if an arbitrator “exceed[ed] his or her powers by interpreting a CBA in such a way that it contravenes state law or other public policies that are not subject to alteration by arbitration.” State Department of Corrections v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 867 A.2d 823, 829 (R.I. 2005).', 'Here, the arbitrator did not resolve the dispute based on any provisions in the CBA. In fact, the arbitrator decided—improperly we conclude—that, because the CBA did not list offenses and corresponding penalties, he would not rely on the CBA in making his decision and instead would “look elsewhere for guidance on this question” to reach this result. Not only is the CBA pertinent to the determination of just cause in this case, the arbitrator’s failure to consider its terms was a manifest disregard of the contract.', 'The Management Rights section of the CBA, specifically section 4.1A., provides that', '“the employer shall have the exclusive right, subject to the', 'provisions of this [CBA] and consistent with applicable laws and', 'regulations: * * * To hire, promote, transfer, assign, and retain', 'employees in positions within the bargaining unit, and to suspend,', 'demote, discharge or take other disciplinary action against such', 'employees[.]” (Emphasis added.) The arbitrator wholly overlooked this section of the CBA in his decision. Because this Court has declared it to be “an abuse of an arbitrator’s power pursuant to § 28-9-18(a)(2)” “if an award fails to ‘draw its essence from the agreement * * *[,]’” we are of the opinion that the arbitrator here abused his power in determining that the DOC director lacked just cause without taking into consideration relevant portions of the CBA.

The facts of this case, which are not in dispute, establish that Officer Maddalena, a sworn officer, accompanied a fellow officer smoking marijuana in a DOC vehicle while working at a security post—while armed with a loaded shotgun and handgun—and continuously lied to the Rhode Island State Police and the DOC investigation officers about his being in the vehicle and observing the wrongful conduct. The arbitrator referenced the DOC’s testimony and specifically found Director Wall’s testimony regarding the need for the DOC to take action against any threat to safety and security of the institution to be compelling and convincing, yet proceeded to look outside the CBA to justify his result.', 'In City of East Providence v. United Steelworkers of America, Local 15509, 925 A.2d 246, 250 (R.I. 2007), where an animal-control supervisor was terminated by the City of East Providence for keeping a wild and rabid raccoon at the city kennel and, therefore, putting others’ lives at great risk, the following questions were put to an arbitrator: “Did the City have just cause to suspend and terminate [an employee]? If not, what shall the remedy be?” Id. at 256. In City of East Providence, the arbitrator found that the city had just cause for termination, but then', '- 12 - decided that a different remedy was more appropriate. Id. This Court determined, however, that the arbitrator had acted irrationally, and we declared that “[o]nce the arbitrator found just cause, he exceeded his authority by requiring the city to reinstate [the employee] in another position.” Id. In the case at bar, the arbitrator reached an irrational just-cause determination and then proceeded to exceed his authority in fashioning his own remedy. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the trial justice was correct in vacating the arbitration award.', 'We pause to note that, although RIBCO asserts that the trial justice improperly relied on the management-rights clause of the CBA in determining that the DOC director’s authority to discharge employees trumped the just-cause provision of the CBA, we do not agree with this characterization of the trial justice’s determination. The trial justice concluded that the arbitrator exceeded his authority when he manifestly disregarded the management-rights provision of the CBA, not that the management-rights provision trumped the just-cause provision. We agree with her conclusion.', 'Therefore, this Court affirms the trial justice’s conclusions that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the CBA and that the arbitration award was irrational.', 'Constitutionality of G.L. 1956 § 42-56-10(24)', 'Lastly, both parties have addressed the constitutionality of a 2007 amendment (P.L. 2007, ch. 523, § 1) to § 42-56-10, which added subsection (24) to the statute. Section 42-56-10(24) states:', '“Notwithstanding the enumeration of the powers of the', 'director as set forth in this section, and notwithstanding any other', 'provision of the general laws, the validity and enforceability of the', 'provisions of a collective bargaining agreement shall not be', 'contested, affected, or diminished, nor shall any arbitration be', 'vacated, remanded or set aside on the basis of an alleged conflict', 'with this section or with any other provision of the general laws.”', '- 13 - This Court has “recognize[d] that G.L. 1956 § 28-[9]-1 empowers an arbitrator to modify a penalty imposed by an employer unless the parties agree in writing that the arbitrator shall have no such authority.” Riel, 725 A.2d at 298; see also State v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 819 A.2d 1286, 1289 (R.I. 2003). We also have stated, however, that “[t]his statute must be harmonized with those provisions set forth in § 42-56-10, which outlines the powers of the director of the [DOC], in light of the director’s nondelegable authority to maintain security, safety, and order at all state correctional facilities.” Riel, 725 A.2d at 298. The RIBCO now counters that the amendment to § 42-56-10, adding subsection (24), radically altered this area of law such that now the director’s authority regarding security is subject to review by an arbitrator. 5 The DOC counters that RIBCO’s “argument is in essence [that] arbitration awards are no longer reviewable or subject to alteration by the judiciary” and that, therefore, the amendment is unconstitutional as violative of the separation of powers doctrine.', 'This Court is mindful of the director’s nondelegable responsibility concerning safety and security of the state prison, and we do not retreat from our previous holdings in any way. However, because we agree with the trial justice that the arbitration award was irrational, we need not venture into the arena of nondelegation and separation of powers, 6 nor reach a determination on the constitutionality of the amendment. 5', 'The RIBCO also contends that the constitutionality of § 42-56-10(24) is not properly before the Court because the trial justice did not address the constitutional argument, the DOC did not file a cross-appeal with respect to the constitutionality issue, and the DOC failed to provide the appropriate notice, which RIBCO suggested is required in Rule 32 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. Because the Court is not addressing the constitutionality of § 42-56- 10(24), it is unnecessary to address these peripheral issues. 6', 'The nondelegation doctrine, derived from the Rhode Island Constitution, “arises when it is contended that there has been an impermissible delegation of legislative power to an administrative agency.” Moreau v.

Further, we are of the opinion that, if the Legislature intended to alter or diminish the director’s authority to “suspend, demote, discharge, or take other necessary disciplinary action” in order to secure prison safety and security, it would have done so in a clearer and more explicit manner.

As an initial matter, we agree with the majority’s conclusion, if not entirely with its rationale, that the grievance filed by the Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers (RIBCO) on behalf of Officer Maddalena was arbitrable. However, that is where our paths diverge.', 'The majority holds that, in fashioning his award, the arbitrator substituted his judgment for the judgment of the director of the Department of Corrections (the DOC). In coming to that conclusion, it is our opinion that the majority completely misunderstands and misstates the role of an arbitrator. The arbitrator here was tasked by the parties, by submission and by agreement, to evaluate evidence presented to him, listen to the arguments of the parties, and make a decision based on the evidence and the relevant contractual language. 1 That is exactly what he did. In his award, the arbitrator found: (1) the CBA did not contain a negotiated list of offenses and corresponding penalties; (2) the DOC had never before punished dishonesty by the termination of employment; (3) the director’s interest in the safety and security of the institution was compelling; (4) Officer Maddalena had twenty-seven years of “discipline-free service”; (5) there was not just cause for the termination of Officer Maddalena; and (6) his termination should be revoked and replaced by a sixty-day disciplinary suspension without pay.', 'In an opinion that, in our view, sets the law on its head, the majority then simply substitutes its judgment for the judgment of the arbitrator.', 'See North Providence School Committee v.

That, after all, was the issue before the arbitrator.', 'The majority then castigates the arbitrator for “formulat[ing] his own remedy.” Again, this is a core function of an arbitrator and, particular to this case, it is precisely what he was asked to do by the parties. See MISCO, Inc., 484 U.S. at 38 (“where it is contemplated that the arbitrator will determine remedies for contract violations that he finds, courts have no authority to disagree with [the arbitrator’s] honest judgment in that respect * * * as long as the arbitrator is even arguably construing or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his authority”); Burchell v.

However, the majority does not hesitate to leap to 2', 'See also 6 C.J.S. Arbitration § 103 at 176 (2004) (“The courts look to the arbitration agreement to determine the scope of the arbitrator’s powers in rendering an award, and in the absence of clearly restrictive language, great latitude must be allowed in framing of an award and fashioning of an appropriate remedy.”)', '- 19 - outside sources itself, including Rhode Island statutes and previous holdings of this Court, to decide that the arbitrator was irrational and that he exceeded his power by manifestly disregarding the CBA.', 'In our view, the major flaw in the majority’s decision is that it is myopically entranced by just some of the wording in Article IV, section 4.1 of the CBA, the so-called management-rights clause. There is no question that section 4.1 recognizes broad powers in the director, but those powers are not unfettered. Instead, they are circumscribed in that they are explicitly said to be “subject to the provisions of this Agreement.” Id. Indeed, Article XVI, section 16.1 3 requires that discipline, including termination, will not be imposed in the absence of just cause. Further, section 16.4 4 gives an employee the right to contest whether the just-cause standard was reached in light of the punishment imposed, including the right to arbitrate the dispute if it has not been resolved at an earlier stage of the grievance process.', 'In reaching its decision, the majority, wrongly in our opinion, relies heavily upon two earlier decisions of this Court. The majority quotes extensively from Laurie v. Senecal, 666 A.2d 806, 809 (R.I. 1995), trumpeting this Court’s language that “[p]rison administrators therefore should be accorded wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies and practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal order and discipline and to maintain institutional security.” However, that case involved the authority of prison authorities to force-feed an inmate who was attempting to starve himself.

United Steelworkers of America, Local 15509, 925 A.2d 246 (R.I. 2007). There, the Court decided that an arbitrator had acted irrationally when, charged with deciding the same issue as was the arbitrator in this case, first found that there was just cause to terminate an employee, but then inexplicably ordered that the employee be brought back to work, even ordering that the grievant be reassigned to a different position. Id. at 256. We agree that in City of East Providence, the arbitrator was irrational because, having decided that there was just cause to fire the employee, he had absolutely no reason to address the question of remedy, much less to place the grievant in a position from which he had not been terminated. Id. It is noteworthy that the complete opposite situation is present in this case. Here, the arbitrator determined that there was not just cause for termination, thus triggering his second obligation to fashion an appropriate remedy. Respectfully, it is our opinion that City of East Providence could not possibly supply less foundation to the majority’s analysis.', 'In summary, it is our opinion that the arbitrator carefully considered the case before him and rendered an award that was not only “passably plausible” but also drew its essence from the CBA. Town of North Providence, 763 A.2d at 606. It is completely irrelevant that this Court, hearing the case as the arbitrator did, might have reached a different conclusion. See North Providence School Committee, 945 A.2d at 345 n.10 (“Although it is possible that one or more of the members of this Court might not have reached the same result or engaged in the same process of reasoning as did the arbitrator in this case, the operative standard of review narrows the judicial role to that of determining whether the result reached by the arbitrator was irrational', '- 21 - or constituted a manifest disregard of the law.”); Rhode Island Council 94, AFSCME, AFL-CIO v.

He was released shortly thereafter.', 'On December 1, 2010, while sitting in a park-and-ride adjacent to the white church, Patrolman Michael Gregorezek (Ptlm. Gregorezek) observed another man fitting Laura’s general description waiting for a RIPTA bus. The man, identified as Robert Austin, was wearing a gray sweatsuit and a purple and yellow Vikings jacket; he was also carrying a black duffel bag. When asked if he was willing to go to the station and answer questions, Austin cooperated. At the station, Det. Ferreira asked Austin whether he had traveled through Barrington on a RIPTA bus on November 29, 2010, to which he replied that he had not. Austin admitted that he had boarded a bus that day, but that the bus he was on was headed to Warwick. He further informed the police that he was the only person in possession of his bus pass. When the officers asked for his bus pass, he complied and was allowed to leave the station. 3', 'Although she did not know which team was represented on the assailant’s jacket, complainant stated that she saw the letters “V” and “N” in the name. After initial speculation that this was the logo for the New York Knicks, Det. Ferreira concluded that complainant was likely describing the logo for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League, whose team colors are purple and yellow. 4', 'A BOLO notice alerts officers to “be on the lookout.” State v. Pitts, 960 A.2d 240, 242 n.4 (R.I. 2008).', '-3-', 'Detective Ferreira then transferred the serial numbers from the bus passes of Austin and McGill to RIPTA Assistant General Manager, James Dean (Dean). As Dean explained to the jury at trial, a scan of the serial numbers revealed no activity on McGill’s pass on November 29. A scan of Austin’s pass, however, showed that it was used twice on that date during the relevant time period, once at 12:59 p.m. to board a Route 30 bus to Warwick, and again at 1:06 p.m. to board a Route 60 bus to Newport. 5 The number of the bus running Route 60 at that time was 0545, matching the number recorded in Laura’s notes.', 'Later on December 1, 2010, Det. Ferreira telephoned Laura and arranged for her to view a photo array at the Bristol police station. The array consisted of seven photographs, which she was shown in sequential order after reading and initialing the Barrington police department procedure on how to view a photo array. The instructions noted that the array “may or may not contain a picture of the person who committed the crime.” Photograph No. 1 was of McGill, photograph No. 3 was of Austin, and the remaining five photographs were taken from the Adult Correctional Institutions WINFACTS computer database. 6 Detective Ferreira compiled the list by entering genetic search parameters including gender, age, and weight. He did not include photographs of any bald or mustached men, nor any non-Caucasian men. Both McGill and Austin were fifty-one years old as of the date of the photographs, and the remaining men in the array were aged thirty through forty-two years old.', 'Laura went through all seven photographs at the station, explaining later at trial that she did not “want to send an innocent person to jail.” On completion, she asked to again view 5', 'The swiping of one card on different buses headed in different directions within a seven minute span can be explained by the “pass-back” system. At trial, Dean described the “pass-back” system as one passenger swiping his card and either passing the card back to someone behind him or finding a way to get the card to someone outside the bus. 6', 'Mistakenly referred to in the transcript as WINFAX, WINFACTS is the inmate database for the Adult Correctional Institutions.', '-4- photographs No. 1 and No. 3 and to be shown side-view photographs of these two men. After viewing the side-view photographs of McGill and Austin, Laura immediately identified No. 3, Austin, as “the person who assaulted her on the RIPTA bus.” Confident in her selection, she later testified that the side-view profile photograph of Austin brought his chin and fuller face into focus, and that “[r]ight away [she] knew which one it was.” Detective Ferreira then showed her a photograph of the black duffel bag, which she identified as the bag belonging to her attacker. Detective Ferreira also showed her a photograph of Austin, face concealed, wearing a Vikings jacket and holding a black duffel bag. Laura identified the jacket and duffel bag as the articles worn and carried by her assailant, respectively. Finally, Det. Ferreira showed her a photograph of Austin wearing gray sweatpants and a Vikings jacket. Upon viewing this photograph, Laura stated that she was “one hundred percent certain” that this was the individual who assaulted her.', 'On January 27, 2011, criminal information P2/11-160A charged Austin with one count of second-degree sexual assault in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-37-4 and 11-37-5. Before trial, defendant filed a motion to suppress Laura’s out-of-court identification, and hearings were held on the issue on June 28, 2012 and July 2, 2012. At the hearings, 7 defendant contended that Laura’s out-of-court identification should be suppressed because of the dissimilarities between the men in the photo array, the questionable accuracy of the complaining witness, and, ultimately, because the photograph identification procedure was unduly suggestive and created a substantial risk of misidentification.', 'In response, the state contended that the Barrington police appropriately handled the identification procedure. The state noted that the instructions included the admonition that the perpetrator may or may not be in the array, and that nearly all of the men in the photo array were 7', 'Both Det. Ferreira and complainant testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress.', '-5- of similar builds, weight, and skin tone. Finally, the state commented that Laura had “four chances” to view her assailant, and that she was “a hundred percent certain” that it was defendant. After reviewing the five-factor test for assessing the propriety of an eyewitness identification, 8 the trial justice concluded that the identification procedure was not unduly suggestive, and denied defendant’s motion to suppress.', 'Austin’s trial commenced on July 2, 2012; Laura, Det. Ferreria, Ptlm. Gregorezek, and Dean testified. On July 5, 2012, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal, which was denied by the trial justice.', 'On July 6, 2012, after the close of evidence, the trial justice gave his charge to the jury, which included the following instruction:', '“The burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable', 'doubt not only that the crime was committed but that the', 'Defendant was the person who committed the crime.

If the circumstances of the identification of the', 'Defendant are not convincing beyond a reasonable doubt then you', 'must find the Defendant not guilty.”', 'After the trial justice delivered the complete jury charge, defendant objected to the trial justice’s failure to read from either of the two proposed instructions he had previously submitted. One set of proposed instructions was based on instructions submitted pursuant to State v. Henderson, 27 A.3d 872 (N.J. 2011), while the other set was taken from this Court’s decision in State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1290-91 (R.I. 2011). The thrust of defendant’s argument was that the trial justice’s instruction did not include language concerning “accuracy versus certainty.” In response, the state noted that this issue has come up more often in the context of a defendant’s proffered eyewitness expert testimony, but that this Court has consistently rejected these experts on the ground that “trustworthiness of eyewitnesses is not beyond the ken of the jurors.” Siding with the state, the trial justice declined to give defendant’s requested instructions and maintained that the instructions given to the jury in the present case adequately covered the law concerning identification. On July 6, 2012, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on one count of sexual assault.', 'On July 13, 2012, defendant filed a motion for a new trial. At the hearing on September 24, 2012, he argued that the evidence should have yielded a verdict of not guilty because Laura', '-7- could not have fully formed a reliable identification of her assailant, as evidenced by her broad age range estimate. He pointed out the fact that Laura “demonstrated a level of uncertainty” upon her first viewing of the photo array, and that the procedure became overly suggestive and “sloppy” when she was only shown a photograph of Austin in the jacket with the bag. The defendant argued that these issues produced a high likelihood of misidentification such that a reasonable juror could have found in favor of Austin. In response, the state noted that Laura identified Austin as her assailant before she was shown the full-length photograph of Austin wearing the purple and yellow jacket.', 'In denying the motion, the trial justice expressed satisfaction with the identification procedure and found complainant to have testified credibly. Further, he indicated that, if this had been a bench trial, he, too, would have found defendant guilty.', 'On November 13, 2012, defendant was sentenced to fifteen years, ten to serve, and five years suspended, with probation. Thereafter, on November 27, 2012, defendant filed a notice of appeal of his conviction. A final judgment of conviction and commitment entered on December 17, 2012. 9', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The defendant raises three issues on appeal. First, he argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress Laura’s out-of-court identification because of the dissimilarity in the appearances of the subjects in the photo array and because the photographs of defendant were unnecessarily suggestive. Second, he asserts that the trial justice’s denial of his motion for a new 9', 'A premature notice of appeal is “timely so long as a final judgment is entered thereafter.” State v.

Lastly, he contends that the trial justice erred in denying his request for a specific set of jury instructions. We will address each of these issues in turn.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Motion to Suppress', '“This Court reviews motions to suppress eyewitness identifications under a clearly erroneous standard.” State v.

Patel, 949 A.2d 401, 410 (R.I. 2008)). “In making this determination, ‘we assess the available evidence in the light most favorable to the state.’” Id. (quoting Patel, 949 A.2d at 410).', 'In evaluating the propriety of an eyewitness identification, the trial justice is to undertake a two-step analysis. See Gallop, 89 A.3d at 801. The first step is for the trial justice to determine “whether the procedure used in the identification was unnecessarily suggestive.” State v. Brown, 42 A.3d 1239, 1242 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Texter, 923 A.2d 568, 574 (R.I. 2007)). To be inadmissible, “an identification procedure must have been ‘so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification’ * * *.” Gallop, 89 A.3d at 801 (quoting State v. Gatone, 698 A.2d 230, 235 (R.I. 1997)). Second, if the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, “the trial justice must ‘determin[e] whether in the totality of the circumstances the identification was nonetheless reliable.’” Id. (quoting Brown, 42 A.3d at 1242-43).', 'The defendant advances two arguments before this Court regarding the alleged suggestiveness of the identification procedure. First, he contends that the composition of the photo array was unfair and that the trial justice was clearly wrong in finding that the physical', '-9- characteristics of the men in the array were similar to Laura’s description. This, for defendant, was evidenced by the fact that the photographs of the five younger men were immediately ruled out by Laura and, of the two remaining photographs, only Austin matched the weight of the described perpetrator.', 'We disagree with defendant’s assertion. The seven photographs in the array depicted men fitting all of the general characteristics described by Laura. All seven photographs revealed white men between their thirties and fifties, with short hair, and no facial hair. Also, while not all of the men matched defendant’s exact weight of 230 pounds, five of the six other men weighed close to 230 pounds. As we have cautioned, “the images constituting a photographic array need not be ‘look-alikes,’ but rather need only possess similar general characteristics.” State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1029 (R.I. 2007) (citing Gatone, 698 A.2d at 236). Given that the images in the photo array shared nearly all the same general characteristics, as described by complainant, we are satisfied that the array was not unnecessarily suggestive.', 'The instructions provided by Det. Ferreira prior to the viewing of the photo array further persuade us that there was no likelihood of misidentification. See Gallop, 89 A.3d at 802. Notably, Laura was informed that the photo array “may or may not contain a picture of the person who committed the crime.” That instruction “mitigated the risk” that she would select a photograph “simply because she believed she was expected to do so.” Id. (citing Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1029-30).', 'Next, defendant argues that the display of Austin’s photographs after Laura’s initial selection constituted “impermissibly suggestive confirmation.” Specifically, he argues that the trial justice was in error in relying on Laura’s level of certainty because that certainty was influenced by Det. Ferreira’s confirmatory actions.', 'Those suggested confirmatory actions', '- 10 - included showing Laura a photograph of Austin in the purple and yellow jacket. This claim of error fails, however, because it is clear from the transcript that this photograph was shown to Laura only after she had already identified defendant as her assailant, and there is no indication that Det. Ferreira gave positive feedback at any point in the process.', 'Having held that the photo array was not unnecessarily suggestive, we need not engage in step two of the analysis, the determination of whether the identification was nonetheless independently reliable. See Gallop, 89 A.3d at 803; see also Brown, 42 A.3d at 1242-43 (holding that, if the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, the trial justice must “determin[e] ‘whether in the totality of the circumstances the identification was nonetheless reliable.’” quoting Texter, 923 A.2d at 574). However, even if we had found the identification procedure to have been unnecessarily suggestive, it is readily apparent that the identification was independently reliable. As the trial justice recounted, Laura had a number of opportunities to view her assailant. She looked at defendant when he sat next to her on the bus, when she was fending off his sexual advances, when she maneuvered past him on the way to the front of the bus, when she looked back at him from the front aisle-facing seat, and when he passed her while exiting the bus. Regarding certainty, Laura stated at the photo array that she did not want to send an innocent man to jail, and soon after she said she was certain that defendant was her assailant. Additionally, the mere forty-eight hour lapse between the assault and the identification further weighs in favor of a finding that the identification was independently reliable. Therefore, we find no error in the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion to suppress.', '- 11 -', 'B', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'It is well established that, on a motion for a new trial challenging the weight of the evidence, the trial justice acts “as a thirteenth juror, exercising independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” 10 State v.

(quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 842). 10', 'In his decision, the trial justice initially indicated that his intention was to treat the motion as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. He subsequently stated, however, that he was basing at least a portion of his decision on the credibility of complainant’s testimony, which is not to be done under a sufficiency of the evidence challenge. See State v. Fleck, 81 A.3d 1129, 1133 (R.I. 2014) (explaining that, on a new trial motion based upon the sufficiency of the evidence, “the trial justice does not weigh the evidence or the credibility of the witnesses”). Despite the apparent conflation of differing standards, the trial justice’s analysis centered on a challenge to the weight of the evidence, and we will treat it as such.', '- 12 -', 'Here, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying the motion for a new trial because the only reasonable response to the evidence presented was that the identification was incorrect. He avers that the trial justice failed to consider all relevant evidence, including the impact of the photograph of Austin wearing the Vikings jacket, as well as the fact that Laura might not have gotten a proper look at her assailant as he sat next to her given that she was mainly focused on removing his hands from her lap. He also disputes the probative value of the testimony regarding the RIPTA pass, contending that it is just as likely Austin was on a Warwick-bound bus.', 'As laid out in Fleck, 81 A.3d at 1134, the trial justice considered the evidence in light of the charge to the jury, highlighted by complainant’s testimony. He then assessed the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, declaring that he found complainant to have testified credibly in light of the fact that she was subjected to a comprehensive cross- examination. The trial justice also expressed satisfaction with the credibility of the testimony that Laura was shown photographs of defendant’s jacket and duffel bag only after she had identified defendant as the perpetrator. Further, he noted that the data contained in the bus pass weighed heavily in the state’s favor. Finally, the trial justice stated that, if the matter had been a bench trial, he would have also found defendant guilty.', '“This Court is loath to overturn the credibility findings of a trial justice because ‘it is the trial justice who has the opportunity to observe the witnesses as they testify and therefore is in a better position to weigh the evidence and to pass upon the credibility of the witnesses than is this [C]ourt.’” State v.

This case came before the Supreme Court on April 8, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. The plaintiff, William A. Bettez (William),1 appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the defendants, Robert A. Bettez (Robert), Ronald A. Bettez (Ronald), and Attorney Daniel Stone (Attorney Stone) as co-executors of the estate of Rudolph T. Bettez (collectively, defendants), dismissing the plaintiff’s appeal and sustaining the decision of the Probate Court of the Town of Scituate allowing the last will and testament of Rudolph T. Bettez (Rudolph).', 'After considering the arguments advanced by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'Rudolph passed away on December 4, 2010. He was survived by his three sons—Robert, Ronald, and William—as well as his second wife, Joyce Bettez (Joyce). Rudolph also had a daughter, Deborah Bettez, who predeceased him but left two children, Sarah Vernon and Jesse 1', 'First names may be used throughout this decision for ease of reading. We intend no disrespect.', '-1- King. Rudolph’s four children were from his first marriage, to Barbara Bettez (Barbara), who passed away in December 2003. Before Barbara passed away, she and Rudolph had entered into a joint revocable trust agreement on February 13, 2003 (Bettez Trust). The Bettez Trust was drafted by Attorney Stone. The Bettez Trust became an irrevocable trust when Barbara passed away.', 'After Barbara’s death, the relationship between Rudolph and William steadily deteriorated, to the point, according to William, that he became the “black sheep” of the family. William testified at his deposition that “if it wasn’t for my mama, I would have beat the [****] out of [Rudolph] after he hit [Barbara].” In addition to the animosity arising from the alleged domestic discord, the relationship between Rudolph and William was strained based on their financial dealings. On December 23, 2003, William executed a promissory note in favor of his father, whereby William was to repay a loan made in the amount of $130,200 that was paid to a company controlled by William—Global Industries & Technologies, Inc. (Global). In order to obtain the funds necessary to loan the money to Global, Rudolph secured a bank loan. The terms of the loan were the same terms that were extended to William in the promissory note. However, William failed to make the monthly payments in accordance with the terms of the promissory note; and, in 2006, Rudolph settled the debt owed to the bank by using proceeds from the sale of a general store he owned.', 'Further tension arose because of William’s chronic failure to pay rent that was owing to Rudolph, his landlord, in a timely manner. William rented both a residential and a commercial property from his father.', 'Rudolph—through Attorney Stone—communicated with William regarding the terms of the lease for the two properties. On August 12, 2008, Attorney Stone wrote that the continued nonpayment or late payment of rent would no longer be tolerated by', '-2- Rudolph. William subsequently entered into a new lease agreement with Rudolph in November 2009, which provided that William would pay a reduced rent on a weekly basis. Despite the new agreement, William continued to pay rent sporadically.', 'There were also other nonrecurring financial dealings that caused further tension between Rudolph and William. For example, William maintained an outstanding account at a general store owned by Rudolph. When the store eventually was sold, William claimed that Barbara “forgave” the outstanding debt owed at the store. Also, in early 2009, William received $18,000 from Rudolph to refurbish a truck. Further evidence suggests that William received an extra $10,000 from Rudolph when disbursements were being made by Rudolph to his children from a trust fund.', 'Joyce and Rudolph began dating in March 2009, and on October 3, 2009, they were married.', 'In anticipation of his marriage, Rudolph contacted Attorney Stone to prepare a prenuptial agreement and a new will.', 'In late September 2009, Rudolph executed both documents. The will, according to Attorney Stone, took several drafts to complete and some of the changes had been discussed by Rudolph for several years. The new will excluded William from a share of the Bettez Trust. However, it also released William from any debts owed to Rudolph. The will specifically explained these changes as follows:', '“My omission to make any other provision herein for my said son', '[William], is due to my belief that funds heretofore advanced to', 'him, as loans, as rent not paid by him for properties occupied by', 'him personally and by his business interests, and otherwise,', 'constitute adequate provision for him in respect of my estate, the', 'estate of my late spouse, Barbara Bettez and the Bettez Trust.” The intentional exclusion of William as a beneficiary was confirmed by Joyce, who testified in a deposition that Rudolph had declared that “[William] had already had his share.” Furthermore, it', '-3- was William’s observation that, during the brief courtship of Rudolph and Joyce, Rudolph was “of his own mind.”', 'On December 22, 2010, Robert petitioned the Probate Court of the Town of Scituate to admit his father’s September 2009 will to probate. On July 20, 2012, the will was admitted to probate by a consent order entered by the Probate Court of the Town of Scituate and agreed to by all parties. On August 6, 2012, William filed a claim of appeal in the Probate Court of the Town of Scituate; and, later, on August 17, 2012, he filed his reasons of appeal in Superior Court. William alleged that the judgment of the Probate Court of the Town of Scituate should be vacated because Rudolph lacked testamentary capacity when he executed the will and because he was subject to undue influence.2 The defendants filed a motion for summary judgment that was heard before the Superior Court on March 19, 2013. On April 17, 2013, the Superior Court justice issued a written decision granting defendants’ motion and finding that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The plaintiff alleges that there existed a conflict of interest with Attorney Stone and that, therefore, his involvement in drafting the documents was improper.3 Furthermore, plaintiff asserts that it was Barbara’s intent that the Bettez children each receive an equal distribution from the trust and that his siblings unduly influenced Rudolph to change the planned equal-distribution scheme.', '“Undue influence is the ‘substitution of the will of [the dominant] party for the free will and choice [of the subservient party].’” In re Estate of Picillo, 99 A.3d 975, 982 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Filippi v.

See Campbell v. Rhode Island Hospital Trust Co., 125 A. 220, 221 (R.I. 1924) (“The evidence of opportunity, unaccompanied by evidence, direct or indirect, that such influence was exerted, does not warrant the submission of the issue to the jury, nor will it support a finding that the instrument was the result of undue influence. There is an entire absence of direct evidence of such influence, nor was there anything in the case from which a reasonable inference to that effect can be drawn. It is true, as the appellants argue, that undue influence, from its nature, is usually exerted secretly and is difficult of proof. The lack of evidence, however, does not warrant a resort to conjecture to establish its existence.”).

She hated me because I wouldn’t put up with her bull[* * * *].”', '-6- put it, “pure, unsubstantiated speculation that is wholly unsupported in the record.” Rather, in his will, Rudolph specifically addressed why he decided to exclude William from any share in the Bettez Trust. The reasons enumerated in the will—that William already had received substantial sums from Rudolph that constituted an adequate provision—are supported by the record and are unchallenged by William. For example, William acknowledged that he did not make the payments due on the $130,200 promissory note. William also admitted that he paid rent “[a]s much as possible” but agreed that this meant that he did not pay rent on a regular or timely basis. The provision excluding William from the Bettez Trust reflected Rudolph’s belief that, by the forgiveness of his numerous and substantial outstanding debts, William was adequately compensated.', 'The plaintiff’s broad-based allegations that Attorney Stone—in conjunction with William’s siblings—somehow exerted undue influence over Rudolph are not sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment without the production of “competent evidence that ‘prove[s] the existence of a disputed issue of material fact[.]’” Sullo, 68 A.3d at 407 (quoting Mutual Development Corp., 47 A.3d at 323).5', 'Even in a probate appeal proceeding such as this, at summary judgment, the nonmoving party bears the “affirmative duty to set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact.” Bourg v.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court denying the motion to intervene.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The petitioners Joseph and Angitta DiOrio live in Cumberland, Rhode Island, on a parcel of property identified in the record as Cumberland Tax Assessor’s Plat No. 49, Lot No. 56 (the DiOrio property),2 which directly abuts property identified in the record as Cumberland Tax Assessor’s Plat No. 49, Lot No. 57 (the Hines Road property),3 owned by plaintiff Hines Road, LLC. In 2006, plaintiff built a retaining wall on the Hines Road property in close proximity to the DiOrio property. According to petitioners, in 2008, defendant, the Town, ordered plaintiff to remove said retaining wall and “return the Hines Road property to its original configuration.” However, petitioners assert that plaintiff failed to comply with that order; and, according to petitioners’ filings, in both March and September of 2010, the Town proceeded to issue two separate Notices of Violation to plaintiff with respect to the Hines Road property.', 'The petitioners further allege that each Notice cited plaintiff’s failure to comply with permit requirements promulgated by the Town and that each Notice included both a stop-work order and a requirement that plaintiff remove the retaining wall.4 2', 'The DiOrio property is located at 21 Georgiana Drive in Cumberland. 3', 'The Hines Road property is located at 138 Wrentham Road in Cumberland. 4', 'The stop-work order related to construction of the retaining wall, according to an agreement between plaintiff and the Town, which is described infra.', '-2-', 'In October of 2010, plaintiff appealed to the Town’s Zoning Board of Review (the Board) with respect to the Notices of Violation.', 'However, in March of 2011, during the pendency of that appeal, plaintiff and the Town came to an agreement regarding the retaining wall (the Agreement). The Agreement provided, inter alia, that plaintiff would: (1) complete certain tasks related to the permitting and construction of the retaining wall on the Hines Road property; and (2) withdraw its appeal to the Board. In return, the Agreement indicated that the Town would, inter alia, withdraw its stop-work order relative to the retaining wall on the Hines Road property. Subsequent to the execution of the Agreement, plaintiff withdrew its appeal to the Board as promised.', 'It was at that point in time, after the parties had entered into the Agreement, that petitioners undertook their first attempt to challenge the arrangement that had been agreed to by plaintiff and the Town; they did so by filing an appeal with the Board. However, in October of 2011, the Board determined that it did not have jurisdiction over petitioners’ challenge (the 2011 Board decision).5', 'According to plaintiff’s Superior Court complaint, the Board held that, “because [the Agreement] was a contract between the Town and a private party [viz., plaintiff],” the Board lacked jurisdiction. Significantly, petitioners did not appeal from that decision.', 'In spite of the existing arrangement between plaintiff and the Town, by July of 2012 it appeared that plaintiff had not yet completed the work contemplated by the Agreement with respect to the retaining wall on the Hines Road property.

Regardless, it is clear that the Board declined to exercise its jurisdiction in the matter.', '-3- remove the unsafe wall at the [Hines Road property].” As it had done with respect to earlier Notices, plaintiff appealed to the Board from the issuance of that third Notice. In response, in October of 2012, the Board determined that it lacked jurisdiction over the matter (the 2012 Board decision). Accordingly, unable to obtain redress from the Board, in November of 2012 plaintiff filed a complaint in Superior Court in order to litigate issues relating to the Agreement, thereby commencing the underlying action, in which the parties are plaintiff and the Town. Each count of the complaint directly relates to the Agreement and the parties’ ability to litigate its status before the Board and in Superior Court. Specifically, the complaint contains four counts: (1) a claim for declaratory judgment regarding the Superior Court’s jurisdiction to “declare the rights and responsibilities of the Parties pursuant to the Agreement” (Count One); (2) a claim for equitable estoppel pertaining to the procedural propriety of plaintiff’s attempts to appeal from the 2012 Notice of Violation (Count Two); (3) a claim for injunctive relief to prevent the Town from undertaking legal action against plaintiff in regard to the Hines Road property until the Superior Court “determine[s] the rights, duties and obligations of the parties pursuant to the Agreement and applicable law” (Count Three); and (4) a claim that the 2012 Board decision to the effect that the Board lacked jurisdiction over plaintiff’s appeal prejudiced “the substantial rights of * * * Plaintiff” (Count Four). In sum, all four counts related to either the Agreement between plaintiff and the Town or plaintiff’s appeal from the 2012 Board decision determining that the Board lacked jurisdiction.', 'Some months later, in February of 2013, petitioners filed a motion to intervene in the underlying Superior Court action pursuant to Rule 24.

In addition, petitioners argued that they should be permitted to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(b),', '-4- which rule deals with permissive intervention. The plaintiff objected to petitioners’ motion to intervene; the Town, by contrast, did not file any response to petitioners’ motion.', 'After conducting a hearing on the motion (attended by the parties and the would-be intervenors), the hearing justice rendered a bench decision denying petitioners’ motion to intervene with respect to both intervention as a matter of right and permissive intervention.', 'First, with regard to intervention as a matter of right, the hearing justice ruled that the petitioners were not able to demonstrate that they had a right to intervene pursuant to Rule 24(a); in so ruling, the hearing justice was guided by the four-factor test articulated by this Court in Tonetti Enterprises, LLC v. Mendon Road Leasing Corp., 943 A.2d 1063, 1072-73 (R.I. 2008) (hereinafter Tonetti). In our opinion in Tonetti, we described the four-factor test as follows:', '“Under Rule 24(a)(2), an applicant will be granted intervention as', 'of right if [(1)] the applicant files a timely application * * * ,', '[(2)] the applicant claims an interest relating to the property or', 'transaction which is the subject matter of the action, [(3)] the', 'disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or', 'impede the applicant’s ability to protect that interest, and [(4)] the', 'applicant’s interest is not adequately represented by current parties', 'to the action * * * .” Tonetti, 943 A.2d at 1072-73 (emphasis', 'added).', 'The hearing justice began his analysis by focusing on the first factor, finding that petitioners’ motion was timely filed. However, he then proceeded to find that petitioners had failed to satisfy the second and third factors of the Tonetti test.', 'Specifically, as to the second factor, the hearing justice stated that, although petitioners’ interest in the underlying action was “close,” he found that interest to be “contingent upon a determination of the Agreement,” and he stated that “[t]he [A]greement is between the parties [i.e., plaintiff and the Town], and the DiOrios [petitioners] are not a party to that [A]greement.”', '-5- As such, the hearing justice concluded that petitioners’ interest did not sufficiently relate to the subject matter of the underlying action so as to satisfy the second factor of the Tonetti test.', 'Next, with respect to the third factor of the Tonetti test, the hearing justice found that the underlying action did not “threaten to impede [petitioners’] ability to protect [their] interest because * * * there [were] other legal actions that [petitioners] could have pursued regarding the wall.” Thus, in the hearing justice’s estimation, the disposition of the underlying action would not impair petitioners’ ability to protect their own interests; for that reason, he concluded that petitioners had failed to satisfy the third factor of the Tonetti test.', 'Notwithstanding his negative findings with respect to the second and third factors, the hearing justice went on to find that petitioners had made a “satisfactory showing” regarding the fourth factor of the Tonetti test—namely, that the existing parties in the underlying action did not adequately represent petitioners’ interests. Nevertheless, having determined that petitioners had failed to demonstrate that they satisfied (as required) all four factors of the Tonetti test, the hearing justice concluded that petitioners were not entitled to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a)(2). See Tonetti, 943 A.2d at 1072-73.', 'Finally, the hearing justice turned to petitioners’ contention that they should be permitted to intervene under Rule 24(b)(2) (permissive intervention). Pursuant to Rule 24(b)(2), “[u]pon timely application anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action * * * [w]hen an applicant’s claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common.” In light of the hearing justice’s earlier finding that the motion was timely, he moved directly to consider whether there existed a common question of law or fact between petitioners’ claims and the underlying action. The hearing justice found, however, that petitioners had not demonstrated the existence of a common question of law or fact because “the issues to be litigated in [the', '-6- underlying action] are not the same factual or legal issues that would be litigated in any action that [petitioners] would seek to litigate regarding their interest vis-à-vis the Hines Road property.” On that basis, the hearing justice concluded that petitioners had failed to demonstrate that they should be accorded the status of permissive intervenors.', 'In sum, the hearing justice found that petitioners could neither demonstrate their right to intervene under Rule 24(a)(2) nor show an adequate basis to justify permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)(2); accordingly, he denied petitioners’ Rule 24 motion to intervene. From the hearing justice’s decision, petitioners timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Although we have described Rhode Island precedent concerning motions for intervention as “sparse,” Tonetti, 943 A.2d at 1073; Credit Union Central Falls v. Groff, 871 A.2d 364, 367 (R.I. 2005), we have nonetheless indicated with respect to intervention as of right that “[t]his Court reviews a trial justice’s grant of a motion to intervene for abuse of discretion, reversing only if the justice failed to apply the standards set forth in Rule 24(a)(2), or otherwise committed clear error.” Town of Coventry v.

See Town of Smithfield v. Fanning, 602 A.2d 939, 943-44 (R.I. 1992) (holding that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion by declining to grant permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)).', '-7-', 'III', 'Analysis', 'The petitioners raise three arguments on appeal. First, noting the fact that petitioners’ property “directly abuts” the Hines Road property and relying upon their interpretation of our decision in Caran v. Freda, 108 R.I. 748, 279 A.2d 405 (1971), petitioners argue that their status as abutting property owners entitles them to intervene as a matter of right in the underlying action between plaintiff and the Town. Second, petitioners contend that the hearing justice erred in ruling that their interest in the instant litigation is “contingent” upon the Agreement between plaintiff and the Town. Specifically, petitioners argue that the Notice of Violation at issue in the 2012 Board decision was not related “in any way” to the Agreement made between plaintiff and the Town. Finally, petitioners argue that their failure to appeal from the original 2011 Board decision determining that it lacked jurisdiction over petitioners’ appeal ought not to be “held against” them. We shall address each of petitioners’ arguments below.', 'A', 'Rights of Abutting Property Owners', 'We begin with petitioners’ contention that the Caran decision affords them the right to intervene in the underlying action. To put that contention in context, we shall first refresh the reader’s recollection of our ruling in that case. In Caran, 108 R.I. at 749-50, 279 A.2d at 406-07, a town zoning board of review held a hearing on an application for a variance related to the proposed construction of a shopping center. Those who appeared before the board included the applicants themselves as well as owners of property abutting the site at issue; the attorney for those abutters entered an appearance at the hearing and voiced their concerns regarding the variance at issue. Id. at 750, 279 A.2d at 406. The town ultimately denied the application for the', '-8- variance, and the applicants appealed to the Superior Court, serving a complaint upon the town solicitor, but failing to serve the attorney who had represented the abutting property owners at the zoning board of review hearing. Id. Our opinion in the Caran case passed upon the issue of whether to apply a procedural rule requiring service of the complaint upon the abutting property owners in the context of the applicants’ appeal to the Superior Court; however, this Court also had occasion to pass upon the propriety of intervention by the abutting property owners in the initial application hearing before the town’s zoning board of review. Id. at 753, 279 A.2d at 408. Specifically, we stated:', '“[The] petitioners, as abutting property owners, have a special', 'interest in the pending appeal. If the right of appeal is lost to the', 'board, it is conceivable that petitioners would be confronted with a', 'threat of loss in the value and enjoyment of their property. This', 'potential threat gives petitioners the right to invoke the mandatory', 'provisions of Rule 24(a).” Caran, 108 R.I. at 753, 279 A.2d at 408. Upon scrutinizing the facts of the Caran case as described above, it is apparent that the attendant circumstances in that case differ significantly from those at bar. Most critically, in Caran the abutting property owners had a clear interest in the ultimate decision on the merits regarding a zoning variance that would permit construction of a shopping center on land directly adjoining their property. Specifically, the eventual disposition of the applicants’ appeal would determine whether or not the shopping center would be constructed. Id.', 'By contrast, in the instant case, an adjudication concerning the Agreement between plaintiff and the Town would not yield a decision as to whether or not to construct the retaining wall. Unlike the petitioners in Caran, who, if not permitted to intervene, may have found themselves living next to a shopping center without having had a voice in the zoning decision which would have permitted its construction, petitioners in the instant case are already living with what is in their eyes the rough equivalent of that shopping center, because the wall has', '-9- already been built. Furthermore, although the fact that the wall has been built may appear to support petitioners’ argument that their circumstances are similar to—or perhaps more dire than—that of the abutting property owners in Caran, we emphasize that the underlying action in the instant case simply permits plaintiff and the Town to resolve the issues surrounding whether or not plaintiff has lived up to the Agreement—an Agreement that relates to the wall, but is a contract to which petitioners are not a party. In other words, petitioners’ chosen route to attack the construction of the wall is both untimely (the wall has already been built) and procedurally inappropriate (since the instant case relates not to the merits of constructing the wall, but rather the Agreement between plaintiff and the Town).', 'In sum, we are not persuaded that petitioners’ status as abutting property owners ipso facto entitles them to intervene in this particular case as a matter of right. We therefore hold that the hearing justice did not err in concluding that petitioners were not entitled to intervene as a matter of right pursuant to our decision in Caran.', 'B', 'The Petitioners’ Interest in the Underlying Action', 'The petitioners next argue that the hearing justice erred in ruling that their interest in the Superior Court action is merely “contingent” upon the Agreement between plaintiff and the Town. In Tonetti, we addressed that consideration explicitly, stating that “[a]n intervenor’s interest must bear a sufficiently close relationship to the dispute between the original litigants and the interest must be direct, not contingent.” Tonetti, 943 A.2d at 1073 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). By its very nature, the underlying action in the case at bar concerns the dispute between plaintiff and the Town; the litigation centers on the Agreement between those parties and whether or not the Board could exercise jurisdiction over the dispute', '- 10 - between them. Furthermore, the four counts of the complaint relate to a claim for declaratory judgment (regarding the Agreement), a claim for equitable estoppel (pertaining to plaintiff’s attempts to appeal from the 2012 Notice of Violation), a claim for injunctive relief to prevent the Town from undertaking legal action against plaintiff until the underlying action is resolved, and a claim that the 2012 Board decision (to the effect that it lacked jurisdiction over plaintiff’s appeal) prejudiced plaintiff’s rights.', 'It is clear that the underlying action concerns the Agreement between plaintiff and the Town. Any legally cognizable interest of petitioners in the underlying action depends upon the resolution of the Agreement and may be fairly characterized as “contingent” upon such resolution. See Tonetti, 943 A.2d at 1073. Accordingly, we agree with the hearing justice— petitioners’ interest in the underlying action is “contingent” upon the Agreement between plaintiff and the Town; consequently, we hold that the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in so ruling.', 'C', 'The Petitioners’ Failure to Appeal from the 2011 Board Decision', 'Finally, petitioners contend that the hearing justice erred in considering their failure to appeal from the 2011 Board decision as a factor weighing against intervention in the underlying action. However, even if we were persuaded that petitioners’ failure to appeal from the 2011 Board decision ought not to be considered in conjunction with whether they satisfied the four Tonetti factors, the hearing justice’s decision denying intervention did not constitute an abuse of discretion—simply because there were other grounds for his finding that the disposition of the action did not impede petitioners’ ability to protect their interest in their property. Notably, the hearing justice found: (1) that the wall had already been constructed; and (2) that other legal', '- 11 - avenues existed that petitioners could have initiated. We are persuaded that those two findings suffice to show that the disposition of the action would not impede petitioners’ ability to protect their interest in their property.', 'First, any interest that petitioners had in preventing the construction of the wall has been precluded by its construction, which occurred before plaintiff even initiated the underlying action.', 'Second, with respect to the ability of petitioners to undertake other legal actions, we note that petitioners conceded at oral argument that they have initiated a separate legal proceeding with respect to their concerns regarding the wall as it affects the DiOrio property. Accordingly, we hold that the hearing justice did not commit reversible error in considering petitioners’ failure to appeal from the 2011 Board decision as one factor weighing against intervention.', 'In sum, we hold that the petitioners have not raised any arguments that demonstrate that the hearing justice abused his discretion in finding that the petitioners failed to fulfill the four Tonetti factors, with respect to Rule 24(a)(2) intervention, nor have the petitioners proffered any convincing arguments that demonstrate that the hearing justice abused his discretion in finding that the petitioners were not entitled to permissive intervention.6 As such, we hold that the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in denying the petitioners’ motion to intervene. 6', 'We note that all three of petitioners’ arguments on appeal have been presented supra, and that those contentions noticeably lack any specific legal arguments that relate to whether or not the hearing justice erred in denying petitioners’ motion for permissive intervention. To the extent that petitioners’ claims of error on appeal related to the hearing justice’s decision on their motion for permissive intervention, we note that our analysis above has effectively disposed of these arguments. Should there exist other legal arguments for permissive intervention by petitioners in the underlying action, petitioners have failed to raise those arguments before us, and, on the basis of our well-settled precedent, we deem those arguments to be waived.

25,State : v. : Jack Gregson.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on April 1, 2015, on appeal of the defendant, Jack Gregson (defendant). Following a jury trial in the Superior Court, the defendant was convicted of one count of first-degree sexual assault; one count of second-degree sexual assault; two counts of assault with intent to commit second-degree sexual assault; and two counts of indecent solicitation of a minor. 1 On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial justice committed two errors of law that require this Court to vacate those convictions: (1) the denial of the defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars; and (2) the denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth below, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err, and we affirm. 1', 'The defendant initially was charged with one count of first-degree sexual assault (count one); three counts of second-degree sexual assault (counts two, three, and four); and two counts of indecent solicitation of a minor (counts five and six). However, prior to trial, the trial justice granted the state’s motion to amend counts three and four to the lesser included offense of assault with intent to commit second-degree sexual assault. The defendant acceded to this request.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The testimony at trial disclosed the following facts. In the summer of 2011, fifteen-year- old Grace 2 resided with her mother and little brother in Warwick, Rhode Island. Grace is the granddaughter of defendant. During that summer, defendant saw Grace approximately three times a week, and he was close to her—buying her food, giving her rides, and talking with her. Grace began to confide in defendant about “[d]rama, boyfriend problems, [and] home issues.”', 'The relationship changed, however, and Grace became uncomfortable when defendant started asking her questions about her “G-spot” and whether she had yet to experience an orgasm. Grace testified that, in late September 2011, while defendant was spending a week at Grace’s home because her mother was hospitalized, defendant gave her an alcoholic beverage, which made her so sleepy that she went to bed. She testified that the next thing she remembered is waking up to someone moving her leg, rolling her onto her back, and taking her underwear off. She testified that she felt someone’s tongue moving around in her vaginal area. Grace then stated that she opened her eyes and saw her grandfather, shirtless. She testified that she felt confused and scared. Then, as defendant began to touch her breasts, she moved back into the position she had been in, prior to being violated, and defendant “got up and walked away.” Grace testified that, before leaving her room, defendant stated: “I was trying to teach you something.”', '“Upset[, s]cared[, and c]onfused[,]” Grace testified that she called her friend, Ryan, 3 and climbed out of her bedroom window and spent the night with him. Grace testified that she did not tell anyone in her family about what happened because she “didn’t want to tear [her] family apart and [she] was confused.” 2', 'In order to protect the child’s privacy, she has been given a pseudonym. 3', 'In order to protect this child’s privacy, he has also been given a pseudonym.', '-2-', 'In October 2011, defendant persuaded Grace to accompany him to a liquor store. Grace testified that, during that encounter, defendant propositioned her, stating “that he would pay [her] $100 if [she] would let him perform oral sex on [her].” She testified that she refused. The defendant then went into the liquor store and returned with vodka and cranberry juice, a drink that Grace admitted she enjoyed. The defendant then drove Grace to Oakland Beach, where defendant poured Grace two drinks of vodka and cranberry juice. Grace testified that, after consuming the drinks, she felt “dizzy” and “unbalanced.”', 'After leaving Oakland Beach, defendant expressed his sexual interest in Grace’s thirteen- year-old cousin. Next, Grace testified that defendant then parked the vehicle and put his hand over her clothes on her vaginal area, to which she responded by smacking his hand away. However, defendant was persistent, and he tried to touch her vaginal area again, this time placing his hand underneath the lace of her pants. Grace testified that she again hit his hand away. She stated that she felt scared and “didn’t want him touching [her].” Grace did not immediately report these incidents to anyone; and, when asked at trial why she had not told anyone, Grace replied: “I was scared. I didn’t want to tear my family apart. I was very confused.”', 'Next, Grace testified about another incident that occurred only a few days later. On October 14, 2011, she contacted her grandfather and asked him to pick her up at the bus stop because it was raining, and she wanted to get pizza. The defendant responded to Grace’s request with a text message asking, “[w]hat do I get to eat?”4', 'Grace responded, “[p]izza.” The defendant again messaged Grace and said, “[y]ou know what.” To which Grace replied, “[u]m, what? You make no sense.” The defendant responded, “[i]t’s low, bald, and has no hair.” Grace testified that her vagina was hairless at the time and that she believed he was talking about 4', 'The text messages were recovered by the Warwick Police Department and admitted into evidence.', '-3- her vagina.', 'The defendant proceeded to text Grace again, this time stating, “[w]e should get [your younger cousin].” Grace testified that this text message made her “[w]orried” because she “thought he was going to try to do what he did to [her] to [her] cousin.” That day she asked defendant to drop her at her cousin’s home, and she proceeded to tell her family about what her grandfather had done to her. The police were called, and defendant subsequently was arrested.', 'The defendant was charged by grand jury indictment with one count of first-degree sexual assault, three counts of second-degree sexual assault, and two counts of indecent solicitation of a minor. Prior to trial, two of the second-degree sexual assault counts were amended to the lesser included offense of assault with intent to commit second-degree sexual assault. The jury convicted defendant of all counts.', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in denying a motion for a bill of particulars and also erred in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. We address each argument in turn.', 'Analysis', 'Motion for Bill of Particulars', 'Prior to trial, defense counsel moved for a bill of particulars pursuant to Rule 7(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 5 Defense counsel asserted that, with respect to the count of first-degree sexual assault and second-degree sexual assault,', '“[t]he State could either prove that the accused * * * knows', 'or has reason to know that the complaining witness is mentally', 'incapacitated, mentally disabled, or physically helpless. * * * Or 5', 'The record disclosed that defense counsel filed two motions for bills of particulars in this case, and the state filed one response. However, at a hearing before the trial justice, defense counsel withdrew his first motion. Therefore, the motion filed on October 21, 2013, the second bill of particulars, is the motion properly before this Court.', '-4-', 'the State could prove that the accused used force or coercion; or', 'the State could prove that the accused, through concealment or by', 'element of surprise, is able to overcome the complaining witness', '* * *.', '“[The State’s] response to my motion for bill of particulars', '* * * [is that] the victim was physically helpless and/or through the', 'use of force or coercion.”', '“[The defendant] is not on notice as to what elements the State', 'intends to prove. If the State intends to prove that the complaining', 'witness was physically helpless, I certainly could prepare a cross-', 'examination of the complaining witness knowing that is what the', 'State intends to prove. Conversely, if the State intends to prove', 'force or coercion, I could prepare a cross-examination anticipating', 'being on notice that is the element that the State intends to prove.” In response, the state submitted an answer to defense counsel’s motion for a second bill of particulars and asserted that defendant was on notice that the prosecution would present evidence establishing that defendant had reason to know that Grace was physically helpless and that defendant used force or coercion in accomplishing the charged offenses. The state contended that, consistent with Rhode Island law, because the facts support both theories, it could present evidence to the jury on both theories, and the jury, making the ultimate determination, “could be unanimous on both or one and not the other.” The trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars, stating that he “disagree[d] with defense counsel’s contention that the State[,] in terms of the charge[,] needs to pick under which element [of the offense]” defendant acted. Significantly, the trial justice charged the jury on only one of the state’s theories—that Grace was physically helpless. The trial justice did not charge the jury on the element of force or coercion.', 'Before this Court, defendant argues that the trial justice committed reversible error when he denied defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars because defendant was forced to defend without adequate notice of the charges. We disagree.', '-5-', '“[T]he function of a bill of particulars is to apprise a defendant of the evidentiary details establishing the facts of the offense when such facts have not been included in the indictment or information.” State v. Rivera, 987 A.2d 887, 904 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. LaChapelle, 638 A.2d 525, 527 (R.I. 1994)); see also Wayne R. LaFave et al., 5 Criminal Procedure § 19.4(a) (3d ed. 2014). “The primary purpose of the bill is to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial.” LaChapelle, 638 A.2d at 527; see also State v. Saluter, 715 A.2d 1250, 1253 (R.I. 1998). It is incumbent upon the trial justice to carefully instruct the jury consistent with the bill of particulars. See Rivera, 987 A.2d at 904.', 'This Court has stated that “the granting of a bill of particulars in any civil or criminal proceeding is within the discretion of the justice who hears the motion and his discretion will not be disturbed unless it appears that there has been an abuse of discretion.” Union Mortgage Co. v. Rocheleau, 51 R.I. 345, 348, 154 A. 658, 660 (1931).', '“Rule 16 [of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure] and its mandate for extensive disclosure of evidence for use at trial, ‘[is] designed to be broad in scope so that neither the defense nor the prosecution is surprised at trial.’” State v. Oster, 922 A.2d 151, 163 (R.I. 2007) (quoting State v. Powers, 526 A.2d 489, 491 (R.I. 1987)). This Court has noted, however, that the Rule 16 disclosure requirements are not to “be employed as a procedural device for the later exclusion of material evidence.” Id. The same observation applies to a bill of particulars.', 'In the case before us, we are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in refusing to order the state to provide another bill of particulars. The elements of first-degree sexual assault, under G.L. 1956 § 11-37-2 and second-degree sexual assault, under § 11-37-4 are not, as defense counsel suggested, mutually exclusive. The state provided defendant with adequate notice that it intended to proceed under both theories—that Grace was physically helpless and that defendant', '-6- used force or coercion when he assaulted her. The state was not under a duty to elect, prior to trial, which theory it would pursue. See State v. Waite, 484 A.2d 887, 890 (R.I. 1984) (noting that “[t]he technical precision of the common law rule of criminal pleading that required that a complaint set forth specifically everything that was necessary for the government to prove to establish the offense charged is no longer required”). Additionally, we have stated that “because the state bears the burden of proving each element of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt, it has the right to present evidence establishing those elements in its case in chief.” State v. Marmolejos, 990 A.2d 848, 852 (R.I. 2010). Accordingly, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars.', 'We pause to note that defense counsel also contends on appeal that the trial justice erred when he failed to specifically instruct the jury on which element it must find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. After a thorough examination of the record, it is apparent that defendant failed to preserve this issue for appellate review. Prior to charging the jury, the trial justice indicated that both defense counsel and the prosecutor could submit any proposed jury instructions or verdict forms for consideration. As noted, the trial justice instructed the jury that, in order to return a verdict of guilty on the charge of first-degree sexual assault, they must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Grace was physically helpless. The trial justice then called both counsel to sidebar and asked if they had any objections to the court’s instructions. The state had no objections, but defense counsel requested to “go off the record,” and an unrecorded discussion ensued. The trial justice then summarized what had been discussed and provided an additional instruction to the jury, to which defense counsel had no objection. 6 Therefore, in accordance 6', 'The additional instruction stated the following:', '“Members of the jury, when I went through these [jury instructions], as I', 'said, you will have a copy of this with you. I want to make sure I clarify a couple', '-7- with this Court’s “raise-or-waive” rule, we deem defendant’s argument waived. See Berard v. HCP, Inc., 64 A.3d 1215, 1219 n.2 (R.I. 2013) (noting that the Court “shall ‘not review issues that were not presented to the trial court in such a posture as to alert the trial justice to the question being raised[.]’” quoting State v. Kluth, 46 A.3d 867, 876 (R.I. 2012)). Accordingly, we discern no error by the trial justice.', 'Motion for a New Trial', 'Next, defendant contends that the trial justice erred when he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. “When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v. Matthews, 88 A.3d 375, 387 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. at 387-88 (quoting Heredia, 10 A.3d at 446). “If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” Id. at 388 (quoting Heredia, 10 A.3d at 446). “Only when the trial justice does not agree with the jury’s verdict must he or she consider', 'of things. As you heard when I was going through the elements of some of the', 'different crimes charged, including the first degree. I had gone through and it’s', 'written in there exactly what the statute says. It deals with medical professionals.', 'It deals with something called force and coercion. It deals with helplessness.', '* * * Just make sure and it’s laid out in here you concentrate on not only on the', 'wording of the statute says but specifically what the State alleges they can prove.', 'That’s what you’re looking at * * *.” The trial justice also instructed the jury that his use of the word “victim” should have been “complaining witness.” Lastly, the trial justice corrected a misstatement where he said “consent” instead of “intent.”', '-8- whether reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome.” Id. (citing State v. LaPierre, 57 A.3d 305, 310 (R.I. 2012)). “[W]hen ‘the trial justice has articulated a sufficient rationale for denying a motion for a new trial, the decision will be given great weight’ and we will disturb it only if the trial justice ‘has overlooked or misconceived material evidence relating to a critical issue or if the justice was otherwise clearly wrong.’” Id. (quoting State v. Ferreira, 21 A.3d 355, 365 (R.I. 2011)).', 'In this case, the trial justice set forth his reasons for denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. Specifically, the trial justice determined that “there was substantial credible evidence * * * that the State met its burden beyond a reasonable doubt to convict [defendant] of these charges.” He noted that there was sufficient evidence presented for a jury to reject defense counsel’s contention that Grace consented to defendant’s conduct. Further, the trial justice articulated on the record evidence presented at trial that supported the jury’s verdict, noting that defendant “stooped to the point of offering [his granddaughter] money for sexual contact, getting her drunk and reaching down her pants, and * * * probably most egregious in this trial, is as she slept [he] stuck his tongue in her vagina.” Ultimately, the trial justice found “that there was sufficient evidence before this jury to form the basis for a conviction on each of the counts * * *.” Therefore, the trial justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence relating to a critical issue in this case.', 'Accordingly, we discern no error by the trial justice in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'Clerical Error', 'Finally, our thorough review of the record before us reveals that the final judgment entered in this case failed to reflect the amendments of counts three and four from second-degree', '-9- sexual assault to assault with intent to commit second-degree sexual assault. Rule 36 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure concerning clerical mistakes in judgments provides that, “while [an] appeal is pending[, clerical mistakes in judgments] may be so corrected with leave of the Supreme Court.” Accordingly, included in our remand order we direct that final judgment in this case be corrected to reflect the amended two counts. 7', 'Conclusion', 'The defendant’s appeal is denied and dismissed, and the judgment of convictions is affirmed.', 'We remand this case to the Superior Court with directions to correct the final judgment to reflect the amended counts in the indictment. The papers may be returned to the Superior Court. Justice Indeglia did not participate. 7', 'The state did not object to the Court remanding this case for the limited purpose of correcting the final judgment.', '- 10 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'State v.

26,,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The petitioner, Norman T. Gadomski, Jr. (Gadomski or petitioner), seeks review by petition for common law writ of certiorari of a decision of the respondent, Joseph H. Tavares (Tavares or respondent), the Chief of Police for the City of East Providence (city or East Providence), denying the petitioner’s application for a license to carry a concealed weapon pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 11-47-11. On April 2, 2015, this case came before the Supreme Court sitting at Rhode Island College in the City of Providence, for oral argument, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this petition should not be decided without further briefing and argument. After considering the parties’ submitted memoranda and oral arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown.', 'Accordingly, we shall decide the petition at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, the decision denying the petitioner’s application is quashed.', 'Further, the respondent is directed to issue a new decision on the petitioner’s application not inconsistent with this opinion.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In early 2012, Gadomski, a resident of East Providence, submitted to the East Providence Police Department an application for a license to carry a concealed weapon. The application indicated that Gadomski wanted a license because he occasionally works alone handling cash and expensive tools and equipment, carries cash when purchasing firearms for his collection, and because he camps, hikes, and bikes alone. The application also stated that Gadomski wanted a license from this state, in which he resides, so that he could obtain a nonresident license from Massachusetts, which would enable him to join a nearby gun club in Massachusetts. In response to a question in the application asking if the applicant had ever been arrested, petitioner replied in the affirmative, and attached his Criminal Offender Record Information (CORI) report from Massachusetts. The CORI report indicated that petitioner had been arraigned on misdemeanor charges twice as an adult. The first charge was for possession of alcohol by a minor, which was dismissed with a payment into the Victim-Witness Fund and court costs. The second charge was for destruction of property. Initially, a continuance without a finding was entered, and then later the charge was dismissed, again with a payment into the Victim-Witness Fund and court costs.', 'On March 20, 2012, Gadomski was interviewed by Tavares regarding petitioner’s application. Gadomski appeared at the interview without counsel. No record of the interview was transcribed or otherwise recorded. On April 27, 2012, petitioner, through counsel, sent a letter to Tavares regarding petitioner’s application. The letter indicated that petitioner had not heard anything from Tavares since the interview and requested that a permit be issued to him. On July 9, 2012, petitioner’s counsel sent a second letter to Tavares indicating that there still had not been any response from the city regarding petitioner’s application.', 'This second letter', '-2- included copies of Gadomski’s concealed firearm permit issued by the State of Utah and his federal firearm license to be a collector of curios and relics, which petitioner had acquired since submitting his initial application. The petitioner asserts that there was no response to this letter.', 'On August 21, 2012, petitioner’s counsel sent a third letter to Tavares requesting copies of certain records pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 38-2-2. The letter requested copies of all East Providence records for the years 2007 through 2012 showing the number of applications for a license to carry a concealed weapon, the number of applications for such a license that were granted, and the time between receipt of an application and the issuance of a permit or denial of a request.', 'Subsequently, Gadomski’s counsel received a letter from Tavares responding to petitioner’s requests. The response indicated that, to Tavares’s knowledge, no license to carry a concealed weapon had been issued within the last decade and that, in order to receive a license, all requirements of the application must be met. On September 11, 2012, petitioner’s counsel sent another letter to Tavares indicating receipt of Tavares’s response and expressing frustration with the handling of petitioner’s application. The letter requested the issuance of the license to Gadomski or in the alternative, specification of the legal basis for refusal to do so. Tavares did not respond to this letter.', 'On October 5, 2012, Gadomski filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the Providence County Superior Court seeking an order requiring Tavares to rule on Gadomski’s application. In the interim, while Gadomski’s mandamus petition was still pending, Gadomski sent Tavares a copy of several other firearm-related certifications that he had acquired, including a pistol/revolver license from the State of New Hampshire.', 'On January 16, 2013, an East Providence police officer hand-delivered a letter to Gadomski, which served as official notice that Gadomski’s application for a license to carry a concealed weapon had been denied. In light', '-3- of this development, on January 18, 2013, the Superior Court denied Gadomski’s mandamus petition on the grounds that the denial had rendered the issue moot.', 'On February 15, 2013, Gadomski filed another action in the Superior Court, this time seeking review of the denial of his application pursuant to the Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15, and later, added a request for mandamus relief. Finding that Mosby v. Devine, 851 A.2d 1031 (R.I. 2004), was controlling, the Superior Court determined that it was without subject matter jurisdiction to entertain petitioner’s appeal and, therefore, dismissed the action.', 'The following year, on February 20, 2014, Gadomski filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, which we granted on June 12, 2014.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1048, we stated that “if a license is refused on the ground that a person is not suitable, th[at] determination is subject to review by this Court on certiorari.” Thus, petitioner has invoked the proper vehicle for judicial review of the denial of his application.', 'It is well settled that “[o]ur review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination of the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.” Cruz v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 108 A.3d 992, 995 (R.I. 2015) (quoting State v. Poulin, 66 A.3d 419, 423 (R.I. 2013)).', '-4-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'While the legal landscape surrounding the procurement of a license under the Firearms Act, chapter 47 of title 11, is far from saturated, we do not write on an entirely clean slate. In State v. Storms, 112 R.I. 121, 126-27, 308 A.2d 463, 466 (1973), this Court analyzed the propriety of the delegation of legislative power to licensing authorities under the Firearms Act. We noted that “our brief summary of some of the Act’s essential provisions clearly evidences that the goal of the Legislature was to prevent criminals and certain other persons from acquiring firearms generally and handguns in particular without at the same time making unduly difficult such acquisition for other members of society.” Id. at 127, 308 A.2d at 466. We recognized that, in order to effectuate that intent, among other provisions, the Firearms Act “established licensing procedures and delineated the broad parameters within which those selected by it might determine the facts upon which the right to be licensed to carry a handgun hinged.” Id. Further, we acknowledged that certain determinations required under the Firearms Act “call[ ] for an exercise of the fact-finding function.” Id. at 128, 308 A.2d at 466.', 'Over a quarter-century later, in Mosby, we commented further on the licensing scheme established by the Firearms Act. There, we recognized that “[t]wo separate and distinct licensing procedures are set forth in the Firearms Act.” Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1047. We observed that the licensing procedure in § 11-47-18, which was at issue in Mosby, “provides for the discretionary grant of a firearms license by the [D]epartment [of the Attorney General] ‘upon a proper showing of need’ * * *.” Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1047 (quoting § 11-47-18). In contrast, we noted that § 11-47-11, which grants local officials the power to issue licenses, “is mandatory—an', '-5- applicant who meets the criteria set forth in § 11-47-11 is entitled to a gun permit.” Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1047.', 'There are three components to the statutory scheme set forth in § 11-47-11: (1) an age and residency requirement; (2) a reason requirement; and (3) a suitability requirement. Each of these components must be satisfied in order for a license or permit to be issued under § 11-47-11. To satisfy the age and residency requirement, an applicant must be twenty-one years of age or older and have either (i) a bona fide residence or place of business within the city or town where applying, or (ii) a bona fide residence within the United States and a license or permit to carry a pistol or revolver concealed upon his or her person issued by the authorities of any other state or subdivision of the United States. The reason requirement demands that an applicant has either (i) a good reason to fear an injury to his or her person or property, or (ii) any other proper reason for carrying a pistol or revolver. Lastly, the suitability requirement necessitates that all applicants must be a “suitable person” to be licensed.', 'Notwithstanding the mandatory nature of § 11-47-11, there are certain individuals who may not be issued a license as a matter of law. See §§ 11-47-5, 11-47-6, 11-47-7, and 11-47-15. 1 Further, while issuance of a license under § 11-47-11 is mandatory if an applicant has satisfied the statutory criteria, whether an applicant has satisfied such criteria “involves an exercise of discretion” on the part of local officials. Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1048. In Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1047-48, we identified the key discretionary component of § 11-47-11 as the determination of whether an applicant has met the suitability requirement. In Storms, 112 R.I. at 128, 308 A.2d at 467, we opined that the Legislature vested local licensing authorities with the power to make such a determination because such individuals “by reason of their training and experience and 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-47-5 (persons convicted of crime of violence or who are fugitives from justice); § 11-47-6 (mental incompetents and drug addicts); § 11-47-7 (illegal aliens); § 11- 47-15 (persons who have failed to meet minimum firing qualification score).', '-6- the facilities at their command [are] probably more competent than any others to exercise the delegated power.” Accordingly, if the local licensing authority determines that an applicant is unsuitable, “§ 11-47-11 vests the local licensing authority with discretion to reject [the] application * * *.” Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1047-48.', 'Nonetheless, in Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1050, we proclaimed that “[a]s a matter of policy, this Court will not countenance any system of permitting under the Firearms Act that would be committed to the unfettered discretion of an executive agency.” Indeed, we noted that any rights flowing from article 1, section 22 of the Rhode Island Constitution2 would be “illusory, of course, if [they] could be abrogated entirely on the basis of an unreviewable unrestricted licensing scheme.” Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1050. To prevent such an occurrence, we opined that “certain procedural steps must be employed to allow a meaningful review” of licensing decisions by this Court. Id. at 1051. Specifically, we held that, under § 11-47-18, “[a] rejected applicant is entitled to know the evidence upon which the department based its decision and the rationale for the denial.” Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1051. It follows a fortiori that a rejected applicant under § 11- 47-11 is also entitled to such information.', 'Here, while respondent has provided slightly more substance in his denial letter than the denial letter 3 in Gendreau v. Canario, No. 2013-55-M.P., 2013 WL 6230071, at *1 (R.I., Sept. 18, 2013) (mem.), the denial letter proffered by respondent is still not a model of thoroughness. 2', 'Article 1, section 22 of the Rhode Island Constitution provides: “The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” 3', 'The letter in Gendreau v. Canario, No. 2013-55-M.P., 2013 WL 6230071, at *1 (R.I., Sept. 18, 2013) (mem.), stated in pertinent part:', '“After carefully reviewing the application and receiving a recommendation from', 'the panel which interviewed you with regards to your application for a concealed', 'weapon permit, it is with regret that I advise you that I feel that you do not meet', 'the criteria outlined in 11-47-11 of the General Laws of Rhode Island as amended,', 'as well as Bristol Police Department’s guidelines which would justify me issuing', 'you a concealed weapons permit.”', '-7- A local licensing authority need not write a decision rivaling War and Peace 4 in length, but its decision must still address the salient reasoning for the denial of a license. In doing so, the necessary findings to support the determination must be made, and “[t]hose findings must, of course, be factual rather than conclusional.” Bernuth v. Zoning Board of Review of New Shoreham, 770 A.2d 396, 401 (R.I. 2001) (quoting Irish Partnership v. Rommel, 518 A.2d 356, 358 (R.I. 1986)). Further, when there is a “fail[ure] to state findings of fact, the court will not search the record for supporting evidence or decide for itself what is proper in the circumstances.” Id. (quoting Irish Partnership, 518 A.2d at 359). It is imperative that the local authority acts as a “finder of fact, not a master of puppets.” Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1050.', 'In its entirety, Tavares’s denial letter stated:', '“This letter will serve as official noticed [sic] that your application for license to', 'carry a concealable weapon has been denied. Your disqualification was based', 'upon the fact that you failed to show good reason to fear an injury to yourself or', 'property. You failed to show a proper reason for carrying a pistol or revolver that', 'would allow me to issue you a license to carry a concealable firearm.', '“Based upon the above mentioned reasons, coupled with the fact that you have', 'previously engaged in criminal behavior that resulted in your arrest, I do not find', 'you, at this time, a suitable person to be issued a license to carry a concealable', 'weapon.” The statements that Gadomski failed to show a good reason to fear injury and failed to show a proper reason 5 for carrying a pistol or revolver are nothing “more than the recital of a litany.” 4', 'First published in 1869, Leo Tolstoy’s classic is commonly regarded as one of the greatest pieces of literature and has also garnered significant notoriety for being one of the longest works of all time. 5', 'Additionally, it should be noted that in Mosby v. Devine, 851 A.2d 1031, 1047 (R.I. 2004), after observing that the petitioner held “several gun licenses from other states” and was “[a]n avid gun collector,” we stated that the petitioner “ha[d] a proper reason for carrying a pistol or revolver.” Therefore, it appears that Gadomski, who also has gun licenses from other states and is a licensed gun collector, may have proffered at least one proper reason under the statute.', '-8- Bernuth, 770 A.2d at 401 (quoting Irish Partnership, 518 A.2d at 358-59). Such bare, rote conclusions are insufficient.', 'While Tavares’s denial letter refers, albeit in a perfunctory manner, to the components of § 11-47-11, there appears to have been error in respondent’s underlying analysis. As conceded by respondent’s counsel at oral argument, an incorrect standard was utilized in conducting the review of petitioner’s application. Indeed, a perusal of East Providence’s written policy on the carrying of weapons reveals that it is an inappropriate amalgamation of §§ 11-47-11 and 11-47- 18. As we have said, “[t]wo separate and distinct licensing procedures are set forth in the Firearms Act.” Mosby, 851 A.2d at 1047.', 'Yet, the policy asserts that an applicant must demonstrate a proper showing of need and lists verbatim the same factors that are considered by the Attorney General in assessing whether an applicant has made such a showing of need. Demonstration of a proper showing of need, which is a requirement under § 11-47-18, is not a component of § 11-47-11.', 'Additionally, on appeal, respondent avers that petitioner is unsuitable, contending that petitioner was untruthful in his application regarding his reasons for seeking a permit. The respondent alleges that he questioned Gadomski’s employment supervisor, who indicated that concealed weapons are not required for petitioner’s work and that no other employee carries a concealed weapon. However, no documentation of this questioning can be found in the record. Further, we must note that petitioner’s written application does not assert that a concealed weapon was required for his work. Rather, the application expresses petitioner’s desire to have a concealed weapon for certain reasons, which happen to include two work-related reasons. Moreover, petitioner’s application also includes three nonwork-related reasons why petitioner wants a concealed weapon permit.', '-9-', 'Lastly, the respondent asserts that the determination that Gadomski is unsuitable is bolstered by what the respondent has characterized as the petitioner having “engaged in criminal behavior that resulted in [the petitioner’s] arrest.” The petitioner asserts that any consideration of his misdemeanor charges, which were ultimately dismissed, was erroneous, arguing that no conclusions may be drawn from a mere arrest in the absence of a subsequent conviction. The respondent concedes that the existence of the charges, by themselves, would not render an applicant unsuitable, but still argues that the petitioner has failed to provide sufficient supplementary documentation explaining or mitigating the charges. The record, which contains a copy of the petitioner’s CORI report indicating that the charges were dismissed close to a quarter-century ago, belies this argument. Given the remoteness of the matters, the nature of the charges (especially the first), the petitioner’s forthright disclosure in his application, and the ultimate disposition of the cases, the denial could not properly be predicated on these events.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in this opinion, the petition for writ of certiorari is granted and the respondent’s decision denying the petitioner’s application for a license to carry a concealed weapon is quashed. Additionally, the respondent, or his successor, is directed to issue a new decision on the petitioner’s application within ninety days of the date of this opinion and to set forth therein the findings and conclusions upon which the decision is based. The new decision should take into account any supplemental material that was submitted in connection with the application. This Court holds that if the petitioner is aggrieved by the new decision, he may file an amended petition for writ of certiorari within sixty days of the issuance of the decision. In that event, no additional filing fee will be required.', '- 10 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Norman T.

27,"Mario Gianfrancesco : v. : A.R. Bilodeau, Inc. et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendants, A.R. Bilodeau, Inc. (ARB) and Service Tech, Inc. (Service Tech), appeal from a Superior Court order granting preliminary injunctive relief to the plaintiff, Mario Gianfrancesco, which prevented the defendants from trespassing on the plaintiff’s property. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'The plaintiff and defendants in this action are business owners with abutting properties located on Douglas Avenue in North Providence. The plaintiff owns the Geneva Diner, located at 1162 Douglas Avenue; he has owned this diner since 1992 or 1993, before which time it was owned by his father, beginning in 1983. The defendant ARB owns property located at 1164 Douglas Avenue, and defendant Service Tech is ARB’s tenant. Andrew Bilodeau is the sole', '-1- shareholder of both ARB and Service Tech. ARB has owned the property at 1164 Douglas Avenue since 1998, which is when Service Tech began operating in that location. Service Tech is in the business of manufacturing and servicing water remediation and air filtration equipment. As part of its usual operations, Service Tech requires deliveries of materials that arrive on large tractor-trailer trucks, ranging in length from thirty to fifty-three feet. These trucks are not owned by Service Tech, but are affiliated with independent trucking companies. 1 Bilodeau testified that these deliveries occur at least once a week, or six to eight times per month. 2', 'The plaintiff’s and defendants’ properties are accessible from Douglas Avenue by means of adjacent driveways, or “curb cuts,” separated by a small section of sidewalk. These two curb cuts lead to an open parking area, through which runs the unmarked boundary line between the two lots. Since Service Tech began operating at its current location in 1998, large delivery trucks routinely travel on a diagonal path from Douglas Avenue, through plaintiff’s driveway, and onto Service Tech’s premises. Bilodeau explained that, although plaintiff had never given him permission to use his driveway, Bilodeau allowed the truck drivers to enter Service Tech via plaintiff’s property because “[i]t was the only way to get the product into [his] facility.” Timothy Rutherford, a Service Tech employee, also testified that the trucks use plaintiff’s driveway because “[t]here is just not enough room. They wouldn’t be able to make it to the facility otherwise. * * * There is no other way to do it.” The diagonal path through plaintiff’s driveway to Service Tech’s premises, which is traveled regularly by the large delivery trucks, is the disputed property at issue in this case. 1', 'Service Tech owns its own fleet of smaller trucks, which it also uses frequently. 2', 'In contrast, Timothy Rutherford, an employee of Service Tech since 1994, testified that these deliveries occur approximately “a dozen times a month.”', '-2-', 'The plaintiff testified that, between the years 1999 and 2001, there were a few instances in which trucks caused damage to the diner while making deliveries to Service Tech. After this happened multiple times, plaintiff “aggressively policed” his property in order to prevent the trucks from causing further damage. The plaintiff testified that the trucks continued to pass through plaintiff’s property despite his actions, although less frequently. Arthur Cimini, who had been a patron of the diner for approximately thirty years and had done some carpentry work there, testified that, one day when he was leaving the diner, he found that his vehicle was blocked in by a truck; after requesting that the truck be moved, “the people from next door came with a forklift and loaded the truck.” However, Bilodeau testified that he had never given permission for any tractor-trailer trucks to park on plaintiff’s property. The plaintiff rented the diner to a tenant for three years from 2010 to 2013 and then took repossession of the business in March 2013, at which point he noticed that trucks were passing over his property more frequently.', 'The plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants in Providence County Superior Court on March 28, 2013. The complaint included a demand to cease and desist and a request to quiet title, as well as claims for tortious interference with business relations and quantum meruit. The plaintiff’s prayer for relief included requests for a declaratory judgment that plaintiff was the sole and exclusive owner of his property; and injunctive relief enjoining defendants from trespassing onto, interfering with, obstructing, or blocking plaintiff’s business.', 'On April 12, 2013, defendants filed an answer to plaintiff’s complaint and asserted counterclaims for adverse possession, 3 easement by prescription, possession by acquiescence, and trespass. The defendants then moved for their own temporary restraining order on May 13, 2013, seeking to enjoin 3', 'This claim was later withdrawn.', '-3- plaintiff from blocking access to the diagonal path through plaintiff’s driveway that the delivery trucks had been using to access Service Tech’s premises. Five days of hearings were held between May 22, 2013 and June 10, 2013 4 on the parties’ cross-motions for preliminary injunctive relief, which included the testimony of eight witnesses and the introduction of forty- one exhibits into evidence.', 'In addition to testimony regarding defendants’ use of plaintiff’s driveway, plaintiff revealed that, for approximately the past thirty years, customers of the Geneva Diner had used a parking area directly to the right of the diner, which encroached on the property occupied by Service Tech. When cars were parked in this area, tractor-trailers were unable to access Service Tech. The plaintiff testified that on the morning of May 23, 2013—which was the second day of testimonial hearings in this case—he was inside the diner when he heard a Service Tech employee call to him through a window, requesting that he move a car that was parked on Service Tech’s property. The plaintiff called the North Providence police, and the responding officer told plaintiff that he should put up a sign and some traffic cones in order to prevent his customers from parking on Service Tech’s property. The plaintiff told the officer that he wanted to install a fence along the boundary line because the Service Tech employee was “harassing [his] customers”; plaintiff said that this harassment would continue as long as his customers were 4', 'The record submitted to this Court on appeal contains transcripts of five days of hearings. At the start of the first transcribed hearing, on May 22, 2013, however, reference was made to a previous hearing that did not include testimony. The hearing justice also clarified at the outset of the May 22 hearing that, given the time that had passed since the filing of plaintiff’s complaint and the nature of the hearing, the hearing justice would treat plaintiff’s motion as a motion for a preliminary injunction rather than a motion for a temporary restraining order. Additionally, at the outset of this hearing, the hearing justice noted that he had taken a view of the disputed property.', '-4- parking on Service Tech’s property. 5 The plaintiff stated that his “customers [had] been coming to this diner for 30 years,” and he “c[ouldn’t] stop them from parking” on Service Tech’s property.', 'As requested by the officer, plaintiff installed a temporary barrier along the property line consisting of a plywood sign and cones. On June 4, 2013, plaintiff testified that no trucks had passed over his property since he had installed the temporary fence. The next day, however, Bilodeau testified that Service Tech employees had moved the cones out of the way in order for a truck to make a delivery. Bilodeau also testified that, if plaintiff were allowed to erect a fence along the boundary line, Service Tech “wouldn’t be able to get deliveries and without deliveries [it] would be shut[]down for the most part.”', 'The plaintiff testified that he would be irreparably harmed if the trucks were allowed to continue passing through and parking on his property. He identified some photographs that he had taken, which were introduced as full exhibits during the hearings, showing a large truck parked in front of the Geneva Diner before making a delivery to Service Tech. The plaintiff explained that the truck, which in his estimation was fifty feet long, “overpower[ed]” his small diner, which was only thirty feet long and ten feet tall.', 'Seref “Jeff” Kasapoglu, who leased the diner from plaintiff from 2010 to 2013, testified that, approximately “every few days” during this period of time, he had observed trucks passing over the diner property, “interfering * * * a little bit on the diner side just to make turns” because “it has such a narrow entrance.” The plaintiff testified that he had told Kasapoglu to “be aggressive and police the area.” Kasapoglu, however, reported having a cordial relationship with 5', 'Bilodeau testified that, at some point in 2013 prior to when plaintiff filed his complaint, he became aware that plaintiff was planning to install a fence along the boundary line between the two lots, and he warned plaintiff that if he did install a fence, Bilodeau would have to seek a restraining order. The plaintiff, however, denied that this conversation took place.', '-5- at least one employee of Service Tech; when one of the diner’s customers park[ed] on Service Tech’s property, this Service Tech employee politely ask[ed] that the vehicle be moved, and there were “[n]o problems.”', 'During the hearings, a video was introduced into evidence, taken on May 31, 2013, which depicted a large tractor-trailer truck pulling in and then backing out of Service Tech’s property without using plaintiff’s driveway. Due to the perspective of the video, it was unclear whether the truck traversed over a small portion of plaintiff’s property while entering Service Tech’s premises, although it did not utilize the driveway. However, according to Rutherford, a Service Tech employee who had personally witnessed this truck exiting Service Tech’s premises, the video did not depict the driver’s great difficulty in maneuvering the truck off Service Tech’s property, specifically that it “took three attempts to exit.” As to the issue of whether the large trucks had to use plaintiff’s property in order to make deliveries to Service Tech, Bilodeau clarified that it would not be a fair statement to say that a fifty-three-foot truck could never enter Service Tech’s premises without using plaintiff’s property, because “there are some skilled drivers that might be able to do it if they made a hard enough swing * * * .” He conceded that it did not depend on the truck, but rather the skill of the driver.', 'After the conclusion of the hearings, the hearing justice issued a bench decision granting plaintiff’s request for preliminary injunctive relief and denying defendants’ request for the same. This decision was reflected in an order entered on June 26, 2013, which also declared that plaintiff had “full and rightful ownership of the property in question” and that plaintiff had “the right to use and control the property in question.” The defendants moved on July 19, 2013 to stay and/or modify the order of preliminary injunction. This motion was denied on August 8, 2013, and defendants filed a timely notice of appeal.', '-6-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Although the grant of a preliminary injunction is an interlocutory order, a direct appeal to this Court is permissible pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-24-7. 6 “When reviewing a hearing justice’s decision to grant a preliminary injunction, this Court applies an abuse of discretion standard of review.” New England Stone, LLC v. Conte, 962 A.2d 30, 32 (R.I. 2009). If the party requesting the preliminary injunction has established a prima facie case warranting preliminary injunctive relief, this Court will not find an abuse of discretion. Vasquez v. Sportsman’s Inn, Inc., 57 A.3d 313, 318 (R.I. 2012). “Under such a limited scope of review, this Court need not reach nor resolve the underlying substantive issues as it would after the imposition of a permanent injunction.” Id.', 'Instead, “our role is limited to determining whether the hearing justice considered and resolved each of the appropriate preliminary injunction factors without abusing his or her discretion.” Id. These factors consist of the following:', '“whether the moving party (1) has a reasonable likelihood of', 'success on the merits, (2) will suffer irreparable harm without the', 'requested injunctive relief, (3) has the balance of the equities,', 'including the possible hardships to each party and to the public', 'interest, tip in its favor, and (4) has shown that the issuance of a', 'preliminary injunction will preserve the status quo.” Id.

He then reviewed the testimony of each witness and referred to a number of exhibits that had been introduced into evidence. Next, he addressed defendants’ request for preliminary injunctive relief, which he ultimately denied.', 'On appeal, defendants present an expansive argument as to why their request for preliminary injunctive relief should have been granted. Specifically, they claim the right to a prescriptive easement over plaintiff’s property and assert that they will suffer irreparable harm if plaintiff is permitted to erect a permanent barrier along his property line. This Court, however, has previously held that, “while ‘the grant of a preliminary injunction is appealable, * * * the denial of a preliminary injunction is not’ * * * .” Ciprian v. Providence School Board, 29 A.3d 1239, 1239 (R.I. 2011) (mem.) (quoting Paramount Office Supply Co. v. D.A. MacIsaac, Inc., 524 A.2d 1099, 1101 n.1 (R.I. 1987)). Instead of a direct appeal, a “petition for common-law certiorari is the proper method by which to seek review of the denial of a preliminary injunction.” Id. (quoting Paramount Office Supply Co., 524 A.2d at 1101 n.1). The defendants in this case have not filed a petition for certiorari for the review of the Superior Court’s denial of their motion for preliminary injunctive relief. Therefore, we shall not consider or decide whether this request was properly denied.', 'We shall, however, address the issue of whether the hearing justice erred in granting plaintiff’s request for preliminary injunctive relief. The defendants argue that this request should not have been granted because plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case. With regard to the first prong of the preliminary injunction analysis, defendants argue that the hearing justice failed to make a finding as to whether plaintiff had a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of his assorted claims. The defendants argue that, although the hearing justice found that plaintiff had “owned the disputed area for thirty (30) years and has rightful ownership to the property,”', '-8- this finding was irrelevant to the merits of plaintiff’s claims because none of these claims required proof of ownership for a particular period of time.', 'The defendants further argue that the hearing justice abused his discretion in finding that plaintiff would potentially suffer irreparable harm if relief were not granted. The defendants assert that, if the trucks had been causing irreparable harm to plaintiff’s business, he would not have waited fourteen years to bring this lawsuit. Regarding the third prong, defendants assert that the hearing justice abused his discretion in finding that the balance of the equities tips in favor of plaintiff. The defendants argue that plaintiff has failed to show how his business would be harmed by the continued passage of the trucks, while defendants’ business would certainly be harmed by the injunction, because it would force Service Tech to receive deliveries on Douglas Avenue, which would result in a “dangerous and hazardous situation.” Next, defendants assert that the issuance of the injunction failed to preserve the status quo because defendants had been using the disputed area since 1998.', 'The plaintiff, for his part, argues that the hearing justice properly found that plaintiff had a likelihood of success on the merits and that his business stood to suffer irreparable harm. Furthermore, plaintiff notes that the video introduced into evidence refuted defendants’ proposition that large trucks could not make deliveries to Service Tech without crossing over plaintiff’s property. According to plaintiff, the preliminary injunction was necessary to maintain “[t]he status quo of the Geneva Diner’s thirty (30) year business.”', 'After reviewing the record of this case, we are of the opinion that the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in granting plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunctive relief. Regarding the first prong of the preliminary-injunction standard, reasonable likelihood of success on the merits, the hearing justice found that “there has been no evidence that the plaintiff do[es]', '-9- not own and [he has] owned for 30 years the entire parcel including the area traveled over from time to time by the defendants.” He further found that plaintiff has “full and rightful ownership of that property, and [he has] a right to use and control [his] property.” Although the hearing justice’s analysis in this regard was not set forth exhaustively in his bench decision, we are satisfied that he appropriately considered the evidence presented and found that plaintiff had a reasonable likelihood of success on his claims for quiet title and declaratory relief.', 'Specifically, the parties did not disagree on the boundary line between the two properties, and there was no evidence introduced to suggest that plaintiff was not the owner of his entire parcel of property. The only threat to plaintiff’s claims with regard to ownership and title was defendants’ asserted claim of an easement by prescription, which claim was rejected by the hearing justice. Although we are not presently reviewing the hearing justice’s determination as to the denial of defendants’ request for preliminary injunctive relief, we have considered the likelihood of their success on the merits of their prescriptive easement claim in the context of determining whether it constitutes a likely threat to plaintiff’s success on his own claims, and we are of the opinion that the hearing justice did not err in finding that defendants did not prevail in this regard.', 'It is well established that “[a] claimant of an easement by prescription ‘must show actual, open, notorious, hostile, and continuous use under a claim of right for at least ten years.’” Butterfly Realty v. James Romanella & Sons, Inc., 93 A.3d 1022, 1030 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Drescher v. Johannessen, 45 A.3d 1218, 1227 (R.I. 2012)). Additionally, “[a] plaintiff claiming an easement * * * bears the heavy burden of proving ‘each element by a preponderance of clear and convincing evidence.’” Id. (quoting Carpenter v. Hanslin, 900 A.2d 1136, 1146 (R.I. 2006)). As this Court has previously explained, the hostility element of a prescriptive-easement claim is', '- 10 - satisfied “if one goes upon the land openly and uses it adversely to the true owner * * * .” Butterfly Realty v. James Romanella & Sons, Inc., 45 A.3d 584, 589 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Reitsma v. Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC, 774 A.2d 826, 831 (R.I. 2001)). “Similarly, ‘a claim of right may be proven through evidence of open, visible acts or declarations, accompanied by use of the property in an objectively observable manner that is inconsistent with the rights of the record owner.’” Drescher, 45 A.3d at 1228 (quoting Tavares v. Beck, 814 A.2d 346, 351 (R.I. 2003)). Additionally, however, we have held that the true owner can “stop the statutory prescriptive period from running” by “affirmatively communicat[ing]” objection to the use. Reitsma, 774 A.2d at 832 (emphasis omitted).', 'Here, as the hearing justice found, defendants’ claim for a prescriptive easement was defeated by the undisputed fact that plaintiff objected to defendants’ use of the property shortly after Service Tech began operating in its current location.', 'The plaintiff testified that he “aggressively policed” his property after the trucks caused damage to the diner on multiple occasions between 1999 and 2001. He further explained that he “would get right out there and tell them and stop them and stop trucks and policed it and they knew that.” The defendants, for their part, did not present any evidence to refute plaintiff’s assertion that he continuously objected to their use of his property. Thus, the hearing justice did not err in finding that defendants lacked a reasonable likelihood of success on the merits of their claim for a prescriptive easement, which constituted the only asserted threat to plaintiff’s claims for quiet title and declaratory relief.', 'Furthermore, we are convinced that the hearing justice did not err in his determinations regarding the remaining prongs of the preliminary injunction analysis. As for irreparable harm, he found that the “large trucks pose a safety concern for anyone entering or exiting th[e] diner,', '- 11 - driving their vehicles on the lot.” He noted the large size of the trucks compared to the diner’s small parking area, and he found that the process of getting the trucks in and out “is an incredible disruption, economic and safety hazard if it is allowed to continue.” In support of this finding, he relied in part on the video that was introduced into evidence, which showed the passage of an exceptionally large truck onto Service Tech’s premises.', 'We are further satisfied that he appropriately balanced the equities, finding that the “hardships are much greater on the [Geneva] Diner than [o]n Service Tech or [ARB] * * * .” Regarding the status quo, he found that it “would clearly be maintained by permitting [plaintiff] to enjoy the full use of [his] property including the parking area and [his] own curb cut for [his] own customers and for [his] own use.”', 'Although the hearing justice’s bench decision setting forth his reasons for granting plaintiff’s request for a preliminary injunction was somewhat scant in the analysis of each prong, we are of the opinion that he adequately addressed the issues and did not err in his findings; especially considering his emphasis on plaintiff’s likelihood of success on the merits and the potential for the large trucks to cause irreparable harm to plaintiff’s business.

The charges stemmed from defendant having issued and then stopped payment on several checks paid to James Sangiovanni, d/b/a Design House Bath and Kitchen Studio, in connection with a $129,592 home renovation that Sangiovanni performed for defendant and her husband, on property that the couple owned in Portsmouth, Rhode Island. 3', 'The defendant pled nolo contendere before a Superior Court justice to counts 1, 5, and 6; the remaining counts were dismissed by the state.

She and her husband, however, were more than one year in arrears on their payments and were currently in the midst of foreclosure proceedings. 8 She testified that they were not currently making their monthly mortgage payments and that the bank was paying their property taxes.', 'The defendant’s financial statement also revealed that she and her husband owned two cars, a 2007 Toyota Highlander and a 2008 Toyota Prius, and were making monthly payments of $865 and $680, respectively. The loans on these vehicles showed balances of $32,000 and $21,000, with no equity in either car. The defendant testified that her husband drove the Prius and that she had previously been using the Highlander but now had an “incredible difficulty driving” because of a back injury. 9 In addition to the vehicle loan payments, defendant and her husband spent $174 per month on car insurance and $256 per month on gas.', 'The defendant’s additional monthly expenditures included $804 on homeowner’s insurance; $745 on life insurance; $200 on clothing and shoes; $150 on cable television/internet; and $100 on charitable donations.

The magistrate noted that defendant was paying nearly $900 per month on a vehicle that she barely used, and that her expenditures on cable television, charity, clothing, and shoes were resources that could be allocated toward her restitution obligation.', 'Additionally, the magistrate noted that defendant had not presented evidence regarding the value of her assets in personal property, such as her jewelry or the furnishings in her “million dollar home.” An order reflecting the magistrate’s decision was entered on February 1, 2013, and defendant appealed the matter to the Superior Court.', 'The defendant made two payments of $500 in March and May of 2013 and then moved on May 21, 2013 to stay the restitution order pending appeal.

She then explained that the standard of review for this matter was set forth in G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15, which was a “very deferential standard[] to the decision of * * * the magistrate as to questions of fact.” The hearing justice further explained that, under this limited standard of review, factual findings would be overturned if clearly erroneous, and issues of law would be reviewed de novo.', 'The defendant argued that the magistrate had erroneously concluded that she had sufficient assets, aside from her social security benefit, to pay $500 per month. The defendant also reminded the court that her husband was not obligated to pay restitution and, therefore, that his assets could not be counted toward defendant’s ability to make the required payments. The state, for its part, argued that defendant had access to numerous assets that could be liquidated, and that she could easily reallocate some of the funds she was spending on unnecessary expenses in order to satisfy her restitution obligation.', 'The hearing justice began her bench decision by noting that defendant had borne the burden of proof in seeking to show that she was unable to make the $500 monthly payments, and that she had “willfully failed to meet” this burden. Next, the hearing justice briefly summarized the potential areas that could yield additional funds for the payment of restitution, including the furs, the Highlander, insurance on the Highlander, cable television, life insurance, clothing, shoes, and charitable donations.', 'The hearing justice also noted that defendant had', '-6- “acknowledged being in possession of numerous items of jewelry,” and that “it was her burden to establish that that jewelry could not be sold and to establish the value and what amount of money could be yielded from that.”', 'Similarly, defendant had failed to account for the furnishings inside her home. The hearing justice also noted that defendant had failed to provide any tax returns relating to years after 2007, which “further mudd[ied] the record” as to her potential assets. Accordingly, the hearing justice denied defendant’s appeal. She also vacated the previously imposed stay and ordered defendant to pay the additional $1,000 pursuant to the magistrate’s order. 13 Judgment reflecting the hearing justice’s decision was entered on October 1, 2013, and defendant filed a timely appeal. 14', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'General Laws 1956 §§ 8-2-11.1(e) and 8-2-39(f) provide that final orders of the Superior Court entered in a proceeding to review an order of a magistrate may be appealed to the Supreme Court.

The defendant avers that “there was no evidence in the record that established that [she] had such other assets that would fund $500.00 per month in restitution,” and that most of the monthly expenses listed on the financial statement were being paid by her husband.', 'The state argues that there was “ample evidence in the record to support” the decisions of the magistrate and the hearing justice. The state asserts that the magistrate and the hearing justice did not err in concluding that defendant had sufficient sources of income, aside from her social security benefit, to make $500 monthly restitution payments. The state also notes that “defendant’s continued expenditure of money to litigate the restitution obligations she incurred as a result of her [nolo contendere] plea would seemingly belie her claim that she worries continually about having money to feed herself and her husband.”', '-8-', 'We have previously held that a defendant who claims an inability to comply with a restitution order bears the burden of proving that he or she has made sufficient efforts to acquire the necessary funds. See State v. LaRoche, 883 A.2d 1151, 1155 (R.I. 2005). We are convinced that the hearing justice did not err in determining that the defendant has failed to meet this burden of proof.', 'As described above, her testimony revealed numerous assets that could potentially be liquidated and significant expenses that could be reduced in order to direct more funds toward her restitution obligation. When asked about these expenses and assets, she responded elusively, at no time presenting the court with evidence that she had made a good- faith effort to procure the additional $263 that was purportedly missing from her monthly budget. Similarly, she now makes a vague claim that her husband is paying her monthly expenses, but she has not supported this assertion with any evidence. Indeed, the financial statement upon which she relied below does not indicate how she is paying any of her enumerated expenses. 15 Additionally, she failed to provide the court with tax returns for any years after 2007, despite being instructed to do so on January 25, 2011; nor did she provide any documents to support the various expenses listed on her financial statement. After reviewing the record of this case, we think it is clear that the defendant has patently failed to meet her burden of proving an inability to maintain payments of $500 per month. 15', 'Furthermore, it became apparent at the hearing that the financial statement was not entirely accurate. Although the financial statement was dated and notarized on January 17, 2013 and included the expenses of a mortgage payment, property taxes, and an installment payment to Harris Furs, defendant revealed at the hearing that she and her husband were not actually making payments on any of these obligations.', '-9-', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

In this case, we are once again asked to revisit the scope and applicability of G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 32, the Recreational Use Statute (RUS). The plaintiff, Kathleen Carlson, appeals from summary judgment entered in Washington County Superior Court in favor of the defendant, the town of South Kingstown (the town). 1 The plaintiff’s claim sounded in negligence and concerned an injury she sustained at a town-owned park while she was a spectator at a little league baseball game. This appeal came before the Supreme Court for argument on February 4, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in the appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing argument and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we conclude that cause has not been shown and we shall proceed to decide the appeal at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The plaintiff also named South Kingstown Little League, Inc. (the league) as a defendant in the suit, but this appeal concerns only the town of South Kingstown. The Superior Court entered summary judgment in favor of the league while this appeal was pending, and plaintiff has appealed that judgment separately.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On July 28, 2010, plaintiff attended her son’s little league baseball game at Tuckertown Park in the Wakefield section of South Kingstown. The game was a part of the schedule of South Kingstown Little League, Inc., and the park and field were owned and maintained by the town.', 'Ms. Carlson would later testify by deposition that the game was the league’s championship game, that the game was open to the general public, and that no tickets were required to attend. The league had a permit, issued by the town, to host this game, as it did for all its games, but the town charged no fee to use the park.', 'The defendant, through the interrogatory responses and deposition testimony of Theresa Murphy, the town’s Director of Leisure Services, said that this was in accordance with a written policy because the league was a nonprofit sports league within the town.', 'After the game had ended, plaintiff, who had been standing in the area of a set of batting cages located just off the first-base line of the park’s lower field, walked towards the concession stand, where she planned to meet her son. Unfortunately, on her way there, plaintiff felt her ankle twist under her and she heard what she believed was the breaking of bones in her leg. Ms. Carlson testified that she never fell to the ground, but “when I took a step on my right leg, I felt my ankle fall into this little divot in the ground.” As a consequence of her stumble into the “divot,” plaintiff broke her right leg. A witness to the injury would later testify by deposition that this “divot” was a part of a “repetitive problem” caused by “kids waiting to get into the batting cage, [when] they dig their cleats into the ground.” There is discrepancy in the record as to the size and shape of the hole that caused plaintiff’s injury; plaintiff described the “divot” as “only under two inches but I don’t really remember,” while another witness said the hole was,', '-2- “6, 8 inches across, maybe a little wider than that, a good 8, 10 inches deep.” Ms. Murphy testified that the most recent inspection of the field had been accomplished two days before the incident and that the town had received no notice of any hazardous condition existing at the park. The particular hole in question was filled in by defendant the day after the incident.', 'It was the town’s regular policy to maintain the fields at Tuckertown Park on Mondays and Thursdays; no reports had been received about the area of plaintiff’s accident. Asked whether the town was aware of holes near the batting cages being a common problem, Ms. Murphy stated, “I’m not sure it’s a common problem, but I am aware that that type of thing can happen.” However, she admitted that it was not uncommon “to find holes in ball fields after people have used them.” Ms. Murphy testified that, if the town had been aware of any potential hazard, it would have had it repaired or fixed. The record is devoid of any similar incidents causing injuries at Tuckertown Park.', 'On August 6, 2012, plaintiff filed suit, alleging that defendant was “negligent in maintaining the premises of Tuckertown Field,” resulting in plaintiff’s injury. The plaintiff, in her interrogatory answers, said that her injury had resulted in several thousand dollars in medical bills. 2 Discovery in the suit proceeded; depositions were taken from officials of the town and the league, a witness to the incident, and plaintiff herself. Several months later, the town moved for summary judgment because it believed that the RUS, barred plaintiff’s suit. 3 The plaintiff 2', 'There seems to be no dispute about the extent of plaintiff’s injury. 3', 'The specific section of the statute cited by the town is G.L. 1956 § 32-6-3, which reads:', '“Except as specifically recognized by or provided in § 32-6-5, an owner of land', 'who either directly or indirectly invites or permits without charge any person to', 'use that property for recreational purposes does not thereby:', '“(1) Extend any assurance that the premises are safe for any purpose;', '“(2) Confer upon that person the legal status of an invitee or licensee to', 'whom a duty of care is owed; nor', '-3- objected to the motion, citing two exceptions to the RUS’s limitation on liability, § 32-6-5(a). 4 Specifically, plaintiff claimed that defendant had willfully or maliciously failed to guard or warn against a dangerous condition on the land and that plaintiff had been charged for her access to the park. On May 20, 2013, the motion was argued and, in a bench ruling, a justice of the Superior Court granted summary judgment to defendant, saying, “[t]he Recreational Use Statute is still alive and well * * * there’s no evidence here that the town was aware of this particular hole and/or the plaintiff was facing that peril before falling into that hole.” The hearing justice went on to say of plaintiff’s second argument, that either or both of the fees paid to the league and the taxes paid to the town constitute an admission fee, “[those] are not, quote, charges as contemplated under the Recreational Use Statute.” The plaintiff filed a timely appeal, and, after a minor procedural remand, her case is properly before this Court. 5', '“(3) Assume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury to any', 'person or property caused by an act of omission of that person.” In the preceding decade alone, we have visited this statute many times.

This encouragement came in the form of a reduced duty of care; users of the land would be considered to be trespassers and the landowner need only “refrain from willful or wanton conduct.” Id. at 1044. In 1996, the RUS was amended and “it is clear from the unambiguous language of the 1996 amendment that the legislature intended to include the state and municipalities among owners entitled to immunity under the statute.” Pereira v. Fitzgerald, 21 A.3d 369, 373 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Hanley v. State, 837 A.2d 707, 712 (R.I. 2003)); Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1044 (noting that § 32-6-2(3) was amended by P.L. 1996, ch. 234, § 1). We have on a number of occasions cast a disapproving eye on this expansion of immunity, saying, “the state and its municipalities are presumptively better able to bear the burden of damages” than an injured plaintiff, and that “the statutory scheme does nothing to motivate governmental landowners to make their properties safe.”', 'Smiler v. Napolitano, 911 A.2d 1035, 1042 (R.I. 2006); see also Lacey v. Reitsma, 899 A.2d 455, 458 (R.I. 2006). Nonetheless, we have also been consistent in saying that this Court is not a', '-6- legislative body; we are bound to apply the statute in light of both its language and our jurisprudence.', 'It is true that in Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1051, a duty was imposed on a municipality for injuries suffered by a plaintiff on land that was recreational in nature. However, in that case, the Court was constrained to address the significance of repeated catastrophic injuries of which the defendant municipality was clearly aware. Id.', 'B. The RUS is Implicated by Plaintiff’s Injury', 'The plaintiff relies on Morales v. Town of Johnston, 895 A.2d 721, 731 (R.I. 2006), for her argument that defendant owed a duty to her in this case because her use of Tuckertown Field was not the type of use the RUS was meant to cover. We do not agree. In Morales, 895 A.2d at 724, the plaintiff, a Central Falls High School athlete, was injured while she was playing in a soccer game at Johnston High School. Significantly, on the day Ms. Morales was injured, the field was being “utilized and maintained for school-sponsored athletics.” Id. at 731. When reviewing cases in which the RUS may apply we examine “the nature and scope of the activities occurring on the land.” Id. In order for the RUS to apply, “the premises [must] be available to the public for recreational purposes.” Id. Unlike the open spectator areas at Tuckertown Park where plaintiff was injured, the field in Johnston, at least on that day, was “not open to the public for recreational activities when Morales was injured” because no one except those associated with either high school team was allowed in the area at that time. Id.', 'Rather, we are persuaded by the argument of defendant that Pereira, 21 A.3d at 375, is on all fours with this case. The facts in Pereira are strikingly similar to the facts here; the plaintiff was a spectator at her grandson’s soccer game, a game that was played in a city-owned and- managed park, she paid no fee to enter, and she injured her ankle when she fell into a hole in the common area of that park. Id. at 370-71. In deciding Pereira, we held that Morales was', '-7- “inapposite” to and “clearly distinguishable” from the case of Ms. Pereira. Id. at 375. The same is true for Ms. Carlson. The area where plaintiff was injured, which was both away from the field of play and in an area where, plaintiff admits, “[T]here were people around the whole of the baseball field,” was in space which the general public was free to access for recreational use. Therefore, it was not error for the hearing justice to apply the RUS to plaintiff’s case.', 'C. The § 32-6-5(a)(1) Exception to the RUS is Inapplicable', 'Alternatively, plaintiff argues that defendant engaged in willful or malicious conduct, mandating the application of an exception to the RUS. See § 32-6-5(a)(1). To support this argument, plaintiff relies on Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1051, where this Court held that the city of Newport “had an affirmative duty to take reasonable steps to warn and shield unsuspecting visitors” to the famed Cliff Walk. Citing that case as support, plaintiff correctly states in her brief that “the broad protections created for landowners under § 32-6-3 are not absolute.” However, in deciding Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1052, we were of the opinion that, because of the unique situation, where there was a “strong likelihood that a visitor to the Cliff Walk would suffer serious injury or death,” Newport owed a duty to users of the path. In that light, a factfinder could determine that the city intentionally or voluntarily failed to guard against future injuries and, consequently, the requirements of the § 32-6-5(a)(1) exception were met. Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1052.', 'But in the case currently before us, no such strong likelihood of injury was known to defendant. Ms. Murphy testified that she and her department had received no notice of the hole; otherwise, the record is silent about whether the town ever received notice of the area in which plaintiff was injured. Of the holes that caused plaintiff’s injury, Ms. Murphy said, “I’m not sure it’s a common problem,” but conceded, “I am aware that that type of thing can happen,” and', '-8- plaintiff’s witness described similar holes as a “repetitive problem.”', 'In our opinion, such evidence falls woefully short of establishing the existence of sufficient facts to show that the town knew of the particular hole that injured plaintiff or of similar persons injured by similar defects in the park.', 'The hearing justice correctly described the situation when she said, “[T]here’s no evidence here that the town was aware of this particular hole,” and defendant did not know that “plaintiff was facing that peril.” This is far short of the situation in Berman I, in which the defendant municipality was “saturated with the knowledge that some feature of [its] land presents a clear and present danger to completely innocent users * * * .” Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1054 (Flaherty, J., concurring). Therefore, we see no error in the hearing justice’s refusal to apply the exceptions of § 32-6-5(a)(1) to plaintiff’s claim.', 'D. The § 32-6-5(a)(2) Exception Does Not Apply', 'Lastly, plaintiff advocates that the exception set forth in § 32-6-5(a)(2) should apply, because either: (1) she paid a fee to the league on her son’s behalf so that he could participate, or (2) she paid taxes to the town which uses a part of its budget to maintain Tuckertown Park. The exception in § 32-6-5(a)(2) says that no limitation of liability exists “[f]or any injury suffered in any case where the owner of land charges the person or persons who enter or go on the land for the recreational use thereof * * * .” The RUS defines a charge as “the admission price or fee asked in return for invitation or permission to enter or go upon the land.” Section 32-6-2(1).', 'With respect to this issue, we do not write on a clean slate because in the past we have addressed what the term “charge” means in the context of the RUS. In Hanley, 837 A.2d at 714, an injured plaintiff argued that, because she paid a camping fee at a state park in Narragansett, she was charged for use of the land and therefore was able to sue the state for her injuries. However, we concluded that, to qualify as a charge under § 32-6-5(a)(2) the fee must be', '-9- “imposed in return for recreational use of the land.” Hanley, 837 A.2d at 714 (quoting Majeske v. Jekyll Island State Park Authority, 433 S.E.2d 304, 305-06 (Ga. Ct. App. 1993)).', 'When she was deposed, Ms. Carlson agreed that the game she went to see was open to the public and that it was not necessary to buy a ticket to get into the park to watch the game. The fee plaintiff paid to the league had no effect on her right to use the park or view the game; accordingly, such a fee is not a charge to use the land as the statute contemplates. It also follows that, despite any taxes plaintiff may have paid to the town, the payment or nonpayment of those taxes did not affect whether she could use the park for recreation, and therefore the taxes were not charges or fees to use the land. Indeed, plaintiff was not required to be a resident of South Kingstown to enter Tuckertown Park. We would note that applying this “taxpayer” argument would create a result inconsistent with common sense. This argument, applying the exception in § 32-6-5(a)(2) to this and similar cases, would eviscerate a municipality’s RUS protection in every case where one of its own taxpayers was injured on its land, but not when a nonresident was injured. The same disparity would exist between injured Rhode Island residents and injured nonresidents where state-owned property was concerned. To interpret the statute in that way would be to imply that the General Assembly intended such a result, but that conclusion would be beyond absurd. When the hearing justice said, “It’s undisputed that there is no fee charged for [plaintiff] to walk onto this field to observe her son playing,” she correctly applied the RUS and made no error of law.', 'It is our firm opinion that when the hearing justice granted the defendant’s motion for summary judgment, she properly applied the RUS. Although we are sympathetic to the plaintiff, who suffered great pain and monetary losses from her injuries, we are bound by the language of the statute and guided by our past interpretations of it. A different result is only possible by', '- 10 - revisiting the statute, a task, as we have said in the past, that is not for this Court, but for the General Assembly.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the grant of summary judgment for the defendant.

This case came before the Supreme Court on the appeal of the plaintiff, HK&S Construction Holding Corp. (HK&S or plaintiff), of a Superior Court grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Town of Middletown (town), 1 Robert J. Rafferty (Rafferty), and Woodard & Curran, Inc. (Woodard & Curran).', 'In granting the defendants’ motion, the Superior Court rejected the plaintiff’s claim that the town wrongfully failed to award the plaintiff a contract to construct a drainage project that had been put out to bid and that Woodard & Curran owed it a duty. On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the Superior Court erred in determining that the plaintiff’s bid was nonresponsive, thereby nullifying the grant of summary judgment. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on March 4, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and 1', 'Town defendants included Lynne S. Dible (Dible), in her capacity as finance director and purchasing official of the town, Shawn J.

Accordingly, we shall decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On June 1, 2011, the town issued an invitation for bids on a drainage improvement project, which involved the installation of 2,100 linear feet of drainpipe and structures with outfalls to Easton Bay. The project called for both underground and subaqueous work, as well as a significant amount of blasting. Providing the town with consulting services, Woodard & Curran agreed to tabulate and evaluate the bids. The request for proposal (RFP) included a set of instructions that detailed bid requirements. One entry, titled “Documents to be Returned With Bid,” provided: “Failure to completely execute and submit the required documents before the Submittal Deadline [of 10:30 A.M., July 14, 2011] may render a bid non-responsive.”', 'An additional document, titled, “Bid Documents to Be Returned,” listed four documents that “must be completed and submitted on or before the Submittal Deadline for the Bid to be considered complete.”', 'Those documents were:', '(1) a “Bid Form”; (2) a “Non-Collusion Affidavit”; (3) the “Bidder’s Statement Regarding Insurance Coverage”; and (4) the “Bidder’s Statement of Relevant Experience.” The RFP also requested additional information regarding the subcontractor performing the subaqueous construction and blasting, as well as eight additional items constituting the “company profile,” which, according to the RFP, the bidder “must provide” and “shall [be] include[d] with the[ ] bid.” Those eight additional items included documentation of: (1) company ownership; (2) location of company offices; (3) the number of local and national employees; (4) the locations from which employees would be assigned; (5) the', '-2- name, address, and phone number of the bidder’s contact for a contract resulting from their bid; (6) a company background and history describing why it was qualified to provide the services described; (7) a statement of the length of time the bidder has been providing the services described; and (8) the resumes for key staff to be responsible for the performance of any contract resulting from the bid.', 'Two contractors submitted bids: HK&S and C.B. Utility Company, Inc. (C.B. Utility). On July 14, 2011, the town held a bid meeting, at which it unsealed the bids to reveal that plaintiff was the low bidder. The plaintiff proposed to complete the work for $1,631,125, while C.B. Utility proposed to complete the work for $3,744,285. In his August 1, 2011 letter to the town, Rafferty, technical leader of Woodard & Curran, noted that plaintiff’s bid failed to include the company profile and subcontractor identification. 2', 'As a result, Woodard & Curran recommended against awarding plaintiff the project and in favor of either “negotiating” a contract with C.B. Utility or putting the project out for rebidding.', 'On August 3, 2011, the town council held a special meeting to consider the bids. Town administrator Brown reviewed the bids with the council. After Brown and Rafferty fielded questions, the town council acknowledged that plaintiff’s bid was “non-responsible” and “voted unanimously to adopt the recommendation of Woodard & Curran” and award the contract to C.B. Utility.', 'On August 19, 2011, plaintiff filed a complaint against the town in Newport County Superior Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief “requiring that the Town shall award the contract to [plaintiff],” or “declaring the invitation for bids and the contract award to C.B. 2', 'To the extent that the town argues that plaintiff failed to include a minimum of five references from similar projects, a review of plaintiff’s bid appears to indicate that it did in fact provide this information.', '-3- Utility * * * illegal, null and void * * *.” The complaint alleged that the town violated G.L. 1956 chapter 55 of title 45 as well as Chapters 33 and 33A of the Middletown Code of Ordinances when it denied plaintiff the contract award for the project. On November 23, 2011, plaintiff amended its complaint, alleging wrongful denial of a municipal contract award under § 45-55-5 3 and seeking compensatory damages. In addition, plaintiff added a count alleging intentional interference with prospective contractual relations, as well as counts alleging violations of procedural and substantive due process under both the federal and state constitutions. 4', 'Subsequently, the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, where another amended complaint was filed. In addition to including Rafferty and Woodard & Curran (collectively Woodard & Curran) as defendants, this amended complaint added an equal protection claim under both the federal and state constitutions against all 3', 'General Laws 1956 § 45-55-5 provides, in relevant part:', '“(a) Contracts exceeding the amount provided by § 45-55-9 shall be', 'awarded by competitive bidding * * *;', '“***', '“(b) The invitation for bids shall state whether award shall be made on the', 'basis of the lowest bid price or the lowest evaluated or responsive bid price.

On January 2, 2013, the town moved for summary judgment; and, on April 22, 2013, a federal district judge entered an order dismissing all federal constitutional claims and remanding all state claims to the Superior Court. On April 26, 2013, plaintiff’s most recent amended complaint was remanded to the Superior Court. 5', 'Upon remand from the federal district court, the Superior Court entertained the town’s motion for summary judgment as to plaintiff’s state law claims. In its motion, the town argued that plaintiff’s bid did not qualify for consideration because it did not contain the required documents and was, thus, nonresponsive. Because there was only one responsive bid, the town averred that it was within its right to exclusively negotiate with C.B. Utility for a new price pursuant to §§ 45-55-7 and 45-55-8. 6', 'On November 4, 2013, Woodard & Curran filed a separate motion for summary judgment in which it argued that it was not liable to plaintiff because it was acting as the agent of a disclosed principal, the town, and plaintiff was clearly aware of this relationship. Woodard & Curran also contended that there was no evidence of an abuse of discretion in the town’s awarding of the contract to C.B. Utility. Finally, Woodard & Curran asserted that plaintiff’s claim of intentional interference with contractual relations should be dismissed because no business expectancy existed among the parties.', 'In its memoranda objecting to the motions, plaintiff contended that its bid was responsive and that the company profile and subcontractor information could have been submitted after the 5', 'Woodard & Curran submitted its own answer to the amended complaint, while all remaining defendants submitted one answer. 6', 'Pursuant to § 45-55-7, a new price was negotiated with C.B. Utility for $3,269,185.', '-5- bid opening. The plaintiff insisted, then, that the town was legally obligated to evaluate and properly determine whether plaintiff was a “responsible” bidder, but that it failed to do so.', 'On January 16, 2014, defendants’ motions for summary judgment were heard by a Superior Court justice (the hearing justice). On March 31, 2014, the hearing justice issued a written decision, in which he determined that there were no genuine issues of material fact such that defendants were entitled to summary judgment. The hearing justice concluded that there was no palpable abuse of discretion in the town’s determination that plaintiff’s bid was nonresponsive in light of the instructions given plaintiff and the materials plaintiff failed to submit by the bid deadline. He also rejected plaintiff’s allegations of bad faith, noting that, even if plaintiff’s account of the town’s conduct was true, it was not enough to show wrongful denial of the contract. Further, the hearing justice noted that plaintiff failed to present evidence that defendants engaged in any violation of the law.', 'The hearing justice maintained that, notwithstanding plaintiff’s lower bid, the town would not have been obligated to award it the contract. Citing H.V. Collins Co. v. Tarro, 696 A.2d 298, 303, 304 (R.I. 1997), he reaffirmed the principle that “an awarding authority [may] tak[e] into account factors beyond price when selecting the ‘best’ or ‘superior’ bidder[,]” because a company rated higher under the requested criteria, despite not placing the lowest bid, could actually save the town money in the long run. Additionally, he rejected plaintiff’s claim of intentional interference with contractual relations on the ground that plaintiff did not have a business relationship with the town simply because its bid was lower than that of C.B. Utility.', 'In dismissing plaintiff’s procedural and substantive due process claims, the hearing justice noted that plaintiff was not deprived of a “life, liberty, or property interest,” and he also stated that the town lawfully exercised its discretion when it determined that plaintiff’s bid was', '-6- nonresponsive and therefore was not a bid at all. He then concluded that there were no grounds to sustain plaintiff’s equal protection claim since its bid was nonresponsive and thus not similarly situated to C.B. Utility’s bid. Finally, the hearing justice determined that Woodard & Curran owed no legally cognizable duty to plaintiff, and he dismissed plaintiff’s negligence claim.', 'On April 8, 2014, the hearing justice entered an order granting defendants’ motions for summary judgment and, on that same day, entered final judgment on behalf of all defendants.

Burns, 109 R.I. 236, 240, 283 A.2d 673, 676 (1971); see also Gilbane Building Co. v.

Utility instead of HK&S, and whether summary judgment is a proper mechanism for that determination. Separately, the town and the hearing justice noted that plaintiff did not adhere to the requirements set forth in the RFP because it failed to submit the company profile and subcontractor identification. This omission, then, constituted a violation of the RFP, which explicitly stated that “[f]ailure to completely execute and submit the required documents before the Submittal Deadline may render a bid non- responsive.”', 'We have previously held that “municipal contracts can properly be awarded to a bidder ‘other than the lowest bidder when the awarding authority deems it in the public interest to do so.’” Coastal Recycling, Inc. v. Connors, 854 A.2d 711, 716 (R.I. 2004) (quoting H.V. Collins Co., 696 A.2d at 304). In the bid process, the first hurdle to be crossed is the submittal of a responsive bid.', 'Here, the RFP unambiguously required that bidders “must identify the subcontractors * * * [by] includ[ing] with their bid, the subcontractors’ background information and references,” and that bidders “must provide a company profile.” The town sought vital information for a project dealing with subaqueous and underground blasting, and made it clear in the RFP that this information was to be “include[d] with the[ ] bid.” This language, along with the understanding of the significance of this information, was clear warning to the bidder that the subcontractor information and company profile had to be included with the original bid.', 'The plaintiff does not dispute that it failed to provide the above-mentioned documents, but instead claims that the documents could have been submitted at a later date. This argument', '-9- ignores the compulsory language accompanying the town’s requests for vital information, as well as the notification that “[f]ailure to completely execute and submit the required documents before the Submittal Deadline may render a bid non-responsive.” As the hearing justice noted, “[t]he instructions do not indicate anywhere that any information at all may be submitted after the Submittal Deadline.” Given these admonitions, there is no disputed issue of material fact that the town acted within its sound discretion in determining that the plaintiff’s bid was nonresponsive. As such, we conclude that there was no error in disposing of the plaintiff’s claims against the town on summary judgment. Because we conclude that the plaintiff tripped over the responsive bid hurdle, we need not consider the plaintiff’s claims for wrongful denial of the contract, intentional interference with contractual relations, and violations of due process and equal protection rights.

However, that crime serves only as a precursor to other criminal activity that arose during the course of this sordid tale. In the days leading up to the robbery, the defendant had become increasingly distressed that an investigation into a crime that he had orchestrated while he was in Florida several months earlier was catching up with him. Detectives from the Miami-Dade Police Department had begun questioning everyone who had traveled to Florida with the defendant in an effort to identify the people associated with certain nicknames. The defendant was highly concerned because he thought it was only a matter of time until Jennifer, who took part in the Florida crime at the defendant’s behest, was identified and questioned. The defendant was determined to prevent that from happening because he believed that, if questioned, Jennifer would implicate the defendant’s girlfriend, Victoria Berardinelli', '-1- (Berardinelli), or himself in the Florida incident. 1 To prevent that from happening, the defendant made the callous decision that Jennifer must die.', 'In the predawn hours of November 21, 2006, less than twelve hours after the bank robbery, Jennifer, defendant, and two others parked their vehicle on the side of Grotto Avenue in Pawtucket. 2 The defendant lured Jennifer from the car and the pair ventured a short distance down the street.', 'As they were heading back towards the car, defendant withdrew a semiautomatic handgun and fired one shot at point-blank range into Jennifer’s back.', 'The defendant then straddled Jennifer’s fallen body and discharged an additional eight shots into her body, including three shots in her back, one in her upper right arm, and four in her head. Upon completion of this cold-blooded, ruthless execution, defendant left Jennifer’s lifeless, bullet- riddled body where it fell and fled the scene.', 'Based upon the events of November 20 and 21, 2006, defendant was charged with eleven offenses in a single indictment, most notably the murder of Jennifer Duarte in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-23-1 and 11-23-2. 3 On March 16, 2010, following a lengthy jury trial in Providence 1', 'On October 12, 2007, Victoria Berardinelli and defendant, Deaven Tucker, were married at the Adult Correctional Institutions, in part to prevent her from being coerced to testify against defendant. After the marriage, Berardinelli assumed defendant’s last name; however, in order to prevent confusion, we shall refer to her by her maiden name. Also, Berardinelli and defendant parented two children who were born in 1998 and 2007. 2', 'The additional passengers were Jason Ruiz and Dana Wilson. 3', 'The eleven charged offenses include: the murder of Jennifer Duarte in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-23-1 and 11-23-2 (count 1), using a firearm when committing a crime of violence, to wit, murder, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2(b)(3) (count 2), carrying a dangerous weapon while committing a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-3 (count 3), possession of arms by a person convicted of a crime of violence in violation of § 11-47-5(a) (count 4), carrying a pistol without a license in violation of § 11-47-8 (count 5), four counts of first-degree robbery in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-39-1(a) (counts 6-9), conspiracy to commit robbery in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6 and § 11-39-1 (count 10), and using a firearm when committing a crime of violence, to wit, robbery, in violation of § 11-47-3.2(a)(1) (count 11).

On May 10, 2010, the trial justice sentenced defendant to three consecutive life sentences plus an additional thirty-five consecutive nonparoleable years. 4', 'On appeal, defendant advances two primary arguments to support vacating his judgments of conviction. First, defendant contends that the trial justice abused his discretion when he admitted character evidence in violation of Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.5 Second, defendant claims that he should be granted a new trial because the prosecutor made inappropriate and inflammatory comments during the course of his closing argument. After a careful consideration of defendant’s arguments and a thorough review of the record, we affirm the judgments of conviction.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'To make sense of the cold-blooded and calculated murder of Jennifer, we must turn our attention to events that occurred several months earlier. In September 2006, defendant and Berardinelli planned a trip to Florida to visit defendant’s uncle and inquire about employment prospects at the uncle’s auto-detailing business. However, some of defendant’s friends learned about the trip, expressed an interest in joining, and were invited by defendant to travel with him and Berardinelli. The new additions to the trip included Zachery Brown (Brown), John Soares 4', 'Of the thirty-five consecutive nonparoleable years that the trial justice sentenced defendant to serve, ten years were for using a firearm in connection with a crime of violence and twenty-five years were because defendant was determined to be a habitual offender. 5', 'Rule 404(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides:', '“Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character', 'of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith. It', 'may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive,', 'opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or', 'accident, or to prove that defendant feared imminent bodily harm and that the fear', 'was reasonable.”', '-3- (Soares), Ronald Spearin (Spearin), and Eugenia Gomes (Gomes). 6', 'Two rental cars were obtained, and the group departed Rhode Island. Berardinelli did not travel to Florida in the rental cars; rather, she flew down several days later and was surprised to discover that Jennifer was in Florida with the group. 7', 'On the group’s final night in Florida, everyone went out to a club in Miami except Brown, who remained at the hotel and went to bed early because he was ill. At some point after midnight, defendant, Berardinelli, Soares, and Jennifer returned to the hotel room occupied by Brown, whereupon defendant declared that Spearin “had to be taken care of.” Brown testified that defendant then revealed a plan that he had conceived to kill Spearin. Specifically, defendant instructed that, while Spearin and Gomes were being transported from the hotel at which defendant was staying to their own hotel, Soares would lure Spearin from the vehicle and shoot him. The defendant explained that, in order to create an alibi, he and Berardinelli would remain at the hotel while Spearin’s murder was being carried out.', 'At trial, Brown testified that defendant’s plan was successful and that Soares killed Spearin. Afterwards, Jennifer and Brown returned to defendant’s hotel room in a “frantic” state. Within minutes of their return, Jennifer, Brown, Berardinelli, and defendant had hastily packed their belongings, jumped into the rental car, and began the return trip to Rhode Island. The defendant ordered that “[e]verybody keep their mouth shut.”', 'During the return trip, defendant commanded Brown to shower in order to “wash off the evidence” from the Spearin murder. When the group arrived home, they went directly to Jennifer’s South Providence apartment. Once again, defendant directed Brown to shower “[t]o 6', 'The trial testimony revealed that while in Florida, defendant and his group encountered several acquaintances from Providence, namely Kevin Faria and an individual known as “Gunner.” 7', 'It appears from the record that defendant was romantically involved with both Berardinelli and Jennifer. Also, the record is unclear as to how, or with whom, Jennifer traveled to Florida.', '-4- wash the gun – the gun residue and the rest of the residue off.” Jennifer then showered. While she was doing so, Berardinelli questioned defendant about Jennifer’s loyalty to him. Specifically, Berardinelli warned defendant that Jennifer “was going to tell on him.” Thereafter, defendant announced that “if anyone from Florida tried to contact [one of you] about the incident,” that person should “refuse to answer any questions, and immediately obtain a lawyer.”', 'In the weeks that followed his return to Rhode Island, defendant maintained a low profile, hiding out in various hotels throughout Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Frequently, Jennifer accompanied defendant, staying at the hotels with him. Nonetheless, the investigation into the events that had transpired in Florida was beginning to catch up with defendant.', 'On November 15, 2006, Berardinelli was contacted by Det. Jose Gonzalez of the Miami- Dade Police Department. Detective Gonzalez, who was conducting a criminal investigation, sought to identify individuals who were associated with certain nicknames.', 'During the questioning, Berardinelli revealed the nicknames for herself, Brown, Soares, and defendant. However, when asked to identify the person who was associated with Jennifer’s nickname, Berardinelli told Det. Gonzalez that “she was an acquaintance, someone that’s known to her here in Providence that she has seen several times,” but she lied and claimed that “she did not know her actual name.”', 'At the conclusion of the interview, Berardinelli informed defendant about what had occurred. The defendant became enraged; he “yelled and screamed” at Berardinelli because she “didn’t do what he had originally told [her] to do and refuse to answer questions, and tell them [she] had an attorney.” Adding to defendant’s consternation was his discovery that several other people had been questioned about the Florida incident, including Kevin Faria, “who told [the detectives] everything.”', '-5-', 'It appeared to be simply a matter of time until the Florida detectives would be able to identify and question the remaining accomplices, including Jennifer. Berardinelli testified that defendant said he was convinced that Jennifer “would never say anything to go against him or to implicate him because she loved him.” However, defendant was concerned that Jennifer might implicate Berardinelli. Berardinelli testified that defendant said he believed that, if questioned, “Jenny was going to substitute herself with [Berardinelli] in the driver’s seat of the car [the night of Spearin’s murder], and that [Berardinelli] would go to jail, and that Jenny was going to ultimately have [defendant] to herself.” As a result, fearing for the welfare of himself and Berardinelli, defendant proclaimed that “he really didn’t trust [Jennifer], and that she had to go.”', 'Similarly, Ruiz testified that defendant had voiced concern after he was alerted that the Florida investigation had made its way to Rhode Island. Specifically, Ruiz said that defendant told him that he “didn’t trust [Jennifer]” because he was convinced that “she would tell on him over something that happened in Florida.” As a result, Ruiz said, defendant solicited him to kill Jennifer. Specifically, Ruiz said that defendant instructed him to hide near Jennifer’s apartment until he lured her outside, at which point Ruiz was to shoot and kill her. However, defendant was unable to coax Jennifer out of her apartment and simply told Ruiz to “forget it, because [Jennifer’s] son was upstairs with her.”', 'Ruiz also testified that, on the evening of the aborted attempt to murder Jennifer, defendant informed him that, on November 20, 2006, “there’s going to be a good, good lick.” Ruiz explained that a “good lick” meant a “chance or possib[ility to] get a lot of money.” On November 19, 2006, defendant clarified that the following day they were going to rob a bank. Ruiz said that defendant explained that he and Ruiz would enter the bank and commit the robbery and that Jennifer would drive a getaway car. Jennifer borrowed her sister’s car on the', '-6- day of the robbery, agreeing to return it by 3:00 p.m.', 'That evening, Jennifer, Ruiz, and defendant spent the night at Jennifer’s South Providence apartment.', 'The following day, they prepared for the impending bank robbery. In an attempt to conceal their identities, defendant and Ruiz outfitted themselves from head to toe in black clothing; however, only defendant, and not Ruiz, secured gloves to wear during the robbery. The pair also purchased bandanas to cover their faces. Next, they began canvassing Providence area banks in search of a bank that had neither security officers nor bulletproof glass. To that end, Jennifer reconnoitered several banks in the city; eventually, they arrived at the Sovereign Bank on Elmgrove Avenue. Jennifer cased the bank and determined that it had neither security officers nor bulletproof glass, making it the ideal target.', 'Shortly before 3:10 p.m., Ruiz and defendant got out of the car operated by Jennifer and put defendant’s plan into action. According to the testimony elicited at trial, Ruiz entered the bank first and ordered the tellers to put the money in his bag. 8 The tellers complied; however, Ruiz became impatient and began reaching into the cash drawers himself. Meanwhile, defendant remained near the entrance to the bank lobby, maintaining order by brandishing his gun and threatening to open fire. Ruiz testified that, after they had been in the bank for about forty seconds, defendant told him that it was time to leave. As a result, Ruiz and defendant scampered from the bank and re-entered the car with Jennifer.', 'The trio proceeded to a motel, where they were met by Berardinelli, defendant’s eight- year-old son, Deaven Jr., and defendant’s half-brother, Dana Wilson.', 'The proceeds were counted and amounted to about $50,000.', 'Ominously, when Jennifer was out of earshot, defendant spoke with Berardinelli, Ruiz, and Wilson and declared that “he had used Jenny as 8', 'Three tellers on duty at Sovereign Bank during the robbery provided nearly identical versions of the events that unfolded during the robbery.', '-7- much as he could. He didn’t trust her anymore and she had to go.” The defendant propositioned Wilson and Ruiz to see if they would murder Jennifer. Wilson testified that defendant first turned to him and said, “[y]ou can have [Jennifer’s] share of the money [from the bank robbery] if you kill her.” To defendant’s dismay, Wilson declined to kill Jennifer for $10,000, her share of the robbery proceeds, explaining that “[h]e didn’t want to kill her. He wanted no part of any of it.” Next, Berardinelli and Wilson testified that defendant made the same offer to Ruiz; kill Jennifer in exchange for her share of the robbery proceeds. Berardinelli and Wilson testified that Ruiz responded affirmatively, “F--- it. I’ll kill her. I don’t care.” However, shortly thereafter, Ruiz experienced a change of heart and said that he would not participate in defendant’s money- for-murder scheme. At that point, Ruiz testified, defendant said he would “take care of it.” Later that evening, Jennifer, Wilson, Ruiz, and defendant drove around the Providence area and eventually arrived in Pawtucket and parked the car on Grotto Avenue.', 'The defendant then carried out the murder of Jennifer.', 'Once the deed was done, defendant ran to the car, entered the vehicle, and warned Ruiz and Wilson “[h]ear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil.” After the group fled the scene, Wilson said, defendant reminded him to “[k]eep your mouth shut. You’re my brother. I’ll f------ kill you.” Sometime after midnight, defendant arrived at Berardinelli’s condo, entered her bedroom, and handed her a shopping bag containing a sock with his gun inside. The defendant told Berardinelli he had just done “the hardest thing he ever had to do” and he instructed her to hide his gun outside; she hid it in a nearby park. The defendant also directed Berardinelli to destroy the distinctive blue fur coat that he had been wearing the night of Jennifer’s murder.', 'In early December 2006, Berardinelli, Ruiz, Wilson, and defendant visited Atlantic City, New Jersey. While in New Jersey, defendant told Berardinelli and Wilson that he could no', '-8- longer trust Ruiz because he had not worn gloves during the bank robbery. The defendant suspected that investigators would link Ruiz to the bank robbery and that eventually Ruiz “was going to open his mouth and tell all.” As a result, defendant declared that Ruiz “had to go” and that “[h]e didn’t want [Ruiz] to come back to the State of Rhode Island.” Berardinelli and Wilson disagreed, telling defendant that he was “nuts” and that he should “[l]et the kid live.” Eventually, defendant relented. Berardinelli and Wilson also persuaded defendant to dispose of the gun he had used in Jennifer’s murder before he returned to Rhode Island. On December 9, 2006, the group departed Atlantic City for Rhode Island. 9', 'Meanwhile, major headway was made by the Providence Police Department in their investigation into the Sovereign Bank robbery. Detectives had lifted a latent fingerprint, later determined to be Ruiz’s, from a teller’s cash drawer. Ruiz was contacted by his mother, who said that the police had been to her home and that they wanted Ruiz to turn himself in for questioning. On December 12, 2006, Ruiz, accompanied by a lawyer who had been retained by defendant, turned himself in to the police. Ruiz was arrested on the spot. Later that day, authorities also arrested defendant.', 'During the time that defendant was incarcerated awaiting trial, Berardinelli visited him on numerous occasions and she testified about a number of their conversations. With respect to Jennifer’s death, Berardinelli testified that defendant told her that he was “impressed with the way that she took it. * * * she took it like a soldier. She didn’t run. She didn’t cry. She didn’t beg for her life. She just said, ‘Deaven, please no.’ And that was it.” On another occasion, defendant told Berardinelli that Wilson, his half-brother, “knew too much, and he was a liability, and that he had to go.” She said that defendant explained that Wilson was a drug dealer who was 9', 'The testimony was that the group broke apart defendant’s gun and threw the pieces into the ocean.', '-9- bound to be caught by the authorities and, when that happened, Wilson would implicate defendant both in the bank robbery and Jennifer’s murder.', 'Therefore, Berardinelli said, defendant suggested that she lure Wilson into a local field under the pretext that they were recovering the robbery proceeds and then shoot and kill Wilson. However, Berardinelli said that she refused because she was pregnant with defendant’s second child.', 'On a separate occasion, Berardinelli said that she and defendant discussed Susan Duarte. Berardinelli observed that defendant should be worried about Susan’s testimony because she would be sure to elicit sympathy from the jury at defendant’s trial for Jennifer’s murder. The defendant agreed and said that he believed “[s]he had to go” and indicated that he would have two of his associates take care of Susan outside of Rhode Island. Berardinelli also testified that defendant told her that she had to “start coaching” her co-workers into unwittingly creating an alibi for him for the bank robbery. Specifically, defendant wanted Berardinelli to repeatedly tell her co-workers that he had picked her up from work at 2:30 p.m. on the day of the robbery, because he firmly believed that the more often you say something, the more likely it is that people will believe it. Similarly, Brown testified that defendant spoke with him in an attempt to create an alibi with regard to Jennifer’s murder. Brown said that defendant wanted him to offer a local stripper by the name of Tiffany $5,000 to say that she was with defendant in the early- morning hours of November 21, 2006; however, Brown never complied.', 'After trial, the jury found defendant guilty on all counts, and the trial justice sentenced him to three consecutive life sentences plus an additional thirty-five consecutive nonparoleable years. On May 11, 2010, defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', '- 10 -', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'On appeal, defendant advances two primary arguments to support his appeal. First, defendant argues that the trial justice abused his discretion when he admitted certain Rule 404(b) evidence. Specifically, defendant challenges the admission of evidence relating to: (1) the Florida incident; (2) the Spearin murder; and (3) the subsequent investigation spearheaded by Det. Gonzalez.', 'Second, defendant contends that the trial justice erred when he denied his motion for a mistrial after Ruiz revealed, during cross-examination by defendant, that he knew that the term “good lick” meant a robbery because he had previously taken part in such acts with defendant.', 'Third, defendant claims that the trial justice’s failure to grant a mistrial based on the prosecutor’s inappropriate and inflammatory comments during closing argument constituted reversible error.', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Rule 404(b) Evidence', 'i', 'The Florida Evidence', 'Before the trial started, the state filed a motion in limine, seeking the court’s guidance with respect to the admissibility of certain Rule 404(b) evidence. The state argued that the Florida evidence was necessary to demonstrate defendant’s motive for killing Jennifer and to provide the jury with an accurate description of the sequence of events leading up to Jennifer’s', '- 11 - murder.', 'The defendant objected; he argued that the Florida evidence should be excluded because its admission would violate the dictates of Rule 404(b) and because it was extremely prejudicial, as set forth in Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. 10', 'After a lengthy hearing, the trial justice ruled that the Florida evidence did not exceed the bounds established by Rule 404(b) and that it would be admitted. The trial justice explained that determining the admissibility of uncharged acts requires a bifurcated inquiry under Rules 404(b) and 403. First, the court must ensure that the proffered evidence is relevant to the proof of a significant issue in the case and not offered simply to show a defendant’s propensity for wrongdoing. After making such a finding, the trial justice must then undertake a Rule 403 analysis to determine whether the evidence’s “probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.”', 'Here, the trial justice found that the Florida evidence was probative as to defendant’s motive for killing Jennifer, namely, to prevent her from exposing him to prosecution for the Florida crime. The trial justice found that the evidence of defendant’s motive was “powerful, relevant and extraordinarily significant” and determined that it should not be kept from the jury. In fact, the trial justice stated that, “[i]n the end, it is the motive that drives this murder; the motive to eliminate Jen Duarte.” However, recognizing the powerfully prejudicial effect that evidence of this nature might have on defendant, the trial justice then subjected the Florida evidence to a Rule 403 analysis. After completing that task, the trial justice concluded that the potential prejudice of the evidence did not override its relevance and probative value.', 'In addition, he explained that the jury should be permitted to hear the Florida evidence in order “to 10', 'Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides that “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.”', '- 12 - allow the jury to have a complete and, hopefully, coherent story” because “to try to separate out the Florida events would be to effectively remove from the [s]tate’s quiver its sharpest arrow: the motive for the defendant’s allegedly having killed [Jennifer].” 11', 'During the course of trial, the state called multiple witnesses to testify about the events that had occurred in Florida. Immediately before that testimony was elicited, defendant renewed his objection to the admission of the evidence based upon Rules 404(b) and 403, objections that were overruled by the trial justice. Nonetheless, in an attempt to follow the dictates of State v. Pona, 948 A.2d 941 (R.I. 2008) (Pona I), the state advised that it would not use the term “murder” in reference to the Florida incident. 12 Instead, the state said it would refer only to “a plan to hurt someone, someone being hurt,” and also that Brown heard gunshots while Spearin was being “hurt.” The trial justice said that the state was entitled to call it a murder through their witnesses. Specifically, the trial justice explained to the state that “[y]ou want to call it a murder through your witnesses, go right ahead. I gave you permission. If you want to slow it down, water it down, diminish it for the sake of the defendant’s exposure in this case, I commend you for having done so. It’s up to you.”', 'At trial, Det. Gonzalez was the first witness to testify with respect to the Florida incident. Detective Gonzalez explained that, during the course of a criminal investigation, he questioned Berardinelli about the people associated with certain nicknames. However, Det. Gonzalez never revealed the nature of the crime that he was investigating, nor did he describe the underlying 11', 'This Court has previously explained that, “[u]nder Rule 403, ‘[i]t is only evidence that is marginally relevant and enormously prejudicial that must be excluded.’” State v.

Pona, 948 A.2d 941, 953 (R.I. 2008), we held that the “quantum of evidence” admitted at trial relating to a separate murder resulted in extreme prejudice to the defendant and warranted a new trial. However, we explained that “we will not go so far as to deny the prosecution the opportunity to make any reference to the fact that [the] defendant was charged with [a separate] murder * * * .” Id.', '- 13 - facts. At the end of Det. Gonzalez’s direct examination, the trial justice provided a limiting instruction to the jury. 13', 'The next witness to testify about the Florida events was Brown. Brown testified about the details of the plan that defendant had conceived to murder Spearin and that he heard several gunshots while the plan was carried out. However, at no point during his testimony did Brown use the term “murder.” Instead, Brown only spoke of a plan to “hurt” Spearin. After this testimony, the trial justice provided another limiting instruction to the jury. 14', 'Finally, Berardinelli testified about the events that took place on the night of Spearin’s murder. Specifically, Berardinelli testified that defendant ordered Soares to “take care of” Spearin with the assistance of Brown and Jennifer. As was the case with the other witnesses, Berardinelli never mentioned a “murder” nor did she lay out the specifics of what had transpired. Once again, as he did after the other witnesses describing the Florida events had concluded their testimony, the trial justice provided a cautionary instruction, reminding the jury of the limited purposes for which they were allowed to consider the Florida evidence. 15', 'Before us, defendant argues that, notwithstanding the trial justice’s cautionary instructions and the absence of the term “murder” from the testimony, the trial justice nevertheless abused his discretion when he admitted the Rule 404(b) evidence.

Equally entrenched in our jurisprudence is the “long history of prohibiting the use of ‘other crimes, wrongs, or acts’ as evidence to prove the propensity of a defendant to commit crimes.” Pona I, 948 A.2d at 949 (quoting Rule 404(b)). “The overriding policy of excluding such evidence * * * is the practical experience that its disallowance tends to prevent confusion of issues, unfair surprise and undue prejudice.” Id. (quoting State v. Gallagher, 654 A.2d 1206, 1210 (R.I. 1995)). Therefore, “evidence of a defendant’s bad character or criminal disposition may not be admitted to prove his or her propensity to commit crime * * * .” Brown, 900 A.2d at 1160 (quoting State v.

Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 838 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Rule 403). Therefore, evidence admitted under Rule 404(b), “like all evidence, must survive Rule 403 scrutiny.” State v.

Specifically, the trial justice found that the evidence of defendant’s motive was “powerful, relevant and extraordinarily significant” and that its probative value was not outweighed by its potential prejudice. We agree. The defendant had a motive to kill Jennifer because she might later expose defendant, or Berardinelli, to prosecution for the Spearin murder, something defendant was determined to prevent from happening. In our opinion, the trial justice properly exercised his discretion when he admitted evidence of the Florida murder under Rule 404(b).', '- 16 -', 'However, the trial justice did not end his analysis there. After determining that the evidence met the test of Rule 404(b), he balanced the relevance and probative value of the Florida evidence against its potential prejudice, as he is required to do under Rule 403. The trial justice determined that the probative value of the evidence was not outweighed by the potential for prejudice, and he indicated that his conclusion was further buttressed by the state’s decision to refrain from referring to the Florida incident as a murder. Finally, the trial justice provided multiple limiting instructions to the jury throughout trial, including immediately after the Florida events were brought to light, as well as before closing arguments. Accordingly, in light of the trial justice’s thorough and careful analysis, as well as his numerous limiting instructions, we can discern no abuse of discretion in admitting the Florida evidence.', 'ii', '“Good lick” Testimony', 'Next, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he declined to declare a mistrial after Ruiz revealed, while he was being cross-examined by defendant, that he understood the term “good lick” to mean a robbery because he had previously perpetrated such acts with defendant. The defendant contends that this testimony “easily could have distracted the jurors from the issues at hand and allowed them to convict [d]efendant based upon evidence that he and Ruiz were seasoned robbers.” However, before Ruiz testified, the trial justice conducted an extensive voir dire of Ruiz, wherein the witness said that he decided to testify against defendant, in part, because he was afraid defendant would “snitch” on him about other “robberies and a shooting.” Ruiz further explained that he was talking about robberies and a shooting that were not the subject of defendant’s trial. Consequently, defense counsel was on notice that, according to Ruiz, he and defendant had acted together in the past in committing other robberies and a', '- 17 - shooting. In fact, the trial justice cautioned defense counsel about the dangers of this very line of questioning because “it is going to open a door to expose your client to other shootings and other robberies.” Defense counsel acknowledged that it “[m]ay well do that,” but he decided to proceed nonetheless.', 'At the conclusion of the voir dire, defense counsel continued his cross-examination of Ruiz.

At the very beginning of the next trial day, defendant moved to pass the case. After hearing argument from the parties and reviewing a transcript of the proceedings from the previous day, the trial justice ruled on the motion to pass. In so doing, the trial justice summarized the voir dire testimony of Ruiz that had taken place outside the presence of the jury, during which Ruiz acknowledged that he had committed other robberies and shootings with defendant. The trial justice observed that defense counsel, whom he described as “a paragon of the ability to defend criminal cases,” had been “forewarned” that Ruiz had participated in uncharged robberies with defendant.

Generally, a prosecutor “is given considerable latitude in closing argument, as long as the statements pertain only to the evidence presented and represent reasonable inferences from the record.” State v. Horton, 871 A.2d 959, 965 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885). Thus, a prosecutor’s comments will be deemed inappropriate when they “are totally extraneous to the issues in the case and tend to inflame and arouse the passions of the jury.” Id. at 965 (quoting Boillard, 789 A.2d at 885). 16', 'The defendant also argues that the cumulative effect of the Rule 404(b) evidence constituted reversible error.

To the contrary, the prosecutor was commenting on the evidence that had been introduced at trial, namely Berardinelli’s testimony that defendant wanted her to “start coaching the kids that I worked with; that I had to start putting ideas into their head, because the more you talk about something around someone, and the more you repeat it, that – and they hear it, that they start to believe it to be a memory.” The prosecutor properly alluded to defendant’s “coaching” comments, especially in light of defense counsel’s suggestion during closing argument that it was Ruiz, not defendant, who murdered Jennifer. It is our opinion that the prosecutor’s statement did not exceed the “considerable latitude” he was allowed 17', 'The following transpired during the prosecutor’s closing argument:', '“[Prosecutor]: When Ms. Tucker was telling [about defendant attempting to enlist', 'Berardinelli and others to create false alibis], she said that when [defendant] got', 'something in his head, his angle on things was if you say it often enough, it', 'becomes the truth.', 'Now, I’m not going to for a second suggest that having been associated', 'with [defendant] for all this time, that [defense counsel] has adopted [defendant’s]', 'mantra, but, in his closing argument --', '“[Defense Counsel]: Well, I object to this.', '“[The Court]: Overruled.', '“[Prosecutor]: [Defense counsel] suggested over and over and over again that', 'Jason Ruiz killed Jennifer Duarte.

For Susan, her mother, [Jennifer’s son] – and, by the way, do you think [Jennifer’s son] misses his mother any more just because she might not have had him every night?” 18 The defendant maintains this comment was impermissible “victim impact evidence.” We cannot agree. During trial, defense counsel probed a number of the state’s witnesses about the nature of Jennifer’s relationship with her son. In particular, defense counsel asked Jennifer’s sister, Susan, about how much time Jennifer spent with her son. In response, Susan explained that her mother “baby sat [Jennifer’s son] all the time.” Since defendant questioned a number of witnesses about Jennifer’s relationship, or lack thereof, with her son, it was in the record and therefore proper fodder for the prosecutor’s closing argument. See Horton, 871 A.2d at 965. Nothing the prosecutor said was “totally extraneous to the issues in the case [nor did it] tend to inflame and arouse the passions of the jury.” Id.

32,State : v. : Thomas H. Matthews. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. On June 18, 2012, a Newport County Superior Court jury found the defendant, Thomas H. Matthews, guilty of disorderly conduct in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-45-1(a)(3). Thereafter, on July 5, 2012, the trial justice imposed upon the defendant a sentence of six months, with thirty days to serve and the balance suspended, with probation. On appeal, the defendant contends: (1) that the trial justice erred in denying the defendant’s motion for a new trial and his motion for a judgment of acquittal; and (2) that the criminal complaint lodged against the defendant was insufficient as a matter of law to place him on notice of the charge against him. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s judgment of conviction and its denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial and motion for a judgment of acquittal.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On January 31, 2012, Mr. Matthews was arrested by two Rhode Island State Police troopers and charged with one count of disorderly conduct in violation of § 11-45-1(a)(3), which provides that a person commits disorderly conduct if that person “intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly[,] * * * [d]irects at another person in a public place offensive words which are likely to provoke a violent reaction on the part of the average person so addressed[.]”1 The Superior Court jury trial on the just-referenced charge began on June 18, 2012, and the evidence presented therein consisted of testimony from the state police troopers who arrested the defendant—viz., Trooper Anthony Washington and Trooper Edward Viera.2 We summarize below the portions of their testimony relevant to the instant appeal. 1', 'In what was the first of several instances of confusion throughout the pendency of this case regarding the applicable subsection of the disorderly conduct statute, the criminal complaint correctly cites the statute allegedly violated as G.L. 1956 § 11-45-1(a)(3), which is often referred to as the “fighting words” provision; however, the statutory language that is quoted in the complaint is from § 11-45-1(a)(1) (“A person commits disorderly conduct if he or she intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly * * * [e]ngages in fighting or threatening, or in violent or tumultuous behavior[.]”), which is often referred to as the “behavior” provision. Nevertheless, it is important to note from the outset that, at all critical points in the course of the litigation, the court and the parties unquestionably focused on the elements of the crime that are set forth in § 11-45-1(a)(3), and so we too proceed with our attention dedicated to the just-referenced provision. 2', 'Mr. Matthews was first convicted of disorderly conduct after a jury-waived trial in the District Court; pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 12-22-1 and Rule 37 of the District Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, defendant exercised his right to a trial de novo in the Superior Court.', '-2-', 'A', 'The Testimony at Trial3', '1. The Testimony of Trooper Anthony Washington', 'Trooper Washington4 testified that, at approximately 1:00 a.m. on January 31, 2012, he and Trooper Viera were traveling together in a police cruiser in Middletown, Rhode Island; he said that, as he turned onto West Main Road, he saw from about one hundred feet away what he referred to as an “altercation” between a man and a woman. (During his testimony at trial, Trooper Washington identified the man as defendant Thomas Matthews.) When asked at trial to be more specific about his observations, Trooper Washington added that he saw the pair “hugging, doing something” and that “the male was yelling and screaming.”', 'Trooper Washington testified that he did not get a “full look” at the man and woman as he drove past them and that he accordingly made a U-turn to approach the pair again. Trooper Washington further testified that, as he made the turn, he observed the two persons “yelling and screaming” at each other.', 'Trooper Washington further testified that, after he made the U-turn, he and Trooper Viera drove up to where the two individuals stood; he added that both troopers immediately stepped 3', 'We note that, in the testimony of both troopers, the various epithets allegedly uttered by defendant on the night of his arrest were transcribed without redaction. We have chosen to reproduce their testimony in this opinion in a similarly unbowdlerized fashion because what defendant is alleged to have actually said is so central to the issues on appeal. Unfortunately, many of the words in question are likely to cause real offense to some readers, but we are convinced that an unflinching examination of defendant’s speech is critical to a just analysis of his arguments. This Court has proceeded in this manner in similar situations in the past. See, e.g., State v. Grayhurst, 852 A.2d 491, 509 (R.I. 2004); Johnson v. Palange, 122 R.I. 361, 363 n. 2, 406 A.2d 360, 361 n. 2 (1979). 4', 'For reasons that will become apparent in the course of our discussion of defendant’s arguments on appeal, it is significant to note that Trooper Washington has been described by both parties as an African-American man.', '-3- out of the cruiser. Trooper Washington stated that, upon alighting from his vehicle, he heard defendant say, “[T]ake me now, take me now, I don’t care.” Trooper Washington next testified that he asked defendant for identification and that defendant responded, “‘[F]uck you, cops,’ ‘you’re gay,’ ‘you * * * guys are queers,’ [and] ‘you guys are just harassing me.’” In addition, Trooper Washington testified that defendant made “several threats, threats saying he was going to kill us.” Trooper Washington stated that, at that point in time, he was concerned for “[o]fficer safety and the female’s safety,” explaining that, when defendant began yelling and screaming, the troopers “didn’t know what was going on.”', 'Trooper Washington testified that defendant then “made a physical movement” towards both troopers and that Trooper Viera proceeded to place defendant in an “arm bar.”5 Trooper Washington added that, once defendant was placed in the arm bar, Trooper Washington proceeded to “grab” from defendant’s pocket the identification which he had previously requested.', 'Trooper Washington testified that, although the troopers “ended up calming [defendant] down for literally a brief second or two,” while in the arm bar defendant kept on saying, “[Y]ou guys are harassing me” and, “I didn’t do anything.”', 'Trooper Washington next testified that, while he and Trooper Viera continued their attempts to calm defendant down, Trooper Viera “loosen[ed] the arm bar,” at which point “it looked like [defendant] wanted to escape.” Trooper Washington stated that “[f]rom that point forward, [he and Trooper Viera] ended up putting [defendant] in handcuffs for [their] safety.” 5', 'On cross-examination, Trooper Washington explained that the term “arm bar” refers to a method of controlling an individual, whereby the individual’s “arm is straight out” and the police officer is able to exert control over him. Trooper Washington testified that, in the just-described position, the officer has control over the individual, and the individual is bent over “against the cruiser * * * [to] have the vehicle support,” thereby preventing him from moving around and injuring himself or others.', '-4- Trooper Washington later confirmed that, once defendant was in handcuffs, he was deemed to be under arrest for disorderly conduct.', 'Trooper Washington added that, during the process of handcuffing and immediately thereafter, defendant continued to yell: “‘I’m going to kill you guys,’ ‘I don’t care,’ ‘I don’t care if I go back,’ ‘fuck you, cops,’ ‘you guys are queer,’ ‘gay,’ [and] so forth.” Trooper Washington further testified that he and Trooper Viera then decided to put defendant in their police cruiser; he described as follows what occurred while they were doing so:', '“[The defendant] literally looked at me and he said, ‘[Y]ou’re', 'nothing but a bitch-ass nigger,’ ‘I don’t know why you’re doing', 'this,’ ‘you’re going against me,’ ‘you’re going against your own', 'kind.’ And that was directly toward me.” Trooper Washington further testified that he and Trooper Viera transported defendant to the Wickford barracks for processing; he added that defendant was uncooperative throughout the entirety of the troopers’ attempt to process him at the barracks. Trooper Washington stated that defendant was “yelling, swearing, continuously stating that he knew people, that he was going to have my badge, that he was also going to kill me, kill Trooper Viera * * * [and was] calling us gay and saying we were harassing him.”', 'On cross-examination, Trooper Washington testified that the two individuals whom he had observed in Middletown on the date at issue (viz., defendant and his female companion) were both African-American.', 'Trooper Washington then answered a series of questions concerning the time at which defendant was placed in the arm bar by Trooper Viera. First, Trooper Washington admitted that, after he took defendant’s identification, defendant was not released from the arm bar.', 'Next, Trooper Washington testified that, after he obtained identification from defendant, Trooper Viera “release[d] the pressure” on defendant while defendant was in the arm bar; he added that, once they did so, “it seemed like [defendant] wanted', '-5- to continue at [him and Trooper Viera].”6 Finally, on further questioning, Trooper Washington stated that he felt as though defendant wanted to “continue at [him]” because, when Trooper Viera released the pressure on the arm bar, defendant “made a quick forward movement.” It was at that point, Trooper Washington testified, that the two troopers put defendant in handcuffs. On redirect examination, Trooper Washington testified in more detail regarding defendant’s forward movement, stating that Trooper Washington “[i]nterpreted that movement towards [the troopers], the forward movement [as meaning] that he was going to attack * * *.”', 'Finally, Trooper Washington testified on cross-examination that, during the encounter with defendant, he understood defendant’s utterances “as a threat.”', 'Specifically, Trooper Washington testified that, “[w]hen a person says, ‘I’m going to kill you,’ I take that as a threat.” He added that defendant said “I’m going to kill you” to both Trooper Viera and himself.', '2. The Testimony of Trooper Edward Viera', 'Trooper Viera’s testimony was largely consistent with the testimony of Trooper Washington regarding the night of defendant’s arrest. Trooper Viera testified that, in the early morning hours of January 31, 2012, he was riding as a passenger in the vehicle driven by Trooper Washington on West Main Road. Trooper Viera stated that, at around 1:22 a.m., Trooper Washington pointed out two people, whom Trooper Viera later described as “standing in the street.” To Trooper Viera the pair appeared to be “engaged in a physical altercation;” he said that “[i]t appeared they had hold of each other’s shirt in the front and were like moving around in a type of scuffle.” Trooper Viera testified that, as the troopers in the police car approached the pair, it appeared that the two individuals “were hugging.” 6', 'On recross-examination, Trooper Washington noted that, although Trooper Viera “released the pressure,” he did not release the arm bar; and Trooper Washington added that Trooper Viera still had physical control over defendant.', '-6-', 'Trooper Viera next testified that the troopers proceeded to pull up to the two persons, and Trooper Viera observed that one of them was a man and the other was a woman. He next stated that he had “no sooner closed the door * * * when the * * * male party stepped back from the female and threw his hands in the air and demanded to be taken away.”7 When asked to describe what happened next, Trooper Viera testified that defendant was “screaming loud[ly] and boisterously, [in a] tumultuous manner, [a] violent manner.” Trooper Viera specifically stated that defendant called both troopers “motherfuckers,” told the two troopers that they “weren’t shit,” and told the troopers that they “couldn’t do anything to him.” It was at that time, Trooper Viera testified, that he put defendant in what he described as a “restraint.” Trooper Viera stated that he “took [defendant] into control, forced him across the hood of the cruiser to get him to calm down and gained control of him.” According to his testimony, Trooper Viera did so because he believed that “at [that] point [defendant] was in such an agitated state, he was either getting ready to run or fight;” the trooper added that his belief in that regard was “based on [his] training [and] experience.”', 'Trooper Viera next testified that, after having been restrained by the troopers, defendant began calling the troopers “motherfuckers,” “queers,” and “fags;” he added that defendant then “threatened to kick [the troopers’] asses.”', 'In addition, Trooper Viera testified, defendant “threatened to kill [the troopers].” At that point, Trooper Viera testified, he had “heard enough, seen enough;” and he handcuffed defendant, placing him under arrest for disorderly conduct.', 'Trooper Viera’s testimony then turned to the details of how he had first restrained and then arrested defendant. Trooper Viera confirmed that, when he placed defendant in the arm bar, he was not under arrest.', 'Trooper Viera further testified that he tried to “de-escalate the 7', 'In the course of his testimony at trial, Trooper Viera identified defendant as the “male party” whom he observed at the time in question.', '-7- situation,” telling defendant to “shut up” and “calm down,” but he stated that it “didn’t do any good.” It was Trooper Viera’s testimony that, after he released his grip “a little bit,” defendant “continued to scream and move in a tumultuous and violent manner.”', 'Trooper Viera next testified that, after defendant was placed in handcuffs and put into the back seat of the police cruiser, he “continued to scream and rant,” including threatening the troopers. Trooper Viera’s testimony in that regard was as follows: “[H]e just wouldn’t shut up. He called us both niggers, threatened to kill both of us. Not only did he threaten[] to kill both of us, he threatened to kill our families too, just continually ranted.” Trooper Viera further testified that he believed that the just-referenced utterances were directed at both Trooper Washington and himself because both troopers were in the car with defendant. Finally, Trooper Viera stated that he felt threatened and provoked by defendant at the time defendant was placed under arrest.8', 'On cross-examination, Trooper Viera testified that, at the beginning of his encounter with defendant, he walked towards defendant, who “took a step back.” Trooper Viera characterized that step back as a “defensive posture” and a “defensive stance.” Trooper Viera also stated that the “first thing [defendant] did was call[] [the troopers] motherfuckers[.]” After that, Trooper Viera testified, defendant said to the troopers that they could not “do shit” to him. Trooper Viera 8', 'The relevant exchange between the prosecutor and Trooper Viera proceeded as follows:', '“Q', '* * * [I]f you could please tell us what [defendant] said to', 'you before you placed him in the arm bar?', '“A', '* * * At the time I asked him for some identification, he', 'told me, ‘come get it from me.’ And it’s at that point he', 'proceeded to call us motherfuckers, queers. It was at that', 'point that he was placed under arrest.', '“Q', 'Did you feel threatened?', '“A', 'Yes.', '“Q', 'Did you feel provoked?', '“A', 'Yes, I did.”', '-8- conceded that it was at that point in time that he took “physical control” of defendant, before any threat to either trooper was made.', 'Trooper Viera also testified that, while in the police cruiser during transport, defendant “threatened to kick [the troopers’] asses.” Trooper Viera added that defendant had accused Trooper Washington and himself of trying to take him into the woods and kill him and that, “before [defendant] would let [the troopers] do that, he would kill [them] first[.]” Finally, Trooper Viera acknowledged that, when defendant threatened the troopers’ families, he did not indicate how he planned to carry out that threat.', 'B', 'The Motion for a Judgment of Acquittal', 'After Troopers Washington and Viera testified, the state rested. Defense counsel then moved for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure, arguing that defendant’s speech was not “likely to [have] produce[d] a clear and present danger of serious, substantial evil that rises far above public inconvenience[,] annoyance or unrest.” Relying upon State v. McKenna, 415 A.2d 729 (R.I. 1980), and State v. Authelet, 120 R.I. 42, 385 A.2d 642 (1978), defense counsel contended: (1) that defendant’s “verbal barrage” constituted no more than “idle, wild threats,” as was held to have been the case in McKenna; and (2) that defendant’s speech was not directed at an individual, as required by Authelet. The state objected to the motion; in particular, the state attempted to distinguish McKenna on its facts, referring to the defendant in that case as a “young girl” and emphasizing her apparent inability to “effectuate [her] threat.”', 'The trial justice denied defense counsel’s motion for a judgment of acquittal. He began by reading the relevant statute, § 11-45-1(a)(3), into the record and pointing to the elements that', '-9- must be proven in order to convict a person of the “fighting words” form of disorderly conduct; he quoted § 11-45-1(a)(3) in stating that “[a] person commits disorderly conduct if he or she intentionally, knowingly or recklessly * * * [d]irects at another person in a public place offensive words which are likely to provoke a violent reaction on the part of the average person so addressed.” Focusing on these criteria, the trial justice ruled that the case could be submitted to the jury.9 He found that there was sufficient evidence such that a reasonable juror could find: (1) that defendant “acted intentionally;” (2) that defendant directed the words in question, beginning with “[A]rrest me” and “[T]ake me away,” at Trooper Washington and Trooper Viera; (3) that defendant spoke the words in a public place “during the course of [the] confrontation;” and (4) that the words spoken by defendant “could be looked at in the light that their very utterance inflicted injury or tend[ed] to incite an immediate breach of the peace.” On the basis of these findings, the trial justice denied the motion for a judgment of acquittal, and the defense then rested without presenting any evidence. 9', 'In ruling on defense counsel’s motion, the trial justice conflated the “fighting words” subsection of the disorderly conduct statute, § 11-45-1(a)(3), with the subsection addressing behavior, § 11-45-1(a)(1). Significantly, however, the trial justice did recite the correct standard under the § 11-45-1 (a)(3), or “fighting words” provision.', 'The just-referenced issue occurred a few more times during the travel of this case in Superior Court; in one instance, the trial justice mistakenly referenced the “behavior” subsection during the instructions to the jury, but still gave the correct elements to the “fighting words” subsection of the disorderly conduct statute. In another instance, while ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice erroneously referred to the “specific written” charge applicable to defendant as the “behavior” subsection of the disorderly conduct statute. Once again, however, he correctly described the “fighting words” concept as he continued to rule on the motion. At each juncture, however, defendant failed to object to any statement by the trial justice incorrectly referencing the “behavior” subsection of the disorderly conduct statute.', '- 10 -', 'C', 'The Jury Instructions and the Verdict', 'Following final arguments by the parties, the trial justice instructed the jury. Neither party raised any objections to the instructions. In fact, the trial justice later stated, in ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial, that he had charged the jury “essentially in accord with the proposed jury instructions from the defendant.”', 'The jury proceeded to deliberate, and a guilty verdict resulted.', 'Shortly thereafter, defendant moved for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.', 'D', 'The Motion for a New Trial', 'On July 5, 2012, the trial justice conducted a hearing on defendant’s motion for a new trial. In his written submission, defendant contended that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict and that the trial justice had committed an error of law in denying defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29.10 At the hearing, defendant developed those arguments more fully; he contended that, under both Rhode Island and United States Supreme Court precedent, defendant’s speech simply did not constitute fighting words.

Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 569 (R.I. 2009), we note that our decision in the instant case, discussed infra, ultimately forecloses any question regarding sufficiency of the evidence. We make this determination in light of the following: (1) defendant utilized the “weight of the evidence” standard of review in his brief, thereby waiving any argument on appeal regarding the sufficiency of the evidence standard in the context of a motion for a new trial; and (2) to the extent any sufficiency challenge was raised, our conclusions with respect to defendant’s motion for a new trial and motion for a judgment of acquittal yield the same result when applied to a motion for a new trial based upon the sufficiency of the evidence.

In opposition to defendant’s motion, the state characterized defendant’s contentions in his motion for a new trial as “factual argument[s],” and the state added that the jury had already heard “more than sufficient evidence” to convict defendant.', 'After hearing from both parties, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. He began by focusing on the charge itself, carefully reviewing in detail the elements contained in the “fighting words” statute, § 11-45-1(a)(3). The trial justice next reviewed the facts as they unfolded at trial, and he then identified the issue before him as “whether the speech, as testified to credibly by the troopers, rose to the level of [the] criminal offense with which [defendant] was charged.” He concluded that the words were fighting words, that they “certainly rose above idle threats and thoughtless, toothless warnings,” and that “the credible evidence constituted proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each of the elements of the offense of disorderly conduct * * *.” The defendant timely appealed.', 'II', 'Analysis', 'We have often noted that “a defendant has a higher hurdle to overcome when arguing a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal than when he seeks to prevail on a Rule 33 motion for [a] new trial * * *.” State v.

We have stated that, when a trial justice reviews an acquittal motion, he or she “must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, * * * giving full credibility', '- 12 - to the state’s witnesses, and draw[ing] therefrom all reasonable inferences consistent with guilt.” Fleck, 81 A.3d at 1133 (internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast, we have indicated that, in “the case of a motion for [a] new trial, * * * the trial justice does not favor the state’s evidence, but use[s] independent judgment to weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, “the burden is less onerous under the standard applicable to a motion for [a] new trial because the trial justice is permitted to weigh conflicting evidence.” State v. Richardson, 47 A.3d 305, 317 (R.I. 2012). It should also be recalled that “[t]he motion for a new trial requires a more exacting analysis[;] * * * therefore, unless a defendant can show that the presented evidence failed to support his or her conviction upon the motion-for-a-new-trial standard, a defendant necessarily will be unable to establish he or she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.” Id.

Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial. The defendant contends that his utterances early in the morning of January 31, 2012 did not rise to the level of “fighting words,” but rather constituted protected speech under the First Amendment.', 'In responding to that contention, the state argues that defendant’s speech is distinguishable from the speech that our cases have held to be constitutionally protected and that, in the context in which they were uttered in this case, defendant’s words did in fact constitute fighting words. We begin with a brief review of the pertinent First Amendment jurisprudence.', 'i. First Amendment Principles', 'This Court has long recognized that the “First Amendment [to the United States Constitution] applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment;” and we have further recognized that, in light of the textual protections for the freedom of speech in the First Amendment, there are limitations on what types of speech may be proscribed by the state.

Authelet, 120 R.I. at 51, 52, 57-58, 385 A.2d at 647, 650.', 'After this Court in Authelet engaged in an in-depth discussion of the evolution of the “fighting words” concept in the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, it set forth the following objective test as to whether particular speech constitutes “fighting words”:', '“The test to be applied when the prosecution relies on the fighting', 'words theory is an objective one: Are the defendant’s expressions', 'words which, when directed to the average person, would cause the', 'addressee to fight? * * * It is not necessary that the person who is', 'personally insulted react violently.

In other words, the context in which words are uttered must always be the focus of our analysis.', 'On the basis of the just-summarized principles, we held that the speech of the defendant Michael Authelet did not, as a matter of law, constitute “fighting words.” Id. at 42, 57, 385 A.2d at 642, 650.

Johnson, 122 R.I. at 363-72, 406 A.2d at 361-66. The underlying facts in Johnson related to an earlier criminal case: the five plaintiffs had been charged with violation of a local disorderly conduct ordinance as a result of their having engaged in a shouting match with police officers who had accused them of loitering outside of an establishment known as Parrot North Cafe. Id. at 363-64, 406 A.2d at 361-62. Several epithets were shouted at the officers, including “fucking asshole,” “fucking pig,” and “(d)umb son of a bitch.” Id. at 363 n. 2, 406 A.2d at 361 n. 2. In passing upon these words, we stated that fighting words “have been defined as those personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to the ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction.” Id. at 370, 406 A.2d at 365 (internal quotation marks omitted). And we specifically noted that “[s]uch words, even when addressed to a police officer, do not lose their character as fighting words, if, under the objective test that we apply, they would cause an average person to fight.” Id. at 370-71, 406 A.2d at 365 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). However, noting that it was not necessary to decide the issue, we declined to rule definitively on the question of whether or not the “verbal insults” in question, which had been shouted at the police officers in the circumstances described in Johnson, “were in fact fighting words.”12 Id. at 371, 406 A.2d at 365. 12', 'We pause to note that this Court has never adopted the principle espoused by Justice Powell in his concurring opinion in Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130, 135 (1974), in which he stated that: “[A] properly trained officer may reasonably be expected to exercise a higher degree of restraint than the average citizen, and thus be less likely to respond belligerently to fighting words.” (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Instead, it is the rule in this jurisdiction', '- 18 -', 'Finally, we turn to McKenna, in which we held that the speech of the defendant Joanne McKenna did not constitute fighting words because “on the facts presented * * * her words [did not] create[] an inherent likelihood of provoking an imminent retaliation.” McKenna, 415 A.2d at 731. The facts in that case, as they unfolded during a bench trial through the testimony of two police officers, were as follows. Id. at 730. One officer testified that the underlying events began after he responded to a radio call regarding three juveniles standing on a roof and throwing rocks down at pedestrians and cars. Id. The officer added that, while he and another officer took the juveniles into custody, the defendant, who was in a “nearby parking lot,” “became verbally abusive” to the officers, including threatening to “‘blow [their] fucking heads off.’” Id. The same officer stated that the defendant also “disobeyed another officer’s order to be quiet and to leave the area” and, instead, “continued to berate all of the policemen.” Id. The officer added that the defendant “did not direct her statement to him personally,” but rather to the officers “as a group.” Id. Finally, he testified that, during the incident, the defendant “moved toward the group of officers.” Id. A second officer testified that, “at the time [the] defendant uttered the threat[,] she was standing in the road some fifteen feet from him;” in addition, he stated that she “called the group of police ‘cocksuckers.’” Id.', 'After the officers testified at the jury-waived trial, the trial justice found the defendant guilty of violating the pertinent disorderly conduct ordinance and sentenced her to pay a $10 fine. McKenna, 415 A.2d at 730. On appeal, the defendant argued that the ordinance, as applied to her conduct, was unconstitutional; in her view, “the First Amendment for[bade] the state from punishing her for speaking the words” because the words were not otherwise proscribed as an that abusive words, “even when addressed to a police officer, do not lose their character as fighting words, if, under the objective test that we apply, they would cause an average person to fight.” Johnson, 122 R.I. at 370-71, 406 A.2d at 365 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '- 19 - exception to First Amendment protection—i.e., the words were not “fighting words.”', 'Id.

Id.13', 'Although the state’s concession rendered unnecessary a ruling on the question of whether the defendant’s utterances constituted fighting words, this Court clearly deemed it worthwhile to explicate in some detail the “fighting words” concept; we ultimately concluded that “[i]n light of the attendant circumstances,” the defendant’s speech had not constituted “fighting words.” Id. at 731. We considered the following factors in reaching our conclusion in that regard: (1) the fact that the defendant addressed her remarks to a group of five persons and that “[s]he spoke to [the officers] as a group, not individually nor face-to-face;” (2) the fact that “[s]he was standing some fifteen feet away when she delivered her insults;” and (3) the fact that “the remarks apparently did not concern the officers individually.”14 Id. Accordingly, we reversed the conviction of the defendant McKenna for disorderly conduct, holding that her speech did not constitute fighting words, nor did it constitute incitement. Id. at 731, 732.', 'With the foregoing principles and cases in mind, we turn now to the specific facts upon which the instant appeal must turn. 13', 'As an alternative to its “fighting words” argument, the state contended that the defendant’s language could have fallen within what constituted another category of proscribed speech; the state argued that the defendant’s threatening language, combined with her movement towards some of the officers, evidenced an intent to incite others to violence against the police and a likelihood that her words would cause others to become violent. State v. McKenna, 415 A.2d 729, 730-31 (R.I. 1980). This Court rejected the argument that the defendant’s speech constituted incitement, noting that the defendant “did not exhort anyone else to take action against the officers.” Id. at 732. We characterized her words as an “idle threat” and “a thoughtless and toothless warning uttered in the midst of an emotional harangue.” Id. 14', 'We based our conclusion that the words uttered by the defendant McKenna “apparently did not concern the officers individually” on the fact that the reaction of the officers to those words was “merely” to tell her “to be quiet.” McKenna, 415 A.2d at 731.', '- 20 -', 'ii. Application to the Instant Case', 'We begin by scrutinizing the trial justice’s assessment of defendant’s motion for a new trial, in which he attacked the weight of the evidence presented at the trial in which he was convicted. See footnote 10, supra. It is clear to us that the trial justice conducted that assessment in strict compliance with the methodological approach that has been repeatedly endorsed by this Court. See, e.g., Hie, 93 A.3d at 974-75; see also Silva, 84 A.3d at 416-17; Robat, 49 A.3d at 71.', 'First, the trial justice “considered the evidence in light of the jury charge” by reviewing first his own instructions to the jury in detail and then summarizing the testimony given at trial. Hie, 93 A.3d at 976. In accordance with the analytical approach endorsed in Hie, the trial justice “considered the testimony of every witness who testified at trial.” Id. And, significantly, he did so in light of the jury charge on disorderly conduct, addressing specifically the elements required to show that defendant’s speech constituted unprotected fighting words. He read verbatim from defendant’s request for jury instructions and then proceeded to review the evidence in light of that charge.', 'In compliance with the second step of the analytical process, the trial justice next independently reviewed the evidence and, in the process, expressly addressed the credibility of the witnesses. See Hie, 93 A.3d at 976. The trial justice discussed the testimony of Trooper Washington and Trooper Viera, and bluntly stated: “Obviously, the jury found the officers to be credible and so do I.” He specifically characterized defendant’s utterances as having been “testified to credibly by the troopers.” The trial justice then proceeded to apply to the evidence (i.e., what the troopers had testified to) the four elements of a “fighting words” violation as set forth in the jury charge—viz., (1) that defendant acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly when he uttered the words in question; (2) that defendant directed those words at a specific', '- 21 - individual; (3) that defendant spoke the words in a public place; and (4) that defendant used words that, by their very utterance, inflicted injury or tended to incite an immediate breach of the peace. See § 11-45-1(a)(3).', 'The trial justice first found that defendant “acted intentionally, knowingly or recklessly when he said the words that the troopers testified to,” in light of the fact that defendant continued to “verbal[ly] barrage” the troopers after they asked him to calm down. Second, the trial justice found that the “credible evidence” indicated that defendant directed his speech at the two troopers. Third, he concluded that the evidence indicated that defendant had uttered the words in a public place—specifically, “the corner of Smith Street and West Main Road in Middletown * * *.”', 'Fourth, and finally, the trial justice found that the words spoken by defendant, “by their very utterance[,] inflict[ed] injury or tend[ed] to incite an immediate breach of the peace;” the trial justice stated that defendant was “[e]ssentially * * * inciting the troopers to engage in a physical [response] -- or trying to incite them to a physical response.” In sum, the trial justice reviewed the evidence and found credible testimony supporting each element of what the state had borne the burden of proof of showing—viz., that defendant had engaged in disorderly conduct by uttering words that, in the circumstances testified to at trial, fell outside the protections of the First Amendment.', 'In the third and final step of the requisite analysis, it was implicit in the trial justice’s analysis that he agreed with the jury’s verdict. Under our precedent, the trial justice’s agreement with the jury in the instant case rendered his analysis complete. See Hie, 93 A.3d at 977 (“[I]t is clear that, after properly assessing the evidence and weighing the credibility of the witnesses, the trial justice concluded that he could not disagree with the [jury’s] verdict. As such, his analysis', '- 22 - [was] complete, and he denied defendant’s motion for a new trial.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'While our meticulous review of the reasoning of the trial justice on each of the pertinent analytical steps has persuaded us to affirm the trial justice’s denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial, we pause to briefly address defendant’s contention that his conviction should be reversed on the basis of the reasoning contained in McKenna—i.e., that, in contrast to the trial justice’s conclusion, defendant’s speech was protected and did not constitute fighting words because it did not “inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.” Chaplinsky, 315 U.S. at 572. More specifically, defendant contends that his threats were no more abusive than the language employed by the defendant in McKenna, who threatened to blow the heads off nearby police officers.', 'We reject defendant’s contention. It is important to bear in mind the principle to which we have already alluded to the effect that there are no per se fighting words. See Authelet, 120 R.I. at 55, 385 A.2d at 649 (“Fighting words are recognized as having some social value and are not to be punished on a ‘per se’ basis but only when their use results in the likelihood of an imminent disturbance.”) (emphasis added). Accordingly, the linguistic similarity between the words uttered by the defendant in McKenna and by defendant in this case does not dispose of the question of whether this defendant’s speech constituted fighting words. Instead, we must look to the context15 of defendant’s speech, as we did in McKenna, assessing the “attendant 15', 'Indeed, it is a virtual truism that all language is understandable only in context. See, e.g., Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129, 132 (1993) (referring to a “fundamental principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but must be drawn from the context in which it is used”); Leach v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 860 F.2d 1266, 1270 (5th Cir. 1988) (“It is only * * * within a context that a word, any word, can communicate an idea.”); cf. State v. Sivo, 809 A.2d 481, 488', '- 23 - circumstances” to determine whether defendant’s utterances fell outside the protection afforded by the First Amendment. McKenna, 415 A.2d at 731.', 'Initially, we note that, in the present case, the state made no concessions regarding the language used by defendant, and instead maintained from the outset that his speech constituted fighting words.', 'By contrast, in McKenna, 415 A.2d at 730, the state conceded that the defendant’s speech did not violate the ordinance—that is, the state acknowledged that the defendant’s speech did not constitute fighting words. As a result, this Court’s subsequent discussion of whether the defendant’s speech in McKenna constituted fighting words was not required for the purpose of resolving the case before it.', 'Next, and more critical to our present analysis, McKenna is distinguishable from the instant case in view of the precise factors which this Court found relevant to its “fighting words” analysis in that earlier case. First, in the present case, defendant addressed his remarks to two officers, rather than to a group of five persons. McKenna, 415 A.2d at 731. This Court in McKenna went out of its way to state that the defendant in that case “spoke to [the police officers] as a group, not individually nor face-to-face.” Id. By contrast, in this case, the trial justice specifically found that defendant directed his words at Trooper Washington and Trooper Viera, stating that “[t]he credible evidence was that [Mr. Matthews] directed those words at the two troopers, not a group of individuals.” In addition, both troopers testified repeatedly that defendant had spoken directly to them.', 'Second, Mr. Matthews was in closer proximity to the troopers than the defendant was to the officers in McKenna. Specifically, in McKenna, 415 A.2d at 731, the defendant was “some fifteen feet away” from the officers at all relevant times, and that distance was one of the factors (R.I. 2002) (stating that this Court reviews the challenged portion of a jury charge “in the context in which it was delivered”).', '- 24 - cited by this Court as relevant to its determination that the defendant’s speech did not constitute fighting words. By contrast, in the instant case, defendant was in the troopers’ immediate physical proximity while in an arm bar over the hood of a cruiser.', 'Third, there was testimony in this case that the words spoken by defendant did concern and alarm the officers individually.16 Trooper Viera testified that he felt both threatened and provoked by Mr. Matthews’s speech, and Trooper Washington testified that he took Mr. Matthews’s speech “as a threat.” Again, this evidence stands in stark contrast to the facts in McKenna, in which the defendant’s remarks “apparently did not concern the officers individually,” and this Court expressly opined that the officers “were more annoyed with [the defendant] than moved to violent retaliation.” McKenna, 415 A.2d at 731.', 'Although our application to this case of the just-referenced considerations that were discussed by this Court in McKenna is important to our determination that the instant defendant’s speech constituted fighting words, we believe that a fourth consideration even more convincingly militates in favor of holding that defendant’s speech fell outside the realm of protected First Amendment speech. In McKenna, 415 A.2d at 730, the defendant was quite clearly a bystander; she stood yards away from the police officers as they attempted to arrest several juveniles for what appeared to be delinquent activity. The defendant in McKenna 16', 'While the test to be applied to defendant’s utterances in this case is an objective one, see Authelet, 120 R.I. at 57, 385 A.2d at 649, we note that we are not thereby barred from considering the reactions of Troopers Washington and Viera as evidence of the reaction of an average person to the utterances made by defendant. See Grayhurst, 852 A.2d at 514-15 n. 11 (contrasting the defendant’s actions with those of the defendant in McKenna, and noting the addressee’s lack of alarm in the former case as evidence that the McKenna defendant’s utterances did not constitute “fighting words”); see also State v. Allcock, 857 A.2d 287, 289 (Vt. 2004) (discussing the defendant’s utterances and noting that “[t]here was also evidence that [the] defendant’s behavior alarmed other patrons * * * to the point where they felt compelled to leave. The evidence was thus sufficient to support a finding that an average person, in these circumstances, could have felt provoked to a violent reaction.”).', '- 25 - interrupted and irritated the officers who were attempting to do their job; and, although she shouted some threatening words at them, she was not the reason for their initial decision to come to the scene or their subsequent decision to arrest certain juveniles. Id. at 730-31.', 'We deem defendant’s role in the specific circumstances of the case before us to be an especially important factor that militates powerfully in favor of the trial justice’s conclusion that defendant’s utterances constituted unprotected fighting words. In the instant case, defendant himself was directly and personally involved in the very incident that prompted the troopers to execute a U-turn, stop their cruiser, and make inquiries of two individuals who appeared to be involved in an altercation while standing in a public place. The defendant refused to provide his identification to the troopers, and he immediately escalated what could have been a routine inquiry into a threatening situation. The defendant was not a bystander, nor was he uninvolved in the troopers’ immediate purpose in coming to the scene. In sum, Troopers Washington and Viera were present at the West Main Road location on the night in question specifically in order to assess what was transpiring between defendant and the female with whom he appeared to have been engaged in some sort of altercation. The defendant’s decision at that juncture to shout threats, abusive language, and provocative utterances—in particular, his reaction to the troopers’ request for identification by challenging the troopers to “come and get it from me”—is what distinguishes the instant case from the “attendant circumstances” in McKenna, 415 A.2d at 731.17 17', 'We would add that the situation in Authelet may be readily contrasted with what was involved in the instant case. Both troopers in this case testified that defendant’s words were directed at them, and the trial justice explicitly credited their testimony. By contrast, in Authelet, there was a complete lack of any testimony indicating to whom the alleged “fighting words” were directed. Authelet, 120 R.I. at 58, 385 A.2d at 650.

On March 3, 2015, the parties appeared for oral argument pursuant to an order directing them to show cause why the issues in this petition should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of the parties and examining the memoranda that they submitted, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the petition at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the petition for certiorari is granted and the order of the Superior Court is quashed. 1', 'The term exemplary damages is synonymous with punitive damages.

As a result, plaintiff seeks to recover compensatory damages as well as exemplary damages pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 5-37.3-9. 3', 'In furtherance of his claim for exemplary damages, plaintiff requested, via written interrogatories and requests for production of documents, that Dr. Ejnes disclose personal financial information. Doctor Ejnes objected to plaintiff’s requests, arguing that his personal finances were not relevant and that the requests were premature. Eventually, plaintiff filed a motion to compel the production. In response, Dr. Ejnes filed a motion to strike plaintiff’s claim for exemplary damages, relying upon the procedure set forth in Palmisano v. Toth, 624 A.2d 314, 320-21 (R.I. 1993). Significantly, Dr. Ejnes requested that the Superior Court schedule a Palmisano hearing to determine the viability of plaintiff’s claim for exemplary damages. 2', 'The defendant Coastal Medical, Inc. has filed a Rule 12A statement taking no position with respect to the issues raised by plaintiff, Thomas J.

At the outset of the hearing, the parties informed the hearing justice that they were in agreement that, as a result of Dr. Ejnes’s motion to strike the claim for exemplary damages, a Palmisano hearing would be required. Indeed, the parties requested that the court schedule an evidentiary hearing. Notwithstanding the parties’ request, the hearing justice declined to schedule a hearing. Instead, the hearing justice declared that “it’s usually my practice that you don’t get a [Palmisano] hearing until you prove liability * * * on the original complaint or cause of action.” Accordingly, the hearing justice granted the motion to strike and severed plaintiff’s claim for exemplary damages. In addition, the hearing justice stayed all discovery relating to plaintiff’s claim for exemplary damages until a determination on liability had been made.', 'On March 7, 2013, an order entered memorializing the hearing justice’s decision. On March 27, 2013, plaintiff filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to this Court, and we directed the parties to address whether, in this case, the order of the Superior Court should be summarily quashed as a result of the hearing justice’s failure to comply with the procedures set forth in Palmisano.

The plaintiff asks this Court to quash the order of the Superior Court and remand the case with specific instructions that such a hearing be conducted. Conversely, and in an apparent reversal of the position he maintained before the trial court, Dr. Ejnes argues that our holding in Mark v.

Doctor Ejnes maintains that the trial justice properly exercised his discretion when he deemed that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary.

Toman, 185 A.2d 241, 244 (N.J. Super. Ct. 1962)).

(citing Vollert v. Summa Corp., 389 F.Supp. 1348, 1351- 52 (D. Haw. 1975)). To resolve this conundrum, this Court set forth a procedure that would be applied before a plaintiff may delve into a defendant’s personal financial information. Id. at 320- 21. In doing so, we expressly rejected the adoption of the same bifurcated approach that was employed by the hearing justice in this case. Id. at 319.', 'We explained that “[i]f a defendant believes that a punitive-damage claim cannot be supported factually and legally, the defendant may move to strike the claim for punitive damages,” at which point a hearing justice should conduct an “evidentiary hearing” to test the propriety of a claim for punitive damages.

In Mark, 745 A.2d at 778-79, the plaintiffs filed suit to recover punitive damages in connection with a claim of breach of contract. Despite the fact that the plaintiffs did not seek discovery with respect to the defendant’s finances, a motion to strike the claim for punitive damages was filed by the defendant. Id. at 779. The hearing justice denied the motion to strike after determining that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary because the plaintiff had never sought discovery about the defendant’s finances. Id.', 'On review, this Court explained that it “never intended the remedy enunciated in Palmisano to become a hurdle that must be overcome by every plaintiff who asserts a claim for punitive damages.” Mark, 745 A.2d at 781.

In our opinion, the hearing justice erred in so ruling and in his ultimate determination that plaintiffs’ appeal, consequently, could not proceed under § 9-21-6.', 'Even accepting without quibble the findings of fact and the credibility assessments of the hearing justice, it is troubling that the letter from the Probate Court setting forth the cost of copying the certified record was not sent to counsel for plaintiffs until after the due date for submitting the Probate Court record to the Superior Court (January 12, 2011) had come and gone. That uncontested fact is significantly troubling when one remembers that the cost of copying the certified record had been properly and timely requested by plaintiffs’ counsel in writing. On December 30, 2010, counsel for plaintiffs sent a letter to Ms. Judy Wild, the Administrator of the Probate Court. It is entirely clear from the face of the letter that what was explicitly requested was “a certified record of the proceedings appealed from.” The letter from plaintiffs’ counsel went on to state: “Please advise what the cost of these certified documents is and a check will be forwarded to your office.” The cost for the “certified documents,” which included the certified record, was not sent to plaintiffs’ counsel until January 13, 2011—two weeks after the written request of December 30, 2010. Ms. Wild’s testimony reflects that it was her understanding that the usual practice was that, after an initial request for records was made, a requesting party would have to engage in “recontact with someone” in her office in order to', '- 13 - ultimately communicate to Ms. Wild that “the parties ha[d] agreed to specific parts of the case or [that] they want[ed] the whole file.”13 However, such “recontact” was certainly not necessary in this case since the December 30 letter had, without any sort of qualifying language, requested the entire “certified record of the proceedings appealed from.”', 'It is jurisprudentially important to bear in mind the maxim that “[r]ules of law are rarely as clean and strict as statements of them make them seem.” AM International, Inc. v.

Based on this Court’s clear precedent and the facts of the instant case, it is our judgment that allowing plaintiffs to have a hearing on the merits in Superior Court constitutes a genuinely equitable result. The delay in submitting the certified record was out of the control of plaintiffs and their counsel; it took the Probate Court Clerk’s Office two weeks to respond to a letter specifically requesting both a copy of the entire certified record and a statement as to the costs of the record—which two week lag must be viewed in light of the testimony by Ms. Wild that a record of about the length of the one in the instant case could be copied in a day. Moreover, it is clear from the record that plaintiffs’ counsel would not have been permitted to make the copies of the record himself. See Boranian, 983 A.2d at 839 (stating that one of the factors to be considered when addressing excusable neglect is whether the delay was “within the reasonable control” of the moving party). The plaintiffs’ counsel made a clear and explicit request for a copy of the record; no reasonable person need have done more, 13', 'It is noteworthy that the usual practice about which Ms. Wild testified is not mandated by any statute, ordinance, or regulation.', '- 14 - regardless of what, according to her testimony, Ms. Wild considered to be the usual practice. See id.', 'We add that our conviction that equity militates in plaintiffs’ favor is reinforced by the fact that the circumstances of this case parallel those in other cases where this Court has held that there was excusable neglect; in the instant case, as in those other cases, it was not the fault of plaintiffs or their counsel that caused their non-adherence to the January 12, 2011 filing deadline. See, e.g., Pleasant Management, LLC, 960 A.2d at 225 (holding that there was excusable neglect when an attorney contacted an opposing party—one of the defendants in the case—rather than that party’s attorney, and told that defendant to “forget about court,” ultimately causing a default decree to be entered against the defendants when they failed to appear at a hearing); Gardner v. Baird, 871 A.2d 949, 952-53 (R.I. 2005) (holding that the plaintiffs’ failure to pay appellate court fees, which failure was recognized and corrected before the hearing date, constituted excusable neglect); State v. Dominguez, 679 A.2d 873, 874-75 (R.I. 1996) (holding that there was excusable neglect when a defendant missed a filing deadline because an attorney had not been appointed for him until after the deadline).', 'We further note that this Court’s cases in which we held that there was no excusable neglect dealt with situations more within the parties’ control than is true with respect to the present appeal, such as instances where a pro se litigant lacked knowledge of a filing deadline or where an attorney had a busy schedule. See Jacksonbay Builders, Inc. v. Azarmi, 869 A.2d 580, 584 (R.I. 2005) (holding that a pro se litigant’s lack of knowledge of a deadline did not constitute excusable neglect); Astors’ Beechwood, 659 A.2d at 1115 (holding that an attorney’s busy schedule did not warrant a finding of excusable neglect); see also UAG West Bay AM, LLC v.

Porter, 744 A.2d 405, 406 (R.I. 1999) (mem.) (holding that an attorney’s failure to file a rejection of an arbitration award because he was waiting for a copy of the award to arrive in the mail was not excusable neglect).', 'As such, our respect for precedent and consistency causes us to conclude that, based on the failure of the Probate Court Clerk’s Office to respond to the December 30 letter in a timely manner, the circumstances of this case constitute a “failure to take the proper steps at the proper time, not in consequence of the party’s own carelessness, inattention, or willful disregard of the process of the court, but in consequence of some unexpected or unavoidable hindrance * * * .” Boranian, 983 A.2d at 838. Accordingly, we hold that the plaintiffs’ failure to have satisfied the requirements of § 33-23-1(a) constituted excusable neglect and that, therefore, justice requires that the plaintiffs’ appeal be allowed to proceed under § 9-21-6; the plaintiffs should have their day in Court. In our judgment, allowing the instant appeal to proceed on its merits would be entirely consistent with the spirit which animates the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. We point especially to Rule 1 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, which states that the rules “shall be construed and administered to secure the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.” See Sarni v. Meloccaro, 113 R.I. 630, 636, 324 A.2d 648, 652 (1974).

Although I agree with the majority’s analysis and holding regarding G.L. 1956 § 33-23-1, I disagree with that portion of its opinion pertaining to G.L. 1956 § 9-21-6. I do so for three reasons. First, I believe that the majority abandoned our precedent of deferring to the hearing justice’s fact-finding determinations. Second, under the majority’s opinion, the standard of excusable neglect will be greatly relaxed. And third, I believe that the majority incorrectly shifted the burden of proof under § 9-21-6.', 'Deference to the Hearing Justice', 'The plaintiffs have continually alleged that the backlog in the probate clerk’s office was the reason for any delays in compliance with the statutory deadlines under § 33-23-1. We twice remanded this case to the Superior Court for the specific purposes of, first, an evidentiary hearing and, second, fact-finding and credibility assessments as to the veracity of plaintiffs’ allegations. Ultimately, the hearing justice found that plaintiffs could have received a certified copy of the requested record had they simply been more diligent.', 'The majority acknowledges, that when this Court reviews “a ruling made by a hearing justice with respect to a motion in a civil case, this Court will ‘accord deferential consideration to the findings made by the hearing justice, and in the absence of our being able to determine that', '- 17 - he [or she] was clearly wrong, or had misconceived or overlooked material evidence, we will not disturb his [or her] findings.’” RBS Citizens Bank, N.A. v.

Nevertheless, the majority disregards much of the hearing justice’s findings of fact while seizing on other findings that are helpful to its narrative. The majority offers no explanation for why some facts are overlooked and, more importantly, why the hearing justice’s ultimate conclusion is discredited.', 'The majority has based its decision to overturn the hearing justice largely on the fact that “the cost of copying the Probate Court record was not sent to counsel for plaintiffs until one day after the end of the [thirty-day window to appeal].” What the hearing justice concluded, and what the majority fails to explain away, is that the reason the Probate Court did not send the price quote to plaintiffs’ counsel until the thirty-first day was the inaction of plaintiffs. First, plaintiffs let seventeen of the thirty days pass before contacting the Probate Court to request a price quote for a copy of the certified record. And second, contrary to “the custom and practice of the Probate Court,” the hearing justice found that plaintiffs’ counsel failed to make any “efforts, written or oral, or visits to the probate clerk’s office as the appeal deadline approached to assure that the record would be transmitted in a timely fashion.” The plaintiffs’ inaction combined with the hearing justice’s finding that “[t]here is nothing * * * that would have prevented the Warwick Probate Court from complying with a timely request for copying the entire Scire Estate file” flies in the face of the majority’s conclusion that “[t]he delay in submitting the certified record was out of the control of the plaintiffs and their counsel.”', '- 18 -', 'By deciding to overturn the Superior Court’s decision, the majority, I believe, has abandoned our precedent of deferring to the hearing justice and made the two previous remands in this case nothing more than exercises in futility.', 'Relaxing the Excusable Neglect Standard', 'The majority points out that § 9-21-6 is a rule of equity. It is. I also recognize that this Court previously has stated that the addition of “excusable neglect” to the predecessor statute of § 9-21-6 “was intended to liberalize the remedial nature” of the statute. Steinhof v. Keefer, 101 R.I. 472, 475, 224 A.2d 897, 899 (1966). Nevertheless, we have recently reiterated that, under the statute, “[r]elief cannot be made available to one who has lost his [or her] appeal by reason of mistake of law or by an act of negligence or dereliction on his [or her] own part.” Carlson v. Bedford, 828 A.2d 516, 518 (R.I. 2003) (mem.). Generally, “[t]he rule was not intended as an alternative method of appellate review, nor as a means of circumventing time limits on appeal * * *.” Id. (quoting Steinhof, 101 R.I. at 476, 224 A.2d at 899). Indeed, the party filing a motion under § 9-21-6 “has the burden of establishing one of the acceptable grounds for delay.” Kelley v. Jepson, 811 A.2d 119, 123 (R.I. 2002). Further, “[t]he facts alleged must be sufficient to constitute one of these circumstances before the court can exercise its authority under the statute.” Carlson, 828 A.2d at 517. Such circumstances must be “compelling.” Steinhof, 101 R.I. at 477, 224 A.2d at 899.', 'The majority suggests that this dissent lacks fidelity to our precedent under § 9-21-6. However, the majority fails to acknowledge that we have never found it appropriate to grant relief on the grounds of excusable neglect under § 9-21-6. Furthermore, since the enactment of the current version of § 9-21-6, which vests discretion to grant relief in the Superior Court—as', '- 19 - opposed to this Court, which the predecessor statute to § 9-21-6 did—we have never held that the Superior Court abused its discretion in denying relief.', 'Indeed, our task on appeal is not to decide what “justice requires” de novo, but rather, as our precedent informs us, to “review the Superior Court’s excusable-neglect determination for abuse of discretion.” UAG West Bay AM, LLC v.

The majority, despite recognizing this standard, is set on coming to a “just” determination. In doing so, the majority yearns to return to the time when the predecessor statute to § 9-21-6 vested discretion to grant relief with this Court.', 'It is clear that the Superior Court justice found that plaintiffs could have been more diligent. Excusable neglect must “not [be] in consequence of the party’s own carelessness, inattention, or willful disregard of the process of the court * * *.” In re Kyla C., 79 A.3d 846, 848 (R.I. 2013) (mem.)

Gallant, 795 A.2d 531, 533 (R.I. 2002)).', 'Further, we have emphasized that “‘[e]xcusable neglect’ is a more rigorous standard than ‘good cause[.]’” Reyes v.

Accordingly, the determination that plaintiffs should have done more cuts sharply against the granting of relief on the grounds of excusable neglect.', 'Cf. Ocean Road Partners v. State, 612 A.2d 1107, 1111 (R.I. 1992) (recognizing that “granting of equitable relief is extraordinary relief and will not be applied unless the equities clearly must be balanced in favor of the party seeking that relief”). While the majority acknowledges that the existence of excusable neglect is a question of fact, it nonetheless disregards the factual determinations and credibility assessments made by the hearing justice, to which we are to afford great weight and great deference. See JPL Livery Services, Inc. v. Rhode', '- 20 - Island Department of Administration, 88 A.3d 1134, 1142 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Cullen v. Tarini, 15 A.3d 968, 976 (R.I. 2011)); Lamarque v. Centreville Savings Bank, 22 A.3d 1136, 1140 (R.I. 2011). As a result, I believe that the majority’s opinion will greatly relax the excusable neglect standard, and that this relaxation is a mistake.', 'Shifting the Burden', 'Finally, the majority has shifted the burden of demonstrating entitlement to relief under § 9-21-6 away from plaintiffs to the nonparty Probate Court. Here, the Superior Court justice not only determined that there was more that plaintiffs could have done, he also made explicit factual findings and credibility determinations that ran contrary to plaintiffs’ assertions. On remand, the Superior Court justice held an additional hearing in which testimony was elicited from the administrator for the Probate Court and city clerk. Based on that hearing, the hearing justice subsequently made factual findings and credibility determinations which clearly found that the probate administrator and city clerk were credible and trustworthy and found that nothing would have prevented the Probate Court from complying with a timely request to copy the record.', 'Given the findings of the hearing justice, plaintiffs did not prove that they did everything that they could have done to satisfy the demands of § 33-23-1. Nevertheless, the majority finds that plaintiffs met the standard for excusable neglect. This can only be because the probate clerks did not prove to the satisfaction of the majority that they actually were able to produce the record in a timely fashion. I do not believe that the court clerks carry any burden to prove that they can do their job. Rather, I believe that plaintiffs must show that the clerks were unable to meet the demands of their employment, which they did not.', 'For the reasons articulated above, I respectfully, but vigorously register my dissent.', '- 21 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Joyce Duffy et al. v.

Additionally, the section states that “[t]he giving back of retirement funds dates back only to the time the Pension Plan became effective, which was approximately 1977 or thereabouts.” The language from this section has appeared in every subsequent CBA.', 'Another document which is the cause of much contention between the parties is titled “Town of Johnston Police Department Pension Plan.” The document (1993 Plan) purports to have been executed on October 25, 1993, between Mayor aRusso and a representative from the “Town of Johnston Police Union.” The 1993 Plan was also signed by the town’s finance director, ex officio, as “Trustee.” However, the document was not signed by any individual representing ING. 6', 'A fixed account provides a fixed rate of interest to the contribution. Individual participants could opt to contribute to either a fixed account or a variable account with a non-fixed rate of interest.', '-3-', 'Among the provisions of the 1993 Plan is section 4.1, titled “Formula for Determining Employer’s Contribution,” which states, inter alia:', '“(a) * * * On behalf of each Participant for each year of his participation in', 'this Plan, the Employer shall contribute 12% of his annual Compensation.', '“(b) As a condition of Plan Participation each Participant shall agree to', 'contribute 6% of his Compensation to the Trustee. Such Contribution shall be', 'credited to his Participant’s Account and shall share in Trust earnings and losses.” Additionally, section 6.3 of the 1993 Plan, titled “Determination of Benefits in Event of Disability,” provides:', '“In the event of a Participant’s Total and Permanent Disability, the Trustee', 'shall distribute to such Participant all amounts credited to such Participant’s', 'Account.', '“Any disability benefits paid under this Plan, as a result of Employer', 'Contributions, shall reduce and off set [sic] any statutory disability benefits to', 'which the Employee might otherwise be entitled.” Of note, however, is that nowhere in the 1993 Plan is there a reference to section 457 of the Code. Also inexplicably absent is the first page of the 1993 Plan. Further, the 1993 Plan clearly states in section 9.14(a) that “[n]otwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, contributions to this Plan are conditioned upon the initial qualification of the Plan under Code Section 401.”', 'At the time the 1993 Plan was purportedly executed, there was in place between the town and IBPO a CBA that covered the period from July 1, 1993 to June 30, 1995. The subsequent CBA, which covered the period from July 1, 1995 to June 30, 1998, and was executed on behalf of the town by a mayor other than Mayor aRusso, does not reference the 1993 Plan. However, added to that CBA was a section titled “Disability Pension,” which states in pertinent part:', '“All police officers of the Johnston Police Department who are injured in the line', 'of duty and qualify for a disability pension shall receive from the Town the', 'difference between what is his or her pension payments and sixty-six and two-', 'thirds (66 2/3) percent of what his or her salary was at the time of the injury.”', '-4- The town avers that plaintiffs have received a disability pension pursuant to this section, which went substantially unchanged in subsequent CBAs that each plaintiff retired under.', 'A major point of contention in this case is the validity, or lack thereof, of the various documents and agreements discussed above. The town argues that its town charter provides that the mayor’s authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the town requires approval by the town council. However, a review of the town records by the town clerk indicates that there is no evidence that the town council ever ratified the creation of the ING Accounts, the 1993 Plan, or any of the CBAs prior to the CBA executed in 2001.', 'On December 9, 2002, per the request of the town, 7 a report (H&H Report) was issued by the actuarial consulting firm Hooker & Holcombe which reviewed the “technical, administrative and financial aspects” of the town’s police department pension plan. The H&H Report reviewed 20 CBAs between the town and IBPO covering a period from 1977 through 2004 and the 1993 Plan in its analysis. The H&H Report assumed the validity of all of the CBAs and the 1993 Plan. In the H&H Report’s summary of current plan provisions, it recognized that there were employee and employer contributions being made to the pension plan at the rate of 6 percent and 12 percent of total employee compensation, respectively. Among the comments the H&H Report made was that the:', '“Plan assets are invested in a 457 plan administered by ING. We believe these', 'are the employee and employer contributions that should have been paid to the', 'defined benefit pension plan. The 457 monies should be transferred to the defined', 'benefit plan if possible.” Article VI, Comments. The H&H Report recommended that the town, inter alia, “[s]eek agreement from the union to transfer assets from the 457 plan to the pension plan * * * [and] [d]raft a new defined benefit plan document and have it approved by the Town and the Union.”', 'Article VII, 7', 'It appears to be contested by the town whether or not the town council, as opposed to some other individual from the town, commissioned the report.', '-5- Recommendations. Further, it was recommended that this new document would “[s]upercede [sic] and replace the 1993 document[.]”', 'The next CBA (the 2005-2008 CBA) negotiated between the town and IBPO after the issuance of the H&H Report added a section titled “Pension Contributions,” which required police officers to contribute 6 percent of their gross pay. The section did not include language obligating a contribution on the part of the town, nor did it specify where the police officers’ contributions would be placed. Under that same CBA, a provision was added to the section titled “Pension Committee,” which stated:', '“In the event any pension plan document, pension trust document or any other', 'pension document conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement, the language', 'of this Agreement controls and supersedes any language which is inconsistent or', 'may be construed as inconsistent regarding the pension plan.” The town contends that the only benefits it is obligated to provide to plaintiffs are those obligations derived from the CBAs.', 'The plaintiffs are all former Johnston police officers who retired due to injury disability. DiMaio was placed on disability retirement in March of 2004, Faella in December of 2007, and Ross in October of 2008. Each retired officer has received a disability pension from the town. In addition, each officer has sought a distribution of all amounts credited to the respective ING Accounts maintained under the officer’s name.', 'The town has refused to authorize such distributions.', 'On January 6, 2010, Ross filed a complaint in the Providence County Superior Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief regarding entitlement to funds held in the ING Accounts bearing his name. On January 15, 2010, DiMaio and Faella filed a complaint in the Providence County Superior Court seeking the same declaratory and injunctive relief as well as damages for conversion and attorney’s fees. The actions were consolidated, and the parties cross-moved for', '-6- summary judgment. After a hearing and reviewing the memoranda submitted by the parties, the Superior Court filed a written decision on December 5, 2011, denying the town’s motion for summary judgment and granting plaintiffs’ cross-motions for summary judgment.', 'Final judgment was later entered, and the town timely appealed. 8', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'In passing on a motion for summary judgment, a hearing justice “must review the pleadings, affidavits, admissions, answers to interrogatories, and other appropriate evidence from a perspective most favorable to the party opposing the motion.” Estate of Giuliano v.

36,Gerald Lopes : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. In this appeal, we review the denial of an application for postconviction relief. Gerald Lopes (Lopes or applicant) entered a plea of nolo contendere in two separate cases to the charges of burglary, breaking and entering, and receiving stolen goods. Lopes then applied for postconviction relief in the Superior Court, alleging myriad grounds for relief, including ineffective assistance of counsel that resulted in an unknowing and involuntary plea. Lopes’s application for postconviction relief was denied. The applicant sought review by this Court, and this case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on February 24, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After considering the arguments advanced by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'In February 2008, Lopes was charged by grand jury indictment with one count of burglary and, by criminal information, with one count of breaking and entering, two counts of receiving stolen goods valued at over $500, and one count of receiving stolen goods valued at under $500. Based upon Lopes’s lengthy criminal record, the state filed a notice that applicant was subject to the habitual-offender statute—G.L. 1956 § 12-19-21. Additionally, in April 2008, Lopes was declared to be a violator of a previously imposed suspended sentence and probation as a result of a plea of nolo contendere entered in April 2000 for yet another breaking-and- entering offense.', 'A magistrate of the Superior Court lifted the suspension, resulting in a sentence of fifteen years and four months incarceration.', 'On November 19, 2008, the two cases were reached for trial. After a pretrial hearing, a justice of the Superior Court denied Lopes’s motions to suppress evidence seized during his arrest which led to the burglary charge. Immediately after the denial of the suppression motions, Lopes—through his trial counsel—sought to withdraw his not-guilty plea and enter a plea of nolo contendere to all charges. 1 Pursuant to the plea agreement, applicant was sentenced, inter alia, to thirty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) on the burglary charge, with twenty years to serve and ten years suspended with probation. 2 All sentences were concurrent to the sentence Lopes was serving as a violator. Significantly, as part of this disposition, the state withdrew the habitual-offender notice, thereby relieving Lopes of any potential consecutive sentence. 1', 'The attorney who represented Lopes when he entered his plea of nolo contendere, and who it is alleged ineffectively represented Lopes, will hereafter be referred to as “trial counsel.” 2', 'Lopes was also sentenced to fifteen years at the ACI on the breaking-and-entering charge; five years at the ACI on both charges of receiving stolen goods valued at over $500, these sentences suspended; and one year at the ACI on the charge of receipt of stolen goods valued at under $500, also suspended.', '-2-', 'A review of the transcript from the plea hearing reveals that, before accepting Lopes’s plea, the Superior Court justice engaged in a detailed plea colloquy. The trial justice questioned Lopes as to whether he understood the plea forms, signed the forms, and reviewed them with his trial counsel. 3 The trial justice satisfied himself that Lopes was aware of the elements of the offenses alleged in the indictment and criminal information. The Superior Court justice also reviewed the rights that Lopes was waiving by pleading to the charges, including his right to a trial, the right to call and confront witnesses, and the right of appeal. Before asking the state to recite the factual basis to each charge, the trial justice engaged Lopes in the following dialogue:', '“[Trial Justice:] Anything else[, besides your understanding of', 'what the sentences in these cases will be,] been promised to you?', '“[Lopes:] No.', '“[Trial Justice:] I know that you’re on the eve of trial but it is', 'important that I do understand that you’re not forced – no one gave', 'you an ultimatum; is that correct?', '“[Lopes:] Yes.”', 'During the state’s presentation of the factual basis for the charge of burglary, the prosecutor proffered that the burglary “specifically was constituted by this defendant breaking and entering [into] that apartment in the nighttime with the intent to commit larceny inside of that apartment; that he did, in fact, commit larceny inside that apartment[.]” Lopes admitted that all facts as presented by the state were true. Before imposing sentence, the Superior Court justice again ensured that Lopes was aware that he was giving up his rights, that Lopes was “satisfied by the representation of your attorney in this case[,]” and that there was “[n]o problem with this [representation] at all[.]” Having found that Lopes acted “knowingly, voluntarily, 3', 'During the plea colloquy, Lopes informed the trial justice that he had attained a GED degree and had no trouble reading or understanding the plea forms.', '-3- intelligently, willingly and with full awareness of the consequences[,]” the trial justice accepted the plea and imposed sentence.', 'Less than three months later, Lopes, acting pro se, filed an application for postconviction relief. Lopes alleged that his conviction should be vacated because of (1) violations of the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; (2) due process violations; (3) ineffective assistance of trial counsel; (4) prosecutorial misconduct; and (5) new evidence. On July 14, 2009, an attorney appointed as counsel for Lopes entered her appearance “for [the] limited purpose of determination of grounds for postconviction relief application.”', 'The appointed attorney then filed a report with the Superior Court on September 2, 2009, finding that “there are no valid grounds for assignment of counsel to pursue the post conviction [sic] remedy under the provision of [G.L. 1956 §] 10-9.1-5 * * *.”', 'On October 1, 2009, Lopes informed the Superior Court that he had retained private counsel, and thus, his court-appointed counsel was discharged. After a series of continuances, applicant’s counsel filed an amended application, alleging, among other things, that there was no factual basis for the burglary charge, that the plea colloquy was defective, and that applicant’s trial counsel provided ineffective assistance to Lopes.', 'A hearing on Lopes’s application for postconviction relief was undertaken in 2010. 4 The same justice who had accepted Lopes’s plea of nolo contendere presided over the 4', 'The transcript for the September 14, 2010 hearing on the merits of applicant’s postconviction- relief application appears to be a continuation of a prior hearing at which testimony had previously occurred. The trial justice indicated as much, stating that testimony had begun in July 2010. However, a review of the record on appeal failed to uncover a transcript from this referenced hearing.', '-4- postconviction-relief hearing. In addition to Lopes, his trial counsel and Lopes’s wife also testified in this preceding. 5', 'On April 26, 2011, the Superior Court justice issued a written opinion denying Lopes’s application for postconviction relief. In his decision, the trial justice found Lopes’s credibility to be “minimal.”', 'The trial justice noted that, although applicant maintained that he was ill- informed regarding what a criminal information was and what his rights were, applicant was a veteran of the criminal justice system, having over twenty-five charges on his record, many of which were resolved through pleas of guilty or nolo contendere. Overall, the trial justice found that “[h]is testimony was inconsistent, self-serving, not credible, and not helpful to the factfinder.”', 'After briefly touching upon the testimony of Lopes’s wife, the trial justice addressed the testimony of trial counsel. The trial justice observed that trial counsel did not specifically recall the particulars of this case due to the passage of time and the volume of trial counsel’s practice. However, the trial justice observed that trial counsel specifically recalled speaking to Lopes in advance of the hearings, filing numerous motions to suppress evidence and discovery requests, and filing a motion to appoint an independent prosecutor. Despite trial counsel’s inability to recall with specificity certain details, the trial justice found him to be credible.', 'Judgment entered on May 13, 2011; Lopes timely appealed to this Court.', 'Standard of Review', '“The statutory remedy of postconviction relief set forth in G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1 is ‘available to any person who has been convicted of a crime and who thereafter alleges either that the conviction violated the applicant’s constitutional rights or that the existence of newly 5', 'A private investigator retained by applicant also testified about his attempts to deliver a letter to applicant’s trial counsel.

(quoting Linde, 78 A.3d at 745-46).', 'Analysis', 'Because Lopes’s arguments regarding the voluntariness of his plea and his trial counsel’s performance are interwoven, we analyze them in tandem. See Jolly v. Wall, 59 A.3d 133, 138- 39 (R.I. 2013). In this case, Lopes “bore the burden of proving ‘that, but for his attorney’s errors, he would not have entered a [nolo contendere] plea, but rather would have proceeded to trial.’” Id. at 139 (quoting Gonder, 935 A.2d at 87).', 'In support of his contention that he would not have entered a plea of nolo contendere had he properly been advised by trial counsel, applicant asserts that he only entered into the plea because his trial counsel told him that he was facing a life sentence. 6 Additionally, applicant contends that he was prejudiced by several of trial counsel’s decisions, including trial counsel’s failure to hire an expert to examine the value of the goods he stole during the burglary and examine an alleged DNA sample; failing to secure a severance of the charges for trial; and failing to adequately communicate with applicant.', 'We discern no error by the trial justice in his finding that applicant failed to carry his burden of proof and establish his claim. Initially, we note that trial counsel filed numerous motions in this case, including a motion for a bill of particulars, a motion for exculpatory evidence, multiple motions to suppress evidence and identifications, two motions in limine, and a 6', 'The crime of burglary carries a sentence of five years to life imprisonment. See G.L. 1956 § 11-8-1.', '-7- motion for an independent prosecutor. 7 Furthermore, trial counsel testified at the postconviction- relief hearing that it was his usual practice to review the rights the client is relinquishing when entering a plea of nolo contendere and that, despite the fact that he did not specifically recall doing so with Lopes, he was sure that he would have done so in this case.', 'Moreover, we decline to disturb the trial justice’s credibility determination that Lopes’s testimony was self-serving and not credible. Lopes’s professed ignorance as to the implications of a plea of nolo contendere is belied by his lengthy criminal record and the record evidence that, on at least eight prior occasions, Lopes has entered pleas of guilty or nolo contendere in felony cases. 8 We agree with the trial justice that Lopes is practiced in the crime of burglary and well versed in the rights that are waived when one enters a plea to a felony charge.', 'It is no exaggeration to say that he is a veteran of our criminal justice system. At the postconviction- relief hearing, Lopes insisted that his lack of knowledge was because he was guilty of the other crimes but that he did not commit these offenses. 9 Yet, our review of the plea colloquy supports the trial justice’s conclusion that Lopes entered his plea both knowingly and voluntarily. Lopes confirmed that he had reviewed the agreement with his trial counsel and that he understood the agreement. The record reflects no uncertainty, apprehension, or wavering on applicant’s part 7', 'Applicant incorrectly asserts in his filing with this Court that “an issue missed by [trial] counsel was that in one of the counts improperly joined[,] the victim was [an Assistant] Attorney General * * *. [Trial c]ounsel should have moved to recuse the Attorney General’s Office or at the very least sever that count from the rest as to not prejudice the [applicant].” As noted above, trial counsel filed a motion for appointment of an independent prosecutor. 8', 'In addition to Lopes’s numerous experiences in entering pleas of guilty or nolo contendere, he also filed an extensive Bivens action in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island alleging numerous violations of Lopes’s rights under the federal and state constitutions. 9', 'With respect to the burglary charge, Lopes was caught in the act.

Thus, while Lopes “now apparently regrets his decision to plead to the charges[,] * * * we conclude that on the critical day of [November 19, 2008], he did so voluntarily.” See Jolly, 59 A.3d at 139.', 'The trial justice also conducted a thorough review of the plea agreement with the applicant as required by Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Pursuant to Rule 11, “[t]he [Superior] [C]ourt * * * shall not accept * * * a plea of nolo contendere without first addressing the defendant personally and determining that the plea is made voluntarily with understanding of the nature of the charge and the consequences of the plea.” The transcript of the plea hearing reveals that the trial justice informed Lopes that five charges were pending against him, advised him of the consequences of his pleas of nolo contendere and the manner in which the court would impose his sentence. Additionally, the state recited the facts supporting the charges against applicant, and applicant acknowledged that those facts were true. Lastly, applicant stated that he was satisfied with the representation provided to him by his trial counsel.', 'Although not a basis for the trial justice’s decision in the postconviction-relief proceeding, it should be noted that, upon Lopes’s pleading nolo contendere to the five counts against him, the trial justice imposed an additional four years and eight months beyond the time Lopes was serving as a probation violator. 10 Further, if found to be a habitual offender, Lopes would have faced an additional consecutive term of imprisonment of up to twenty-five years. See § 12-19-21(a). By entering the plea, trial counsel protected Lopes from an enhanced sentence. We are not unmindful of the benefit derived from the withdrawal of the habitual- offender notice. In the past we have observed “that when counsel has secured a shorter sentence than what the defendant could have received had he gone to trial, the defendant has an almost 10', 'The charge of burglary mandates a minimum sentence of five years imprisonment.', '-9- insurmountable burden to establish prejudice” in the context of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Neufville, 13 A.3d at 614.', 'The applicant also suggests that the recitation of the facts which the state was prepared to prove had the burglary charge gone to trial—facts he admitted were true—was faulty because the state did not specify that the larceny applicant intended to commit was a felony, which requires that the value of the stolen items exceed $500. However, as the trial justice correctly noted, it is the intent to commit a felony that is the essential element of the crime of burglary and not the value of what was seized after the crime was interrupted. See State v. Abdullah, 967 A.2d 469, 476 (R.I. 2009) (stating that the elements of burglary are “the breaking and entering the dwelling-house of another in the nighttime with the intent to commit a felony therein, whether the felony be actually committed or not” (emphasis added) (quoting State v. Contreras-Cruz, 765 A.2d 849, 852 (R.I. 2001))).', 'The trial justice examined the record and found sufficient basis to infer the intent necessary from the facts in both cases to which Lopes admitted his guilt. Because Lopes was arrested while the burglary was ongoing, this fact, coupled with evidence that he was in possession of goods valued at well over $500 in the other charges brought against him, it was reasonable to infer that, if given the opportunity, Lopes had every intention to steal goods valued at more than $500 in this case. 11 See Camacho v. State, 58 A.3d 182, 186 (R.I. 2013) (“A finding may be based on the ‘record viewed in its totality.’” quoting State v. Frazar, 822 A.2d 931, 935 (R.I. 2003)); see also State v. McLaughlin, 621 A.2d 170, 178 (R.I. 1993) (affirming a Superior Court decision when certain facts would allow a factfinder “reasonably to infer” that the defendant had entered a dwelling with the intent to commit a larceny). Additionally, Lopes 11', 'When arrested, Lopes was found with gold jewelry stolen from the occupant of the dwelling.', '- 10 - himself confirmed that he intended to commit larceny inside the dwelling based upon the facts as presented by the state. Accordingly, the trial justice’s conclusion that Lopes understood that the state was alleging that he intended to commit a felony larceny, as opposed to a misdemeanor larceny, was correct in the circumstances of this case.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which we remand the record in this case.', '- 11 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Gerald Lopes v.

This opinion addresses three appeals that have arisen from a labyrinth of litigation brought by the plaintiffs, David F. Miller and Miller’s Auto Body, Inc. (MAB), against the defendants, Amica Mutual Insurance Company, Amica Property and Casualty Insurance Company (collectively Amica), Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company (Metropolitan), and Allstate Insurance Company, Inc. (Allstate). 1 All three appeals were argued before the Supreme Court on December 3, 2014.', 'After hearing the arguments and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that a release that Miller executed before he initiated suit bars all his claims against the defendants. As a 1', 'The three appeals concern only one plaintiff, Miller, in his personal capacity, and two defendants, Amica and Metropolitan. Miller’s Auto Body, Inc. was dismissed as a plaintiff by order dated April 27, 2010. Allstate Insurance Company was granted summary judgment on all of plaintiff’s claims, in orders effective April 27, 2010, and September 7, 2010. Although plaintiff included Allstate in his notices of appeal, no argument has been made specific to Allstate, and Allstate never filed a brief with this Court.', '-1- result, and for the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part, and reverse in part, the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Travel', 'The plaintiffs, Miller and MAB, alleged in their complaint that they were subjected to an improper, nefarious, and malicious investigation into suspected insurance fraud that the defendants believed was taking place at plaintiffs’ Cumberland auto-body shop. Miller alleged that he was suspected of perpetrating insurance fraud by using “improper estimate and repair methods,” eventually precipitating an investigation by the Rhode Island State Police (State Police). On January 16, 2002, Miller was arrested at his place of business; he was subsequently charged in Sixth Division District Court with four counts of insurance fraud, two counts of obtaining money under false pretenses, and two counts of attempting to obtain money under false pretenses. After the District Court complaint was dismissed for lack of a prosecution, the Rhode Island Attorney General (Attorney General) renewed the charges by means of a criminal information in Providence County Superior Court. Eventually, the criminal information was dismissed by the Attorney General pursuant to Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 2 However, the dismissal, dated March 28, 2005, was not without cost; it was accompanied by, and conditioned on, an agreement between Miller and the Attorney General. The agreement required that Miller relinquish or transfer his auto-body license, pay restitution to the insurance carriers, and execute a general liability release in favor of the Attorney General, the State Police, and, particular to our analysis, Amica, Metropolitan, and 2', 'Rule 48(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure states, “[t]he attorney for the State may file a dismissal of an indictment, information, or complaint and the prosecution shall thereupon terminate. Such a dismissal may not be filed during the trial without the consent of the defendant.”', '-2- Allstate. By its terms, the document specified that Miller released those parties “from any and all manner of actions, causes of action, debts, dues, claims and demands, both in law and equity arising from the facts alleged in [the Attorney General’s prosecution of Miller] which said David F. Miller ever had, now has, or in the future may have.” 3 Fifteen months after the execution of the release, plaintiffs filed a complaint against those same three insurance companies in Superior Court.', 'The plaintiffs’ complaint alleged eight counts: tortious interference with contractual relations (count 1); tortious interference with prospective contractual relations (count 2); malicious prosecution (count 3); abuse of process (count 4); 4 continued tortious interference with contractual relations (count 5); continued tortious interference with prospective contractual 3', 'The release provided in full:', '“KNOW ALL MEN, THAT I, DAVID F.

The two carriers also provided ersatz, or pretext, policies of insurance for those vehicles.', 'Miller was certainly no newcomer to the auto-body business; his affidavit provided that he had spent over twenty-five years performing auto-body maintenance and repairs, during which time he was an officer in the Auto Body Association of Rhode Island and had served as chairman of the Rhode Island Auto Body Licensing Board. Miller also swore by affidavit that he owned and operated MAB, a Rhode Island corporation with its principal place of business in Cumberland, and was its sole shareholder.', 'It is undisputed that, while the State Police investigation was ongoing, MAB was operating even though its charter had been revoked by the 5', 'The seventh count in plaintiffs’ second amended complaint, alleging violations of the Rhode Island Deceptive Trade Practices Act, G.L. 1956 § 6-13.1-2, was mistakenly labeled as a second “Count VI,” and the subsequent eighth count for punitive damages was labeled incorrectly as “Count VII.” For convenience’s sake, the counts will be referred to by name.', '-4- Secretary of State. 6 Miller later testified at trial that he was not aware that the charter had lapsed, and when he became aware of the problem, he was unable to renew the charter because the corporation was in arrears for taxes to the state. As of the time of trial in 2012, the charter of MAB had in fact never been renewed. It is also undisputed that Miller continued to operate the business in the same manner as he had prior to the charter revocation. In particular, Miller swore that he “continued to operate the business, repair vehicles, contract with customers * * * and conduct all other operations that [he] had done prior to the issuance of the revocation.”', 'On January 16, 2002, after the State Police had completed its investigation, Miller was arrested and charged. Ultimately, in March 2005, the Attorney General filed a Rule 48(a) dismissal of the criminal charges against Miller, stating in its filing that its decision was “due to evidentiary and proof issues.” As previously noted, the Attorney General’s dismissal of the pending criminal charges was not without qualification; it was contingent upon Miller’s compliance with the three conditions mentioned above. Those conditions were: (1) Miller’s payment of restitution to the insurance companies; 7 (2) Miller’s agreement to relinquish or transfer the Department of Business Regulation (DBR) auto-body license; 8 and (3) Miller’s execution of a general liability release. Miller agreed to those three conditions while he was represented by experienced and well-respected counsel—who, according to legal bills produced at trial, in fact drafted the release—and Miller complied with each condition. However, Miller 6', 'MAB’s corporate charter was revoked on September 20, 1999, for a failure to file the annual report required of all corporations under Rhode Island law. 7', 'The attorney who was Miller’s counsel at that time, swore in an affidavit that he understood that the restitution required was a payment of approximately $2,000 each to Amica and Metropolitan. The amount was intended to reimburse the insurers for costs incurred during the police investigation. 8', 'The DBR permitted Miller to transfer the auto-body repair license to his son’s auto-body shop, D. Miller’s Auto Body, Inc., which was separately incorporated.', '-5- alleged in his complaint that he was coerced into agreeing to the dismissal and signing the release, later testifying that he “felt that [he] had no choice.”', 'There can be no doubt that Miller had been through a wearying process. By the time the criminal charges were dismissed in 2005, he had been the subject of the state’s prosecution efforts for over three years. In July 2006, Miller instituted this suit to recover damages for what he characterized as the victimization that he had encountered throughout the police investigation and the ensuing criminal prosecution. In his complaint, Miller said he believed that the entire investigation was a “crusade” motivated by the carriers’ personal animus towards him, an animus fueled by his tireless and effective advocacy for legislative enactments that affected insurance companies’ operations and profits. This, he claimed, had placed a target on his back. Miller further alleged that his arrest was “[b]ased upon the false information, false allegations and deceitful conduct and practices of Defendants.” During the pendency of his criminal charges, Miller alleged that he had “suffer[ed] catastrophic financial losses” and had endured “severe financial and emotional distress.” Miller contended that defendants’ acts and the Attorney General’s dismissal conditions that required him to surrender the license of MAB were simply an “attempt to put [him] out of business.”', 'Pretrial Proceedings', 'In March 2010, Amica, Metropolitan, and Allstate moved for partial summary judgment, under the provisions of Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The defendants’ motions asked for judgment on all counts of the complaint brought on behalf of MAB, and on two of Miller’s individual claims, those for abuse of process and deceptive trade practices. 9 9', 'Rule 56(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, “[a] party against whom a claim, counterclaim, or cross-claim is asserted or a declaratory judgment is sought may, at any', '-6- Because the hearing justice determined that MAB was operating without a valid charter, he ruled that MAB had no corporate capacity to maintain the suit. The hearing justice therefore granted summary judgment for the three defendants on all of MAB’s claims, leaving Miller, personally, as the sole plaintiff. 10 The hearing justice then granted summary judgment for all defendants on Miller’s deceptive trade practices count. Lastly, on the abuse-of-process claim, only Allstate’s motion for summary judgment was granted; the hearing justice denied identical motions filed by Metropolitan and Amica.', 'Several months later, defendants again moved for partial summary judgment, this time on all counts that alleged tortious interference with contractual relationships (counts 1, 2, 5, and 6) and the malicious prosecution claim (count 3). These motions were heard on July 20, 2010, before a second justice. Of note, at this hearing, counsel for one defendant, Amica, reiterated “[i]t is [our] position * * * that the release is valid and binding.” On September 7, 2010, in a written decision, the hearing justice granted the motions, but on other grounds. This quieted all claims against Allstate, leaving only Miller’s individual claim for abuse of process against Amica and Metropolitan. In dismissing the claim for malicious prosecution, the hearing justice reasoned that, because the criminal charges against Miller were dismissed by means of a compromise, Miller would be unable to establish one of the elements of that tort—a favorable termination of the prosecution for the accused. With regard to the claims of tortious interference, the hearing justice determined that, because MAB was a defunct corporation, any contracts it time, move with or without supporting affidavits for summary judgment in the party’s favor as to all or any part thereof.” 10', 'The summary judgment entered against MAB was not appealed.', '-7- entered into not related to the corporate “winding up” process were invalid and Miller could not personally enforce them in a suit for tortious interference. 11', 'Miller did not accept defeat easily; in November 2011, he requested that the hearing justice reconsider his earlier summary judgment rulings in favor of defendants in light of “newly discovered evidence.” 12 The purportedly new evidence pertained exclusively to the claims of tortious interference; it included deposition testimony from Louis DeQuattro, Executive Counsel at the DBR, regarding the status of MAB’s auto-body repair license after its corporate charter was revoked. In addition, Miller provided a DBR-issued document, designated as an “Order to Show Cause,” which had been sent to MAB in January 2002. Miller alleged that this document established that the DBR was aware of the revocation of MAB’s corporate charter. Miller also produced a document printed from the website of the Office of the Secretary of State, dated January 30, 2002, which indicated that the mailed notice of MAB’s corporate charter revocation had been returned undeliverable. Finally, Miller relied on a renewed auto-body repair license issued to MAB in 2004, after its charter had been revoked. The hearing justice agreed to re- 11', 'The hearing justice cited G.L. 1956 § 7-1.2-1325, which states, in pertinent part, “any corporation whose articles of incorporation are revoked by the secretary of state * * * continues for five (5) years after the date of the * * * revocation for the purpose of enabling it to settle and close its affairs * * * but not for the purpose of continuing the business for which it was organized.” 12', 'The Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure do not provide for a motion to reconsider. However, because parties routinely file them, the trial courts often treat these motions as motions to vacate under Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.

Notwithstanding the expanded record, the hearing justice affirmed his grant of summary judgment and denied Miller’s motion to reconsider.', 'The Trial', 'In May 2012, a jury trial commenced in the Superior Court on the sole remaining count, Miller’s claim of abuse of process against Amica and Metropolitan.', 'The plaintiff’s case stretched over several days and included testimony from plaintiff, State Police detectives, an attorney involved in Miller’s criminal defense, and former adjusters with the insurance companies. In the course of the trial, the Rule 48(a) dismissal agreement and the release that Miller had signed were admitted as full exhibits. At the close of plaintiff’s case, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law in accordance with Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. 13 The trial justice denied the motion and the trial continued. The defendants briefly called one witness, a representative from the DBR, rested, and again moved for judgment as a matter of law. Again, the trial justice denied the motions.', 'Before being excused to deliberate, the jury was instructed on the law that it needed to consider to decide the abuse-of-process claim and to determine whether to apply the general release. On the matter of the release, the jurors were instructed that defendants had the burden to show that the release signed by Miller was valid. The instruction noted that “releases may be void if the execution of the release was affected by duress.” The trial justice offered a definition of duress, saying, “[y]ou may consider duress to be a threat of an action that incites fear, some grievous wrong, including such a thing as an unlawful imprisonment.” 13', 'Rule 50(a)(1) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part, “[i]f during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party * * * .”', '-9-', 'Several days later, the jury returned verdicts in favor of plaintiff against both defendants, specifically noting that it had found that defendants had not met their burden to show that plaintiff “released [the defendants] from liability for any cause of action arising out of the criminal prosecution of the Plaintiff.”', 'On May 31, 2012, judgments were entered against Metropolitan in the amount of $1,758,950.65 and against Amica in the amount of $1,508,950.65, both figures including prejudgment interest.', 'After the return of the verdicts, defendants renewed their motions for judgment as a matter of law and, in the alternative, moved for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. 14 On August 20, 2012, after hearing the parties on the motions, the trial justice entered orders that denied Metropolitan’s motions, but granted those of Amica. The trial justice reasoned that there was insufficient evidence that Amica had instituted process against Miller. Miller filed a timely notice of appeal of this order and all prior judgments granted in favor of Amica. 15 On August 31, 2012, Metropolitan appealed from the order of the Superior Court, which denied its motions for judgment as a matter of law and for a new trial. 16 In response, Miller filed a second notice of appeal, seeking review of the pretrial summary- judgment grants for Metropolitan. 17 14', 'Rule 59(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part that, “[a] new trial may be granted to all or any of the parties and on all or part of the issues for error of law occurring at the trial or for any of the reasons for which new trials have heretofore been granted in the courts of this state.” 15', 'This appeal is docket No. 2013-60-A and it includes the post-trial Rule 50 judgment and the summary judgments granted in favor of Amica. 16', 'Metropolitan’s appeal is docket No. 2013-61-A.

Summary judgment is appropriate when the hearing justice, after considering the “pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,” finds “no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as [a] matter of law.” Emond, 105 A.3d at 89 (quoting Sola v.

The plaintiff argued his various positions vigorously and adroitly in his multiple briefs; however, we conclude that we need not decide the many allegations of error that are claimed in order to resolve this appeal. This is so because it is our opinion that, as a matter of law, even with the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to him, plaintiff was unable to present sufficient evidence that the release that he executed in favor of defendants was signed under duress, which is necessary to defeat an instrument that otherwise meets our criteria for validity. 18 Accordingly, albeit on different grounds than those relied upon by the trial justice, we affirm the pretrial grants of summary judgment for defendants, affirm the Rule 50 judgment for Amica, and reverse the denial of Metropolitan’s Rule 50 motion, thereby granting Metropolitan a judgment as a matter of law. We do so because the release plaintiff signed specifically barred any claims that might arise out of the criminal investigation of plaintiff.', 'A. The Release Meets the Requirements for Enforcement', 'We agree with defendants that the general liability release that plaintiff executed at the conclusion of the criminal proceedings was an appropriate basis for granting judgment for them on all plaintiff’s claims. From the start, the release was a part of the litigation and defendants’ 18', 'Although we do not address the issues plaintiff raised with respect to the trial justice’s rulings on the Rule 50 motions, we pause to express our belief that his rulings have been, to some degree, unfairly characterized. It is apparent that the trial justice, on one occasion, articulated the standard for a Rule 50 motion incorrectly, but within the same page of the transcript, and at various other points, he set forth the correct standard. Thus, it appears to us that this was a mere misstatement or slip of the tongue in the course of disposing of a long and complex case. It is also true that when the trial justice orally reviewed the evidence, he suggested the weight he would give to certain pieces of evidence. Weighing the evidence is not an appropriate analysis when deciding a Rule 50 motion. However, we note that the trial justice was at the same time considering a motion for a new trial under Rule 59, and in this regard weighing the evidence is appropriate. We believe that the trial justice may have simply been commenting on the weight of certain evidence as it would have pertained to his Rule 59 decision, and he could have properly made his Rule 50 determination without incorporating his appraisal of the evidence.', '- 12 - arguments. Miller attached a copy of the Rule 48(a) dismissal agreement, which noted his “[e]xecution of a general liability release,” to his original and subsequent amended complaints. The defendants attached a copy of the release itself and raised it as an affirmative defense in their answers.', 'At trial, the release and the Rule 48(a) dismissal agreement were admitted into evidence as full exhibits, and plaintiff acknowledged the release’s authenticity and that his signature was affixed to the document. Because the release was all-encompassing, all claims that Miller had, both personally and as the self-described “sole shareholder” of MAB, should have been disposed of in favor of defendants.', 'The law concerning releases has been addressed by this Court: “[t]he validity of a release must be determined in light of three factors: (1) the existence of consideration for the release, (2) the experience of the person executing the release, and (3) the question of whether the person executing the release was represented by counsel.” Guglielmi v.

See G.L. 1956 § 11-41-5 (penalties for larceny, under which the insurance fraud charges against Miller fall).', 'Consideration is simply, “[s]omething (such as an act, a forbearance, or a return promise) bargained for and received by a promisor from a promisee; that which motivates a person to do something.” Black’s Law Dictionary 370 (10th ed. 2014). The release that Miller signed provided specifically that he “ma[de] this settlement in an attempt to avoid litigation.” It is clear to us that Miller received consideration for signing the release, because doing so allowed him to avoid the potential for jail time and further monetary losses. Irrespective of whether plaintiff ultimately would or would not have been found guilty, his opportunity to avoid any further criminal proceedings and the expenses he would have incurred stand as sufficient consideration for his promise to release defendants.', 'Second, Miller was no novice; to the contrary, he was a man of knowledge and experience who knew the ramifications of what he was signing. As evidenced by his sworn affidavits, he was, in addition to being a savvy business owner for twenty-five years, an officer of a trade association and a lobbyist who frequently advocated for the interests of Rhode Island’s auto-body trade at the General Assembly. This experience is precisely the knowledge our law requires; one does not need to be an attorney to be of sufficient experience to enter knowingly', '- 14 - into a release. See Town of Newton v. Rumery, 480 U.S. 386, 394 (1987) (upholding a similar release-dismissal agreement where releasor, Rumery, was “a sophisticated businessman”). It is readily apparent to us that Miller understood the law of insurance claims, was aware of the financial implications that a criminal prosecution might have for him personally and professionally, and signed the release knowingly and willingly.', 'Lastly, and importantly, Miller had the assistance of very competent and seasoned criminal defense counsel throughout the process. Indeed, it was one of Miller’s attorneys who drafted the release. We have considered advice by an attorney as a strong indicator that a release was entered into voluntarily and in the best interests of the party executing the document. Guglielmi, 573 A.2d at 690 (finding persuasive that releasors “were represented by an attorney throughout the negotiations”). Miller testified that, although he felt that he had no alternative but to release the insurers, no one forced him to do so and his attorney never counseled against his signing the release. 19 In our opinion, the evidence showed that plaintiff weighed his options, consulted with counsel, and ultimately signed a release in return for the dismissal of pending criminal charges. See Rumery, 480 U.S. at 394 (noting the importance of the fact that Rumery “was represented by an experienced criminal lawyer”). 19', 'On cross-examination by Amica’s counsel:', '“Q: In any event, you’ve told us that you felt that you had no choice but to sign it?', '“[Miller]: That’s correct.', '“Q: And you did sign it?', '“[Miller]: Yes, I did.', '“Q: Nobody had a gun to your head?', '“[Miller]: No.', '“Q: Your attorney didn’t tell you not to sign it; did he?', '“[Miller]: No.”', '- 15 -', 'B. Miller’s Release of Defendants Was Not Procured Under Duress', 'A release that satisfies the above three criteria shall be considered to be valid unless “it has been procured through fraud, misrepresentation, overreaching, or a material mistake on the part of either party.” Guglielmi, 573 A.2d at 689 (citing Bonniecrest Development Co., 478 A.2d at 559). Although this standard does not explicitly employ the word duress, we recognize that releases are contracts and it is clear that contracts entered into under duress are voidable by the party claiming to be the victim of such conduct. See McGee v. Stone, 522 A.2d 211, 214 (R.I. 1987) (“[d]uress does not render a contract void, merely voidable, but the victim may ratify the agreement by failing to object”). In his brief, plaintiff highlights several cases which, he maintains, strengthen his argument for duress: Smith v. Markensohn, 29 R.I. 55, 56-57, 69 A. 311, 311 (1908); White v. International Text-Book Co., 136 N.W. 121, 128 (Iowa 1912); and Gowin v. Heider, 386 P.2d 1, 7 (Or. 1963). However, in all those cases, the plaintiffs were either imprisoned or held under arrest because they had failed to pay a debt. Markensohn, 29 R.I. at 56, 69 A. at 311; White, 136 N.W. at 122; Gowin, 386 P.2d at 7. In our opinion, these cases are inapposite. The cases cited stand for the proposition that, because a plaintiff is either imprisoned or under arrest, paying the disputed debt does not waive the right to later pursue a challenge of the debt. “If a person arrested while protesting that he is not indebted to the person causing his arrest pays the money demanded simply to procure his freedom, he is not thereafter debarred from maintaining an action for malicious prosecution.” Markensohn, 29 R.I. at 57, 69 A. at 311 (citing Morton v. Young, 55 Me. 24, 27-28 (1867)). Miller was not simply paying a debt, which he wished to continue to dispute, in return for his freedom. Miller did not sign the release in order to free himself from arrest or imprisonment; the release was meant to quiet all further disputes in return for Miller’s relief from criminal prosecution.', '- 16 -', 'This Court stated the rule on duress many years ago; “[d]uress exists when one by the unlawful act of another is induced to perform some act under circumstances which deprive him of the exercise of free will.” Peabody v. Tenney, 18 R.I. 498, 502, 30 A. 456, 457 (1893) (bill was amended and case decided on Mar. 2, 1894 by Tillinghast, J.) (citing Hackley v. Headley, 8 N.W. 511, 512-13 (Mich. 1881)) (emphasis added). That simply did not happen here. Miller was faced with a looming prosecution for alleged acts of fraud when he was presented with an opportunity to have those charges dismissed on the condition, among others, that he release defendants. Miller maintained that, at the time he was presented with the release, he had “suffer[ed] catastrophic financial losses” and had endured “severe financial and emotional distress.” He claimed that he “felt [he] had no other choice [than to sign the release].” While his predicament was certainly stressful, it was not precipitated by any unlawful act on the part of the Attorney General, the State Police, or defendants. “Duress is not shown by the fact that one was subjected to * * * personal embarrassment, a difficult bargaining position or the pressure of financial circumstances.” Pierce v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Co., 65 F.3d 562, 569 (7th Cir. 1995) (quoting Herget National Bank v. Theede, 537 N.E.2d 1109, 1111 (Ill. App. Ct. 1989)). Further, “one cannot successfully claim duress as a defense to a contract when he had an alternative to signing the agreement.” Id. (citing Graehling v. Village of Lombard, 58 F.3d 295, 298 (7th Cir. 1995)). Despite Miller’s protestations that he felt he was without a viable alternative, he certainly could have proceeded to trial. Indeed, Miller said that his lawyers told him that he had a “strong case,” despite the sometimes unpredictable nature of a jury trial. While his choice may have been difficult, even gut wrenching, such is the nature of bargaining. In return for what Miller characterized as “walk[ing] out of court without a criminal record,” he', '- 17 - agreed to release from liability the state agencies and defendants, who had reported conduct to the authorities that they believed to be illegal.', 'C. The Release is Effective as to All Three Appeals', 'On the pretrial motions for summary judgment, the hearing justice was able to consider all the evidence before him, including the “pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits,” in making his judgment. Emond, 105 A.3d at 89 (quoting Sola, 45 A.3d at 506). Among the pleadings was the general liability release, a document signed by Miller, an experienced businessperson, benefitting from the advice of counsel, which relieved him from the threat of criminal prosecution and further litigation. The plaintiff’s allegations of duress were set forth in his complaint and affidavit. In our opinion, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the hearing justice should have concluded the release was valid and that the plaintiff had presented insufficient evidence of legal duress. Therefore, we will enforce the release of liability provided to Metropolitan and Amica, and thereby affirm the pretrial grants of summary judgment for defendants, though on reasoning that differs from that of the hearing justice.', 'Similarly, the release, and the attendant circumstances that demonstrate its validity, was in evidence at trial. Again, reviewing the facts in the light most favorable to Miller, as we must, we conclude that the plaintiff failed to produce sufficient evidence such that the jury could have reasonably concluded that his choice to sign the release was the product of some unlawful act of duress that should invalidate its effect.', 'Accordingly, although for a different reason than employed by the trial justice, we affirm the grant of judgment to Amica and we reverse the trial justice’s decision and grant judgment to Metropolitan.', '- 18 -', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the pretrial grants of summary judgment to Amica and Metropolitan. With respect to the abuse-of-process claim that went to trial, we affirm the trial justice’s grant of judgment as a matter of law in favor of Amica, and reverse the trial justice’s decision and grant judgment as a matter of law for Metropolitan.

The defendant contends that the trial justice erred in: (1) denying his motion to suppress an incriminating confession he gave to the police; (2) permitting Dr. Amy Goldberg (Dr. Goldberg) to testify regarding the explanation of a normal examination over defense counsel’s objection; and (3) denying the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2010, six-year-old Sarah1 lived with her mother and defendant in a multifamily home in East Providence, Rhode Island. The defendant had been renting a bedroom on the second 1', 'In order to protect the child’s privacy, she has been given a pseudonym.', '-1- floor, while the child and her mother lived on the first floor.2', 'On January 29, 2011, at approximately one o’clock in the morning, Sarah awakened to defendant touching her vagina. After Sarah’s mother saw defendant run out of Sarah’s room, she went into her daughter’s room, turned on the light, and noticed that the blankets covered her daughter’s head. When Sarah’s mother moved the blankets, she saw that her daughter’s jeans and underwear had been pulled down below her waist. Sarah’s mother immediately took the child into her own bedroom, locked the door, and asked her “Did he touch your cookie?”3 Sarah answered “yes[,]” and her mother subsequently called the East Providence police. When the police arrived, Sarah’s mother explained what had happened, and Sarah was taken to Hasbro Children’s Hospital (Hasbro) for an examination, which was performed by Dr. Goldberg. The following day the police arrested defendant.', 'On March 18, 2011, a criminal information was filed against defendant in Providence County Superior Court, alleging one count of second-degree child molestation in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-37-8.3 and § 11-37-8.4. A jury trial was held in September 2012. The jury returned a verdict of guilty, and the trial justice sentenced defendant to thirty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with ninety months to serve and two hundred and seventy months suspended with probation. The defendant timely appealed.', 'Motion to Suppress', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she denied defendant’s motion to suppress an incriminating statement he gave to the East Providence police while in custody.

A pretrial hearing on the motion was held, which featured the testimony of two East Providence police officers, defendant, defendant’s mother, defendant’s cousin, and an attorney who had been contacted by defendant’s cousin.', 'Detective Mark Jones (Det. Jones) of the East Providence police department was the first witness. Detective Jones was on duty on January 29, 2011 and spoke with defendant the following day, after defendant’s arrest. According to Det. Jones, he and another officer, Det. Michael Spremulli (Det. Spremulli), first spoke to defendant while in the department cellblock and, after he agreed to speak with them, defendant was moved to an interview room. Detective Jones stated that he “asked [defendant] if he understood, if he could read English, if he could read period, and [defendant] said yes.” Detective Jones testified that he provided defendant with a rights form and advised defendant of his constitutional rights, as set forth on the form. The defendant then initialed each numerically listed item on the rights form and signed the form.', 'Next, Det. Jones testified that, although defendant was alert, he appeared “subdued but nervous[,]” which the detective characterized as normal behavior.', 'Detective Jones acknowledged that defendant stated that he had vomited some sleeping pills which he ingested prior to being arrested while purportedly attempting suicide, but the officer testified that he did not observe anything that would suggest defendant had taken sleeping pills. Detective Jones testified that defendant stated the following:', '“He said that night of the incident, he was in Cranston * * * doing', 'shots. He got home, he thinks it was around midnight or so, took a', 'sleeping pill, and then he said he went into [Sarah’s] bedroom to', 'check on her. And he said he saw that she had a pair of jeans, she', 'seemed uncomfortable. So he decided to pull her pants down, and', 'while doing so her underwear came down as well. Then he said', 'when he saw her vagina he got curious as to what it would feel', 'like. So at that time, he said he touched her vagina, got nervous,', '-3-', 'realizing what he did was wrong, and then left the room.” After the interview, Det. Jones typed the statement, asked defendant to read the statement, and then asked him if there were any inconsistencies in the statement or anything he wished to change. Detective Jones testified that defendant never indicated that the statement was incorrect or that it was incomplete in any way. The defendant then signed the statement. Detective Jones noted that at no time during his interaction with defendant did defendant ever ask to speak to an attorney, nor did defendant request that he be allowed to make a phone call.4', 'Detective Spremulli also testified at the suppression hearing. Detective Spremulli’s testimony corroborated the testimony of Det. Jones. Specifically, Det. Spremulli testified that he was present when defendant read the rights form, indicated to the officers that he understood the contents of the form, and initialed and signed the rights form. Detective Spremulli’s recollection of defendant’s confession was substantially the same as that of Det. Jones. Detective Spremulli also testified that he did not recall defendant asking for a lawyer, nor did he recall anyone coming into the interview room to tell the officers about a telephone call.', 'The defendant’s version was at variance with the testimony of the police detectives. According to defendant, after he was first arrested and while still in handcuffs, ten to fifteen officers “kept saying[,] * * * did you resist arrest? Did he resist arrest? * * * I hope he does, I hope he does, I’m really in the mood to mess him up. They kept saying, I want to mess him up, I want to fuck him up.” He testified that the officers were “fingering their Billy clubs and putting their hands on their guns and stuff * * *.” The defendant stated that he “was afraid they were going to beat the hell out of [him]” and that he felt “intimidated.” The defendant testified that, when he arrived at the station, officers further threatened him about what he could expect from 4', 'Detective Jones did, however, testify that the booking sheet was marked “phone call, no[,]” indicating, according to the officer, that defendant “didn’t choose to make a phone call.”', '-4- the other inmates at the prison, which made him think that he “was going to die.” The defendant stated that, while at the police station, he asked an officer if he could make a phone call; however, because the telephone number of the person he wished to call was on his mobile phone, the officer allowed defendant to make one phone call from his mobile phone. The defendant testified that he called his mother and asked her to call his cousin and ask the cousin to obtain a lawyer for him.', 'The defendant’s testimony concerning the interview with Det. Jones and Det. Spremulli also differed from that of the detectives. He testified that, numerous times before he was shown the rights form, he asked for a lawyer. He testified that Det. Jones ignored his requests and kept pestering him about the incident. The defendant testified that he signed the rights form because he was scared, tired, and “afraid that the judge was going to decide [he] was guilty if [he] didn’t give [his] side of the story.” He also told the court that, while being questioned, another officer came into the room where he was being questioned and said something to Det. Jones about a phone call. The defendant admitted to giving a statement to the police and signing it, but he stated that he never read it and only signed it because he “was afraid not to.” However, on cross- examination, defendant admitted that he understood he did not have to say anything to the officers but spoke with Det. Jones anyway.', 'The defendant’s mother also testified at the suppression hearing. She testified that, on January 30, 2011, she received a call from defendant, requesting that she obtain a lawyer for him. She testified that she told defendant that she would contact his cousin to obtain a lawyer for him; she then called defendant’s cousin, who agreed to help. The defendant’s cousin also testified and stated that she contacted Attorney Priscilla DiMaio (Attorney DiMaio), who agreed to represent defendant.', '-5-', 'Lastly, Attorney DiMaio testified. Attorney DiMaio testified that, on January 30, 2011, at approximately 9:45 in the morning, she called the East Providence police department, identified herself as an attorney who was trying to contact defendant, and asked to speak to a detective. She stated that she also asked to speak with defendant, but her request was denied. She testified that she told a detective “to let [defendant] know that [she had] called, and * * * not to give a statement.” We note that the record discloses that defendant signed the waiver of rights form at 9:40 that morning.', 'At the conclusion of testimony and after hearing counsels’ arguments, the trial justice rendered a bench decision. The trial justice denied the motion to suppress, declaring that, based on the record before her, defendant’s statement was voluntary and that defendant had not been deprived of his right to counsel. With respect to whether the statement was voluntary, the trial justice found defendant’s testimony “implausible,” “unbelievable,” and “far-fetched.” “Viewing all the evidence and under the totality of the circumstances[,]” the trial justice found that defendant’s statement was not coerced and that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his rights. Also, with respect to defendant’s argument that he was deprived of his right to counsel, the trial justice, citing State v. Burbine, 451 A.2d 22 (R.I. 1982), noted “that the effort by third parties to retain counsel for the defendant is entirely irrelevant to whether the defendant asked for and was denied the right to counsel.” See id. at 27-28. The trial justice went on to find “the detectives to be more credible than the defendant in testifying that the defendant never did request counsel.” Specifically, the trial justice found “it incredible that such numerous requests [for a lawyer] were made * * * and fell on deaf ears * * *.” The trial justice determined that the state had established by clear and convincing evidence that defendant did not request an attorney and, therefore, was not deprived of his right to counsel.', '-6-', 'Before this Court, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress his statement to police, arguing that his statement was not voluntary. “Both the Rhode Island and the United States Constitutions bar the use of a defendant’s involuntary statements in a criminal trial.” State v. Bojang, 83 A.3d 526, 532 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 835 (R.I. 2008)). “In order for the trial justice to admit a defendant’s statement at trial, ‘the state must establish, by clear and convincing evidence, that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his or her right against self-incrimination and that the statement was voluntary.’” Id. at 533 (quoting State v. Monteiro, 924 A.2d 784, 790 (R.I. 2007)). “This inquiry ‘requires an analysis of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation.’” Id. (quoting State v. Jimenez, 33 A.3d 724, 734 (R.I. 2011)). “This Court applies the following two- step review of a trial justice’s finding of voluntariness:', '‘First, we review the trial justice’s findings of historical fact with', 'deference, and we will not overturn those findings unless they are', 'clearly erroneous. * * * Second, because this issue is of', 'constitutional dimension, we accept the historical facts and', 'credibility determinations, and we then conduct de novo review of', 'the trial justice’s conclusion that the confession was voluntary.’”', 'Id. (quoting Monteiro, 924 A.2d at 790).', 'After examining the record in this case, we are satisfied that defendant’s confession was voluntary and that the trial justice did not err when she refused to suppress the confession. The evidence presented at the suppression hearing disclosed that Det. Jones advised defendant of his rights, both orally and in writing. The defendant initialed and signed the waiver of rights form that was introduced into evidence. Detective Jones testified that defendant appeared alert, and both Det. Jones and Det. Spremulli testified that defendant acknowledged that he understood his rights. Finally, defendant himself testified that he knew he did not have to say anything to the detectives, but he nevertheless proceeded to speak with the detectives and then to sign the statement.', '-7-', 'Although the trial justice set forth her decision in a comprehensive bench ruling, she did err when she stated that “defendant never testified that his mother, aunt, and/or cousin were in the process of retaining an attorney * * * [n]or did the defendant testify that he, in fact, had already made a call to his mother requesting that she procure an attorney for him.” The record reveals that defendant did testify about the phone call to his mother. Nonetheless, this error was not material and has no impact on our decision given the appropriate factual findings and credibility determinations made by the trial justice in view of the totality of the circumstances.5 The trial justice specifically found that defendant did not invoke his right to counsel. The trial justice rejected defendant’s argument that the police officers threatened him or deprived him of his right to counsel. The trial justice concluded, after analyzing the totality of the circumstances, that defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his rights and spoke to the police.', 'In light of the trial justice’s findings of historical fact and credibility determinations, which we review with deference, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not misconceive or overlook material evidence, nor did she err in her conclusions. Our de novo review also satisfies us that defendant’s confession was given voluntarily.', 'Finally, we pause to note that defendant also argued that the trial justice erred in denying his motion to suppress because he “was denied his right to a confidential phone call pursuant to R.I.G.L. § 12-7-20.” General Laws 1956 § 12-7-20 provides that a person who is arrested “shall be afforded, as soon after being detained as practicable, * * * the opportunity to make use of a telephone for the purpose of securing an attorney * * *.” Here, defendant testified that, after he 5', 'The defendant testified that he was given an opportunity to make a phone call and did make a phone call. The detectives testified that the booking sheet was marked “phone call, no[,]” indicating that defendant “didn’t choose to make a phone call.” Whether or not the notation on the booking sheet meant that defendant did not make a phone call from a police phone is irrelevant to our analysis. It is not disputed that defendant did in fact make a telephone call to his mother.', '-8- was arrested and transported to the East Providence police station, he made a phone call to his mother and requested that she assist him in obtaining a lawyer by contacting a cousin. Accordingly, we deem this argument without merit.', 'Testimony of Dr. Goldberg', 'Next, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred when she allowed Dr. Goldberg to testify regarding what defendant characterized as “physical examination, diagnosis, and treatment of penetrative first degree sexual assault[,]” as contrasted with the second-degree sexual assault of which he was accused. During trial, the state sought to introduce the testimony of Dr. Goldberg, an attending physician in the Child Protection Program at Hasbro who had examined Sarah on the night of the incident. At trial, Dr. Goldberg discussed her examination of the child, presented certain disclosures that Sarah made during her examination, and explained what was meant by an examination that was found to be normal. Doctor Goldberg testified that, on January 29, 2011, Sarah, in describing the incident and her physical condition, had told her “she felt wet,” a symptom which, Dr. Goldberg explained, prompted her to evaluate the child for an acute sexual assault. Next, Dr. Goldberg testified that Sarah had some redness in her genital examination but that the rest of her physical examination appeared to be normal, which she explained to the jury meant that she saw no specific abnormalities. Doctor Goldberg went on to explain that a normal finding does not necessarily mean that the child was not abused. Although defense counsel objected numerous times throughout Dr. Goldberg’s testimony, these objections were grounded on lack of materiality. Significantly, the witness was asked, without objection: “[a]nd that normal examination in your mind at the time, can you say for certain whether or not she was touched in the manner that you understood?” To which Dr. Goldberg replied, “[Sarah’s] normal examination does not exclude the possibility of sexual abuse, or even penetration, in my', '-9- mind.” Not only was there no objection to this question, there was no motion to strike this answer.', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the trial justice erred in admitting this testimony because it was irrelevant, beyond the scope of proper expert testimony, and substantially prejudicial. It is well settled that this Court will “review a trial justice’s decision admitting or excluding evidence under an abuse of discretion standard.” State v. Covington, 69 A.3d 855, 862 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Brown, 42 A.3d 1239, 1242 (R.I. 2012)). “We will reverse a trial justice’s ruling on the admissibility of evidence only where ‘it constitutes a clear abuse of discretion.’” Id. (quoting Brown, 42 A.3d at 1242).', 'After a thorough examination of the record, this Court concludes that defendant failed to preserve this issue for appellate review. We note at the outset that, prior to Dr. Goldberg’s testimony, defense counsel expressly agreed that “[Dr. Goldberg could] testify as to what the absence of any injuries means, and [could] also testify as to the result of her examination.” During Dr. Goldberg’s direct examination she was asked, “[a]nd that normal examination in your mind at the time, can you say for certain whether or not she was touched in the manner that you understood?” To which Dr. Goldberg answered, “[h]er normal examination does not exclude the possibility of sexual abuse, or even penetration, in my mind.” As noted, defense counsel did not object to the question, or move to strike the answer. Therefore, according to this Court’s “raise- or-waive” doctrine, we deem defendant’s argument that the trial justice erred in permitting Dr. Goldberg to testify waived.6 However, were this issue properly preserved before the Court, we are convinced that Dr. Goldberg’s testimony—which was equivocal at best—was not unduly 6', 'See Berard v. HCP, Inc., 64 A.3d 1215, 1219 n.2 (R.I. 2013) (noting that the Court “shall ‘not review issues that were not presented to the trial court in such a posture as to alert the trial justice to the question being raised[.]’” quoting State v. Kluth, 46 A.3d 867, 876 (R.I. 2012)).', '- 10 - prejudicial or implied that defendant engaged in sexual penetration, as the trial justice instructed the jury “that there is no evidence in this case of the type of conduct that this doctor just referred to * * *.” It is also significant that defendant was not charged with first-degree sexual assault and that he, through his confession, admitted to improperly touching Sarah, the act that led to the charge of second-degree child molestation for which he was convicted.', 'In addition, “because the state bears the burden of proving each element of the charge beyond a reasonable doubt, it has the right to present evidence establishing those elements in its case in chief.” State v. Marmolejos, 990 A.2d 848, 852 (R.I. 2010). Here, the child’s disclosure to Dr. Goldberg, about feeling “wet,” prompted the physical examination about which the witness testified.', 'Thus, the state was within its rights to present testimony about the examination.', 'Motion for Judgment of Acquittal', 'Lastly, defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. “When passing on ‘a trial justice’s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, this Court applies the same standard as the trial justice.’” State v. Long, 61 A.3d 439, 445 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Lynch, 19 A.3d 51, 56 (R.I. 2011)). “A motion for a judgment of acquittal should be granted only if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, is insufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. (quoting State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010)).', '“If, however, a reasonable juror could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the motion should be denied.” Id. (quoting Heredia, 10 A.3d at 446).', 'Viewing the evidence “in the light most favorable to the state” and “giving full credibility to the state’s witnesses,” we conclude that sufficient evidence existed to prove, beyond a', '- 11 - reasonable doubt, that the defendant committed one count of second-degree child molestation, in violation of § 11-37-8.3. See Lynch, 19 A.3d at 56. In this case, the six-year-old child took the stand at trial and testified that, on the night of the incident, she woke up, felt something on her vagina, and opened her eyes to the defendant standing at her bed. Sarah’s mother also testified at trial and corroborated the child’s statements and the events of that night. According to Sarah’s mother, on January 29, 2011, she had put her daughter to bed with her jeans and underwear pulled up to her waist. At approximately one o’clock in the morning, she saw someone leaving her daughter’s room; and, when she went into the room, she discovered that her daughter’s pants and underwear had been pulled down below her waist. She testified that she took Sarah into her room, locked the door, and asked her if the defendant touched her, to which Sarah replied, “yes.” Doctor Goldberg testified that Sarah told her that the defendant had been in her room that night and that “she felt wet.” Further, Det. Jones also testified at trial and read the defendant’s sworn statement, which stated:', '“On January 28, 2011, I was out drinking * * *. Then I went to', 'check on [Sarah]. I noticed that she had jeans on, and she looked', 'very uncomfortable. * * * I went over to [her] and pulled her jeans', 'down. The jeans were so tight that her underpants came down', 'with the jeans. * * * I was always curious if a young girl felt the', 'same as a woman. * * * After [Sarah’s] underpants came down', 'with her jeans, I saw her vagina. * * * So I touched the outside of', '[her] vagina with my hand.”', '“A person is guilty of a second degree child molestation sexual assault if he or she engages in sexual contact with another person fourteen (14) years of age or under.” Section 11- 37-8.3. Because we are satisfied that the state presented ample evidence that Sarah was six years old when the defendant touched her vagina, in violation of § 11-37-8.3, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to withstand the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal and to support the conviction. Accordingly, the trial justice did not err when she denied the defendant’s', '- 12 - motion for a judgment of acquittal.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment below.

39,(Dissent begins on page 21) Jennifer O’Connor : v. : Newport Hospital et al. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. After a three-week trial, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants, Newport Hospital (hospital), Gita S. Pensa, M.D., and Newport Emergency Physicians, Inc. (NEP) (collectively defendants), in this medical malpractice action. The plaintiff, Jennifer O’Connor, appeals from the Superior Court judgment, claiming that the trial justice’s erroneous admission into evidence of three documents during the voir dire of the plaintiff’s standard-of-care expert, exacerbated by an allegedly “biased and incorrect” jury verdict form, was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial. We agree, and accordingly we vacate the judgment and remand the case for a new trial.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On June 22, 2006, at the age of thirty-one, O’Connor underwent cervical disk replacement surgery at Rhode Island Hospital; she was discharged from the hospital two days later.', 'In the early morning hours of June 26, 2006, O’Connor experienced a pain behind her right eye “unlike anything that [she] had ever felt before.” She testified that “it [was as] if', '-1- someone took an ice pick and stuck it through the eye and it hit the point right behind your eye * * *.” O’Connor also testified that she experienced numbness around her mouth, confusion, and the sensation of being hot and cold at the same time. O’Connor was transported to Newport Hospital by ambulance, at which time she also experienced nausea and sensitivity when her eye was exposed to light.', 'At Newport Hospital, O’Connor was treated by Dr. Pensa. According to O’Connor, Dr. Pensa thought she had an eye problem or perhaps a migraine headache. O’Connor was admitted, but a couple of hours later she was discharged from the hospital, and she returned home. Later that morning, she awoke with worsening symptoms and was driven to Rhode Island Hospital, where she was joined by the surgeon who had performed the disk replacement surgery. O’Connor learned she was having a stroke caused by a vertebral artery dissection. She testified that, after the stroke, she experienced the loss of motor skills on her right side, but that she regained function through therapy.', 'She also testified that she continues to have chronic, debilitating nerve pain, issues with her balance, and difficulty coming up with the correct words while speaking.', 'On March 6, 2007, O’Connor filed suit in Superior Court against defendants, alleging negligence and lack of informed consent. 1 On May 12, 2011, Dr. Pensa and NEP filed a pretrial motion to preclude the testimony of Eddy Lang, M.D., one of plaintiff’s disclosed experts on the standard of care. At the hearing on the motion, Dr. Pensa and NEP’s counsel argued that Dr. Lang was not qualified to testify as an expert on the standard of care in American emergency rooms because he was a Canadian physician who was neither board-certified nor licensed to 1', 'In plaintiff’s initial complaint, she also named Lifespan (partner to Newport Hospital) and Christine Gill, M.D. (who allegedly treated plaintiff) as defendants. The claims against these defendants, however, were dismissed by stipulation before trial.', '-2- practice medicine in the United States. The trial justice denied the motion without prejudice, noting that “plaintiffs are at their peril * * * if the defendants are able to impeach the expert’s credibility either on issues of experience, training, education, etc.” Towards the beginning of trial testimony, a voir dire of Dr. Lang was conducted in the presence of the jury. Doctor Lang testified that he was familiar with the standard of care required of emergency-room physicians in the United States, and he also stated that there was no difference between the standard required in the United States and that required in Canada.', 'Counsel for Dr. Pensa and NEP cross-examined Dr. Lang regarding his qualifications and elicited the fact that, although he is a practicing emergency-medicine physician in Canada and is certified as an emergency-medicine specialist in the provinces of Québec and Alberta, he has neither sought, nor received, a license to practice medicine in the United States. The following colloquy took place regarding Dr. Lang’s eligibility for board certification in the United States:', '“Q And in fact, when I asked you at your deposition as to whether', 'or not you knew if you were even eligible to sit for board', 'certification in the United States with the American Board of', 'Emergency Medicine, you thought you were able to, correct?', '“***', '“A I think I was uncertain as to whether I was able to.', '“Q * * * You were uncertain or you believed that you were', 'eligible?', '“A I believed I was eligible.', '“Q Okay. You believed you were eligible. In fact, you’re not', 'eligible to even sit for board certification with the American', 'Board of Emergency Medicine, correct?', '“***', '“A I still do not know for certain whether I would be eligible or', 'not.', '“Q Well, okay. And have you taken time to look at the American', 'Board of Emergency Medicine at their website to even see if', 'you are eligible?', '“***', '“A I have not.”', '-3-', 'Following this exchange, Dr. Pensa and NEP offered three exhibits purporting to relate to the policies of the American Board of Emergency Medicine (ABEM). 2 Exhibit A reflected a printed version of a web page that purported to outline the ABEM’s policies on training requirements. Exhibit B was also a printed version of what appeared to be an ABEM web page, stating that, in Canada, the Royal Association of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada (RAPSC) reviews and accredits Canadian residency programs. 3 Finally, exhibit C purported to reflect a printed version of an email from the Associate Executive Director of the Academic and Board Relations section of the ABEM. The printed version of the email stated that training through the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) did not fulfill the ABEM’s eligibility requirements. All three documents were admitted as full exhibits over plaintiff’s objections. At the conclusion of the voir dire and over defendants’ objections, the trial justice ruled that Dr. Lang was qualified to provide expert testimony on the standard of care and causation.', 'After a three-week trial, the jury returned a verdict in defendants’ favor on June 14, 2011, finding that plaintiff had failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that Dr. Pensa had breached the standard of care. In her appeal of the final judgment, plaintiff argues that: (1) the trial justice erred by admitting exhibits A-C during Dr. Lang’s voir dire; (2) the trial justice erred by including the language “physician practicing in the United States at a community hospital” in question one of the jury verdict form; and (3) that these errors sufficiently prejudiced plaintiff to warrant a new trial. This case initially came before us pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After oral 2', 'The trial exhibits were not submitted with the record on appeal. The descriptions of the content of exhibits A-C were taken from the testimony at trial and from photocopies of the documents that were provided in plaintiff’s appendices. 3', 'Doctor Lang trained under the College of Family Physicians of Canada.', '-4- argument, however, we concluded that this Court would benefit from additional briefing and argument, and we reassigned this case to the full argument calendar.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“It is well established that ‘the admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial justice, and this Court will not interfere with the trial justice’s decision unless a clear abuse of that discretion is apparent.’” Notarantonio v. Notarantonio, 941 A.2d 138, 149 (R.I. 2008) (quoting DiPetrillo v. Dow Chemical Co., 729 A.2d 677, 690 (R.I. 1999)). When the complaining party can show that the trial justice abused his or her discretion, we will reverse the ruling only if the abuse of discretion resulted in prejudice to the complaining party. State v. Martin, 68 A.3d 467, 475 (R.I. 2013).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'The Exhibits', '1. Authentication', 'The plaintiff first argues that the trial justice abused his discretion by admitting exhibits A-C because none of them was properly authenticated. She contends that Dr. Lang, the only witness to whom questions were posed regarding these documents, was not capable of authenticating them simply by reciting some of the information contained therein. She also contends that these three documents were neither self-authenticating nor subject to judicial notice.', '-5-', 'Doctor Pensa and NEP first argue that plaintiff failed to properly preserve her authentication objections to exhibits A and B because plaintiff interposed only a general objection to their admission and did not specify lack of authentication as a ground thereof. To effectively preserve an issue for appeal, a litigant’s objection must be “sufficiently focused so as to call the trial justice’s attention to the basis for said objection.” State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Warren, 624 A.2d 841, 842 (R.I. 1993)).', 'The entire discussion after defendants moved to admit exhibits A and B in full was as follows:', '“[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: By the way, at this time if I may', 'I would ask that A and B be full.', '“[PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL]: Objection.', '“THE COURT: Grounds?', '“[PLAINTIFF’S COUNSEL]: Foundation, admissibility', 'and hearsay.', '“THE COURT: Overruled. It may be marked as full.” Rule 901(a) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence is clear that authentication is a “condition precedent to admissibility.” We are satisfied that plaintiff’s use of the words “foundation” and “admissibility” sufficiently “call[ed] the trial justice’s attention” to the threshold issue of authentication. See Brown, 9 A.3d at 1245 (quoting Warren, 624 A.2d at 842). The plaintiff’s argument that none of the three documents was properly authenticated prior to admission as full exhibits, therefore, was properly preserved for our review.', 'The hospital argues that plaintiff was on notice that defendants intended to use these exhibits to challenge Dr. Lang’s qualifications during the trial because defendants’ pretrial motion in limine to preclude Dr. Lang’s expert testimony referred to these three documents and included each as an appendix to the motion. Doctor Pensa and NEP contend that plaintiff did not challenge the accuracy of the information contained within the three documents during the trial. Furthermore, all defendants assert that Dr. Lang’s acknowledgement of the purported content of', '-6- the documents, coupled with the “inherent reliability” of the ABEM website, was sufficient for purposes of authentication.', 'Rule 901(a) provides that “[t]he requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.” The advisory committee’s note to Rule 901 informs that “authentication and identification are regarded as a special aspect of relevancy”; evidence is relevant only if it is in fact what the party seeking its admission claims it to be. “[T]he burden of proof for authentication[,] [however,] is slight.” United States v. Reilly, 33 F.3d 1396, 1404 (3d Cir. 1994) (quoting Link v. Mercedes-Benz of North America, Inc., 788 F.2d 918, 927 (3d Cir. 1986)). To that end, we recently stated that “[a]uthentication is not a high hurdle to clear.” McGovern v. Bank of America, N.A., 91 A.3d 853, 860 (R.I. 2014). “This Court has taken a flexible and pragmatic approach to Rule 901 by allowing ‘a document’s authenticity [to] be established in any number of different ways.’” McGovern, 91 A.3d at 860 (quoting Rhode Island Managed Eye Care, Inc. v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island, 996 A.2d 684, 691 (R.I. 2010)). We have previously held that “document authenticity need not be established by any particular means * * * [but] may be accomplished by any of the methods enumerated in Rule[s] 901 or 902.” 4 State v. Oliveira, 774 A.2d 893, 925 (R.I. 2001) (quoting Superior Boiler Works, Inc. v. R.J. Sanders, Inc., 711 A.2d 628, 632 n.3 (R.I. 1998)). “In making Rule 901 determinations, trial justices must decide whether there is enough support in the record to conclude that it is ‘reasonably probable’ that the evidence is what its offeror [pro]claims it to be. * * * If so, then the evidence’s suasive force is for the jury to decide.” Id. at 4', 'Rule 901(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence sets forth, “[b]y way of illustration only, and not by way of limitation,” a non-exclusive list of ways to authenticate evidence; Rule 902 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence lists documents that are self-authenticating.', '-7- 926 (quoting State v. Griffin, 691 A.2d 556, 558 (R.I. 1997)). Thus, a trial justice “need not find that the evidence is necessarily what the proponent claims, but only that there is sufficient evidence that the jury ultimately might do so.” United States v. Safavian, 435 F.Supp.2d 36, 38 (D.D.C. 2006); see 31 Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence § 7102.', 'The issue of authentication of documents printed directly from either an Internet website or an email account is a matter of first impression in Rhode Island. While Rule 901(b) provides several illustrations of how to properly authenticate various kinds of evidence, none of the illustrations provided therein includes either documents printed from pages located on the Internet or from email accounts. Although a proponent of evidence need not meet a particularly high standard for an authenticity determination, defendants in this case undoubtedly have failed to cross even the most minimal of thresholds. We address the contested documents in turn.', 'a. Web Pages', 'Exhibits A and B consist of printouts of web pages purportedly printed from the ABEM website. One commentary on Rule 901 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which essentially mirrors Rule 901 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, 5 suggests that:', '“To authenticate a printout of a web page, the proponent must', 'offer evidence that: (1) the printout accurately reflects the', 'computer image of the web page as of a specified date; (2) the', 'website where the posting appears is owned or controlled by a', 'particular person or entity; and (3) the authorship of the web', 'posting is reasonably attributable to that person or entity. Evidence', 'that may corroborate these points could include testimony of others', 'who saw the posting on the website, continuation of the posting on', 'the website so that it is available to be seen by the court, or 5', 'When, as here, the Rhode Island rule is substantially similar to the federal rule, we often look to federal courts’ decisions for guidance and interpretation. Miller v. Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Co., 88 A.3d 1157, 1161 (R.I. 2014); Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 942 A.2d 284, 290 (R.I. 2007); Crowe Countryside Realty Associates, Co., LLC v. Novare Engineers, Inc., 891 A.2d 838, 840 (R.I. 2006). We find federal treatises to be similarly instructive.', '-8-', 'evidence that the party to whom the posting is attributed made', 'similar postings or published the same information elsewhere.”', 'Christopher B. Mueller and Laird C. Kirkpatrick, 5 Federal', 'Evidence § 9:9 (4th ed.) (database updated May 2014).', 'Here, there is no indication on the record that Dr. Pensa and NEP’s counsel made any representations to the trial justice regarding when or by whom the documents reflected in exhibits A and B were accessed and printed from the ABEM website. Counsel did not offer, by affidavit or otherwise, a witness to confirm that the exhibits in question accurately reflected what the witness saw after he or she logged onto the ABEM website. Instead, defendants attempted to admit the exhibits through the testimony of Dr. Lang himself by merely showing him the documents and asking him if it was “something taken directly off a public website.”', 'It is clear from the record that counsel simply asked Dr. Lang a few leading questions about the content of the documents, the answers to which were based on Dr. Lang’s cursory review of the documents in the moments prior to the posing of the questions. Alternatively, defendants could have provided a witness with personal knowledge to testify to the source of the exhibits. See United States v. Bansal, 663 F.3d 634, 667 (3d Cir. 2011) (holding that screenshots from a website were properly authenticated when the proponent of the evidence called a witness who explained the website’s archive process and testified, based on personal knowledge, that the screenshots were authentic); United States v. Jackson, 208 F.3d 633, 638 (7th Cir. 2000) (affirming a trial justice’s exclusion of web postings on the basis of lack of authentication because the defendant had not shown that the postings were actually created by the group that the defendant claimed). Another option would have been to obtain a copy of the policies and guidelines purportedly contained within exhibits A and B that had been either certified by the keeper of records at ABEM, or attached to an affidavit that attested to the accuracy of the copies.', '-9-', 'McCormick on Evidence states that “[p]rintouts of [w]eb pages must first be authenticated as accurately reflecting the content of the page and the image of the page on the computer at which the printout was made. Testimony of a percipient witness, even the trial judge, can testify to such accuracy.” 2 Kenneth S. Broun et al., McCormick on Evidence § 227 at 74 (6th ed. 2006). Here, the trial justice did not make any comments or findings with respect to authentication of any of the documents in overruling plaintiff’s objections to the exhibits. It is our considered opinion that insufficient evidence was proffered to support the authenticity of the two printouts of the ABEM web pages and that, accordingly, the admission of exhibits A and B into evidence was clearly erroneous.', 'b. Email', 'Exhibit C is a printout of a purported email from the Associate Executive Director of the Academic and Board Relations section of the ABEM to “K. Lafontaine.” Doctor Lang was asked questions about the contents of the email, and it was admitted into evidence without any attempt on the record to verify its authenticity. Doctor Lang simply answered the questions about the identity of the sender of the email and the message contained therein—answers that were based on his reading of the email to himself at counsel’s request during the few moments before the questions were asked. There was no indication that Dr. Lang had previously seen this email, or that he had any familiarity with either the sender or recipient of the email.', 'Clearly, an email, like any other item of evidence, may be authenticated in any number of different ways, by either direct or circumstantial evidence. Perhaps the most direct method would be through the testimony of a witness with personal knowledge that the proffered exhibit is what it is claimed to be, such as the author or recipient of the email. See Rule 901(b)(1). Additionally, Rule 901(b)(4) provides for a variety of ways that an email might be authenticated', '- 10 - by circumstantial evidence, including “[a]ppearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances.” If an email is not clearly identifiable on its own, and if there is no witness with personal knowledge, a forensic expert witness might be able to trace an email back to the Internet address from which it originated. As one well-respected treatise on evidence instructs:', '“E-mails can be authenticated by their authorship. The electronic', 'signature that they bear may not be sufficient, however, because of', 'the risk of manipulation of e-mail headers.[] Additional data such', 'as the address that an e-mail bears, the use of the ‘reply’ function', 'to generate the address of the original sender, the content of the', 'information included in the e-mail and other circumstances, can', 'suffice.” 2 Kenneth S. Broun, § 227 at 73.', 'Here, Dr. Lang was neither the sender nor the recipient of the email. Doctor Lang’s mere recitation of the identity of the purported sender of the email and summary of its message (viz., that one with Dr. Lang’s credentials would not be eligible for board certification by the ABEM) was insufficient to authenticate the email. Moreover, the record is silent as to any distinctive features of the email that would support its authentication, and our review of exhibit C does not reveal any characteristic that would authenticate it as an email sent from a representative of ABEM.', 'While we have not set a “high hurdle to clear” with respect to authentication, McGovern, 91 A.3d at 860, we hold that the trial justice abused his discretion by admitting exhibits A-C based solely on the brief testimony of one witness who was clearly unfamiliar with all three documents.', '2. Hearsay', 'The plaintiff next argues that the exhibits were “textbook hearsay documents,” offered for the truth that Dr. Lang was ineligible for board certification in the United States. The', '- 11 - plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred by not requiring defendants to provide an applicable hearsay exception as well as by not making any findings with respect to the hearsay objections other than to summarily overrule them. “Hearsay is defined in Rule 801(c) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence as ‘a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.’” Martin, 68 A.3d at 475 (quoting Rule 801(c)). Hearsay statements are inadmissible except as provided by law. Rule 802 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence.', 'Here, the trial justice summarily overruled plaintiff’s hearsay objections without requiring either a response from defendants or further argument from plaintiff regarding the specific grounds for her hearsay objections. The three documents entered into evidence as exhibits A-C were unquestionably hearsay. Exhibits A and B were clearly offered to prove ABEM’s eligibility standards for board certification. Exhibit C was offered to establish that Dr. Lang’s training under the CFPC does not meet ABEM’s eligibility requirements.', 'Doctor Pensa and NEP contend that “[t]he challenged evidence carries the necessary imprimatur of reliability and inherent trustworthiness necessary to meet the ‘catch-all’ exception to the hearsay rule.” With respect to exhibits A and B, Dr. Pensa and NEP argue that each would qualify under Rule 803(24) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence because the documents are from an official website and not a blog or comment section to an online article. The hospital, for its part, contends that “[t]he URL address, date of printing, email addresses and date and time of transmittal, coupled with counsel’s representations, provide adequate circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness to permit the admission of these documents into evidence.”', 'Rule 803(24)—known colloquially as the “catch-all” exception—allows for the admission of hearsay statements that, while not covered by any of the other hearsay exceptions,', '- 12 - have “equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.” In order for the evidence to be admissible, the trial justice must determine that:', '“(A) the statement is offered as evidence of a material fact; (B) the', 'statement is more probative on the point for which it is offered', 'than any other evidence which the proponent can procure through', 'reasonable efforts; and (C) the general purposes of [the Rhode', 'Island Rules of Evidence] and the interests of justice will best be', 'served by admission of the statement into evidence.” Rule 803(24). We have said, however, that this “residual exception is ‘meant to be reserved for exceptional cases’ and is ‘not intended to confer a broad license on trial judges to admit hearsay statements that do not fall within one of the other exceptions * * * .’” In re Steven D., 23 A.3d 1138, 1165 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Conoco Inc. v. Department of Energy, 99 F.3d 387, 392 (Fed. Cir. 1996)).', 'In the case under review, we decline defendants’ invitation to hold that the exhibits were properly admitted under the catch-all exception to the hearsay rule. The trial justice did not make any of the requisite findings concerning admissibility under Rule 803(24), nor do we discern from the record such exceptional circumstances as would warrant the admission of exhibits A-C. We are satisfied, therefore, that all three documents were erroneously admitted in violation of Rule 802.', '3. Extrinsic Evidence of Character and Conduct', 'The plaintiff also argues that exhibits A-C were extrinsic evidence admitted in violation of Rule 608(b) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence. The plaintiff contends that defendants were trying to prove that Dr. Lang was not eligible to become board-certified in emergency medicine by the ABEM, a collateral and extraneous point given Dr. Lang’s admission prior to the introduction of these documents that he was not board-certified to practice emergency medicine in the United States. The plaintiff, however, raises a Rule 608(b) challenge for the first time on appeal, and plaintiff’s objections to the exhibits on the grounds of foundation,', '- 13 - admissibility, authentication, and hearsay were insufficient to call the trial justice’s attention to Rule 608(b). See Brown, 9 A.3d at 1245. In addition, we have stated that, if “the introduction of evidence is objected to for a specific reason, other grounds for objection are waived and may not be raised for the first time on appeal.” Robideau v. Cosentino, 47 A.3d 338, 341 (R.I. 2012) (mem.) (quoting In re Jazlyn P., 31 A.3d 1273, 1280-81 (R.I. 2011)). Accordingly, we find this argument to be waived.', 'B', 'Prejudice', 'The plaintiff argues that the admission of the three documents was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial, and also that the prejudice was intensified by defendants’ repeated references to Dr. Lang’s nationality and his ostensible inability to become board-certified in the United States, 6 as well as by the wording of the first question on the jury verdict form. She contends that defendants’ goal was to suggest that Dr. Lang was “untrustworthy because he supposedly could not practice in a United States emergency room,” and that this suggestion was powerful, “extremely damaging and unquestionably prejudicial.” The plaintiff further asserts that “[t]he expert’s outsized importance suggests that the introduction of any inadmissible evidence intended to influence the jury’s consideration of an expert’s opinion can have an overwhelming impact on the jury verdict.”', 'The hospital contends that, even if the three exhibits were admitted in error, the error was not unfairly prejudicial because “the question of board certification was a very small piece of the overall attack on [plaintiff’s] expert’s qualifications.” The defendants also assert that the trial 6', 'Doctor Pensa and NEP’s counsel incorporated the phrase “board certified emergency medicine physician practicing in the United States” into four questions posed to defendants’ own standard- of-care expert during the direct examination and referred to Dr. Lang’s nationality and lack of American credentials during his closing argument.', '- 14 - justice issued an instruction to the jury clarifying that: (1) the purpose of the testimony relating to exhibits A-C was to impeach the doctor’s testimony regarding his qualifications; and (2) as trial justice, it was his decision whether Dr. Lang had the necessary qualifications to testify as an expert. Doctor Pensa and NEP argue that this limiting instruction, although given in the context of testimony regarding a fourth exhibit (exhibit D, a document not challenged on appeal), was “sufficient to obviate any perceived prejudice as to the other challenged exhibits, which also addressed [Dr. Lang’s] qualification[s] to testify as an expert.” The plaintiff replies that the trial justice’s cautionary instruction applied to exhibit D only and that it did not serve to “reduce the impact these three inadmissible, hearsay documents had on the jury’s deliberations.”', 'After exhibits A-C were admitted in full, Dr. Pensa and NEP’s counsel questioned Dr. Lang about exhibit D, which purported to contain guidelines set forth by the American College of Emergency Physicians as to how its members may qualify to serve as expert witnesses in the area of emergency medicine. At the conclusion of the discussion regarding exhibit D, the trial justice directed the following instruction to the jury:', '“Ladies and gentlemen, I just should say that the purpose of that', 'line of questioning was to try to impeach the doctor’s testimony as', 'far as his qualifications, specifically, his affiliation with the journal', '-- the American Annals or the Annals of Emergency Medicine', 'which is a publication of this particular organization. It’s not to', 'say what qualifies an expert, particularly in this particular case to', 'testify -- a physician to testify as an expert in the area of', 'emergency medicine. That’s my call. They don’t get to decide', 'that just because they say this is what you should be to testify.', 'That doesn’t mean that it’s binding on me. So it’s simply offered', 'for that limited purpose and I should let you know that.” We agree with plaintiff that this instruction pertained only to exhibit D. However, even if the jurors considered the instruction in light of the entire voir dire cross-examination, the weight that', '- 15 - they ultimately gave to Dr. Lang’s testimony may nevertheless have been overly influenced by the improperly admitted evidence.', 'In Marley v. Providence Journal Co., 86 R.I. 229, 238, 134 A.2d 180, 184 (1957), we stated that “not every admission of improper evidence entitles an adverse party to a new trial * * * [b]ut if it appears that the evidence objected to was material, in the sense that it probably influenced the verdict, the verdict should be set aside.” We have also explained:', '“No rule of thumb will provide us with the answer, and there is no', 'bench mark against which possible prejudicial effect may be', 'measured. Instead, prejudicial effect, if it exists, must be found in', 'an examination of the substance of the evidence and of the facts', 'attendant upon its admission, and in an evaluation of its probable', 'effect upon the outcome of the case.” Heuser v. Goldstein, 107 R.I.', '317, 322, 267 A.2d 420, 422 (1970). The ultimate test is “whether [the improperly admitted evidence] reasonably tended to exert an influence upon the determination of the real issue in the case.” Bailey v. Huling, 119 R.I. 250, 255, 377 A.2d 220, 223 (1977) (quoting Heuser, 107 R.I. at 321, 267 A.2d at 422).', 'The trial in this case lasted three weeks and the record spans fifteen volumes of transcripts. The plaintiff offered only one expert witness to testify regarding the standard of care and Dr. Pensa’s alleged breach of that standard.', 'The defendants vigorously attacked that expert’s qualifications and credibility, both in questioning their own expert and when making their final effort to persuade the jury during their closing argument. We agree with plaintiff that a medical expert plays a “pivotal role” with respect to meeting the burden of proof in a medical malpractice case. The weight to be ascribed to Dr. Lang’s testimony was the central issue in this case because the entire cause of action hinged on whether the jury found that the treatment provided to plaintiff by Dr. Pensa met the standard of care. As defendants accurately state, however, the evidence elicited from exhibits A-C was merely cumulative of information that was', '- 16 - already on the record through the testimony of Dr. Lang. Prior to the introduction of the exhibits, Dr. Lang had already acknowledged that he was not board-certified in the United States, that he had never sought to be board-certified in the United States, and that he did not know whether he was eligible to be board-certified in the United States.', 'The plaintiff contends, however, that not only was the admission of exhibits A-C sufficiently prejudicial on its own to warrant a new trial, but that the extent to which these three documents prejudiced her case was exacerbated by the improper wording of question one on the jury verdict form. The plaintiff proposed the following language for the first question: “Do you find by a fair preponderance of the evidence that Defendant Gita S. Pensa, M.D. was negligent in her care and treatment of Jennifer O’Connor at Newport Hospital on June 26, 2006?” The trial justice, however, phrased the question in a manner that was substantially similar to the question proposed by defendants:', '“Did the Plaintiff, Jennifer O’Connor, prove by a preponderance of', 'the evidence that the Defendant, Gita S. Pensa, M.D., breached the', 'standard of care for an emergency medicine physician practicing in', 'the United States at a community hospital on June 26, 2006 in her', 'care and treatment of Jennifer O’Connor?” The plaintiff objected to the wording of this question; she contends that it was biased and incorrect, and “reinforced the crux of [defendants’] criticism of Dr. Lang and the import of the three improperly admitted documents.”', 'Doctor Pensa and NEP argue that any issue regarding the phrasing of the question may not be properly preserved for appeal because the record shows that plaintiff agreed to the question after discussions off the record with the trial justice. A review of the record reveals that, towards the end of the jury instructions and after the trial justice had read the verdict form to the jury, the trial justice held a sidebar conference with counsel on the record. Most of the', '- 17 - sidebar discussion is not pertinent to the issues on appeal, but plaintiff’s counsel did begin the discussion with the following:', '“[Y]our Honor, just briefly under Question 1, the phrase practicing', 'in the United States in a community hospital, the question is', 'whether she breached obviously the national standard of care but', 'the practicing, United States, community hospital incorporates the', 'defendant’s argument under the second question of the jury verdict', 'form.” The plaintiff’s counsel then proceeded to discuss his issues with questions two through four of the verdict form. The trial justice responded with: “Well, frankly, I thought we discussed Question 1 which I thought we were in agreement on.” It is our opinion that plaintiff’s comment regarding question one during the sidebar conference was sufficient to preserve her objection for our review.', 'The defendants contend that the verdict form question was appropriate because it reflected this Court’s adoption of a national standard of care in Sheeley v. Memorial Hospital, 710 A.2d 161 (R.I. 1998). In Sheeley, we rejected the “similar locality” rule in favor of a national standard for expert witnesses in cases of medical malpractice. Id. at 166, 167. The trial justice in Sheeley had excluded the testimony of a board-certified obstetrician from New York whose expert testimony was offered regarding the standard of care for a second-year family- practice resident in Rhode Island—testimony that was potentially inappropriate under the “similar locality” rule. Id. at 163, 164. Although defendants are correct that Sheeley heralded our adoption of a national standard of care, they overlook the fact that Sheeley also liberalized our view of expert testimony considerably. In adopting the more liberal standard, this Court stated that “whatever geographical impediments may previously have justified the need for a ‘similar locality’ analysis are no longer applicable in view of the present-day realities of the', '- 18 - medical profession.” Id. at 166. This Court then went on to quote a Maryland decision that explained why the similar locality rule was outdated:', '“[T]he medical schools of yesterday could not possibly compare', 'with the accredited institutions of today, many of which are', 'associated with teaching hospitals. But the contrast merely begins', 'at that point in the medical career: vastly superior postgraduate', 'training, the dynamic impact of modern communications and', 'transportation, the proliferation of medical literature, frequent', 'seminars and conferences on a variety of professional subjects, and', 'the growing availability of modern clinical facilities are but some', 'of the developments in the medical profession which combine to', 'produce contemporary standards that are not only much higher', 'than they were just a few short years ago, but are also national in', 'scope.” Id. (quoting Shilkret v. Annapolis Emergency Hospital', 'Association, 349 A.2d 245, 252 (Md. 1975)).', 'The plaintiff ascribes error to the following language in the jury verdict form: “practicing in the United States at a community hospital.” With respect to the phrase “at a community hospital,” she argues that the “language is nearly identical to language that was disapproved by this Court in Carlson v. Gillie, 723 A.2d 801, 802 (R.I. 1998) [(mem.)] and in [Sheeley, 710 A.2d at 166-67].” The offending language in Carlson was a statement by the trial justice that “[t]he standard is a community standard. The community is Westerly. The community in which Dr. Gillie practices in Westerly [sic].” Carlson, 723 A.2d at 802. It is our opinion, however, that such language is fundamentally different from the jury verdict form in the case under review. The mere reference to a “community hospital” does not evoke the “same or similar locality standard” that we rejected in Sheeley and Carlson. See id.; Sheeley, 710 A.2d at 166-67. Moreover, it can hardly be argued that the phrase “practicing in the United States” does not reflect a national standard.', 'Nevertheless, while the language in the first question on the jury verdict form might pass muster in another medical malpractice case, we must, however, assess its potential prejudice in', '- 19 - light of the circumstances of this case. In so doing, we conclude that the jury verdict form highlighted information contained in exhibits A-C and contributed to the prejudicial effect of those erroneously admitted documents. The phrase “practicing in the United States” certainly draws attention to the fact that Dr. Lang was not board-certified in the United States. We are mindful that, even though Dr. Lang testified that he was not board-certified and was uncertain about his eligibility, it was the email and two web pages, introduced as full exhibits, that were available to the jury during its deliberations. We conclude, therefore, that these improperly admitted documents probably influenced the jury’s verdict. See Marley, 86 R.I. at 238, 134 A.2d at 184.', 'Considering all three exhibits admitted in error and the wording of question one on the verdict form, there is, in our opinion, sufficient prejudice to warrant a new trial. The improperly admitted documents could reasonably have influenced the jury’s determination of the central issue in this case, and the jury could have been misled into lending more weight to Dr. Lang’s nationality than appropriate, resulting in prejudice to the plaintiff. See Bailey, 119 R.I. at 255, 377 A.2d at 223; Heuser, 107 R.I. at 321, 267 A.2d at 422. We hold that the improper admission of the three exhibits “ha[d] a natural tendency to affect the fairmindedness of the jury,” resulting in a prejudicial error that “only a new trial can cure.” Bruyere v. Castellucci, 98 R.I. 129, 138, 200 A.2d 226, 231 (1964).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand this case for a new trial. The record of this case shall be returned to the Superior Court.', '- 20 -', 'Justice Indeglia, dissenting. While I agree with my colleagues in the majority that the three documents 1 introduced into evidence may have been improperly admitted, I remain convinced that they were cumulative in nature and any error in their admission, at most, was harmless. See Now Courier, LLC v. Better Carrier Corp., 965 A.2d 429, 435 (R.I. 2009) (noting that the admission of otherwise inadmissible evidence “is harmless when the record demonstrates that it is merely cumulative of proper evidence”); Flanagan v. Wesselhoeft, 765 A.2d 1203, 1210 (R.I. 2001) (holding that “the use of unauthenticated excerpts from medical treatises and/or articles did not constitute prejudicial error in light of the totality of the evidence presented”); Maynard v. Rhode Island Hospital, 536 A.2d 532, 534 (R.I. 1988) (stating that any error in admission of evidence was “harmless” because complaining party “had already admitted” similar facts).', 'The plaintiff contends that the emphasis of these documents so prejudiced Dr. Lang with the jury that it could not fairly evaluate his testimony and ultimately her case. Still, it was plaintiff who opened the gate to this information when she agreed to conduct Dr. Lang’s voir dire examination before the jury to determine his qualifications as an emergency medicine expert. 2', 'During plaintiff’s direct examination or without objection on cross-examination, Dr. Lang revealed much of the information found in the documents. He told the jury (1) he was not 1', 'It is worth noting that plaintiff and the majority place dispositive significance on the impact of these three documents, yet plaintiff herself failed to ensure that certified copies of these documents were made part of the record on appeal notwithstanding the requirements of Article I, Rule 10 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure. 2', 'At oral argument, plaintiff contended that she was faced with a Hobson’s choice of employing this mechanism or being unable to have Dr. Lang complete his testimony before returning to Canada.', '- 21 - board-certified in emergency medicine in the United States, (2) he was not licensed to practice medicine in the United States, and (3) he never worked in the United States as a physician. Nothing in these exhibits changed those facts, especially in light of the trial justice’s caution to the jury, again without objection, that the trial justice makes the determination as to the expertise of witnesses and then, shortly thereafter, instructed the jury that he found Dr. Lang qualified as an expert in the field of emergency medicine both as to the standard of care and causation. Nor can plaintiff argue that this information was a surprise. As made clear at oral argument, the documents were appended to defendants’ motion in limine to preclude Dr. Lang’s testimony heard eight days before the start of trial. At the completion of testimony, the trial justice further instructed, without additional objection, as to the jury’s consideration of expert witnesses.', 'After three weeks of trial, the jury then deliberated “for about one half (1/2) hour” before returning a verdict for defendants. Besides the three documents, they were able to consider other exhibits including Dr. Lang’s impressive forty-four page curriculum vitae as well as the testimony of witnesses.', 'Despite the instruction of the trial justice declaring Dr. Lang’s expertise, his timely and balanced cautionary instruction at the voir dire hearing, and, in my view, his accurate final expert instruction, the majority suggests that the jury plucked out these three single-spaced documents to eviscerate the plaintiff’s case.

40,": Atwood Health Properties, LLC v. : Calson Construction Company : v. : Gem Plumbing & Heating Co., Inc. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'The defendant, Calson Construction Company (Calson), and the third-party defendant, Gem Plumbing & Heating Co., Inc. (GEM), (collectively, defendants), appeal a Superior Court order confirming an arbitration award in favor of the plaintiff, Atwood Health Properties, LLC (Atwood or plaintiff). This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After hearing the arguments of the parties and examining the record and memoranda that were filed in this case, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we summarily affirm the order confirming the arbitration award.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In December 1999, Atwood contracted with Calson to construct a three-story medical office building in Johnston, Rhode Island. Calson engaged GEM, as a subcontractor, to design and install a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in accordance with', '-1- specifications provided by the project architect, Robinson Baretta Corporation (RBC). The project was completed in January of 2001, and Calson issued a one-year warranty, as required by its contract with Atwood. Thereafter, Atwood experienced compressor failures at the newly constructed facility. 1 For several years, the manufacturer replaced the compressors under its warranty with GEM. However, in 2005, the manufacturer refused to provide more replacement compressors, and the compressors continued to improperly function.', 'On January 23, 2006, Atwood sold the building to Atwood Medical Properties, LLC (AMP). However, after the compressors in the HVAC system continued to fail, AMP filed suit against Atwood, alleging that Atwood had misrepresented the condition of the HVAC system. Atwood agreed to pay for a new HVAC system and, in turn, initiated arbitration proceedings against Calson to recover the cost of the new HVAC system. Calson consequently initiated a separate arbitration proceeding against GEM, for indemnification in accordance with its contract with GEM. The two proceedings subsequently were consolidated. 2', 'The arbitration proceeding included not only witness testimony but also more than 500 pages of exhibits. The arbitrator issued an “Interim Award of Arbitrator[,]” which was later affirmed and incorporated in a “Final Award of Arbitrator” (arbitration award). The arbitration award declared that Calson breached its contract with Atwood, “in that it designed and built, through subcontractor GEM, an HVAC system that experienced repeated compressor failures[.]” The arbitration award also found that “GEM breached its contract with Calson in that it designed 1', 'All the compressors that failed had been installed by GEM. 2', 'A hearing was held in Superior Court, on February 12, 2013, to determine whether or not the two proceedings had been merged or consolidated; however, the trial justice declined to make a ruling. Because the question of whether or not the cases were merged or consolidated has no bearing on our decision in this case, we decline to address it. What is clear is that we are confronted with a single arbitration award.', '-2- and built the defective system.” Accordingly, the arbitrator concluded that Calson should pay Atwood $358,223.42 on or before August 1, 2012 and that GEM should pay Calson that same amount on or before July 20, 2012. 3', 'On August 15, 2012, Atwood filed a motion in Providence County Superior Court to confirm the arbitration award. In response to Atwood’s motion, GEM moved to vacate or modify the arbitration award. Thereafter, Calson also filed a motion to confirm the arbitration award. 4', 'On September 24, 2013, the trial justice issued a final judgment confirming the arbitration award and denying GEM’s motion to vacate or modify it. Calson and GEM timely appealed.', 'Standard of Review', '“Judicial review of arbitration awards is ‘statutorily prescribed and is limited in nature.’” Wheeler v. Encompass Insurance Co., 66 A.3d 477, 480 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Buttie v. Norfolk & Dedham Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 995 A.2d 546, 549 (R.I. 2010)). Grounds for vacating or modifying an arbitration award are found in the Arbitration Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 3 of title 10. Section 10-3-12 sets forth the narrow conditions pursuant to which an arbitration award must be vacated:', '“(1) Where the award was procured by corruption, fraud or', 'undue means.', '“(2) Where there was evident partiality or corruption on the', 'part of the arbitrators, or either of them. 3', 'The arbitration award also declared that “Calson [was] entitled to be reimbursed by GEM for attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $27,381.21” on or before July 20, 2012 and that interest was to be added onto all amounts if not paid by the date specified in the arbitration award. 4', 'Calson’s motion was titled “motion for clarification and for entry of order or in the alternative, to confirm the final arbitration award[.]”', '-3-', '“(3) Where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in', 'refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or', 'in hearing legally immaterial evidence, or refusing to hear', 'evidence pertinent and material to the controversy, or of any other', 'misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been', 'substantially prejudiced.', '“(4) Where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so', 'imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award', 'upon the subject matter submitted was not made.” Additionally, § 10-3-14 directs the courts to modify or correct an award under the following limited circumstances:', '“(a) * * *', '“(1) Where there was an evident material miscalculation of', 'figures, or an evident material mistake in the description of any', 'person, thing, or property referred to in the award.', '“(2) Where the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not', 'submitted to them, unless it is a matter not affecting the merits of', 'the decision upon the matters submitted.', '“(3) Where the award is imperfect in matter of form not', 'affecting the merits of the controversy.', '“(b) The order must modify and correct the award, so as to', 'effect the intent thereof and promote justice between the parties.”', '“Generally, arbitration awards cannot be vacated or modified for errors of law and may be disturbed only in narrow circumstances.” Wheeler, 66 A.3d at 481 (citing Aponik v. Lauricella, 844 A.2d 698, 703-04 (R.I. 2004)). “This Court will overturn an arbitration award ‘only if the award was irrational or if the arbitrator[ ] manifestly disregarded the law.’” Id. (quoting Aponik, 844 A.2d at 703). “We hasten to add, however, that in passing on an appeal from an order confirming or vacating an arbitration award, this Court is not without authority to ‘make such orders * * * as the rights of the parties and the ends of justice require.’” Id. (quoting § 10-3-19).', '-4-', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendants assert that the trial justice erred in confirming the arbitration award. Although Calson argues before this Court that the trial justice improperly confirmed the arbitration award, it failed to object to Atwood’s request for confirmation and, in fact, also requested that the Superior Court confirm the arbitration award. Thus, according to this Court’s “raise-or-waive” doctrine, we deem Calson’s appeal waived. 5', 'Turning to GEM’s appeal, GEM argues that the trial justice improperly confirmed the arbitration award, alleging that: (1) the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the contract and applicable law when he failed to make a finding of negligence before determining that GEM was in breach—a finding that GEM avows was required according to the indemnity clause in the contract with Calson; (2) the arbitrator’s reliance on the indemnification provision was in violation of G.L. 1956 § 6-34-1; (3) Atwood’s claims are time-barred; and (4) the calculation of damages was irrational. After a thorough review of the record, we are not persuaded by GEM’s contentions. Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s determination and confirm the arbitration award.', 'First, GEM asserts that the arbitrator irrationally invoked the indemnification provision. 6 An arbitrator’s award will not be overturned for mere errors of law. See Wheeler, 66 A.3d at 483. “In fact, ‘awards premised on “clearly erroneous” interpretations of [a] contract have been 5', 'See Berard v. HCP, Inc., 64 A.3d 1215, 1219 n.2 (R.I. 2013) (noting that the Court “shall ‘not review issues that were not presented to the trial court in such a posture as to alert the trial justice to the question being raised,’” quoting State v. Kluth, 46 A.3d 867, 876 (R.I. 2012)). 6', 'The indemnity provision in the subcontract agreement between Calson and GEM stated that GEM would indemnify Calson if GEM was negligent. Because the arbitrator found that GEM breached its contract with Calson, he did not make a finding as to GEM’s negligence; accordingly, GEM asserts that it was irrational for the arbitrator to find that it owed Calson damages without so doing.', '-5- affirmed where the result was rationally based upon the contract.’” Purvis Systems, Inc. v. American Systems Corp., 788 A.2d 1112, 1117-18 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Jacinto v. Egan, 120 R.I. 907, 912, 391 A.2d 1173, 1176 (1978)). Here, the arbitrator determined that GEM was obligated to pay Calson damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs, pursuant to Section 5.1 of their agreement— the indemnity clause. We agree with GEM that the arbitrator’s reliance on this provision is erroneous because the indemnity clause is designed to protect Calson from negligent acts by GEM and its agents and does not embrace negligent performance of the contract. This error, however, does not affect the award in this case. Although the arbitrator may have erred in relying on the indemnification clause of the contract when declaring that GEM pay damages to Calson, this is not a manifest disregard of the contract and is an insufficient basis to overturn the arbitration award. In order to find GEM responsible for damages to Calson, the arbitrator did not need to resort to the indemnity clause because other sections of the agreement support his determination, including Article 3, section 3.1, which provides in relevant part that:', '“[GEM is obligated to] take down and/or rebuild all portions of the', 'Work which the Architect, Owner, or Contractor shall * * *', 'condemn as unsound or improper, or as in any way failing to', 'conform to the Contract Documents.” Section 3.17 provides in pertinent part:', '“[GEM] guarant[eed] its Work and, without limiting the foregoing,', 'agrees to make good, at no cost to [Calson] or the Owner, any and', 'all defects due to nonconformity or imperfect workmanship or', 'material; and [GEM] shall pay for any damages resulting', 'therefrom, including any for which [Calson] may be liable under', 'the Contract Documents or by law.” In this case, the findings of the arbitrator that the HVAC system improperly was installed fall within this provision of the contract. We are satisfied that the arbitrator’s decision “‘draws its essence’ from the contract and is sufficiently ‘grounded in the contract’ to be within the scope of', '-6- his authority.” Jacinto, 120 R.I. at 913-14, 391 A.2d at 1176 (quoting United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO v. United States Gypsum Co., 492 F.2d 713, 731, 732 (5th Cir. 1974)).', 'Next, GEM asserts that the arbitrator’s reliance on the indemnification provision was in violation of § 6-34-1 and constituted a manifest disregard for the law. 7 The record does not support GEM’s contention that the arbitrator manifestly disregarded the law. A “review of an arbitration award does not permit ‘judicial re-examination’ of the relevant contractual language.” Berkshire Wilton Partners, LLC v. Bilray Demolition Co., 91 A.3d 830, 837 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Jacinto, 120 R.I. at 912, 391 A.2d at 1175). “Only when the arbitrator’s decision rises above the high-water marks of implausibility, irrationality, manifest disregard, or failure to draw its essence from the agreement may a court intervene and strike it down.” Id. at 838. Section 3.17 of the agreement between GEM and Calson provided that GEM was required to deliver workmanship that was “first-class quality, free from faults and defects and in conformance with the Contract Documents.” Also, GEM agreed,', '“to make good, at no cost to the Contractor or the Owner, any and', 'all defects due to nonconformity or imperfect workmanship or', 'material; and [GEM] shall pay for any damages resulting', 'therefrom, including any for which the Contractor may be liable', 'under the Contract Documents or by law.” The arbitrator determined that GEM breached its agreement with Calson and, therefore, was liable for the corrective work performed on the HVAC system.', 'Although the arbitrator’s reliance on the indemnity clause may have been erroneous, we are of the opinion that the arbitrator’s interpretation of the agreement was plausible and rational and did not manifestly disregard the law. 7', 'General Laws 1956 § 6-34-1 provides that a subcontractor cannot be required to indemnify a general contractor for the general contractor’s own negligence and that any indemnification agreement to the effect is void.', '-7-', 'GEM also argues that Atwood’s claims against Calson are time-barred and that, therefore, Calson’s claims against GEM also are time-barred. According to GEM, Atwood failed to challenge Calson’s work within the time limit specified in its contract with Calson. However, Calson failed to raise this argument in Superior Court and is precluded from doing so here. See Berard v. HCP, Inc., 64 A.3d 1215, 1219 n.2 (R.I. 2013). GEM also is precluded from asserting that Atwood’s claims are time-barred under the Atwood-Calson contract because GEM was not a party to that contract.', 'Lastly, GEM contends that the arbitration award was irrational, as the arbitrator miscalculated the amount of damages and failed to support his calculations by reference to the record.', '“This Court has held that unless provided otherwise, ‘arbitrators of a commercial dispute, like a jury, are under no obligation to set out the reasons for their award or the findings of fact or conclusions of law on which that award is premised.’” Purvis Systems, Inc., 788 A.2d at 1118 (quoting Westminster Construction Corp. v. PPG Industries, Inc., 119 R.I. 205, 209, 376 A.2d 708, 710 (1977)). In this case, the damages awarded appear to be rationally related to the costs incurred in investigating and correcting the defective HVAC system.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons articulated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

Pursuant to the “Honorable Service Ordinance” (HSO), Chapter 17, Article VI, § 17-189.1 of the City of Providence Code of Ordinances (as enacted in 1999), 1 the board voted to reduce Corrente’s pension benefits and filed a miscellaneous petition in the 1', 'The HSO was enacted in 1999 and amended in 2011.

The intervenors appealed the order of the Superior Court confirming the board’s decision, and the board cross-appealed the trial justice’s decision granting the intervenors’ motion to intervene.

Corrente was sentenced to serve fifty- six months in prison.', 'On October 23, 2002, the board voted to suspend Corrente’s pension benefits, subject to a hearing as to whether his pension should be permanently reduced or revoked.', 'The board appointed Larry J.

On November 2, 2006, Corrente was discharged from prison; thereafter, on December 27, 2007, a hearing was conducted pursuant to the HSO, § 17-189.1(a)(5).', 'Following the hearing, Prof. Ritchie issued a written report and recommendation to the board. The hearing officer found that all the crimes Corrente committed took place during the second period of his employment. He recommended that the board reduce Corrente’s pension by revoking that portion of the benefit that was earned during the second period of employment, leaving the portion based on the first term of employment intact. Further, the hearing officer recommended that the board return the contributions that Corrente had made to the pension during the second period of employment. On August 13, 2008, the board voted to adopt the hearing officer’s recommendations.', 'In accordance with § 17-189.1(a)(5), the board then filed a civil action in Superior Court to confirm its decision to reduce Corrente’s pension. The action was styled as a miscellaneous petition, with Corrente named as the respondent.', 'Corrente filed an answer to the board’s', '-3- miscellaneous petition, in which he also requested that the court confirm the board’s decision. 4 On January 29, 2009, the mayor filed a motion to intervene as a matter of right pursuant to Rule 24(a), arguing that the interests of the mayor and the city were not adequately represented in the action. After a hearing on March 13, 2009, the trial justice granted the motion to intervene.', 'Shortly thereafter, the trial justice ordered that five related cases, including the board’s case against Corrente, be consolidated 5 for purposes of addressing three common legal issues of first impression regarding the HSO: (1) whether a criminal conviction was needed before the board was authorized to take action to revoke or reduce municipal pensions pursuant to the HSO; (2) whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction to review civil actions filed by the board pursuant to the HSO; and (3) what was the appropriate standard of review to apply when reviewing civil actions filed by the board pursuant to the HSO. In September 2009, the trial justice issued a decision regarding these issues, finding that: (1) a criminal conviction was not a prerequisite to board action under the HSO; (2) the Superior Court had jurisdiction over civil actions filed by the board pursuant to the HSO under its general equity powers and its declaratory judgment powers; and (3) the appropriate standard of review was the standard used for administrative appeals, as set forth in the Administrative Procedures Act, G.L. 1956 § 42-35-15. 4', 'Corrente also asserted a counterclaim against the board, in which he referred to the recommendation of the hearing officer that he receive a lump-sum payment for amounts due for the period during which his benefits were suspended, as well as the recommendation that all taxes paid to the City of Providence by him be credited or deducted from any amounts owed by him to the city. He also requested that he not be required to pay back to the city benefits already paid to him between the date of his second retirement and the date when his benefits were suspended. 5', 'The consolidated cases included Retirement Board v. Anthony E. Annarino, C.A. No. 02-5196, Retirement Board v. Urbano Prignano, Jr., C.A. 08-5442, Retirement Board v. Kathleen Parsons, C.A. No. 07-2175, Retirement Board v. Frank E. Corrente, C.A. No. 08-6508, and John J. Ryan v. City of Providence, C.A. No. 08-7268. The cases involving Annarino, Prignano, Parsons, and Corrente were brought by the board pursuant to the Honorable Service Ordinance (HSO). The case involving Ryan was a declaratory-judgment action, brought by Ryan, regarding his status under the HSO.', '-4-', 'John Ryan, a plaintiff in one of the consolidated cases, appealed to this Court. See Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 70 (R.I. 2011). Ryan had filed a declaratory-judgment action against the board to determine his rights under the HSO and had not been convicted of any crimes related to his employment. Id. at 69. On appeal, this Court held that a criminal conviction was a prerequisite to board action under the HSO. Id. at 76. Because the disposition of that suit completely resolved Ryan’s case, this Court did not reach the issues of jurisdiction and standard of review. Id.', 'Following our decision in Ryan, the board filed a motion for summary judgment in the Superior Court. The intervenors opposed the motion and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. A hearing was held on June 23, 2011 and, thereafter, the trial justice issued a written decision denying the intervenors’ motion for summary judgment and granting summary judgment to the board, confirming its decision to reduce Corrente’s pension. 6 Judgment was entered on October 18, 2011; the intervenors filed a timely appeal, and the board then filed a timely cross-appeal of the order granting the motion to intervene. 7 Corrente did not file an appeal; consequently, he is not a party before this Court.', 'On April 3, 2014, this Court issued an order directing the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the threshold issue of whether the Superior Court was properly vested with subject-matter jurisdiction over this case. 8 After we issued this order, the General Assembly 6', 'As to Corrente’s counterclaim, the court elected to not alter the board’s rulings, but also found that “the matter should be returned to the [board] for a proper determination as to the tax credit recommended by Professor Ritchie.” 7', 'Although a bench decision on the motion to intervene was issued on March 13, 2009, the order granting that motion was not entered until November 28, 2011.

Because the Superior Court “is statutory in its origin,” its powers “are defined by statute and cannot be extended by judicial interpretation.” Boss v. Sprague, 53 R.I. 1, 3, 162 A. 710, 711 (1932).', 'In the instant case, the board filed its miscellaneous petition pursuant to § 17-189.1(a)(5), a city ordinance, which provides:', '“Whenever any employee is convicted of or pleads guilty or nolo', 'contendere to any crime related to his or her public employment,', 'the retirement board shall conduct a meeting, with the employee', 'having the opportunity to be heard, to determine if a', 'recommendation of revocation or reduction of any retirement', 'allowance or annuity or other benefit or payment to which the', 'employee is otherwise entitled to under this chapter is warranted.', 'If the retirement board determines that revocation or reduction of', 'any retirement allowance or annuity or other benefit or payment to', 'which the employee is otherwise entitled to under this chapter is', 'warranted, the retirement board shall initiate a civil action in the', 'superior court for the revocation or reduction of any retirement', 'allowance or annuity or other benefit or payment to which the', 'employee is otherwise entitled to under [this chapter].” Section 17-', '189.1(a)(5) (as enacted 1999) (emphasis added). The HSO, a municipal ordinance, could not confer jurisdiction on the Superior Court for the “civil action” that the board was required to file in order to effectuate the reduction of Corrente’s pension. See Advisory Opinion to the Governor, 437 A.2d 542, 543 (R.I. 1981); Higgins v. Tax Assessors of Pawtucket, 27 R.I. 401, 403-04, 63 A. 34, 35 (1905). Accordingly, if the Superior Court had jurisdiction over this action, the jurisdiction must have originated from a source other than the ordinance itself.', '-7-', 'In his 2009 decision regarding common legal issues of first impression, the trial justice found that the Superior Court had subject-matter jurisdiction over the board’s miscellaneous petition pursuant to its general equity powers and its authority to issue declaratory judgments. In their supplemental briefs, the board and the intervenors are in agreement that the Superior Court had jurisdiction over this case; in support of this contention, the parties present essentially identical arguments. First, they contend that the court was vested with jurisdiction pursuant to the newly enacted statute, § 36-10.1-5, because that statute applies to all “pending proceedings under any municipal ordinance.” As an alternative, they mirror the trial justice’s findings that the court had jurisdiction pursuant to its equity and declaratory-judgment powers. We shall address each of these potential avenues for jurisdiction in turn.', 'A', 'Equity and Declaratory-Judgment Jurisdiction', 'General Laws 1956 § 8-2-13 provides: “The superior court shall, except as otherwise provided by law, have exclusive original jurisdiction of suits and proceedings of an equitable character and of statutory proceedings following the course of equity * * * .”', 'We have previously held that the Superior Court “is a court of general equitable jurisdiction * * * ; although its jurisdiction is not limitless, the Superior Court possesses, as a matter of fundamental judicial power, the jurisdiction to hear and confront the merits of any case wherein the power of determination has not been specifically conferred upon another tribunal.” La Petite Auberge, Inc. v. Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, 419 A.2d 274, 279 (R.I. 1980). While the Superior Court’s jurisdiction over matters of equity is broad, a litigant must seek or be entitled to some form of recognized equitable relief in order to invoke this jurisdiction. See Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 318-19 (1999); Martin', '-8- v. James B. Berry Sons’ Co., 83 F.2d 857, 859 (1st Cir. 1936); see also John Norton Pomeroy, 1 Equity Jurisprudence § 62 at 82-83 (5th ed. 1941) (“a court of equity will not, unless perhaps in some very exceptional case, assume jurisdiction over a controversy the facts of which do not bring it within some general principle * * * of the equitable jurisprudence”).', 'In his 2009 decision, the trial justice stated that the Superior Court had historically “exercised its broad general equity jurisdiction over municipal pension disputes,” and found that the enactment of Providence’s Home Rule Charter, the creation of the retirement board, and the enactment of the HSO did not divest the court of this “previously existing” jurisdiction. We do not deny that the Superior Court has previously adjudicated municipal pension disputes pursuant to its equity jurisdiction; however, we are unaware of any such case that was not brought by an aggrieved plaintiff seeking a traditional equitable remedy or declaratory relief. See, e.g., Trice v. City of Cranston, 110 R.I. 724, 725-26, 297 A.2d 649, 650 (1972) (declaratory-judgment action brought by city firefighters regarding their entitlement to reduction in eligibility time required for longevity pensions); Marro v. General Treasurer of Cranston, 108 R.I. 192, 193, 273 A.2d 660, 661 (1971) (petition for writ of mandamus brought by a city police lieutenant regarding the amount of his pension following involuntary retirement); Beebe v. Fitzgerald, 106 R.I. 650, 651- 52, 262 A.2d 625, 626 (1970) (city police officer challenging the amount of his pension award following retirement pursuant to statutory scheme). In our opinion, it was not the classification of “municipal pension disputes” that vested the Superior Court with jurisdiction in these cases. Rather, these were cases brought by plaintiffs seeking known equitable remedies; the actions merely happened to have in common that each dispute involved an employee’s rights regarding his or her pension benefits.', '-9-', 'Here, in contrast, we are presented with an entirely unique procedural posture. In its miscellaneous petition, the board did not seek an injunction or any other variety of known equitable relief; it merely requested that the court “enter an order confirming the August 13, 2008 Decision of the Retirement Board.” Furthermore, the miscellaneous petition was brought by the board—not Corrente—pursuant to the explicit mandate in § 17-189.1(a)(5), in order for the board to effectuate its own decision to reduce Corrente’s pension. The board was not an aggrieved party in this situation, asking the court to use its equitable powers to right a wrong; rather, it was taking the affirmative action of reducing Corrente’s pension, on the basis of dishonorable service, in the manner specifically prescribed by the Providence City Council. Thus, while this action does involve a municipal pension, it is distinguishable from previous cases in which the Superior Court has adjudicated pension disputes pursuant to its general equity jurisdiction. Although the principles of equity are flexible by nature, we cannot say that this miscellaneous petition—clearly brought pursuant to the HSO and not seeking an equitable remedy—properly invoked the court’s equity jurisdiction.', 'Regarding declaratory-judgment jurisdiction, the trial justice found that, because the HSO was “silent on the issue of judicial review,” the Superior Court had subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, G.L. 1956 § 9-30-2, 9 to “adjudicate matters relating to the rights, status, or other legal relations of any person that may be affected by a particular statute or municipal ordinance.”', 'However, the board was clearly not seeking 9', 'General Laws 1956 § 9-30-2 provides:', '“Any person interested under a deed, will, written contract,', 'or other writings constituting a contract, or whose rights, status, or', 'other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance,', 'contract, or franchise, may have determined any question of', 'construction or validity arising under the instrument, statute,', 'ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights,', 'status, or other legal relations thereunder.”', '- 10 - declaratory relief. The board did not bring suit in Superior Court in order to determine its rights under the HSO; it brought suit to confirm its decision to reduce Corrente’s pension, as specifically provided by the terms of the HSO.', 'Thus, we are of the opinion that this matter did not properly invoke either the equity jurisdiction or declaratory-judgment jurisdiction of the Superior Court. The petition was brought pursuant to the HSO, in order to obtain the specific relief required by the language of that ordinance. Whether the drafters of the HSO considered the issue of jurisdiction when creating the civil action requirement, we do not know. What is clear is that in our opinion, the language of the ordinance, and the board’s corresponding action in this case, cannot fairly be construed as a prayer for equitable relief or a request for declaratory judgment. We decline to interpret the board’s action as something that it was not. 10', 'B', 'General Laws 1956 § 36-10.1-5', 'The newly minted § 36-10.1-5, titled “Municipal employee pension revocation and reduction,” became effective on July 8, 2014, just three months after the issuance of this Court’s order directing the parties in this case to address the question of subject-matter jurisdiction. This 10', 'The Superior Court also has general jurisdiction of actions at law, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 8-2- 14, which provides in part:', '“(a) The superior court * * * shall have exclusive original', 'jurisdiction of all * * * actions at law in which the amount in', 'controversy shall exceed the sum of ten thousand dollars', '($10,000); and shall also have concurrent original jurisdiction with', 'the district court in all other actions at law in which the amount in', 'controversy exceeds the sum of five thousand dollars ($5,000) and', 'does not exceed ten thousand dollars ($10,000) * * * .” Here, the board was not seeking damages from Corrente, and it did not state a legal cause of action in its miscellaneous petition. None of the parties in the instant case, nor the trial justice, have suggested that the court had jurisdiction over the board’s miscellaneous petition pursuant to § 8-2-14. We agree that this statute did not confer jurisdiction over this case.', '- 11 - statute, which adds yet another layer of uniqueness to the sui generis posture of this action, provides in full: “The superior court shall have jurisdiction to review any decisions, appeals or other proceedings initiated pursuant to any municipal ordinance providing for the revocation or reduction of the pension of any municipal employee for circumstances constituting dishonorable service as defined by municipal ordinances.” Section 36-10.1-5. Additionally, the public laws enacting this statute provide that “[t]his act shall take effect upon passage and shall apply to all pending proceedings under any municipal ordinance as provided herein.” P.L. 2014, ch. 497, § 2; P.L. 2014, ch. 526, § 2. This new statute undoubtedly confers jurisdiction on the Superior Court for all future cases brought pursuant to the HSO; the pertinent question at the present time, however, is whether—and in what manner—the statute applies to the case currently before us on appeal.', 'In their supplemental briefs submitted to this Court on the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction, both the board and the intervenors argue that, because the new statute applies to “all pending proceedings,” and because the case is currently pending before this Court, the statute solves the problem of whether the Superior Court had subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the board’s miscellaneous petition. Unfortunately, the parties’ rationale in this regard overlooks a crucial fact. Namely, the Superior Court issued its final judgment in this case on October 18, 2011, whereas the new statute did not become effective until July 8, 2014. 11', 'We have previously held that “[a]s a general rule a statute is presumed to operate prospectively and not retrospectively, unless it appears by clear, strong language or by necessary 11', 'Furthermore, the present appeals were docketed in this Court on April 2, 2012, and April 3, 2012, at which point this Court obtained sole jurisdiction of the matter from the Superior Court. See Article I, Rule 11(f) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure (“From the time of the docketing of an appeal in the Supreme Court, said Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to supervise the further course of such appeal * * * .”).', '- 12 - implication that the Legislature intended to give the statute retroactive force and effect.” State v. Healy, 122 R.I. 602, 606, 410 A.2d 432, 434 (1980). Here, the statutory language is silent on the issue of retroactivity, and the public law states that the act “shall take effect upon passage and shall apply to all pending proceedings.” P.L. 2014, ch. 497, § 2; P.L. 2014, ch. 526, § 2 (emphasis added). In our opinion, this language does not suggest intent to give the statute retroactive effect; rather, it states clearly that the statute was to become effective upon passage, which date was July 8, 2014.', 'Although we think it is clear that the Legislature did not intend § 36-10.1-5 to apply retroactively, it appears equally obvious that the language “all pending proceedings” was intended to encompass this particular case. We construe the General Assembly’s timing in enacting this statute—three months after our order regarding jurisdiction—to be more than coincidental. Moreover, Black’s Law Dictionary defines “pending” as “[r]emaining undecided; awaiting decision”; 12 applying this plain meaning, it is clear that the new statute applies to this case because, when the statute was passed on July 8, 2014, the case was awaiting decision by this Court. Thus, we are of the opinion that, although the statute confers jurisdiction to the Superior Court over this particular action, it does not remedy the fact that the Superior Court did not have jurisdiction when it adjudicated the matter and issued its final judgment in 2011.', 'Accordingly, because this case was brought pursuant to the HSO and was adjudicated in the Superior Court prior to the enactment of § 36-10.1-5, we are constrained to hold that the Superior Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction and that the final judgment is therefore void. We also hold, however, that the Superior Court has now been vested with jurisdiction over this case. Given the utterly unique posture of this action, we shall remand the matter to the Superior 12', 'Black’s Law Dictionary 1314 (10th ed. 2014).', '- 13 - Court, which now has jurisdiction pursuant to § 36-10.1-5.

In my judgment, there has existed at all relevant times a fully sufficient statutory basis for such jurisdiction.', 'It is my considered opinion that the Superior Court was vested with subject matter jurisdiction from the moment that the instant civil action was originally commenced; it was so vested by virtue of the general equity jurisdiction with which the Superior Court is endowed pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 8-2-13.

On May 30, 2012, at approximately 11:05 p.m., twenty-six-year-old Ralph Joseph was struck by a single bullet as he fled from a building located at 51 Salmon Street in the City of Providence. The bullet pierced his skull and caused his death two days later. The scene that unfolded before Joseph exited the building, as well as the events that led to this fateful occasion, are unclear. The evidence suggested a drug-deal-turned-murder, involving Joseph, Michael Tully (defendant), 1 Leshayna Owens, Ryan Rue, and at least one other unidentified individual. After a jury trial in Superior Court, the defendant was convicted of first-degree felony murder and conspiracy to commit robbery. He appeals from this verdict as well as from the denial of his motion for a new trial. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'In December 2012, a grand jury returned an indictment containing six felony charges against defendant: the murder of Ralph Joseph, in violation of G.L. 1956 §§ 11-23-1 and 11-23-2 1', 'The record of this case reveals that defendant was known by various aliases.

Owens, who was present during the shooting and was a mutual acquaintance of both defendant and Joseph, provided key portions of the narrative regarding defendant’s involvement in Joseph’s death.', 'Owens testified that she had met defendant approximately six or seven months before the date of the shooting. During this period of time, Owens would “[h]ang out” and “[s]moke marijuana” with defendant a few times per week, and she sometimes would see him around the neighborhood. This neighborhood was the “Manton” area of the City of Providence, which is near the Manton Housing Development, referred to as the “Manton projects.” Owens recalled that she had purchased marijuana from defendant “[t]wo or three times.”', 'She identified defendant at trial and described him as “[d]ark skin, shorter than [her, 3] [c]ross-eyed,” with a “[m]uscular, but skinny” build.', 'Owens testified that she had met Joseph at a party in late May 2012, approximately one week before the shooting.

This charge was described on the verdict form as “discharging a firearm during a crime of violence causing the death of Ralph Joseph.” Joseph was not a police officer. 3', 'Owens testified that she was six feet, three inches tall.', '-2- life; she sold him small amounts of marijuana, and they spent time smoking together. Joseph also introduced Owens to his friend Ryan Rue.', 'According to Owens, Joseph called her in the early afternoon of May 30, 2012 and asked her to purchase one pound of marijuana for him. Owens agreed to take Joseph to a location to make the purchase; and, in exchange, she would receive some of the marijuana and some money. Owens then made phone calls to various contacts who could potentially provide them with the marijuana. One of those contacts was defendant. Owens told defendant that she was looking for one pound of marijuana for an unidentified friend, and the two agreed to a price of $1,100. Later in the day, Owens informed Joseph of the arrangement, and then Joseph and Rue came to Owens’s house, where the three smoked marijuana before leaving to make the purchase from defendant. Records extracted from Owens’s cell phone indicated that, between 9:31 p.m. and 10:57 p.m., Owens made seven outgoing calls to defendant’s cell phone, and he called her three times. Owens testified that defendant arranged for the sale to take place in a building located on Salmon Street in the Manton projects, not far from where Owens lived.', 'The evidence in this case included surveillance video footage of a walkway behind 60 Fairfield Street, which was located a short distance from the building on Salmon Street where the sale was to take place. This video showed a man standing and walking on the walkway while speaking on a cell phone, at approximately 10:47 p.m. on May 30, 2012. The man was wearing a black hooded sweatshirt with the hood down, a black hat, and jeans. At trial, a patrolman of the Providence Police Department identified this man as defendant. After a few minutes, a second man entered the scene, wearing a black T-shirt and jeans. The two men then exited the right-hand side of the screen, in the direction of the building located at 60 Fairfield Street. A few minutes later, the two men re-entered the screen, this time both wearing dark sweatshirts; the', '-3- video showed them walking side by side through the camera’s vantage point and exiting to the top of the screen, in a direction leading to Salmon Street.', 'Shortly before 10:45 p.m., Owens, Joseph, and Rue drove in Rue’s silver BMW convertible to the area where defendant had instructed them to meet. They circled this area for a few minutes while looking for the correct building, which Owens thought was number 52 Salmon Street but turned out to be number 51. 4 After parking in front of 51 Salmon Street, the three waited for a few minutes in the car. Owens testified that she saw “about one or two guys” go inside the front door of the building, neither of whom she recognized. She then observed defendant standing in the doorway and holding up one finger, signaling that she and Joseph should wait before going inside. According to Owens, defendant was wearing jeans and a black hooded sweatshirt, with the hood pulled down, and his face was uncovered. 5 After signaling to Owens to wait, defendant went inside the building.', 'One or two minutes later, Owens saw a man put his head out of a window on the second floor of the building, and he waved at her with his hands and verbally instructed her to come upstairs. When asked at trial, Owens stated that she was unsure whether this person was defendant. 6 According to Rue, Owens was waiting for a phone call, and she and Joseph left the vehicle after receiving this call. Owens and Joseph then departed from Rue’s car and walked inside the building located at 51 Salmon Street. Surveillance video footage confirmed that two individuals entered through the front door of 51 Salmon Street at 11:05 p.m.; approximately 4', 'Surveillance video of an area outside 51 Salmon Street confirmed that a silver convertible drove by the building multiple times between 10:55 p.m. and 10:59 p.m. 5', 'Rue also testified that he saw a man in the doorway, whom he described as “black” and “wearing a doo rag,” with nothing covering his face. Surveillance video showed a figure in the doorway of 51 Salmon Street at 11:01 p.m., but the image was not clear enough to distinguish clothing or features. 6', 'When asked during the grand jury proceedings, Owens testified: “I can’t tell who it was, but I know it wasn’t [defendant].”', '-4- thirty seconds later, one of these individuals exited the building and fell, face first, to the sidewalk from a short flight of stairs outside the front door. An unidentifiable figure appeared briefly in the doorway as the injured person fell.', 'Owens was the only witness who testified at trial regarding the events that occurred inside 51 Salmon Street at 11:05 p.m. Thus, her testimony and her credibility were crucial pieces of the state’s case. Owens testified that, after she and Joseph entered the building, she heard a voice instructing them to come upstairs. 7 They walked up the stairs, Owens following Joseph; when Owens reached the landing at the top of the stairs, she was accosted by a man who pointed a gun at her. Owens described this man as “Spanish and chunky.” 8 Owens recalled that he was wearing a hooded sweatshirt with the hood pulled up, that he wore his hair in a ponytail, and that he wore a black mask that covered his face from nose to chin. Owens testified that, as she was being confronted, she saw Joseph turn around and run past her in the direction of the stairs, pursued by another man. Owens described the man chasing Joseph as “[b]lack,” with “dark skin,” “[s]kinny,” and shorter than herself.', 'He was wearing jeans, a black hooded sweatshirt with the hood pulled up, and a mask. Owens testified that she was “screaming frantically,” with her back against the wall at the top of the stairs, and the man holding her at gunpoint was standing in front of her, yelling “[s]hut the fuck up.”', 'Owens testified that, as this chaotic scene unfolded, she saw Joseph run past her, fall down the stairs, get up, and run out of the door from which they had entered the building. She saw the second man pursue Joseph down the stairs; and, when he reached the doorway, Owens heard him call out to Joseph, “[d]on’t run, don’t run.” Owens testified that she recognized this 7', 'The front entrance to 51 Salmon Street consisted of a short, outdoor stairway leading to a front door, directly inside of which was an indoor stairwell leading to the building’s second floor. 8', 'When asked to define “Spanish,” Owens replied, “Lighter than my complexion.”', '-5- voice as belonging to defendant. She further testified that she saw the man’s face from the eyes up 9 and became aware “that [she] knew him.” She also claimed that she recognized him from “[h]is body type” and “[t]he way he walked.” Seconds after hearing this man instruct Joseph not to run, Owens saw the man raise his arm, and she heard a gunshot. Owens recalled witnessing this event from the landing at the top of the stairs where she was being detained; she was looking to her right, down the stairs, at the shooter’s back.', 'Owens testified that, after the gunshot, the man holding her at gunpoint grabbed her purse from her hands and ran down the stairs, and the two men exited the building through a back door. Owens remained in place for “a minute or two” out of fear, and she then ran out of the building through the front door. Upon exiting the building, she saw Joseph on the ground outside of the doorway, “bleeding and coughing.” Owens testified that she gestured to Rue—who was still in the car—for help, “pointing to [Joseph] and pointing to [Rue].” 10 According to Owens, Rue did not respond; instead he drove slowly away. Owens then fled from the scene on foot, running through the projects to a nearby gas station. She called her brother as she escaped, and he picked her up at the gas station and took her home. 11 When asked at trial, Owens testified that she had not known, before arriving at 51 Salmon Street, that defendant and another man were going to rob Joseph and her, nor had she known that defendant would have a gun.', 'Rue, who waited in the car while Joseph and Owens went inside the building, testified that he saw Joseph exit the building, heard a gunshot, and saw Joseph fall to the ground.

One of the first responders found $1,300 on Joseph’s person; the money was turned over to personnel at the hospital.', 'Owens testified that she spoke with defendant on the phone approximately twenty to thirty minutes after the shooting, and she “asked him why he did what he did.” In response, defendant told Owens that “he was only trying to scare him,” meaning Joseph. According to Owens, defendant did not know, until she informed him, that Joseph had been hit with the bullet. Records extracted from Owens’s cell phone confirmed that she made two outgoing calls to defendant after the shooting, at 11:17 p.m. and 11:21 p.m.', 'Then, approximately one hour after the shooting, Owens received a text message from defendant, which read: “You heard bout em HP kids busten in manton”; Owens explained that “HP kids” referred to the Hartford projects, which are near the Manton projects.', 'Owens interpreted this text message “as a way of * * * telling [her] to be quiet and basically blame [the shooting] on them, the Hartford project kids.” She testified that, although she knew it was a lie, she responded by telling defendant that she had not heard anything about it and did not know what had happened.', 'The day after the shooting, Owens gave a recorded statement to the police, which she later recanted in part.', 'She told the interviewing officers that she had been involved in a prearranged drug transaction, but she identified the intended seller as a person called “G,” with 12', 'Surveillance video footage confirmed that the silver convertible drove off after Joseph fell; an individual, presumably Owens, can then be seen exiting the building and disappearing from the screen.', '-7- whom, she said, she was not acquainted. 13 She mentioned a “dark-skinned” man who signaled from 51 Salmon Street that she and Joseph should come inside, and she indicated that this man was the same person who shot Joseph, but she did not identify this person as defendant or reveal that she knew who he was. At trial, she explained that she had not wanted to identify defendant at that time “because [she] [didn’t] want to get hurt and [she] [didn’t] want [her] family to get hurt.”', 'Two days after the shooting, Owens saw defendant at a local convenience store. She testified that she approached defendant and asked why he had done what he had done, told him that she did not want to get hurt and “didn’t want to be involved,” and that the police had already come to her house and she had told them that she “didn’t know anything.” Owens also told defendant that she had “found out that [Joseph] was on life support”; according to Owens, defendant responded by saying that they “would be all set because [Joseph] was the only person there to testify or anything like that.” Owens testified that she was concerned about the safety of herself and her family, because she had been present during the shooting. The defendant told her that she and her children would be safe, and that she should “[j]ust stick to [her] story,” the story being that “she didn’t know anything.” At the end of this encounter, Owens cried and hugged defendant, purportedly because she was scared and she “wanted to make sure * * * that he knew [she] was on his side.” 13', 'Owens explained at trial that “G” was a nickname for an individual named Marcus Hughes, whom Owens knew, and who was incarcerated at the time of the shooting.', '-8-', 'Joseph passed away two days after the shooting, on June 1, 2012. The autopsy report revealed that the cause of death was a single perforating gunshot wound through the head; the manner of death was ruled a homicide. 14', 'Owens was again interviewed by the police on June 4, 2012. She was shown three photo arrays, in one of which she identified defendant as a person whom she knew. When asked if anyone from the photo arrays was involved in the robbery on May 30, 2012, Owens told the interviewing officers, for the first time, that defendant had been involved and that he had been the shooter. Owens told the officers that she had not expected defendant to be present during the drug transaction, that he was wearing a mask, and that she had identified him by his voice. One of the interviewing officers testified that Owens was crying during this interview; when he asked why she was crying, she responded that “[s]he felt that her life was in danger, her family’s life was in danger and that she would have to leave - - move out of the area.”', 'In November 2012, Owens entered into a cooperation agreement with the state, in which the state agreed, in exchange for Owens’s truthful testimony from that point forward, to not charge her for any drug offense relating to the planned transaction on the night of the shooting, or for any false statements made to the police prior to the date of the agreement. In March 2013, Owens and the state executed a second agreement, in which the state additionally agreed to not charge her for conspiracy or felony murder.', 'The defendant was tried by jury in Superior Court for five days in March and April of 2013. At the close of the evidence, the state dismissed count three of the indictment (assault with intent to commit robbery). The jury considered the remaining five counts and delivered a verdict on April 1, 2013. The jury found defendant guilty of two counts only: the first-degree 14', 'Although the bullet passed completely through Joseph’s skull, no projectile was found in the vicinity of the crime scene, only a 9 millimeter shell casing.', '-9- felony murder of Joseph, and conspiracy to commit robbery. The defendant was acquitted of the remaining charges: discharging a firearm during a crime of violence (murder), carrying a firearm without a license, and first-degree robbery of Owens. The defendant moved for a new trial on April 4, 2013, on the grounds that the verdict was against the law, the evidence, and the weight of the evidence. A hearing was held on April 18, 2013, and the trial justice issued a bench decision denying defendant’s motion on the same day. The defendant was sentenced to serve life in prison for count 1 and ten years in prison for count 5, to be served concurrently, as well as twenty years in prison for being a habitual offender, to be served consecutively to the sentence for count 1.

The defendant was provided, in response to his requests for discovery and inspection, with Owens’s witness statements made to the police, as well as a transcript of her grand jury testimony, and the state indicated that she was expected to testify consistently with these documents. In her grand jury testimony, Owens stated that she recognized defendant’s voice when he said “don’t run, don’t run,” and that “[t]he only reason [she] knew it was him [was] those two words.” The prosecutor at the grand jury proceeding did not specifically ask what part of defendant’s face, if any, she had seen; however, Owens did state that the man she identified as defendant was wearing a face mask, which would indicate that she had observed some part of his face. Although Owens’s grand jury testimony differed to some degree from her statements at trial, when she said explicitly that she had seen and recognized defendant’s face from the eyes up, there is no indication that the state was aware of this information and withheld it from defendant.', 'This inconsistency, as well as any other inconsistencies between Owens’s trial testimony and her previous statements, merely provided defense counsel with fodder for impeachment upon cross-examination. 16 Accordingly, the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in denying defendant’s motion to pass the case. 16', 'Indeed, Owens’s identification of defendant as the shooter was apparently rejected by the jury, as he was acquitted of the charges of possessing and discharging a firearm.', '- 13 -', 'B', 'The Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial', 'The defendant asserts that there is only one “reasonably-proven view of the facts of this case”: defendant conspired with Owens to sell marijuana to Joseph, and then when Owens, Rue, and Joseph arrived at 51 Salmon Street to conduct the transaction, two other unidentified men happened upon the scene and decided to rob them, and one of these unidentified men shot Joseph as he attempted to flee. The defendant argues that the vast majority of the state’s evidence supports this construction of the facts. According to defendant, the jury’s apparent rejection of Owens’s testimony regarding defendant having possessed and discharged a firearm leads to the conclusion that defendant could not have committed felony murder. Additionally, defendant asserts that “there [was] a gaping lack of evidence” to support the theory that defendant was vicariously liable for murder as a co-conspirator to the robbery.', 'In response, the state points to Owens’s testimony regarding defendant’s incriminating statements made after the incident, testimony that the trial justice credited when ruling on the motion for a new trial.

Similarly, the trial justice found that the jury could have discredited the portions of Owens’s testimony that identified defendant as the shooter; “[t]hat does not mean, however, that the jury’s verdict convicting him of conspiracy and felony murder is fatally flawed.” The trial justice also noted that the jury could have found defendant guilty of felony murder as a vicariously liable co-conspirator.

Such a theory would not require the jury to have found that defendant was the person who committed the attempted robbery of Joseph, or that he possessed or discharged the gun.', 'The theory of vicarious liability does, however, depend on the jury’s finding that defendant was guilty of conspiracy.', 'As we have previously explained, “[t]he crime of conspiracy is an agreement between ‘two or more persons to commit an unlawful act or to perform a lawful act for an unlawful purpose.’” State v.

The defendant was undisputedly present at 51 Salmon Street immediately prior to the shooting, for the purported purpose of selling one pound of marijuana, and he appeared in video footage with another individual walking in the direction of 51 Salmon Street minutes before the shooting. Furthermore, Owens’s testimony regarding the defendant’s various incriminating statements made to her after the shooting—especially his statement that he had only meant to scare Joseph—strongly suggest that he was culpably involved in a coordinated attempt to commit robbery.

43,State : v. : Wilson Rodriguez. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case came before the Supreme Court on writ of certiorari on January 22, 2015, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided.1 The defendant, Wilson Rodriguez (defendant or Rodriguez), appeals from a judgment of conviction after a jury verdict finding him guilty of one count of delivery of a controlled substance, to wit cocaine. After the trial justice heard, and denied, the defendant’s motion for a new trial, he sentenced the defendant to five years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with one year to serve and four years suspended with probation. Before this Court, the defendant raises a bevy of issues, all of which lack merit. The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in: (1) his denial of the defendant’s motion in limine to bar the testimony of Detectives Louis Stravato (Det. Stravato) and Anthony Hampton (Det. Hampton); (2) his charge to the jury; (3) his failure to include certain portions of testimony during a read back to the jury; (4) his denial of the defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal; and (5) his denial of the defendant’s motion for a new trial. 1', 'The defendant filed a petition for certiorari after his appeal was dismissed by the Superior Court for failure to properly perfect his appeal.', '-1- After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time. We affirm the judgment of conviction.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On February 26, 2008, Providence Police Detectives Stravato and Hampton were investigating defendant for possible narcotics violations. Detective Stravato testified that they set up a surveillance because they “had information that [defendant] was * * * a narcotics dealer, specifically crack cocaine.” The detectives observed defendant exiting a home on Barry Road in Providence with an elderly gentleman—later determined to be defendant’s father—and drive off in a white Acura. The detectives proceeded to follow defendant.', 'Eventually, after passing through portions of Cranston and Warwick, the surveillance led the detectives to the parking lot of the Rhode Island Mall in Warwick. The detectives parked thirty to forty feet away from defendant’s vehicle and saw another vehicle park next to defendant’s vehicle; both vehicles were facing in the same direction. Detective Stravato then saw the passenger of the second vehicle—later identified as Pamela Sherman (Sherman)—throw “crumbled currency, crumbled in a ball” into defendant’s car and then defendant threw what appeared to be cocaine into the car occupied by Sherman. The two cars then exited the parking lot, and the detectives followed the car in which Sherman was a passenger because, according to Det. Stravato, they had already “identified [defendant] so we weren’t concerned about, you know, particularly apprehending him at that point.”', 'The Providence police detectives stopped the Sherman vehicle after it had entered West Warwick. Detective Hampton removed Sherman from the car and asked her about drugs in her vehicle. Sherman admitted that the drugs were in a pack of cigarettes inside the vehicle. The', '-2- pack of cigarettes contained a bag of suspected crack cocaine. It was seized and turned over to Detective Sergeant Lavigne of the West Warwick Police Department. Sherman was arrested by the West Warwick Police and charged with drug possession. The suspected narcotics were field- tested at the West Warwick police headquarters and tested positive for cocaine. 2 Eventually, on March 11, 2008, defendant was arrested by the Providence police on the basis of a Warwick Police Department arrest warrant with an affidavit signed by a member of the Providence Police Department and was later transferred to the custody of the Warwick Police Department.', 'In a pretrial ruling, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion in limine to preclude trial testimony of Detectives Stravato and Hampton on the grounds that the Providence police lacked jurisdictional authority to conduct a surveillance outside of Providence’s city limits without informing the local police departments, and that the Providence police had no authority to seize suspected narcotics from Sherman. The trial justice rejected defendant’s argument, observing that the detectives did not arrest defendant outside of Providence, but merely conducted surveillance of defendant. Furthermore, the trial justice noted that there was no authority that suggested that the detectives’ actions were in violation of state law.', 'The case was reached for trial on January 4, 2010. The state called several witnesses in support of its case, including Det. Stravato, Det. Hampton, and Sherman. The state rested on January 5, 2010; and the next day, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal. The trial justice denied the motion, concluding that the state had submitted evidence supporting all of the elements of the charged offense. The defense rested without presenting any evidence. After the trial justice instructed the jury, defendant raised a number of objections to the jury charge, all of which were denied by the trial justice. 2', 'The state crime laboratory later confirmed that the substance in the plastic bag was cocaine.', '-3-', 'During its deliberations on the afternoon of January 6, 2010, the jury submitted the following question to the trial justice: “What body parts did the following witnesses say they saw coming from the defendant’s car?”', 'The question listed Det. Stravato, Det. Hampton, and Sherman as the pertinent witnesses about whom the jury inquired. The trial adjourned for the day to enable the stenographer to find the responsive testimony.', 'The next day, the trial justice read back the following two excerpts from the testimony of Det. Stravato: (1) Q: “Now, did you see any part of his body perform that action, is what I’m asking?” A: “Yes, his left hand.” and (2) Q: “Okay. Can you tell us what you observed next?” A: “I observed Mr. Rodriguez’s hand, um, come through his window of his vehicle and toss into her vehicle a, um, small bag of suspected crack cocaine.”', 'However, the trial justice refused defendant’s request to read a portion of Det. Stravato’s cross-examination testimony in which he testified that he did not see defendant’s hand outside of his car at a particular point in time. The trial justice determined “that the request of the jury is specifically as to body parts coming from the defendant’s car.” Therefore, the trial justice concluded that the read back requested by defendant was “not in the positive. It’s not something coming from the car. He said he didn’t see anything coming from the car at that time.” Thus, the trial justice declined to read back that portion of Det. Stravato’s testimony as it was not responsive to the jury’s question. Later that day, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on the charge of delivery of a controlled substance.', 'The defendant filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and also that the trial justice had committed an error of law when he refused to read back the requested portion of Det. Stravato’s testimony to the jury. The trial justice denied both bases of defendant’s motion. The defendant was later sentenced to five years, with one year to serve and four years suspended with probation.', '-4-', 'Analysis', 'Motion in Limine', 'This Court “review[s] the grant or denial of a motion in limine for an abuse of discretion.” State v. Marte, 92 A.3d 148, 150 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Fravala v. City of Cranston ex rel. Baron, 996 A.2d 696, 702 (R.I. 2010)). “When reviewing the grant or denial of a motion in limine, this Court will consider only whether the challenged evidence was proper and admissible and, if not, whether there was sufficient prejudice to constitute reversible error.” State v. Scanlon, 982 A.2d 1268, 1274 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Gomes, 881 A.2d 97, 111 (R.I. 2005)).', 'The defendant asserts that the trial justice erred in denying his motion in limine seeking to exclude the testimony of Providence Detectives Stravato and Hampton because they were outside of their jurisdiction when they observed the alleged criminal conduct in Warwick. The defendant argues that G.L. 1956 § 12-7-19 and G.L. 1956 § 45-42-1 impose an obligation upon police to contact local authorities from the cities and towns when making an arrest outside their jurisdiction. By extension, defendant contends that the same obligation applied to Detectives Stravato and Hampton during their surveillance. Thus, defendant asserts that the surveillance was illegal and the testimony derived therefrom should have been excluded.', 'This argument ignores our recent holding in State v. Morris, 92 A.3d 920, 926 (R.I. 2014), where we stated “that the Pawtucket police could properly travel outside of their jurisdiction without the accompaniment of Providence police in the course of investigating the robberies.”', 'As Detectives Stravato and Hampton were merely conducting surveillance of defendant—that began in Providence—and they did not arrest him at that time, the detectives', '-5- were not required to contact the authorities of the cities and towns through which they traveled. See id.', 'Furthermore, the detectives did not follow defendant out of the parking lot, but rather pursued Sherman.', 'Thus, even if Sherman had been arrested outside of the detectives’ jurisdiction, defendant has no standing to challenge her arrest because the Fourth Amendment is a personal right and defendant would have no expectation of privacy in the search that was conducted. See State v. Quinlan, 921 A.2d 96, 109 (R.I. 2007) (“A party has standing when he or she is found to have a reasonable expectation of privacy in the area searched or the thing seized.” citing State v. Casas, 900 A.2d 1120, 1129-31 (R.I. 2006)); see State v. Bertram, 591 A.2d 14, 19 (R.I. 1991) (concluding that passenger of a vehicle rented by the passenger’s spouse had no standing to challenge the search of the vehicle).', 'Jury Instructions', '“[T]he standard of review for jury instructions is well settled. A charge ‘need only adequately cover[ ] the law.’” State v. Long, 61 A.3d 439, 445 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Cardona, 969 A.2d 667, 674 (R.I. 2009)). “When we are called upon to review ‘issues pertaining to jury instructions, we do so de novo.’” State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 470 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Vargas, 991 A.2d 1056, 1060 (R.I. 2010)). “[W]e examine the challenged portion in the context in which it was delivered to ascertain how a jury composed of ordinary, intelligent lay people would have understood the instructions.” State v. Sivo, 809 A.2d 481, 488 (R.I. 2002). “A ‘trial justice is bound to ensure that the jury charge sufficiently addresses the requested instructions and correctly states the applicable law.’” Long, 61 A.3d at 445 (quoting State v. Sivo, 925 A.2d 901, 913 (R.I. 2007)).', '-6-', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred when he overruled defendant’s objection to the jury instructions focused on what he contends was insufficient instruction and use of the phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt” in various portions of the jury charge. We note at the outset that defendant failed to specifically identify the portions of the jury instructions that he is contesting on appeal.', 'The defendant’s argument contesting the jury charge has not been sufficiently developed for this Court to review. See State v. Day, 925 A.2d 962, 974 n.19 (R.I. 2007). Nonetheless, from our review of the trial transcript, it is abundantly clear that the instructions provided by the trial justice properly instructed the jurors on the applicable law and the state’s burden of proof. It was not necessary that the term “beyond a reasonable doubt” be repeated throughout the instructions, but rather, that the meaning of “beyond a reasonable doubt” must adequately be conveyed to the jury. See State v. Imbruglia, 913 A.2d 1022, 1030, 1033 (R.I. 2007) (holding that the trial justice is “not obligated to use the specific words requested by [the] defendant” so long as the trial justice “adequately cover[s] the law”). The instructions in this case satisfied this requirement.', 'The Testimony Read Back to the Jury', '“The decision whether to read back to the jury a particular witness’s trial testimony—in response to a jury request—‘is committed to the sound discretion of the trial justice.’” State v. Ros, 973 A.2d 1148, 1176 (R.I. 2009) (quoting State v. Dumas, 835 A.2d 438, 443 (R.I. 2003)). “The trial justice generally should honor such a request, ‘especially when it is practically possible to do so without consuming an inordinate amount of time and without misleading the jury.’” Id. (quoting Dumas, 835 A.2d at 443). Furthermore, a read back must be both fair and impartial; thus, “it should include all testimony pertaining to the subject matter of the jury request.” Id. (citing Dumas, 835 A.2d at 444).', '-7-', 'The defendant contends that the trial justice erred when, in response to the question posed by the jury, he did not read back the following excerpt: Q: “Was Mr. Rodriguez’s, I assume, left hand outside the window?” A: “Not at that point.” The trial justice determined that this excerpt was not within the purview of the question posed by the jury because it did not relate to what parts of defendant’s body the witnesses “saw coming from the defendant’s car[.]”', 'We discern no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial justice in excluding the challenged portion of Det. Stravato’s testimony. While the testimony implies that Det. Stravato saw defendant’s hand at some other point, it was not responsive to the question that was posed by the jury. It is well settled that “[t]he trial justice has considerable discretion in how to respond to a request.” Ros, 973 A.2d at 1176. Here, the trial justice determined that the challenged testimony was not responsive, particularly in light of the fact that the question called for an answer as to when defendant’s body parts were coming from the vehicle, and the challenged testimony related to a point when defendant’s hand was not observed outside the vehicle. We previously have stated that “[w]hen a jury makes a request for information, the response should be tailored to the request.” Id. We are satisfied that the response provided by the trial justice was appropriately tailored to the request of the jury, and it was within his sound discretion to decline to read back the portion requested by defendant.', 'Motion for a New Trial and Judgment of Acquittal', '“When ruling on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice acts as a thirteenth juror, exercising ‘independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.’” State v. Heredia, 10 A.3d 443, 446 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Imbruglia, 913 A.2d at 1028). “Specifically, ‘the trial justice must (1) consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, (2) independently assess the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and then', '-8- (3) determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.’” Id. (citing State v. Texieira, 944 A.2d 132, 140 (R.I. 2008)). “If, after conducting such a review, the trial justice reaches the same conclusion as the jury, the verdict should be affirmed and the motion for a new trial denied.” Id. (citing State v. Snow, 670 A.2d 239, 244 (R.I. 1996)).', '“When passing on ‘a trial justice’s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, this Court applies the same standard as the trial justice.’” Long, 61 A.3d at 445 (quoting State v. Lynch, 19 A.3d 51, 56 (R.I. 2011)). “A motion for a judgment of acquittal should be granted only if the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, is insufficient to establish the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Id. (quoting Heredia, 10 A.3d at 446). “If, however, a reasonable juror could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, the motion should be denied.” Id. (quoting Heredia, 10 A.3d at 446).', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying his motion for a new trial because of the alleged lack of credibility of the detectives and because of the failure of the trial justice to read back the requested portion of Det. Stravato’s testimony. The defendant contends that the detectives’ credibility was first called into question because they knowingly allowed defendant to drive even though they had probable cause to arrest him for operating the vehicle without a valid license. Additionally, defendant asserts that there were inconsistencies between the testimony of the detectives as to where in the parking lot the delivery took place.', 'Although the trial justice acknowledged the minor inconsistencies between the testimony of Detectives Stravato and Hampton, he also found that, to the extent the testimony was inconsistent, Sherman’s testimony established that she purchased cocaine from defendant at that location. The trial justice declared that he agreed with the verdict and his decision was not influenced by the inconsistencies:', '-9-', '“There was nothing so shattering that was entered into evidence to', 'detract or limit the credibility from either Stravato or from', 'Hampton. When the [c]ourt looks at the total credibility of all', 'those witnesses, Hampton, Stravato, and Sherman, the [c]ourt does', 'not fault the jury’s verdict in this particular matter.” Additionally, the trial justice reiterated that the only portions of the testimony that were read back to the jury were the portions that responded to the question posed. He concluded that it was not error to decline to read back the portion requested by defendant.', 'We are of the opinion that the trial justice did not err in denying defendant’s motion for a new trial. The trial justice properly considered the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, and he “articulated adequate reasons for denying the motion[.]” State v. Fleck, 81 A.3d 1129, 1134 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Phannavong, 21 A.3d 321, 325 (R.I. 2011)). The trial justice was not clearly wrong, and we see no reason for disturbing his decision. See id. at 1135.', 'Lastly, because we have “concluded that the evidence ‘was sufficient to withstand the more stringent review applicable to a motion for a new trial, it follows that the evidence was also sufficient to withstand a motion for a judgment of acquittal.’” State v.

44,: v. : Town of Westerly. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The plaintiff, Renewable Resources, Inc. (Renewable Resources or plaintiff), appeals from a Superior Court order vacating a preliminary injunction halting demolition of the Potter Hill Mill (the mill), as well as a subsequent judgment dismissing the remaining counts of the plaintiff’s amended complaint against the defendant the Town of Westerly (the town or defendant). On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the hearing justice abused his discretion in failing to find a change of conditions warranting the mill’s demolition. After a thorough review of the record and consideration of the parties’ written submissions and oral arguments, we affirm the order and judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In the 1950s, the Potter Hill Mill, a vestige of this country’s Industrial Revolution located on the Pawcatuck River in Westerly, ceased its operations. In 1980, with the condition of the mill’s buildings worsening, the town sought to have it demolished, and a demolition order was eventually issued.', 'The demolition order was upheld by the Rhode Island Building Code Standards Committee; and, in 1984, a Rhode Island District Court judge affirmed the order to', '-1- demolish the mill for safety reasons. Demolition, however, did not take place. In 1992, plaintiff purchased the mill for $50,000 “as is.”', 'In 2006, plaintiff and the town entered into a memorandum of agreement (MOA), in which plaintiff recognized the validity of the condemnation order and pledged to meet a series of conditions in order to stave off demolition. The MOA required that plaintiff fence off the property, clean up debris, and expeditiously pursue its development plan. Further, the MOA explicitly granted the town the power to determine whether plaintiff was in breach of the MOA’s conditions.', 'On August 21, 2009, aware of the mill’s continuing deterioration and plaintiff’s failure to expeditiously pursue its development plan, the town placed a newspaper advertisement requesting proposals for the demolition of the mill. On September 11, 2009, plaintiff responded by filing the instant action in the Washington County Superior Court seeking a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction against the town barring demolition of the mill’s buildings. 1 In its answer, the town alleged that plaintiff’s failure to comply with the MOA’s requirement of due diligence was sufficient to grant “the Town the right to condemn and * * * demolish the building.” The town also filed an objection to the requested temporary restraining order, as well as a motion for the court to conduct a view of the mill. A Superior Court justice subsequently granted plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order, and the parties continued the preliminary injunction hearing for more than one year while the temporary restraining order remained in effect.', 'On April 26, 2011, a second Superior Court justice dismissed count 3 of the amended complaint, which requested “a mandatory injunction ordering [the town] to forthwith conform the zoning classification of Plaintiff’s property * * * to its comprehensive plan[.]” The hearing 1', 'On March 29, 2010, plaintiff filed an amended complaint, in which it added a request for monetary damages.', '-2- justice then entered an order effectuating an agreement between plaintiff and the town. The order provided plaintiff with a timetable for both submission of development plans and actual repair work for the mill, and it also provided that a preliminary injunction against demolition of the mill would remain in effect until further notice. 2', 'On June 25, 2012, after two hearings on the matter before a third Superior Court justice, an order was entered allowing quarterly inspections by the town’s building official, the issuance of permits for demolition and reconstruction of the mill, and a viewing of the mill property by the court. The order further scheduled a review of the case for November 16, 2012. On October 16, 2012, the hearing justice viewed the property along with the parties. A short time later, at the end of October 2012, Hurricane Sandy 3 struck New England, wreaking havoc on what was left of the mill. Subsequently, on November 16, 2012, the town filed an emergency motion for relief from the preliminary injunction pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, 4 in which it described the advanced rate of deterioration and collapse of the buildings 2', 'On June 17, 2011, the town filed a motion to hold plaintiff in contempt for failing to submit a reconstruction plan and failing to repair a gravel road. While plaintiff was not held in contempt, it was ordered to commence reconstruction and repair of the mill under the direction of a court- appointed architect and submit a development plan to the Westerly Planning Board by October 15, 2011. When plaintiff timely filed its development plan but failed to follow through with requests for additional information, the town again moved to hold plaintiff in contempt. This motion was not granted. 3', 'Hurricane Sandy made landfall on October 29, 2012, bringing extensive damage to the Atlantic Coast. Congress responded to the natural disaster by appropriating $9.7 billion to replenish the National Flood Insurance Program and another $51 billion to aid victims of the storm. See Kolbe v. BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, 738 F.3d 432, 455 (1st Cir. 2013). 4', 'Rule 60(b)(5) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides: “On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or a party’s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: * * * the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application[.]”', '-3- since the summer and requested that it be allowed to demolish the buildings so that it might prevent immediate harm to children.', 'At a December 11, 2012 hearing, David Murphy, the town’s building official, testified that the buildings were beyond repair and unsafe; he added that they posed a threat to persons on the property and in the adjacent waterway. Acknowledging the problems posed by trespassers and children on the property, Mr. Murphy concluded that the buildings should be demolished. 5 At that same hearing, the town planner, Marilyn Shellman, testified that she had viewed the mill twice in the past year, and that in her second visit “[t]he integrity of the buildings seem[ed] to be worse than [on her] first viewing.” Specifically, she noted that parts of the roof as well as the sidewalls had collapsed since her first viewing. The court also heard testimony from Bonnie Bennett and Allison Goodsell, longtime neighbors of the mill. Ms. Bennett testified to taking pictures of two young boys on top of the mill and, using pictures she had taken in the wake of Hurricane Sandy, she testified that the storm brought about “a lot of further deterioration” to the mill. Ms. Goodsell testified that she had seen many trespassers over the years, as well as that “kids just go in there.”', 'On December 18, 2012, 6 an order was entered by the hearing justice “grant[ing] [the town] relief from the current restraining order as it relates to enforcement procedures and * * * permit[ing] [the town] to issue a demolition order to the owner of the subject property through its 5', 'On December 20, 2012, Mr. Murphy issued a notice of unsafe condition and order to demolish, citing eight of the unsafe conditions listed in G.L. 1956 § 23-27.3-124.1. On January 16, 2013, plaintiff unsuccessfully appealed the demolition order to the town’s Building Code Board of Appeals. The plaintiff then appealed to the Rhode Island Building Code Standards Committee pursuant to § 23-27.3-127.2.5(f). When its appeal was again denied, plaintiff filed an administrative appeal in the Sixth Division District Court, where that case currently awaits a decision. 6', 'This order was date-stamped as having been issued on December 17, 2012, but the docket sheet lists it as having been issued on December 18, 2012.', '-4- Building Official[.]” On January 22, 2013, he issued a written decision finding that plaintiff had breached the MOA and, accordingly, entered an order on February 6, 2013, vacating the preliminary injunction. 7', 'On February 18, 2013, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, and, on February 19, 2013, plaintiff filed a motion for the Superior Court to stay the order pending the outcome of its appeal to this Court. On March 28, 2013, the town filed an objection to the motion for stay, as well as a motion to dismiss the appeal. On April 29, 2013, the hearing justice denied plaintiff’s motion for stay, but required the town to give notice at least ten days prior to commencing demolition of the mill. On that same day, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed count 4 of its amended complaint with prejudice, and the hearing justice entered a judgment denying and dismissing counts 1 and 2 of plaintiff’s amended complaint. On April 30, 2013, plaintiff amended its notice of appeal to include the newly entered judgment.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We note at the outset that the town’s emergency motion for relief from the preliminary injunction was mistakenly brought pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5). Rule 60(b)(5) “is applicable only in instances where relief is sought from a final judgment, order, or proceeding.” Murphy v. Bocchio, 114 R.I. 679, 682, 338 A.2d 519, 522 (1975). Because a preliminary injunction is merely an interlocutory order, as opposed to a final judgment, Rule 60(b)(5) was erroneously invoked. See Menard v. Woonsocket Teachers’ Guild-AFT 951, 117 R.I. 121, 128, 363 A.2d 1349, 1353 (1976) (“It is axiomatic that [a] * * * preliminary injunction is not intended as a final determination of the merits of a controversy, but that it is intended only to continue, 7', 'In his written decision, the hearing justice also noted that plaintiff did not present any witnesses at the December 11, 2012 hearing.', '-5- approximately, the status quo until the merits of the cause can be formally adjudicated.” citing Studley Land Co. v.

It is clear, then, that the hearing justice was justified in entertaining the town’s motion for relief despite the fact that it was brought pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5). See Greene v. Union Mutual Life Insurance Company of America, 764 F.2d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 1985) (acknowledging “the inherent power of [the trial court] to afford such relief from interlocutory judgments * * * as justice requires,” quoting Dow Chemical, USA v.

(citing Forcier, 558 A.2d at 214).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, plaintiff contends that the hearing justice abused his discretion in failing to find a “substantial” change in circumstances warranting the vacating of the preliminary injunction. In support of its argument, plaintiff points to the absence of any findings by the hearing justice of significant deterioration between April 26, 2011, the date of the granting of the preliminary injunction, and November 16, 2012, the date of the filing of the motion for relief. In response, the town argues that plaintiff’s failure to fulfill the terms of the MOA as well as the accelerated deterioration of the mill’s buildings following Hurricane Sandy were sufficient evidence of a change in circumstances.', 'In a review of a trial court decision on a motion to modify a preliminary injunction, we have previously required the petitioner to show “[a] sufficient change in circumstances” in order to prevail. Harris v. Town of Lincoln, 668 A.2d 321, 328 (R.I. 1995) (citing Coalition of Black Leadership v. Cianci, 570 F.2d 12, 14 (1st Cir. 1978) (emphasis added)).', 'As the hearing justice recounted in his written decision, the town presented a series of witnesses at the December 11, 2012 hearing, all of whom testified to the escalation of the dangerous condition of the mill’s buildings. Mr. Murphy, the building official, testified that his recent visits indicated that the buildings were unsafe and on the verge of collapsing. He also testified that plaintiff had only once sought a demolition permit, and that the application was incomplete, which led him to believe that plaintiff was in violation of the MOA’s diligence requirement. Ms. Shellman, the town planner, further testified to the worsening of the buildings’', '-7- condition, as well as plaintiff’s inaction with respect to the MOA, noting that plaintiff had failed to submit the master plan. Ms. Bennett, the neighbor, testified that recent events brought “advanced deterioration,” which included the collapsing of walls and ceilings. She also showed photographs of trespassers, some of whom appeared to be minors, on the property. Finally, Ms. Goodsell, another neighbor, corroborated Ms. Bennett’s testimony regarding the presence of children on the property.', 'In rejecting plaintiff’s contention that it should not be deemed in breach of the MOA, the hearing justice declared that plaintiff’s failure to do enough work on the property to move beyond a simple vision constituted a breach. As evidence of an abuse of discretion, plaintiff points to the lack of any mention of a specific change in circumstances warranting vacating of the preliminary injunction.', 'Although the hearing justice did not specifically explain what constituted a change in circumstance, we are in agreement that he acted within his discretion in vacating the preliminary injunction.', 'In compliance with Rule 52(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, 8 the hearing justice detailed the witness testimony he found credible, notably concerning the advanced deterioration of the mill’s buildings and plaintiff’s failure to fulfill its requirements under the MOA. The hearing justice also considered plaintiff’s argument that the town should have been estopped from finding that plaintiff was in breach of the MOA because the town did not amend the applicable zoning ordinance until 2011. He rejected that argument, however, noting that an amendment of the ordinance was not a condition of the agreement. 8', 'Rule 52(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides, in relevant part: “[I]n granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions the court shall * * * set forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law which constitute the grounds of its action. * * * It will be sufficient if the findings of fact and conclusions of law are stated orally and recorded in open court * * *.”', '-8-', 'The hearing justice stressed that plaintiff’s noncompliance with the MOA was the impetus for vacating the preliminary injunction. To that end, we are not persuaded by plaintiff’s contention that the hearing justice’s referral to the terms of the MOA was improper. This argument overlooks the fact that plaintiff’s request for injunctive relief was based on both parties’ living up to the terms of the MOA. Further, the record reveals that plaintiff waived this issue when it failed to object to the town’s invoking the terms of the MOA as a basis for vacating the preliminary injunction. See Town of Smithfield v. Fanning, 602 A.2d 939, 942 (R.I. 1992) (“No principle of appellate review is better settled in this state than the doctrine that this court will not consider an issue raised on appeal that has not been raised in reasonably clear and distinct form before the trial justice.”).', 'We note that the hearing justice’s finding of plaintiff’s breach was sufficient to constitute the requisite change in circumstances. Essentially serving as an enforcement mechanism for the MOA, the preliminary injunction was entered into with certain requirements, notably the reconstruction and repair of the mill’s buildings. The town exposed itself to risk by agreeing to those terms, and plaintiff’s inaction in the ensuing months resulted in further deterioration. Between the granting of the preliminary injunction and the filing of the emergency motion for relief, the town twice sought to hold plaintiff in contempt, but plaintiff was shown leniency on both occasions. The plaintiff’s continued noncompliance, then, was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back. See Calhoun v. United States Department of Labor, 576 F.3d 201, 214 (4th Cir. 2009) (“In the face of [the petitioner’s] repeated refusals to change his behavior, [his] conduct * * * was simply the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back.”). Given that plaintiff’s noncompliance resulted in an advanced state of deterioration, we conclude that this', '-9- breach was sufficient to constitute a change in circumstances. 9 Accordingly, we are satisfied that the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in granting the town’s emergency motion for relief. 10', 'Finally, to the extent that the plaintiff appeals the judgment dismissing counts 1 and 2 of its amended complaint seeking a “preliminary and permanent injunction restraining and enjoining [the town] from * * * demolishing [the mill],” we glean no applicable argument relating to them in its brief, and we therefore deem those issues to have been waived.

Pielech, No. 2013-146-A., slip op. at 8 (R.I., filed Jan. 14, 2015) (“Even when a party has properly preserved its alleged error of law in the lower court, a failure to raise and develop it in its briefs constitutes a waiver of that issue on appeal and in proceedings on remand.” citing Bowen Court Associates v.

The plaintiff, the Narragansett Indian Tribe (Tribe), appeals from the entry of partial summary judgment in the Superior Court in favor of the defendant, the State of Rhode Island (state), and the intervenor defendant, UTGR, Inc. d/b/a Twin River (UTGR), finding that the 2011 Casino Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 61.2 of title 42 (Casino Act or the act) is not facially unconstitutional. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Much of the background of the lengthy disputes between the state and the Tribe as it pertains to gambling in Rhode Island is succinctly summarized in our previous opinion in this case. See Narragansett Indian Tribe v. State, 81 A.3d 1106, 1107-09 (R.I. 2014) (Tribe I). Accordingly, here, we summarize only the pertinent facts necessary to the disposition of this appeal.', '-1-', 'The present appeal concerns only the facial constitutionality of the Casino Act. 1 On September 28, 2011, the Tribe filed a complaint against the state seeking a declaration that the Casino Act is unconstitutional in violation of article 6, section 15 of the Rhode Island Constitution, which provides, in relevant part, that “[a]ll lotteries shall be prohibited in the state except lotteries operated by the state * * * and all shall be subject to the prescription and regulation of the general assembly.” Additionally, the Tribe asserted that the Casino Act was unconstitutionally vague and in violation of the non-delegation doctrine embodied in sections 1 and 2 of article 6 of the Rhode Island Constitution. Subsequently, UTGR was permitted to intervene as a defendant.', 'A hearing before the Washington County Superior Court on the parties’ cross-motions for partial summary judgment was held on May 30, 2012. The hearing justice later issued a written decision, which found that, although the Tribe had standing, it nonetheless had failed to meet its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the Casino Act is facially unconstitutional.', 'The Tribe timely appealed the decision on the merits, and the state timely cross-appealed the determination that the Tribe had standing. This Court declined to consolidate the two appeals, and directed the parties to first address the issue of standing. On January 10, 2014, we issued an opinion affirming the hearing justice’s decision that the Tribe had standing. Tribe I, 81 A.3d at 1111. However, we relied on different reasons from those relied on by the hearing justice. Id. Rather than invoking the public interest exception to standing, we held that the Tribe had “demonstrated an injury in fact” sufficient to maintain standing. Id. 1', 'The Tribe’s as-applied challenge remains pending in the Superior Court. Additionally, the parties disagree whether subsequent legislation and materials produced by the state in connection with the Casino Act should be taken into account on this appeal. Also, on April 19, 2012, the Tribe filed an amended complaint concerning, inter alia, matters pertaining to the operation of video lottery terminal machines. Since these matters were not addressed by the hearing justice, we decline to consider them at this stage. In any event, these matters appear more appropriate for as-applied adjudication.', '-2-', 'Having cleared the standing hurdle, we proceed to address the merits of the Tribe’s challenge.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'It is well settled that “[t]his Court reviews a lower court’s grant of a motion for summary judgment de novo, ‘employing the same standards and rules used by the hearing justice.’” Generation Realty, LLC v.

Nonetheless, the current consensus appears to be that “facial challenges are generally equated with claims of unconstitutionality in toto,” Gillian E. Metzger, Facial and As-Applied Challenges Under the Roberts Court, 36 Fordham Urb. L.J. 773, 786 (2009), whereas, “[a]s-applied challenges are then treated as the residual, although ostensibly preferred and larger, category.” Fallon, 99 Calif. L. Rev. at 923.

Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 18 (2010).', 'The United States Supreme Court has fairly recently stated that a key distinction between facial and as-applied challenges essentially “goes to the breadth of the remedy employed by the Court.” Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, 558 U.S. 310, 331 (2010). In addition, it has been suggested that “the availability of facial challenges varies on a doctrine-by-doctrine basis and is a function of the applicable substantive tests of constitutional validity.” Richard H.

United States, 541 U.S. 600, 609-10 (2004).', 'At the current stage, 2 the Tribe’s facial challenge is roughly analogous in form to what has been described as a “valid rule facial challenge,” which “is a challenge to a statute based on a constitutional infirmity evident in the written words of the statute itself.” Isserles, 48 Am. U. L. Rev. at 428. Accordingly, we shall assess, as written, the Casino Act’s constitutionality against the infirmities alleged by the Tribe.', 'The Tribe argues that the Casino Act must be invalidated because it is unconstitutionally vague or because it otherwise violates the non-delegation doctrine enunciated in article 6, sections 1 and 2 of the Rhode Island Constitution. We note, however, that there is no allegation that the Casino Act infringes upon First Amendment or other fundamental rights.', 'A', 'Vagueness', 'To the extent that a sufficient basis for invalidating the Casino Act under the vagueness doctrine 3 has been articulated, at the current stage of these proceedings, we may succinctly dispose of this argument. 2', 'While we understand the time sensitive exigency (i.e., adjudication prior to the ballot referenda) that led the Superior Court to separate the as-applied and facial analyses, we note that such bifurcation is not preferable for purposes of judicial review. 3', '“The void-for-vagueness doctrine emanates from the due process requirements that a law must be defined ‘[1] with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and [2] in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.’” State ex rel.

Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983)).', '-5-', 'The United States Supreme Court has stated that “[v]agueness challenges to statutes not threatening First Amendment interests are examined in light of the facts of the case at hand; the statute is judged on an as-applied basis.” Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356, 361 (1988); see Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. at 18 (“We consider whether a statute is vague as applied to the particular facts at issue.”); Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, 467 (1991) (“First Amendment freedoms are not infringed by [the statute], so the vagueness claim must be evaluated as the statute is applied to the facts of this case.”). Accordingly, the Casino Act must be evaluated on an as-applied basis when that challenge is considered by the Superior Court.', 'B', 'Non-delegation', 'We begin with the recognition that “the delegation of legislative functions is not a per se unconstitutional action.” Milardo v. Coastal Resources Management Council of Rhode Island, 434 A.2d 266, 270-71 (R.I. 1981); see Davis v. Wood, 427 A.2d 332, 335 (R.I. 1981) (“As a practical matter, the [non-delegation] doctrine has not prohibited the delegation of legislative power.”). Nonetheless, we are mindful that “merely calling a casino ‘state operated’ does not make it so for purposes of fulfilling the very explicit terms of our Constitution.” In re Advisory Opinion to the House of Representatives (Casino II), 885 A.2d 698, 707 n.8 (R.I. 2005). However, we are also cognizant of our role in evaluating the constitutionality of legislation. In performing this task, “if two alternate interpretations are possible, we shall favor that which presents no potential constitutional difficulties.” Mosby v. Devine, 851 A.2d 1031, 1045 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Pontbriand v. Sundlun, 699 A.2d 856, 866 (R.I. 1997)).', 'The Tribe emphasizes that the extensive regulatory power given to the state in the Casino Act is an indication that the act is unconstitutional. This assertion must be rejected. That', '-6- the Casino Act grants the state regulatory power does not necessarily take away from whatever grant of operational power the Casino Act also provides. Indeed, the Rhode Island Constitution recognizes that regulation and operation are not mutually exclusive.', 'Article 6, section 15 excludes lotteries operated by the state from the general prohibition on lotteries and also provides that all lotteries, including those operated by the state, “shall be subject to the prescription and regulation of the general assembly.”', 'Additionally, we note that among the extensive operational powers given to the state through the Casino Act is the power not only to “[d]etermine the number, type, placement and arrangement of casino gaming games, tables and sites,” § 42-61.2-2.1(c)(1), but also the “power to terminate or suspend any casino gaming activities.” Section 42-61.2-2.1(c)(5). The justices of this Court previously opined 4 that this power was “essential to the exercise of operational control.” Casino II, 885 A.2d at 710 n.12. Accordingly, this clause’s existence among the panoply of powers present in the Casino Act supports the determination that the law is constitutional.', 'Further, as the hearing justice correctly recognized, the Casino Act does not suffer from any of the previous constitutional infirmities that were identified in In re Advisory Opinion to the Governor (Casino), 856 A.2d 320 (R.I. 2004) (Casino I) or Casino II.

Here, in contrast, the Casino Act authorizes state-operated casino gambling. 5 In Casino II, 885 A.2d at 708, the justices of this Court opined that the proposed legislation was constitutionally deficient because, inter alia, it granted a private entity “largely unmitigated control over the table games at the proposed casino.” Here, however, the Casino Act explicitly vests the state with the power and authority to “[d]etermine the number, type, placement and arrangement of casino gaming games, tables and sites,” § 42-61.2-2.1(c)(1), as well as the “power to terminate or suspend any casino gaming activities.” Section 42-61.2- 2.1(c)(5).', 'The Casino Act directly references article 6, section 15 of the Rhode Island Constitution and explicitly provides that, pursuant to that clause, the state “shall have full operational control” and have the “authority to make all decisions about all aspects of the functioning of the business enterprise * * *.” Section 42-61.2-2.1(c). That the Casino Act lists specific aspects 6 over which the state has authority does not limit the broad grant of power because it is clear that by employing the language “including, without limitation,” the specific enumerations are not intended to be the exclusive aspects over which the state has control.

46,"(Dissent begins on page 37) In the Matter of Keven A. McKenna. : Present: Suttell, C.J., Goldberg, Flaherty, Robinson, and Indeglia, JJ. OPINION PER CURIAM. This attorney disciplinary matter comes before this Court pursuant to a recommendation of the Disciplinary Board of the Rhode Island Supreme Court (board) that the respondent, Keven A. McKenna, be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year. Article III, Rule 6(d) of the Supreme Court Rules of Disciplinary Procedure for Attorneys provides in pertinent part: “If the [b]oard determines that a proceeding * * * should be concluded by a public censure, suspension or disbarment, it shall submit its findings and recommendations, together with the entire record, to this Court. This Court shall review the record and enter an appropriate order.” We directed the respondent to appear before this Court at its conference on June 11, 2014, to show cause why he should not be disciplined. Having heard the representations of the respondent and this Court’s Disciplinary Counsel, and having reviewed the entire record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that the imposition of discipline is appropriate. We adopt the recommendation of the board that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year, with said period of suspension to become effective thirty days from the date of this opinion. -1- I Procedural History On November 5, 2012, Chief Disciplinary Counsel brought disciplinary charges against respondent, alleging violations of several of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct. The petition asserted four counts: count 1 alleged that respondent violated Article V, Rules 3.3, 7.1, 7.5, and 8.4(c) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct by engaging in the unauthorized practice of law as a limited liability entity in violation of this Court’s order of February 23, 2011; count 2 alleged that respondent violated Rules 3.3 and 8.4(c) by failing to disclose his income to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island (Bankruptcy Court), misrepresenting his interest in a receivable to that court, and by engaging in conduct that amounted to a lack of candor, dishonesty, and misrepresentation to the bankruptcy trustee; count 3 alleged that respondent violated Article V, Rule 1.19 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct by failing to provide records requested by Assistant Disciplinary Counsel 1 through a subpoena and by failing to keep records as mandated by Rule 1.19; and count 4 alleged that respondent violated Rule 3.3 and Article V, Rule 3.5(d) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct by engaging in conduct during proceedings in the Workers’ Compensation Court and Bankruptcy Court that demonstrated a lack of candor, as well as an attempt to disrupt those tribunals. On December 11, 2012, respondent filed an answer to the petition, stating that the “answers to the Petition for Disciplinary Action are hereby set forth in the attached Federal Court Complaint.” The federal complaint, brought against Chief Disciplinary Counsel, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, and the Chair of the board, alleged multiple constitutional violations and 1 The Supreme Court appointed an Assistant Disciplinary Counsel to investigate this matter. -2- sought to “temporarily, preliminarily, and permanently restrain” the board from enforcing the provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct. In the federal complaint, respondent argued that this Court has no authority to regulate “non court room [sic] and non-attorney client activities of R.I. [a]ttorneys * * * .” The United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island (District Court) dismissed the complaint, holding that abstention was required under Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), because the relief respondent sought would require federal interference in an ongoing state judicial proceeding. McKenna v. Gershkoff, 2013 WL 3364368 at *1-*2 (D.R.I. July 3, 2013) (not officially reported). The respondent also filed numerous motions with the board, seeking to avoid the board’s review of this matter by alleging multiple constitutional violations. A three-member panel of the board (the panel) convened and conducted eight hearings on this matter between February 18, 2013 and October 16, 2013. The panel heard testimony from respondent, attorney Kevin Heitke (who, for a time, represented respondent’s professional corporation in Bankruptcy Court), Sheila Bentley McKenna (respondent’s wife), attorney Thomas Quinn (Chapter 11 trustee in respondent’s professional corporation’s bankruptcy case), and Daniel Marks (a client of respondent). Numerous exhibits were admitted, including the transcript of the hearings in Workers’ Compensation Court that provided the genesis of the proceedings now before this Court. II Facts The following facts are gleaned from the voluminous record of the board’s proceedings. In May 2009, respondent was practicing law under the duly licensed entity “Keven A. McKenna, P.C.” (the PC). Also in May 2009, an employee of the PC, Sumner Stone, filed a claim for -3- workers’ compensation benefits, alleging a work-related injury. Because the PC was unable to provide proof that it carried workers’ compensation insurance as required by statute, a pretrial order was entered that ordered it to make weekly compensation payments to Stone. The respondent, on behalf of the PC, refused to make the payments, arguing that this order violated his due process rights. Over the course of several months and a dozen hearings, respondent made multiple motions to dismiss and repeatedly asked the Chief Judge of the Workers’ Compensation Court, who was presiding over the hearings, to recuse himself. Each motion was argued, and all of the motions were denied. Despite the denials, respondent continued to press the same arguments at virtually every hearing. The respondent repeatedly argued that he was being denied his right to a full hearing on the merits; however, the entire course of the proceedings in the Workers’ Compensation Court consisted of the disposition of his own motions and of the employee’s motions relating to respondent’s failure to comply with the pretrial order. After presiding over the numerous hearings, the Chief Judge observed that respondent was “simply using the procedures of this court to delay and harass.” Eventually, the Chief Judge dismissed respondent’s claim for trial, due to the fact that respondent refused to make payments as required by the pretrial order. Thus, the pretrial order became the court’s final order. While the Workers’ Compensation Court transcripts are replete with examples of respondent’s apparent contempt for the court and the proceedings as a whole, we highlight a few particularly illustrative excerpts: -4- “[Respondent]: I would like to enter an order on that, that you’re denying me a right to a speedy civil trial * * * . “* * * “[Respondent]: I will drag this on forever. “* * * “[Respondent]: I have filed, and I will file again a motion to recuse you because I’m suing you personally for due process rights, violations, and that is a requirement for you to recuse yourself, assign it to another judge. * * * This is a rump court proceeding. You’re aiding and abetting a criminal getting benefits * * * . “* * * “[Respondent]: [Stone is] making a mockery of this court, Your Honor, because of your dislike for me. You will not give me a trial. I’m going to ask for a trial on this one, you’re not going to give it to me. You’re just going to continue this thing on with the hope that you will be generating money. “* * * “The Court: Mr. McKenna, are you alleging, first of all, you’re not denying that you have not made payments; is that correct? “[Respondent]: I’m not going to answer that question. You’re not the prosecutor, Your Honor. “* * * “[Respondent]: That’s why we don’t want judges doing administrative function. [sic] We don’t like judges pandering to attorneys and nonprofit corporations like you do with [opposing counsel] * * * .” During the ninth day of hearings, respondent, while testifying as a witness, refused to admit familiarity with the pretrial order that had been the subject of the previous eight hearings. Opposing counsel then attempted to confirm the address of respondent’s house: “[Opposing Counsel]: Mr. McKenna, where do you live? “[Respondent]: In a house. “[Opposing Counsel]: Can you tell me the address of your house? “[Respondent]: No. “* * * “[Respondent]: I don’t have a house. “[Opposing Counsel]: Where, well, you just said you did. You just said - - “[Respondent]: I did not. I live in a house. “[Opposing Counsel]: You live in a house. What is the address of that house that you live in? “[Respondent]: Actually, I don’t think it has an address, it has a post-office box. -5- “[Opposing Counsel]: Does your house, is your house on a street anywhere? “[Respondent]: No. “[Opposing Counsel]: It’s not? Is it on an avenue? “[Respondent]: No. “[Opposing Counsel]: Is it on a court? “[Respondent]: No. “[Opposing Counsel]: Well, if I was to come and visit you, how would I get there? “[Respondent]: You would have to get directions from me.” 2 In December 2009, the Workers’ Compensation Court entered an order finding respondent in contempt for his refusal to make payments to Stone as required by the pretrial order. The respondent appealed from this order. After temporarily staying the order, this Court declined to hear the appeal and remanded the matter to the Workers’ Compensation Court, noting that respondent had not claimed an inability to comply with the order. The respondent next sought a stay of the order from the United States District Court and the Superior Court and, after failing to receive the stay, he filed a motion with the Workers’ Compensation Court claiming an inability to meet the payment obligations “due to circumstances beyond his control, including but limited [sic] to a priority U.S. I. R.S. [sic] [levy] of [$]171,000 upon his bank account.” On January 25, 2010, the day before the hearing on his motion in the Workers’ Compensation Court, respondent filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition on behalf of the PC and then presented that filing to the court during the hearing on his motion, arguing that it automatically stayed any action by the Workers’ Compensation Court. The Chief Judge noted that respondent was also named personally in Stone’s claim, and he set a hearing for that same 2 It is worth mentioning that in respondent’s answer to the U.S. Trustee’s complaint objecting to discharge in Bankruptcy Court, see infra, respondent provided a street address for his residence. -6- afternoon on the issue of whether the bankruptcy stay applied to respondent personally. During the break, respondent filed a petition for personal bankruptcy. Subsequent to the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee for the PC, respondent applied to this Court for a license to practice law as a limited liability company under the name “The Law Offices of Keven A. McKenna, LLC” (the LLC). On February 23, 2011, because respondent had “made no provision for the transfer of any client files to any other entity, nor ha[d] the PC withdrawn its appearance in any pending cases,” this Court entered an order directing respondent to satisfy the Court that the PC would no longer engage in the practice of law. We stated that, until that time, respondent “may continue to practice law in his individual capacity only and not in any corporate form.” On March 24, 2011, respondent withdrew his application for a license to practice law as an LLC. Notwithstanding this Court’s order, respondent continued to use a bank account in the name of “Law Offices of Keven A. McKenna, LLC.” 3 He deposited checks made payable to the LLC, as well as other checks, and he wrote checks for expenses directly related to the practice of law, including the Supreme Court attorney registration fee, Rhode Island Bar Association dues, and court filing fees. These actions form the basis for count 1, alleging respondent’s violation of Rules 3.3, 7.1, 7.5, and 8.4(c) 4 by engaging in the unauthorized practice of law as a limited liability entity in violation of this Court’s order. 3 On or around March 24, 2011, respondent changed the name of the bank account to “McKenna Support Services, LLC”; however, he continued to use checks bearing the name “Law Offices of Keven A. McKenna, LLC” after this date. 4 Article V, Rule 3.3 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct states, in pertinent part: “Candor toward the tribunal. (a) A lawyer shall not knowingly: (1) make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal or fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made to the tribunal by the lawyer * * * .” Rule 7.1 states, in pertinent part: “Communications concerning a lawyer’s services. A lawyer shall not make a false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyer’s services.” -7- During the bankruptcy proceedings for the PC, an issue arose regarding legal services that respondent had provided to the Estate of Amelia Carmone for a number of years prior to filing the bankruptcy petition. Despite having accrued a sizable amount of unpaid fees for legal services provided to this client (hereinafter known as the “Wells receivable” 5), respondent failed to report the existence of this receivable on his initial corporate bankruptcy filing. The respondent filed the required Schedule B disclosure of assets on January 25, 2010, and amended it on May 3, 2010; on neither occasion did he list the Wells receivable. In March 2011, respondent disclosed to the bankruptcy trustee that the Wells receivable amounted to $63,000 and was uncollectable. During this period of time, respondent had been attempting to purchase the PC’s receivables from the trustee for $10,000. On June 7, 2011, respondent appeared in the Probate Court for the Town of Bristol and asserted a lien for attorney’s fees in the amount of $93,000 against real property owned by the Carmone estate, as well as a petition for approval to sell property located at 10 Hope Street in the Town of Bristol, to satisfy the lien. 6 Although respondent represented to the bankruptcy trustee that the receivable was largely uncollectable, he did not disclose that there was real property in the estate that could potentially secure the debt. In addition, respondent did not have authority from the trustee to attempt to collect the debt himself. These actions form the basis for count 2, alleging that respondent violated Rules 3.3 and 8.4(c) by failing to disclose his income to the Bankruptcy Court, misrepresenting his interest in a receivable to that court, and by engaging in Rule 7.5 states, in pertinent part: “Firm names and letterheads. * * * (d) Lawyers may state or imply that they practice in a partnership or other organization only when that is a fact.” Rule 8.4 states, in pertinent part: “Misconduct. It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: * * * (c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation * * * .” 5 John Wells was the successor executor of the estate. 6 This petition was later withdrawn. -8- conduct that amounted to a lack of candor, dishonesty, and misrepresentation to the bankruptcy trustee. On August 4, 2011, the U.S. Trustee filed a complaint objecting to discharge. In his answer to the complaint, respondent neither admitted nor denied a large number of the allegations, including those that were straightforward and clearly within his knowledge; for example, whether he had filed his bankruptcy petition and bankruptcy schedules “under oath” (despite the fact that the petition’s signature page included the language “I declare under penalty of perjury that the information provided in this petition is true and correct” and that the bankruptcy schedules contained similar language); whether he had a “Wells receivable” as property of the PC’s bankruptcy estate; and whether the exhibits to the complaint, viz., copies of his motions in the Bristol Probate Court to collect attorney’s fees for the work performed regarding the Wells receivable, were “true and accurate” copies of his own pleadings. Subsequent to the U.S. Trustee’s complaint, respondent filed an application for waiver of discharge; the waiver was granted, and the Trustee dismissed the complaint. The respondent’s actions in Bankruptcy Court, as well as his actions during the lengthy Workers’ Compensation Court hearings, form the basis for count 4, alleging that he violated Rules 3.3 and 3.5(d) 7 by engaging in conduct before both tribunals that demonstrated a lack of candor, as well as an attempt to disrupt these tribunals. On September 12, 2011, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel issued a subpoena to respondent, directing him to produce the records identified in Rule 1.19(a)(1)-(8) 8 and to testify regarding the 7 Rule 3.5(d) states, in pertinent part: “Impartiality and decorum of the tribunal. A lawyer shall not: * * * engage in conduct intended to disrupt a tribunal.” 8 Article V, Rule 1.19(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct requires that: “A lawyer shall maintain for seven (7) years after the events which they record: -9- veracity and completeness of the production. The respondent appeared at the deposition but failed to produce the requested records. Instead, he challenged the authority of Assistant Disciplinary Counsel to issue the subpoena, and he stated that he needed more time. The respondent’s failure to comply with the subpoena is the basis of count 3, alleging a violation of Rule 1.19. 9 “(1) The records of all deposits in and withdrawals from special accounts specified in Rule 1.15 and of any other bank account which records the operations of the lawyer’s practice of law. These records shall specifically identify the date, source and description of each item deposited, as well as the date, payee and purpose of each withdrawal or disbursement. “(2) A record for special accounts, showing the source of all funds deposited in such accounts, the names of all persons for whom the funds are or were held, the amount of such funds, the description and amounts, and the names of all persons to whom such funds were disbursed. “(3) Copies of all retainer and compensation agreements with clients. “(4) Copies of all statements to clients or other persons showing the disbursement of funds to them or on their behalf. “(5) Copies of all bills rendered to clients. “(6) Copies of all records showing payments to lawyers, investigators or other persons, not in the lawyer’s regular employ, for services rendered or performed. “(7) Copies of all retainer agreements and closing statements. “(8) All checkbooks and check stubs, bank statements, pre- numbered cancelled checks and duplicate deposit slips with respect to the special accounts specified in Rule 1.15 and any other bank account which records the operations of the lawyer’s practice of law.” 9 Rule 1.19(g) provides: “A lawyer who does not maintain and keep the accounts and records as specified and required by this Disciplinary Rule, or who does not produce any such records pursuant to this Rule shall be deemed in violation of these Rules and shall be subject to disciplinary proceedings.” - 10 - III Disciplinary Proceedings A series of eight hearings was conducted before a three-member panel of the board, during which both respondent and Assistant Disciplinary Counsel examined witnesses and entered exhibits into evidence. In addition to challenging the authority of the panel to hear the matter, as well as the authority of this Court to regulate attorneys, respondent argued that there was no basis for sanctions. Specifically as to count 1, respondent argued that, after the February 2011 order of this Court, he changed the name and purpose of his LLC to “McKenna Support Services, LLC” and used the bank account established under that LLC name to pay his employees, his rent, and his expenses. The respondent argued that the use of the account and the checks bearing the name of the former LLC did not constitute the practice of law, and that he had continued to use these checks as a mere matter of convenience. Regarding count 2, respondent argued that he had made no false statements on his bankruptcy filings, and that he valued the Wells receivable at $63,000 because “[n]ot all of the estate[’s] billing had been posted” and the unbilled time increased the value to $93,000. With respect to count 3, respondent argued that he had brought records to the deposition, although he made them available for inspection only, and not for copying. Further, respondent averred that he had invited Assistant Disciplinary Counsel to his law office to inspect the records there, an invitation that was declined. Finally, as to count 4, respondent argued that his actions in Workers’ Compensation Court and Bankruptcy Court are outside this Court’s jurisdiction. He further represented that there was no evidence that he had engaged in conduct intended to disrupt any tribunal. - 11 - The panel found that there was clear and convincing evidence that respondent had violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in counts 1, 2, 3, and 4. Regarding count 1, the panel found that “[r]espondent’s use of the ‘LLC’ designation in his deposit slip/letterhead constitutes a ‘material misrepresentation of fact or law’ and is false and misleading * * * .” Further, the panel found that respondent’s testimony “by which he attempted to justify and/or excuse” these actions was “palpably disingenuous.” As to count 2, the panel found that respondent “engaged in a course of conduct deliberately designed to hide the existence, value and collectability of the Wells Receivable.” This conduct included making false statements of material fact, failing to disclose material facts, and offering evidence that respondent knew to be false. Regarding count 3, the panel found that respondent admitted that he did not bring all of the records requested to either his deposition or the hearing, and that his invitation to Assistant Disciplinary Counsel to inspect the records at his law office did nothing to mitigate this failure. Because the subpoena directed him to produce the records at the office of Disciplinary Counsel, he was duty bound to do so. As to count 4, the panel found that during the Workers’ Compensation Court proceedings, respondent was “flippant, evasive, dilatory and disruptive.” The panel noted that it was “disturbed by [respondent’s] disrespect” for the judge who was presiding over that hearing, particularly respondent’s repeated refusal to answer simple questions posed by the court, as well as respondent’s employing the threat of a lawsuit to support his motion to recuse that judge. Finally, the panel found that respondent “was deliberately and unnecessarily disruptive and dilatory, disrespectful to the [c]ourt including the judge and opposing counsel, combative, evasive[,] unresponsive, disputatious and pugnacious in both his testimony and in his actions as counsel for himself” before that court. - 12 - The panel rejected respondent’s argument that he was being subjected to disciplinary action because of his “controversial positions on constitutional issues.” Rather, the panel concluded that “the allegations [were] sufficiently serious to warrant a recommendation for a disciplinary sanction.” The panel recommended a one-year suspension from the practice of law. On May 13, 2014, the panel’s recommendation was approved and adopted by the board. IV Discussion Pursuant to Article III, Rule 6(d) of the Supreme Court Rules of Disciplinary Procedure for Attorneys, it became our unenviable task to review the record submitted by the board to determine whether a forty-year member of the bar should be disciplined for his conduct. Mindful of the gravity of this proceeding, we undertook a thorough review of the record, particularly the transcripts of the proceedings in Workers’ Compensation Court and the hearings before the panel. Because respondent has raised numerous objections based on constitutional arguments, we shall first address these concerns, and we will then discuss the findings of the board. A Respondent’s Constitutional Claims Throughout the course of these disciplinary proceedings, respondent has repeatedly asserted claims of constitutional violations. 10 While these claims have been inserted in a piecemeal, repetitive fashion into nearly all of respondent’s filings with this Court and with the board, we have parsed them into two general areas of concern: (1) he challenges the authority of 10 The respondent has filed four substantive motions with this Court: (1) a motion to stay these proceedings pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-33-2; (2) a motion to recuse the justices of this Court; (3) a motion to dismiss counts 2 and 4; and (4) a motion to dismiss count 3. - 13 - this Court to regulate attorneys, as well as its and the board’s jurisdiction over matters of attorney discipline; and (2) he alleges that the proceedings before the board and this Court have violated his procedural due process rights. 11 We will address these contentions in turn. 12 1. This Court’s Authority and Jurisdiction The respondent challenges the authority of this Court to regulate attorneys, as well as its and the board’s jurisdiction over matters of attorney discipline. More specifically, respondent contends that this Court’s power is limited to appellate jurisdiction over statutory courts and/or that the judiciary’s inherent power is limited to adjudicating cases and controversies. He appears to argue that this Court’s creation of disciplinary procedures and the disciplinary board, as well as this Court’s promulgation of rules of professional conduct, are exercises of legislative power not delegated by the General Assembly and are, therefore, violative of the doctrine of separation of powers. Contrary to respondent’s protestations, “[i]t is well settled that the authority of the Supreme Court to discipline the members of the bar * * * is plenary in nature.” In re Lallo, 768 A.2d 921, 924 (R.I. 2001). As this Court explained almost eighty years ago: 11 We note that respondent’s motions and memoranda are less than models of clarity, and we have employed our best efforts to decipher and address his various constitutional claims. The following verbatim quote is but one example of the manner in which respondent composed his memoranda submitted to this Court: “It was a violation of due process to have been civilly prosecuted by a persons appointed by the Supreme Court to prosecute for McKenna for violations created by illegal legislative actions of the R.I. Supreme Court. It was violation of Due Process to have those self-legislated rules enforced by the Judicial Bank and not be enforced by Executive regulatory appointment not appointed by the Governor.” 12 The respondent also appears to claim that the disciplinary process has violated his rights under the First Amendment; however, his discussion of this issue is perfunctory at best, and certainly insufficient to form a cognizable claim for us to address. See Manchester v. Pereira, 926 A.2d 1005, 1015 n.8 (R.I. 2007) (repeating well-established rule that this Court will not substantively address an issue that is not adequately briefed). - 14 - “In Rhode Island, at least since the adoption of the State Constitution, [the power to license attorneys and admit them to practice] has been vested in this [C]ourt. The General Assembly has conceded this by section 2, chapter 322, G.L. 1923, wherein it is declared that: ‘The [S]upreme [C]ourt * * * shall by general or special rules regulate the admission of attorneys to practice in all the courts of the state.’[13] This language has long been accepted by common consent to be declaratory of the power inherent in this [C]ourt to control and supervise the practice of law generally, whether in or out of court. A careful examination of the public laws, even before the adoption of the Constitution, and as far back as the year 1800, fails to reveal an enactment of the General Assembly assuming to regulate the matter by statute. On the other hand, there is ample evidence of the exercise of this power as a matter of course by the Superior Court of Judicature established in 1746-47 which was the predecessor of this [C]ourt until 1798, when it became the Supreme Judicial Court.” Rhode Island Bar Association v. Automobile Service Association, 55 R.I. 122, 129- 30, 179 A. 139, 142 (1935). 14 “This broadbased power includes the power to supervise, administrate, discipline, and serve the needs of the public in all facets of the courts.” In the Matter of Almeida, 611 A.2d 1375, 1381 (R.I. 1992), superseded by statute on other grounds, Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 73- 74 (R.I. 2011). It further includes “the authority to exercise necessary means to regulate and control the practice of law by promulgating and enforcing rules to discipline attorneys.” Id. at 1382. “Since the early days of English common law, it has been widely recognized that courts possess the inherent power to regulate the conduct of attorneys who practice before them and to discipline or disbar such of those attorneys as are guilty of unprofessional conduct.” Howell v. State Bar of Texas, 843 F.2d 205, 206 (5th Cir. 1988); see In re Snyder, 472 U.S. 634, 643 (1985) (“Courts have long recognized an inherent authority to suspend or disbar lawyers. * * * This inherent power derives from the lawyer’s role as an officer of the court which granted 13 This statute is now codified at G.L. 1956 § 8-1-2. 14 This Court went on to explain the historical roots of this institutional structure in common law England. See Rhode Island Bar Association v. Automobile Service Association, 55 R.I. 122, 132-33, 179 A. 139, 143-44 (1935). - 15 - admission.”); see also In re Petition of Almond, 603 A.2d 1087, 1087 (R.I. 1992) (“This court is responsible for promulgating rules regulating the practice of law and ethical standards for the conduct of attorneys admitted to the Rhode Island Bar.”). 15 The passage of the separation of powers amendments in 2004 did not in any way dilute, but rather served to solidify and strengthen, this inherent judicial authority. In 2004, article 5 of the Rhode Island Constitution was amended to provide that the powers of the Rhode Island government are distributed into “three separate and distinct departments: the legislative, executive and judicial.” R.I. const., art. 5. “In practice, this doctrine operates to confine legislative powers to the legislature, executive powers to the executive department, and judicial powers to the judiciary * * * .” In re Request for Advisory Opinion from House of Representatives (Coastal Resources Management Council), 961 A.2d 930, 933 (R.I. 2008). Just as “the separation of powers amendments did not, either explicitly or implicitly,[] limit or abolish the power of the General Assembly in any other area where we have previously found its jurisdiction to be plenary,” see id. at 935-36, the separation of powers amendments reinforced the judiciary’s previously recognized plenary powers, including the power to regulate the practice of law. See State v. Germane, 971 A.2d 555, 590 (R.I. 2009) (separation of powers doctrine prohibits “unwarranted legislative invasion of the judicial power”). Accordingly, this Court has the authority, as it has had since its inception, to promulgate and enforce rules of conduct and procedure for the regulation of attorneys, as well as to exercise necessary means to regulate and control the practice of law. This includes appointing 15 See also G.L. 1956 § 8-6-2 (judicial authority to promulgate rules of practice and procedure); G.L. 1956 § 11-27-18 (recognizing right of this Court to regulate and discipline members of the bar); G.L. 1956 § 7-5.1-2(2) (identifying the Supreme Court as the regulatory agency for attorneys at law); G.L. 1956 § 7-16-3.1 (applying § 7-5.1-2(2) to professional limited liability companies). - 16 - disciplinary counsel, creating the board to carry out this Court’s disciplinary powers, and subpoenaing witnesses and materials in investigations related to attorney misconduct. Next, respondent claims that the appointment of disciplinary counsel as a “special prosecutor” and use of the subpoena power are exercises of the executive power and violate the separation of powers doctrine, and he also maintains that the General Assembly has not delegated the subpoena power to the Supreme Court. We can find no legitimate basis for respondent’s assertion that the subpoena power is an executive power or that it must be delegated to the judiciary by the General Assembly. See, e.g., State v. Guido, 698 A.2d 729, 734 (R.I. 1997) (recognizing “the subpoena power of the judiciary”); Bartlett v. Danti, 503 A.2d 515, 517 (R.I. 1986) (same); Donatelli Building Co. v. Cranston Loan Co., 87 R.I. 293, 297, 140 A.2d 705, 707 (1958) (recognizing court’s inherent power to issue subpoenas); see also Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400, 409 (1988) (“To ensure that justice is done, it is imperative to the function of courts that compulsory process be available for the production of evidence * * * ”) (quoting United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 709 (1974)). The Court, the board, and lawyers licensed to practice in Rhode Island, as officers of the Court, including Disciplinary Counsel, may all properly exercise the judiciary’s inherent subpoena power. See In re Snyder, 472 U.S. at 644 (recognizing that “as an officer of the court, a lawyer can cause persons to drop their private affairs and be called as witnesses in court, and for depositions and other pretrial processes,” although “subject to the ultimate control of the court”). Similarly, respondent’s contention that this Court’s appointment of an Assistant Disciplinary Counsel as a “special prosecutor” is a violation of the separation of powers doctrine—contrary to the advisory opinion in In re House of Representatives (Special Prosecutor), 575 A.2d 176 (R.I. 1990)—is misguided. In that matter, at the request of the House - 17 - of Representatives, the five members of this Court issued an advisory opinion, opining that proposed legislation relating to the appointment of special prosecutors by the Chief Justice for crimes involving public officials was unconstitutional. See id. at 176-77, 180. The justices reasoned that, under the principle of separation of powers, the legislation impermissibly encroached upon the power of the judiciary and threatened its independence. See id. at 178-79. It did so by permitting the Chief Justice both to appoint and supervise special prosecutors (which included defining the scope of the special prosecutors’ jurisdiction, releasing the special prosecutors’ findings to the public, and removing special prosecutors) and to review on appeal any felony prosecutions tried by the special prosecutor. Id. at 179. The justices concluded that these conflicting roles by the Chief Justice “threaten[ed] the institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch.” Id. (quoting Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 851 (1986)). The proposed legislation at issue in In re House of Representatives impermissibly transferred to the judiciary a fundamental executive power—specifically, the “power and discretion to prosecute crimes”—which power is vested in the Office of the Attorney General by the Rhode Island Constitution. See In re House of Representatives, 575 A.2d at 179-80; see also R.I. Const., art. 9, sec. 12. In contrast, the role and function of disciplinary counsel appointed by this Court is a means to carry out an inherent judicial function: the regulation of attorneys. Furthermore, this Court is not, in the context of attorney discipline, jeopardizing its function as the court of last resort of criminal matters. Rather, this Court is the only tribunal with authority over matters of attorney discipline. See In re Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline, 916 A.2d 746, 751 (R.I. 2007) (noting that this Court has “steadfastly held” that the authority of this Court to discipline the bar and bench is “plenary and exclusive”). This Court has established - 18 - disciplinary procedures that allow initial screening and review by the board, with the assistance of Disciplinary Counsel, in order to safeguard the due process rights of attorneys subject to discipline. Furthermore, in the event an attorney disciplinary proceeding uncovers the possibility that a crime may have been committed, such matters are referred to the Office of the Attorney General to investigate and act on in accordance with its prosecutorial discretion. The respondent further argues that this Court does not have jurisdiction over attorney conduct outside of the Supreme Court’s proceedings and, specifically, that attorney conduct in the Workers’ Compensation Court, the Federal Bankruptcy Court, and “professional offices” falls outside of this Court’s jurisdiction. The respondent’s contention that this Court’s jurisdiction over attorney conduct is limited to actions in the Supreme Court is not warranted in law or fact. Not only would respondent’s argument render much of the professional rules of conduct nugatory, it is contrary to the well- established “power inherent in this [C]ourt to control and supervise the practice of law generally, whether in or out of court.” Rhode Island Bar Association, 55 R.I. at 129-30, 179 A. at 142 (emphasis added). Especially considering how few attorneys come before the Supreme Court and how infrequent such appearances are by the majority of attorneys who practice in this state, such a rule would utterly prevent this Court from protecting the public from incompetent, unethical, or irresponsible representation. Rather, the ethical standards imposed on attorneys historically have extended—and do still extend—beyond the courtroom. See id. at 134, 179 A. at 144 (in the English colonies, “[a]dmission to the bar meant admission to practice law, and admission to practice law comprehended all the activities of a lawyer in advising and assisting - 19 - others in all matters of law both in and out of court”). 16 Indeed, over a century ago, this Court recognized: “[A]ny conduct which demonstrates a moral condition inconsistent with the proper appreciation and discharge of professional duties and obligations may also form a just basis for disbarment or the imposition of some lesser punishment. In fact, any conduct which would preclude admission to the bar might well justify a disbarment thereafter, whether such conduct be associated with the discharge of strictly professional duties and obligations or clearly separated therefrom.” Crafts v. Lizotte, 34 R.I. 543, 546, 84 A. 1081, 1082 (1912). 17 In accordance with these principles, it is undeniable that this Court may investigate and discipline attorney conduct regardless of where that conduct takes place. Attorneys licensed in Rhode Island are held to the same professional standards whether they are practicing in the Workers’ Compensation Court, in another state court, or in a local federal court. Indeed, this Court has regularly applied Rhode Island’s Rules of Professional Conduct to attorneys practicing in the local federal district court. See, e.g., In the Matter of Schiff, 677 A.2d 422, 423, 425 (R.I. 1996) (suspending attorney from the practice of law for eighteen months for her violation of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct after she submitted a materially false affidavit to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island); In re Petition of Almond, 603 A.2d at 1087, 1090 (denying a federal prosecutor’s petition for waiver of Article V, Rule 3.8 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct, which had been based on his contention that 16 See Rhode Island Bar Association, 55 R.I. at 134-35, 179 A. at 144-45 for an historical and in- depth discussion rejecting the argument that the regulation of lawyers should be limited to conduct occurring in court. 17 See also Rhode Island Bar Association, 55 R.I. at 135, 179 A. at 144 (quoting the Supreme Court of South Carolina, in In Re Duncan, 65 S.E. 210, 211 (S.C. 1909), as stating that “[i]t is too obvious for discussion that the practice of law is not limited to the conduct of cases in courts”); Anderson v. Bosworth, 15 R.I. 443, 445, 8 A. 339, 341 (1887) (“it is now well settled that the jurisdiction [of the court’s disciplinary power] extends to any matter in which an attorney has been employed by reason of his professional character”). - 20 - the rule conflicted with federal rules and standards and was a violation of the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution). Further, attorneys are held to the same ethical standards whether they are practicing in court, in a professional office, at home, on the street, over the phone, in a coffee shop, or anywhere else. There are no geographic or location-specific limitations to an attorney’s ethical obligations. Next, respondent claims that the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution prevents this Court from exercising authority over attorney conduct in federal courts. “In analyzing a claim under the supremacy clause, it is axiomatic that the supremacy clause is relevant only when there is impermissible state interference with federal law.” In re Petition of Almond, 603 A.2d at 1090 (citing Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U.S. 707, 712 (1985)). In the instant matter, there is no such interference because the state and federal courts have consistently been in harmony as to the proper ethical conduct of attorneys practicing in their respective courts. For instance, the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island has adopted the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct (and any additional standards of conduct set forth in its local rules). See Rule 208 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. In order to practice in the federal Bankruptcy Court in Rhode Island, an attorney must be in good standing with the bar of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island and must be admitted to practice in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. See Rule 9010-1(a) of the Rules of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island. Further, there is no indication that these disciplinary proceedings in any way disrupted the bankruptcy proceedings in federal court, which continued to transpire without interruption from this Court, the board, or Disciplinary - 21 - Counsel. Nor has respondent contended that any specific disciplinary charge or applicable Rule of Professional Conduct interferes with a particular federal rule or law. Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, this Court may exercise jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary matters generally, and over respondent specifically. 2. Due Process The respondent raises numerous concerns implicating his procedural due process rights under the federal and state constitutions. First, he contends he was denied his procedural due process right to “present evidence and argue law” and to be heard by the “full board.” Second, he appears to be arguing that, because this Court promulgates and enforces the Rules of Professional Conduct, appoints persons to the board, hires disciplinary counsel, and ultimately determines whether and how to discipline an attorney for misconduct, this amounts to a constitutionally infirm merger of investigatory, prosecutorial, and adjudicatory functions so as to deny respondent procedural due process. 18 Both the federal and state constitutions provide that no person shall be deprived of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. Amend. XIV; R.I. Const. art. 1, sec. 2. This Court has quoted the United States Supreme Court in explaining that “[t]he Due Process Clause provides that certain substantive rights—life, liberty, and property—cannot be deprived except pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures. The categories of substance and procedure are distinct.” Germane, 971 A.2d at 574 (quoting Cleveland Board of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985)). “The guarantee of procedural due process assures that 18 The respondent also contends that he was fined by the Workers’ Compensation Court without an evidentiary hearing. This question is not properly before this Court; review of that contention would require a writ of certiorari issued to the Appellate Division of the Workers’ Compensation Court. See G.L. 1956 § 28-35-30; McGloin v. Trammellcrow Services, Inc., 987 A.2d 881, 885 (R.I. 2010). - 22 - there will be fair and adequate legal proceedings, while substantive due process acts as a bar against ‘certain arbitrary, wrongful government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.’” Id. (quoting L.A. Ray Realty v. Town Council of Cumberland, 698 A.2d 202, 210 (R.I. 1997)). When addressing procedural due process concerns, this Court “ha[s] previously employed the three-part test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 * * * (1976).” Germane, 971 A.2d at 574. Under the Mathews test, three factors are to be considered in determining whether a procedure violates due process: “First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.” Germane, 971 A.2d at 574- 75 (quoting Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335). As to the first factor, it is undisputed that respondent’s license to practice law in this state, which has been in place for forty continuous years, is a property interest sufficient to invoke due process protections. See Barry v. Barchi, 443 U.S. 55, 64 (1979); Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners of New Mexico, 353 U.S. 232, 238-39 (1957); see also Mackey v. Montrym, 443 U.S. 1, 10 n.7 (1979). As to the third factor, it appears respondent does not dispute that the state has an interest in regulating attorneys. 19 Regarding the second factor, the state’s interest in regulating attorneys must be enforced with sufficient procedural safeguards as to protect an attorney’s property interest in his license to practice. “[A]n essential principle of due process is that a deprivation of 19 The respondent appears to dispute, instead, which government branch has authority to do so; this issue has been addressed supra. - 23 - life, liberty, or property be preceded by notice and opportunity for hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.” Germane, 971 A.2d at 579 (quoting Loudermill, 470 U.S. at 542); see In re Ruffalo, 390 U.S. 544, 550 (1968) (an attorney subject to discipline must be afforded fair notice of the charge and a meaningful opportunity to respond). Although respondent contends that he was not able to “present evidence and argue law” and was denied a hearing by the full board, 20 it is indisputable that respondent was given a meaningful opportunity to be heard. A panel of the board convened and conducted eight hearings on this matter over an eight-month period, heard testimony from respondent and other witnesses, admitted numerous exhibits from both Disciplinary Counsel and respondent, and gave respondent the opportunity to present and argue numerous motions. The respondent was also permitted to submit to the board a post-hearing memorandum summarizing his position on the facts and law. Furthermore, due process does not require a hearing before the full board; hearings held before a panel of the board are appropriate to the nature of disciplinary matters. See Barber v. Exeter-West Greenwich School Committee, 418 A.2d 13, 20 (R.I. 1980) (“[d]ue process is a flexible concept and the degree of protection afforded to an individual may vary with the particular situation”). Accordingly, the principle of notice and a hearing has been complied with in this case. The due process clause also guarantees a hearing before a tribunal that is not “biased or otherwise indisposed from rendering a fair and impartial decision.” La Petite Auberge, Inc. v. Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights, 419 A.2d 274, 283 (R.I. 1980); see Champlin’s Realty Associates v. Tikoian, 989 A.2d 427, 443 (R.I. 2010). “[T]he mere existence of a combination of ‘investigatory, inquisitorial, and adjudicative roles in a single administrative 20 The respondent has not alleged that he did not receive proper notice of the charges or hearing. - 24 - body’ does not amount to a denial of due process or signify that the agency’s structure or operations is subject to constitutional attack.” In re Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline, 916 A.2d at 750 (quoting La Petite Auberge, Inc., 419 A.2d at 284). The United States Supreme Court has explained that, “in order to challenge an administrative process successfully on the grounds of a combination of incompatible functions, a respondent must show that the procedures ‘pos[e] such a risk of actual bias or prejudgment that the practice must be forbidden if the guarantee of due process is to be adequately implemented.’” La Petite Auberge, Inc., 419 A.2d at 284 (quoting Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 47 (1975)). This Court has recognized that “the procedures employed in a modern administrative agency that allots ‘the prosecutorial function to a staff of attorneys or other personnel who will not participate in the eventual decision, is a common and recommended feature of American administrative enforcement activity.’” In re Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline, 916 A.2d at 751 (quoting La Petite Auberge, Inc., 419 A.2d at 284). “[A]cceptable accommodation can be reached between the needs for aggressive enforcement of [the] public-interest * * * and fairness to individual * * * respondents, within the framework of a single agency’s organizational processes.” La Petite Auberge, Inc., 419 A.2d at 285. The attorney disciplinary procedures in this state are designed in such a way that complaints against attorneys are addressed fairly in accordance with state and federal law. As discussed above, this Court steadfastly has held that “the authority of this Court to discipline [attorneys] is plenary and exclusive.” In re Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline, 916 A.2d at 751. The fact that this Court promulgates and enforces attorney disciplinary rules, - 25 - appoints board members, and hires disciplinary counsel to enforce these rules is typical of administrative enforcement. 21 There is absolutely no indication from this Court’s Rules of Disciplinary Procedure or the record of the present case that the same individuals are involved in the building of an adversarial case and the deciding of the issues, or that other special circumstances make the risk of unfairness intolerably high. All investigations, whether upon complaint or otherwise, are initiated and conducted by Disciplinary Counsel who presents recommendations to the board but does not participate in the board’s decision. See Rule 6(a), (b). Furthermore, the board may commence formal proceedings only after a screening panel finds probable cause to believe the respondent-attorney is guilty of misconduct (although a respondent-attorney may demand formal proceedings as of right). See id. These procedures ensure unbiased review of charges of attorney misconduct while safeguarding against any “risk of actual bias or prejudgment.” La Petite Auberge, Inc., 419 A.2d at 285 (quoting Withrow, 421 U.S. at 47). Additionally, the board’s role is restricted to making recommendations to this Court. See Art. III, Rules 4(d)(2) and 6(d) of the Supreme Court Rules of Disciplinary Procedure. Upon a finding of attorney misconduct, it is the responsibility of the board to recommend a sanction, including, but not limited to, public censure, suspension, or disbarment; however, the board’s decisions are not final and it lacks enforcement authority. See Rules 4 and 6(d). Because of the board’s limited authority, this Court is obligated to review the record and the evidence adduced by the board, in order to enter an appropriate order. See Rule 6(d). Any proceedings before this Court are to be conducted by Disciplinary Counsel, which again ensures the separation of 21 See, e.g., G.L. 1956 chapter 17.1 of title 42 and chapter 17.7 of title 42 (creating the state Department of Environmental Management, granting it the power to issue its own rules and regulations and to hire and appoint enforcement personnel, and establishing a process of adjudication of disputed enforcement actions). - 26 - adversarial and adjudicatory functions. See id. Accordingly, we are not persuaded by respondent’s apparent argument that the procedures utilized result in a merger of investigatory, prosecutorial, and adjudicatory functions such that his right to due process was denied. The respondent’s motions to dismiss counts 2, 3, and 4 are therefore denied. B Respondent’s Motion to Recuse Next, respondent has moved to recuse the members of this Court, claiming a procedural due process violation and a violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct based on allegations of personal hostility toward—and bias against—him by members of this Court. He asserts three bases for these allegations: (1) Assistant Disciplinary Counsel was appointed by this Court; (2) the chair of the panel that heard respondent’s case applied to the Chief Justice to be appointed a magistrate during the course of the disciplinary proceedings; and (3) the members of this Court are “friendly” with a retired Chief Justice, who “[r]eportedly * * * has a bias toward [respondent].” As mentioned above, the due process clause “entitles a person to an impartial and disinterested tribunal.” Marshall v. Jerrico, Inc., 446 U.S. 238, 242 (1980). However, “[a] respondent who raises this sort of irregularity must overcome a ‘presumption of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators.’” La Petite Auberge, Inc., 419 A.2d at 284 (quoting Withrow, 421 U.S. at 47). “This presumption may be overcome through evidence that ‘the same person(s) involved in building one party’s adversarial case is also adjudicating the determinative issues’ or if ‘other special circumstances render the risk of unfairness intolerably high.’” Champlin’s Realty Associates, 989 A.2d at 443 (quoting Kent County Water Authority v. State (Department of Health), 723 A.2d 1132, 1137 (R.I. 1999)). - 27 - Likewise, Article VI of the Supreme Court Code of Judicial Conduct requires that judges “avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of [their] activities” and “perform the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently.” Code of Judicial Conduct Canons 2, 3. Thus, “judicial officers are duty-bound to recuse themselves if they are ‘unable to render a fair or an impartial decision in a particular case.’” Ryan v. Roman Catholic Bishop of Providence, 941 A.2d 174, 185 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Kelly v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 740 A.2d 1243, 1246 (R.I. 1999)). Absent actual bias, the code provides that “[a] judge shall disqualify himself or herself in a proceeding in which the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned * * * .” Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 3E1. The pertinent inquiry in this regard is whether “a reasonable person might question [the judge’s] ability to remain impartial in hearing the case,” particularly where facts exist “that would prompt a reasonable question in the mind of a well-informed person about the judge’s capacity for impartiality * * * .” In re Bulger, 710 F.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 2013). While judicial officers are obligated to recuse themselves under necessitating circumstances, they “have an equally great obligation not to disqualify themselves when there is no sound reason to do so.” State v. Mlyniec, 15 A.3d 983, 999 (R.I. 2011) (quoting Ryan, 941 A.2d at 185). “The burden is on the party seeking recusal to set forth facts establishing that the justice possesses a ‘personal bias or prejudice by reason of a preconceived or settled opinion of a character calculated to impair his [or her] impartiality seriously and to sway his or her judgment.’” Id. (quoting Mattatall v. State, 947 A.2d 896, 902 (R.I. 2008)). Here, respondent has failed to provide any facts that would demonstrate either bias or the appearance of bias. First, as explained above, this Court’s appointment of Assistant Disciplinary Counsel does not constitute a structural defect in violation of the due process clause; and, for the - 28 - same reasons, it does not present an issue of bias warranting recusal. Second, respondent appears to assert that the justices of this Court harbor personal animus towards him because the retired Chief Justice serves the Court in the capacity of an appellate mediator and is “friendly” with members of the Court. Assuming, arguendo, that the former Chief Justice has a bias toward respondent, the former Chief Justice’s cordial relationship with the current members of this Court is insufficient to impute bias or the appearance of bias. Similarly, respondent implies that the current Chief Justice of this Court may harbor bias against respondent because a member of the panel had applied to this Court for appointment to a magistrate position during the time when this disciplinary matter was pending. 22 This fact alone does not demonstrate bias by the Chief Justice in this proceeding, and respondent has not supported his serious allegations with any additional relevant facts. Instead, he appears content to rest his claims on mere conjecture. As we have previously stated, “[r]ecusal is not in order by a mere accusation that is totally unsupported by substantial fact.” Mlyniec, 15 A.3d at 1000 (quoting State v. Clark, 423 A.2d 1151, 1158 (R.I. 1980)). We do not take motions for recusal lightly, but in this case respondent has simply failed to establish any facts showing our apparent or actual bias. Accordingly, his motion to recuse the members of this Court is denied. C Respondent’s Motion to Stay Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-33-2 In addition to his constitutional objections, respondent has moved this Court to stay the proceedings pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 9-33-2, commonly referred to as the “anti-SLAPP” statute, arguing that “[t]he purpose of the activities of [disciplinary counsel] who was hired by this Court 22 The member of the panel in question was not appointed to the position. - 29 - is to chill the free speech rights of Keven A. McKenna as an attorney by having his [sic] suspended from the practice of law for pre-textual minor allegations * * * .” “The General Assembly enacted the anti-SLAPP statute in order to ‘prevent vexatious lawsuits against citizens who exercise their First Amendment rights of free speech and legitimate petitioning’ under the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions ‘by granting those activities conditional immunity from punitive civil claims.’” Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144, 150 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Alves v. Hometown Newspapers, Inc., 857 A.2d 743, 752 (R.I. 2004)). “Section 9-33-2 provides that, when that conditional immunity attaches, it renders ‘the petitioner or speaker immune from any civil claims for statements, or petitions, that were not sham by virtue of being objectively or subjectively baseless.’” Id. (quoting Global Waste Recycling, Inc. v. Mallette, 762 A.2d 1208, 1211 (R.I. 2000)). The purpose and application of the anti-SLAPP statute are wholly inapplicable to attorney disciplinary proceedings. The respondent is not being sued for his exercise of First Amendment rights of free speech; rather, he is the subject of a disciplinary complaint, deriving from his conduct as a licensed attorney, brought by Disciplinary Counsel under the rules of this Court after a thorough investigation. We find no merit in respondent’s claim that this process is somehow being used as a vehicle for chilling his free speech rights, nor in his claim that the anti- SLAPP statute has any applicability to this type of proceeding. Accordingly, we deny respondent’s motion to stay these proceedings pursuant to § 9-33-2. D The Disciplinary Board’s Findings In addressing the board’s findings on the four counts, we begin by noting that no client has brought this complaint, and there is no allegation that respondent ever improperly accessed - 30 - any client funds. That is one circumstance that sets this apart from many of the disciplinary cases that make their way to this Court. However, it is the responsibility of this Court to give force and effect to all of the Rules of Professional Conduct. In doing so, we are mindful of the high threshold of ethical conduct expected of members of the bar in this state. Aspiring lawyers are required to pass the Multi-State Professional Responsibility Examination 23 and to successfully undergo a character and fitness interview. Law students customarily take a course in professional ethics, during which they are schooled in the high ethical standards expected of an officer of the court. Newly admitted attorneys are required to take a day-long “Bridge the Gap” course, which focuses heavily on professional ethics. It is our intent that all lawyers hold a healthy respect for the Rules of Professional Conduct, and that they carry forward in their careers the oath they swore upon entering this profession: “[I] solemnly swear that in the exercise of the office of attorney and counselor [I] will do no falsehood, nor consent to any being done; [I] will not wittingly or willingly promote, sue or cause to be sued any false or unlawful suit; or give aid, or consent to the same; [I] will delay no man’s cause for lucre or malice; [I] will in all respects demean [myself] as an attorney and counselor of this [C]ourt and of all other courts before which [I] may practice uprightly and according to law, with fidelity as well to the court as to [my] client; and that [I] will support the constitution and laws of this state, and the constitution and laws of the United States. So help [me] God.” Article II, Rule 8 of the Supreme Court Rules for Admission of Attorneys and Others to Practice Law. It is our expectation that newly admitted attorneys will observe adherence to that oath reflected in the practice of the more senior members of the bar. 23 “Any applicant for the bar examination shall be required to have obtained a Multi-State Professional Responsibility Examination (MPRE) scaled score of 80 in order to be eligible to sit for the Rhode Island bar examination.” Note to Article II, Rule 1 of the Supreme Court Rules for Admission of Attorneys and Others to Practice Law. - 31 - We do not question respondent’s fidelity to the constitution—even if, from time to time, we disagree with his interpretation of that document. However, the role of attorney demands more. There are dozens of rules that govern professional conduct which, read together, demand a high level of ethics and professionalism from members of this bar. We cannot maintain the integrity of the profession if we ignore persistent, intentional, and repeated violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Neither can we hold young attorneys to the standards we have set if we allow more senior, seasoned members of the bar to flout those rules with impunity. In his brief summarizing the hearings before the panel, respondent stated that “[t]he cliché that lawyers are ‘officers’ of the Supreme Courts [sic] is no more than a cliché.” We beg to differ. An attorney’s position as an officer of the court is a sacred trust. “Courts have long recognized an inherent authority to suspend or disbar lawyers. * * * This inherent power derives from the lawyer’s role as an officer of the court which granted admission.” In re Snyder, 472 U.S. at 643. An officer of the court is a person “who is charged with upholding the law and administering the judicial system. Typically * * * a judge, clerk, bailiff, sheriff, or the like, but the term also applies to a lawyer, who is obliged to obey court rules and who owes a duty of candor to the court.” Black’s Law Dictionary, 1259 (10th ed. 2014). “‘[T]he courts not only demand [lawyers’] loyalty, confidence and respect but also require them to function in a manner which will foster public confidence in the profession and, consequently, the judicial system.’” In re Griffiths, 413 U.S. 717, 723-24 (1973). Benjamin Cardozo, then Chief Justice of the New York Court of Appeals, wrote: “‘Membership in the bar is a privilege burdened with conditions.’ * * * [An attorney is] received into that ancient fellowship for something more than private gain. He [becomes] an officer of the court, and, like the court itself, an instrument or agency to advance the ends of justice. His co-operation with the court [is] due, whenever justice would be imperiled if co-operation [were] - 32 - withheld. * * * He might be censured, suspended, or disbarred for ‘any conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.’” People ex rel. Karlin v. Culkin, 162 N.E. 487, 489 (N.Y. 1928). The duty of candor, then, is the foundation of a lawyer’s profession. That duty is not limited by the dictates of Rule 3.3 of the Rules of Professional Conduct; rather, courts have held that there is a general duty of candor to the court that is broader than the rule. See United States v. Shaffer Equipment Co., 11 F.3d 450, 457 (4th Cir. 1993) (“[W]e are confident that a general duty of candor to the court exists in connection with an attorney’s role as an officer of the court.”). The basis of this general duty of candor is “the principle that lawyers, who serve as officers of the court, have the first line task of assuring the integrity of the process.” Id. “Our adversary system for the resolution of disputes rests on the unshakable foundation that truth is the object of the system’s process which is designed for the purpose of dispensing justice. However, because no one has an exclusive insight into truth, the process depends on the adversarial presentation of evidence, precedent and custom, and argument to reasoned conclusions—all directed with unwavering effort to what, in good faith, is believed to be true on matters material to the disposition. Even the slightest accommodation of deceit or a lack of candor in any material respect quickly erodes the validity of the process.” Id. The integrity of the justice system is not served when an attorney, who has been sworn to tell the whole truth in a proceeding, refuses to answer simple, straightforward questions, whether posed by the court or by opposing counsel. Nor is it served by an attorney who disregards an order of this Court, fails to respond to a subpoena, or deliberately misrepresents his assets to a bankruptcy trustee. “The system can provide no harbor for clever devices to divert the search, mislead opposing counsel or the court, or cover up that which is necessary for justice in the end.” Shaffer Equipment Co., 11 F.3d at 457-58. It is clear that respondent’s actions in Workers’ Compensation Court were not candid and not directed towards the truth, however literally true some of his responses may have been—e.g., - 33 - “I live in a house.” We are further troubled by respondent’s conduct in Bankruptcy Court. We agree with the board’s conclusion that respondent’s failure to disclose the nature of the Wells receivable, as well as his refusal to admit or deny basic information in his answer to the complaint objecting to discharge, constituted a lack of candor toward the tribunal in violation of Rule 3.3. We also agree with the board’s findings that respondent’s conduct regarding the Wells receivable was dishonest, in violation of Rule 8.4(c). As the board concluded: “It is unfathomable that the serial misrepresentations and omissions of material fact, as unearthed and presented in this case, and which we find established by clear and convincing evidence, would occur without a mindset purposely predisposed to preventing the disclosure of assets which [respondent] deliberately attempted to hide from creditors, including the Bankruptcy Trustee.” Furthermore, a reading of the Workers’ Compensation Court transcripts, containing respondent’s painfully repetitive arguments and his steadfast resistance to the procedural boundaries of the proceedings, shows conduct clearly intended to disrupt the tribunal in violation of Rule 3.5(d). We also agree with the board that respondent’s actions with regard to his use of the name “Keven A. McKenna, LLC” violated Rules 7.1, 7.5, and 8.4(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. After receiving an order of this Court explicitly prohibiting respondent from practicing law as an LLC, he continued to use a bank account under the name of the LLC. He deposited checks for legal services into this account, with at least one made out to the LLC. The respondent used this account to pay for expenses specifically associated with the practice of law, including his attorney registration fee, court filing fees, transcript fees, and title search expenses. We note the board’s determination that respondent’s justifications and excuses for these actions were “palpably disingenuous.” - 34 - Additionally, we concur with the board’s finding that respondent’s failure to provide the records requested through Assistant Disciplinary Counsel’s subpoena constituted a violation of Rule 1.19. The respondent admitted at his deposition that he had not brought all of the records as requested, seemingly relying on a last-minute motion to quash the subpoena, which was not granted. As explained supra, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel clearly had the authority to subpoena respondent’s records, and respondent intentionally failed to comply with this request. E Sanction Chief Justice John Marshall once observed: “On one hand, the profession of an attorney is of great importance to an individual, and the prosperity of his whole life may depend on its exercise. The right to exercise it ought not to be lightly or capriciously taken from him. On the other, it is extremely desirable that the respectability of the bar should be maintained, and that its harmony with the bench should be preserved. For these objects, some controlling power, some discretion ought to reside in the Court. This discretion ought to be exercised with great moderation and judgment; but it must be exercised; and no other tribunal can decide, in a case of removal from the bar, with the same means of information as the Court itself.” Ex parte Burr, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 529, 530 (1824). So too, it is the ultimate responsibility of this Court to fashion an appropriate sanction for respondent’s violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. In so doing, we customarily give great weight to the recommendation of the board. See In re Foster, 826 A.2d 949, 953 (R.I. 2003); In re Cozzolino, 811 A.2d 638, 641 (R.I. 2002). Nevertheless, this Court is the final arbiter of professional discipline. In re Foster, 826 A.2d at 953. We have carefully considered the voluminous record of these proceedings, as well as the recommendation of disbarment by Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, and indeed the judgment of our dissenting colleague that the board’s recommendation is inadequate. We commend the - 35 - members of the board, and the members of the hearing panel in particular, for their patience in considering respondent’s sometimes repetitive arguments and continual challenges to their authority. We are ever aware of the significant role that the board plays in protecting the public and upholding the integrity of the bar and the legal profession. This Court has often said that “the purposes of discipline are not punishment of the attorney but protecting the public and maintaining the integrity of the profession.” In re Scott, 694 A.2d 732, 736 (R.I. 1997). We are satisfied that the board’s recommendation of a one-year suspension from the practice of law is warranted in this case and appropriately meets the dual purposes of professional discipline. In our opinion, the record before us clearly illustrates a persistent pattern of obstreperous behavior from 2009 to the present day, and before several courts, that derogates sharply from the ethical standards to which we expect attorneys in this state to adhere. We disagree, however, with the dissent’s characterization of a one-year suspension as a mere “slap on the wrist.” We do not consider insignificant a one-year hiatus in one’s chosen profession with the consequent effect on his or her livelihood. In an apparent attempt to mitigate his misconduct, respondent reminds us that no client has brought a complaint against him. Unfortunately, that is not particularly relevant; the simple fact is that respondent was representing himself when the conduct that is the basis for the disciplinary action took place. The Rules of Professional Conduct are in place not solely to protect individual clients but also to protect the integrity of the judicial system itself. We would not be true to our duty of safeguarding the integrity of the profession if we were to ignore respondent’s conduct. We do not take lightly the responsibility of crafting a meaningful sanction for this conduct. We are mindful of and take into account the respondent’s many years of service to his - 36 - clients and the bar, including his participation in the state constitutional convention and his significant pro bono work. The respondent is clearly an intelligent attorney and a passionate advocate. We profoundly hope that, in the future, those attributes will be employed more appropriately. V Conclusion For the reasons stated above, we order that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year, said period of suspension to commence thirty days from the date of this opinion. In order to protect the interests of his current clients, we authorize Disciplinary Counsel to supervise the orderly transfer of the respondent’s client matters to new counsel. At the conclusion of this one-year period of suspension, the respondent must apply to this Court for reinstatement pursuant to Article III, Rule 16 of the Supreme Court Rules of Disciplinary Procedure. Justice Goldberg, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority decision that adopts the recommendation of the Disciplinary Board of the Rhode Island Supreme Court (the board) that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year. I do not undertake this dissent lightly, but do so in accordance with my firm belief that the duty to protect the integrity of this profession rests with this Court and, in light of that responsibility, the sanction adopted by the majority is inadequate and fails to respond to the egregious nature and sheer number of material misrepresentations made by the respondent and, importantly, also ignores the respondent’s conduct before the board. - 37 - Having carefully reviewed the entire record in this proceeding and in light of the recommendation of disbarment by Assistant Disciplinary Counsel who prosecuted the petition, I cannot agree with such a minimal sanction, which, in my opinion, does little to further any of the Court’s well-established goals in imposing attorney discipline. In the face of this egregious misconduct, this sanction does scant justice and overlooks the sad fact that this lawyer of many years refuses or is unable to accept the authority of the Supreme Court over the conduct of attorneys. In my opinion, this sanction amounts to a slap on the wrist. I begin by noting that, before the board, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel advocated that respondent should be disbarred. The board found, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct in each and every count of the petition. The board also rejected respondent’s conspiracy-theory defense and his “unsupported and inflammatory assertions * * * that he [was] being subjected to disciplinary action and/or persecuted because of his controversial positions on constitutional issues,” and it concluded that his “arguments and suppositions [were] mere sophistry which [did] nothing to dissuade [the board] from its conclusion.” Next, the board recommended a suspension from the practice of law for a period of one year, but did not set forth any reasoning for this recommendation. The board also failed to address the recommendation of Assistant Disciplinary Counsel that respondent be disbarred. It is this aspect of the board’s decision with which I take issue. I join the majority in commending the board, and particularly the members of the panel, for their herculean efforts in this matter and for the fine work of the Court’s Assistant Disciplinary Counsel and Deputy Disciplinary Counsel. However, it is this Court’s responsibility to impose discipline that responds to the circumstances of the case. See In re Schiff, 677 A.2d 422, 424-25 (R.I. 1996) (refusing to adopt a - 38 - recommendation of public censure for an attorney who filed a false fee affidavit and instead imposing an eighteen-month suspension). In his memorandum to this Court—a copy of which is attached to this opinion as an Addendum—Assistant Disciplinary Counsel acknowledged the board’s recommendation of a one-year suspension; but, nonetheless, in light of respondent’s serial violations of misconduct, he argued “that the severity of [r]espondent’s actions as well as the lack of mitigation factors[,] coupled with his utter disregard for not only this process, but this Court’s authority and the protection of not only the integrity of the profession[,] but the public as well[,] warrants a significant sanction beyond the one (1) year suspension recommended by the [b]oard.” (Emphasis added.) I concur. It is my belief that, when imposing attorney discipline, this Court should look to the totality of the circumstances, including the proceedings before the board. Indeed, the level of cooperation before the board and respondent’s cooperation with Disciplinary Counsel are factors that generally are brought to this Court’s attention in disciplinary matters. This was not an easy road for Assistant Disciplinary Counsel. The respondent challenged his authority at every level as an ultra vires appointment by this Court. His integrity was assailed, he was referred to on numerous occasions by respondent as a “hit man for the * * * Supreme Court,” who was hired to “search and destroy” him; and, significantly, he alleged that, as a practicing lawyer, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel could expect favorable advantage because of his service to this Court. Assistant Disciplinary Counsel was sued four times—three times in federal court and once in Superior Court. The level of vilification directed by respondent toward anyone connected with the investigation and prosecution of this case, including the chair of the - 39 - panel and the Court’s Deputy Disciplinary Counsel and Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, is shocking and should not be overlooked by this Court. I share Assistant Disciplinary Counsel’s concern that, in addition to the unassailable findings of misconduct “demonstrat[ing] a lack of candor amounting to dishonesty in dealing with various tribunals” and respondent’s “refusal or inability to recognize his obligations under the Rules of Professional Conduct[,]” respondent also violated a direct order from this Court prohibiting him from practicing law in the corporate form and thereafter engaged in a course of conduct, throughout these proceedings, in which he consistently and blatantly sought to “circumvent this Court’s authority over his law practice[.]” By way of apparent mitigation of respondent’s misconduct, the majority notes that respondent has been a member of the bar for many years and has performed pro bono services during that time. This mitigation does not tip the scales for me. To this day, respondent has failed to produce the documents sought by Assistant Disciplinary Counsel in defiance of a lawfully issued subpoena, on the ground that Assistant Disciplinary Counsel had no authority to issue it. He moved to quash the subpoena, not before this Court, but before the board, the day before the return date. He appeared at the deposition and flatly refused to produce the records. His statement to the board about why he refused to produce the sought-after records is emblematic: “I did bring the records, I did not give them to him because, as I have said before, he’s an employee hired by the Supreme Court who has no authority to do this. And I then filed a lawsuit against him in Federal Court. So I met the request even though I thought he had no statutory or constitutional authority [to] do anything of the kind. He’s not an Assistant Disciplinary Counsel. He’s a hired gun by the Rhode Island Supreme Court by cont[r]act. He gets paid an hourly fee and he has no authority [to] do depositions or to request subpoenas.” (Emphasis added.) - 40 - In my opinion, the fact that Assistant Disciplinary Counsel resorted to issuing subpoenas for respondent’s bank records is of no moment to this discussion. The respondent should have been suspended from the practice of law for noncompliance with Article V, Rule 1.19 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct like every other attorney who fails to comply with Rule 1.19. In no event should respondent be readmitted to the practice of law until he produces all records that were subject to subpoena. As noted, during the course of these proceedings, respondent filed numerous lawsuits against the Chief Justice, the board, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, and various court employees challenging the authority of the board and Assistant Disciplinary Counsel. Finally, after hearings that spanned over one year, the board issued its findings and submitted its recommendation to this Court. We issued an order directing respondent to appear before this Court in order to respond to the findings of the board. In response, respondent moved to recuse the members of this Court based on bias, unethical conduct, and a violation of his right to due process. Next, he filed yet another federal lawsuit—his third—seeking to restrain this Court from proceeding. That complaint was entitled “COMPLAINT TO STAY SUSPENSION OF PLAINTIFF FROM PRACTING [sic] LAW FOR HIS ACTS IN FILING FEDERAL BANKING [sic] PROCEEDING, ANSWERING FEDERAL ADVERSARY PROCEEDURES [sic], CHALLENGING UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTS IN FEDERAL COURT.” The respondent’s rambling discourse in this pleading, as well as his conduct in his appearances before the panel of the board, convince me that he has no insight into his obligations as a member of the bar or the gravity of his dishonesty and attorney misconduct. In this eleventh-hour salvo, respondent alleged that the Supreme Court was not an adequate or fair forum to hear this matter; that the Court has no authority to suspend respondent - 41 - in the absence of a complaint from a client or a judge or the Bankruptcy Trustee; that the Rules of Professional Conduct are “unconstitutional”; and that Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, at the direction of his client, this Court, has undertaken “an otherwise unfounded and unconstitutional pre-textual administrative inquisition of the [p]laintiff’s practice of law to seek possible technical violations of the Rule[s] * * * of Professional Conduct[.]” He alleged that this Court has no authority over lawyers “outside of the walls of the R.I. Supreme Court, and in particular within the U.S. Bankruptcy Court”; and that the appointment of Assistant Disciplinary Counsel was in retaliation for respondent’s exercise of his rights under the First Amendment. I pause to note that respondent, clearly and unequivocally, has every right to express his opinions about the members of this Court, the constitution, and his version of the separation of powers in this state and the United States; he even is free to amalgamate those doctrines as he often does. See, e.g., In re Application of Roots, 762 A.2d 1161, 1170 (R.I. 2000). Nonetheless, he must comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct. The respondent was found by the board to have filed numerous motions out of time, which were declared to be specious and designed to delay the tribunal. He continued to file the same motions and make the same arguments ad nauseam. The respondent contended that the numerous allegations in the petition filed by Disciplinary Counsel amounted to “pettifoggery” and “frivolous little things” taken out of context. He also accused, without apparent foundation or good-faith basis, Barbara Margolis, the Court’s Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, of participating in the discussions and deliberations of the board. Ms. Margolis did not attend any deliberations or discussions of the board, and respondent was admonished by the Chair. On numerous occasions respondent moved the Chair to recuse herself, based on his contention that her evidentiary rulings demonstrated bias. At the conclusion of the hearings - 42 - before the board, respondent refused to rest his case. He had no further witnesses to call. When asked if he had any other exhibits to introduce, he stated that he did, but that the Chair would “have to wait until I get them.” When informed that the exhibits were required to be produced later that day, respondent refused to produce any further evidence and refused to rest his case. The Chair declared the evidence closed. The respondent’s actions before the board, in my opinion, amounted to unprofessional conduct in violation of Article III, Rule 6(e) of the Supreme Court Rules of Disciplinary Procedure. 1 The respondent’s conduct, his multitude of lawsuits challenging the authority of this Court, his deceitful behavior and lack of candor―as set forth in the petition and findings of the board―his refusal to cooperate with Disciplinary Counsel, and his disobedience to a lawfully issued subpoena duces tecum, merit a significantly longer period of suspension and an order that respondent must reapply for admission to the bar, must produce the records demanded by the subpoena, and must demonstrate his fitness to practice law, including his obligation to comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct. Unless he is able to do that, respondent should be deemed unfit to practice law. The respondent’s personal opinions about the current or former members of this Court have no bearing on my opinion in this case, nor do his quixotic ramblings concerning his view of our constitutional structure. The judicial power rests with this Court. The respondent’s view of the state’s separation of powers as including overlapping responsibilities and authority among 1 Article III, Rule 6(e) of the Supreme Court Rules of Disciplinary Procedure provides: “Duty to Cooperate. The failure of an attorney whose conduct is the subject of an investigation authorized by these rules to comply with the reasonable orders and requests of either Counsel or the Board shall constitute unprofessional conduct, and any such failure shall be referred forthwith to this Court for such action as it deems appropriate.” - 43 - the branches is irrelevant in the context of attorney regulation and discipline. Moreover, respondent’s flexible and fluid arguments about this state’s constitutional structure do not serve as a shield against his perfidious conduct or block scrutiny by this Court. In addition to respondent’s behavior during the course of this investigation, my concern about the inadequate penalty also extends to the breadth and nature of his misconduct that led to the petition. It is important to note that the petition filed by Disciplinary Counsel did not concern merely one event or proceeding. The violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct did not involve a client or any zealous advocacy by respondent to protect the rights of a client. This disciplinary petition solely dealt with respondent’s operation of his law practice and his behavior before the state and federal tribunals concerning his own affairs. In count 1, the board noted that respondent admitted that he was not insolvent, but he filed two bankruptcy petitions solely to obtain a stay of an order in the Workers’ Compensation Court that compelled him to pay money to a former employee. This action was taken in order to impede the Workers’ Compensation proceeding. The respondent then filed an application with this Court for permission to practice law as a limited liability company (LLC). This Court issued an order prohibiting respondent from practicing law in any corporate form until he certified that he was no longer practicing law as Keven A. McKenna, PC. He defied this order, changed the name of the corporation to McKenna Support Services, LLC, and continued to practice law under that corporate form. Significantly, practicing law as McKenna Support Services, LLC constitutes the practice of law as an LLC, the very conduct this Court proscribed. The respondent failed to change his bank account, continued to deposit client checks and draw funds for operating expenses from that account, and did so until he was advised that a subpoena had issued for his banking records. He then filed a federal lawsuit seeking to quash that subpoena. - 44 - The board found that respondent held himself out as an LLC in violation of an express order from this Court. The board also found respondent’s attempts to justify his conduct and “minimize the gravity of his diversion from the applicable disciplinary rules, as palpably disingenuous.” (Emphasis added.) Standing alone, this finding warrants further suspension. This Court frequently is asked by Disciplinary Counsel to consider an attorney’s lack of candor to Disciplinary Counsel and the board during a disciplinary proceeding. Count 2 of the petition focused on respondent’s unprofessional conduct before the Bankruptcy Court—in failing to disclose income, misrepresenting his interest in a receivable, and engaging in conduct that amounted to a lack of candor and dishonesty—and in his failure to cooperate with the U.S. Trustee’s investigation. The respondent failed to report the receivable in his sworn statement to the Bankruptcy Court and to his own attorney. He unilaterally, and without notice to the Bankruptcy Trustee, filed a motion for a whopping attorney’s fee and filed an affidavit, in the Town of Bristol Probate Court, designed to place a lien against the probate estate of a former client. He got caught. The U.S. Trustee filed an adversary complaint against him and objected to any discharge. In response to this complaint, respondent proceeded to commit even more violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, including lack of candor and actions intended to disrupt the proceeding. In his answer to the adversary complaint, respondent refused to admit or deny basic information, including his refusal to admit that copies of his own pleadings were true and accurate copies. He also failed to comply with a subpoena to produce records. In addressing count 2, the board made a plethora of adverse findings against respondent, including that he “made serial misstatements and misrepresentations regarding his financial affairs, or omitted material facts which he was under an obligation to disclose under sworn - 45 - statement in the Bankruptcy Court and in testimony at hearing on the instant [p]etition.” The board set forth seven separate material misrepresentations with respect to this receivable. Additionally, the board found that respondent “engaged in a course of conduct deliberately designed to hide the existence, value and collectability of the Wells Receivable. This course of conduct included the making of false statements of material fact, the failure to disclose material facts and the offering of evidence that the [r]espondent knew to be false.” The board concluded that this conduct simply cannot be countenanced. The board also declared: “It is unfathomable that the serial misrepresentations and omissions of material fact, as unearthed and presented in this case, and which we find established by clear and convincing evidence, would occur without a mindset purposely predisposed to preventing the disclosure of assets which [respondent] deliberately attempted to hide from creditors, including the Bankruptcy Trustee.” The board also found that respondent’s conduct was intended to and did disrupt the tribunal. The board also rejected, as ringing hollow, respondent’s tired refrain that neither the board nor this Court has jurisdiction over lawyers in federal court proceedings. See In re Schiff, 677 A.2d at 424 (attorney disciplined for filing false document in United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island). Count 3 relates to respondent’s unprofessional conduct with respect to a deposition conducted by Assistant Disciplinary Counsel and respondent’s subsequent refusal to maintain records as mandated by Rule 1.19. The respondent was served with a lawfully issued subpoena directing him to appear and bring certain records and to testify with respect to the veracity and completeness of the records produced. He refused to do so. The night before the scheduled deposition, he moved to quash the subpoena on the ground that Assistant Disciplinary Counsel did not have the authority to conduct the disciplinary investigation. The board could discern no - 46 - credible authority to support this assertion and found that respondent refused to comply with the subpoena in violation of Rule 1.19 and, further, that he engaged in obstreperous tactics and conduct before the board. This conduct is unacceptable. Attorneys are required to cooperate in any investigation by Disciplinary Counsel or face serious consequences. This Court has not hesitated to respond appropriately when called upon to do so. See In re D’Ambrosio, 29 A.3d 1241, 1241-42 (R.I. 2011) (mem.) (suspending respondent from the practice of law for failure to comply with a duly authorized subpoena directing him to provide financial records to Disciplinary Counsel in connection with a disciplinary complaint); In re Williams, 791 A.2d 486, 486 (R.I. 2002) (mem.) (disbarring an attorney―after an initial suspension―for disregard of the Court’s order to comply with subpoenas issued in connection with a disciplinary investigation). Count 4 brings us to yet another forum, the Workers’ Compensation Court, where respondent disrupted the proceedings, failed to exhibit candor, accused the Chief Judge of bias against him, and threatened the Chief Judge, declaring that he was “suing you personally because you’re trying to make, take money out of my pocket. I’m going to take money out of your pockets.” The board found that respondent was flippant, evasive, dilatory, and disruptive when he refused to disclose his home address to the Workers’ Compensation Court, noting that documents he filed in the Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the Secretary of State, and in everyday correspondence included the number and name of the street address he refused to disclose to the court. Additionally, the board found that respondent refused to admit the existence of pretrial orders that were part of the court record and refused to answer straightforward questions and feigned a lack of recollection of his claim for a trial and feigned a lack of understanding of simple questions. The board found that respondent was “deliberately and unnecessarily disruptive and dilatory, disrespectful to the [c]ourt[,] including the judge and opposing counsel, - 47 - combative, evasive, unresponsive, disputatious and pugnacious in both his testimony and in his actions as counsel for himself before the Workers’ Compensation Court * * *.” Accordingly, based on the numerous, indeed successive and escalating, incidents of dishonesty and unprofessional conduct committed by respondent, all of which related to his conduct as an attorney and officer of this Court, I am of the belief that a suspension of one year does not respond to the seriousness of the violations, their number, or their scope. Although this Court appropriately accords deference to the recommendations of the board, we also pay close attention to the arguments of the Disciplinary Counsel, who have an opportunity to appear before the Court when discipline is recommended. In this instance, although acknowledging the recommendation of Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, the board failed to set forth any discussion of its reasons for rejecting the recommendation and instead recommended a suspension of one year. In appropriate cases, this Court has elected not to adopt the recommendation of the board. See In re Schiff, 677 A.2d at 424-25 (declining to follow the board’s recommendation of a public censure and imposing an eighteen-month suspension for filing a false fee affidavit in federal court); Lisi v. Resmini, 603 A.2d 321, 324 (R.I. 1992) (rejecting the board’s recommendation of a sixty-day suspension and ordering a suspension of one year for filing a false jurat). In Carter v. Muka, 502 A.2d 327 (R.I. 1985), this Court initially suspended and, after a lengthy evidentiary proceeding before the full Court—which was necessary because a respondent filed suit against the entire disciplinary board—subsequently disbarred Betty Muka for, among other things, filing unfounded lawsuits with the intent to harass or injure another; knowingly advancing a claim that was unwarranted under existing law; engaging in conduct which was degrading to a tribunal; and knowingly making false accusations against a judge, including vituperative and unsupported accusations against a justice of the Superior Court and other members of the bar. Id. at 328-30. - 48 - Although Muka certainly represents an extreme case, this Court’s concerns for the rights of individuals who were hauled into court based on Attorney Muka’s baseless claims and the rights of litigants in our courtrooms, including her “utter disregard for the requirements of law and the rights of any person who has the temerity to disagree with her[,]” id. at 330, are relevant to this analysis. In conclusion, it is my opinion that the sanction recommended by the board, and adopted by the majority, is wholly inadequate and, when compared to discipline imposed upon other members of the bar for a single violation of the disciplinary rules, is disparate. Although I do not, as the majority suggests, consider “a one-year hiatus” from the practice of law to be “insignificant,” I continue to believe that the sanction in this case, for what is serial misconduct involving deceit and dishonesty, is a nominal sanction that does not respond to this Court’s goal of maintaining the integrity of this honorable profession. Furthermore, it is my belief that the respondent should not be readmitted to the practice of law unless and until he produces the records that were the subject of a lawfully issued subpoena. This Court has never overlooked an attorney’s refusal to produce records sought by Disciplinary Counsel. We should not do so here. Accordingly, it is my opinion that the respondent should be suspended from the practice of law for two years and should not be readmitted until he complies with Rule 1.19. - 49 - RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE: In the Matter of Keven A.

A three-member panel of the board (the panel) convened and conducted eight hearings on this matter between February 18, 2013 and October 16, 2013. The panel heard testimony from respondent, attorney Kevin Heitke (who, for a time, represented respondent’s professional corporation in Bankruptcy Court), Sheila Bentley McKenna (respondent’s wife), attorney Thomas Quinn (Chapter 11 trustee in respondent’s professional corporation’s bankruptcy case), and Daniel Marks (a client of respondent).', 'Numerous exhibits were admitted, including the transcript of the hearings in Workers’ Compensation Court that provided the genesis of the proceedings now before this Court.', 'II', 'Facts', 'The following facts are gleaned from the voluminous record of the board’s proceedings.

Also in May 2009, an employee of the PC, Sumner Stone, filed a claim for', '-3- workers’ compensation benefits, alleging a work-related injury. Because the PC was unable to provide proof that it carried workers’ compensation insurance as required by statute, a pretrial order was entered that ordered it to make weekly compensation payments to Stone.', 'The respondent, on behalf of the PC, refused to make the payments, arguing that this order violated his due process rights. Over the course of several months and a dozen hearings, respondent made multiple motions to dismiss and repeatedly asked the Chief Judge of the Workers’ Compensation Court, who was presiding over the hearings, to recuse himself. Each motion was argued, and all of the motions were denied. Despite the denials, respondent continued to press the same arguments at virtually every hearing.', 'The respondent repeatedly argued that he was being denied his right to a full hearing on the merits; however, the entire course of the proceedings in the Workers’ Compensation Court consisted of the disposition of his own motions and of the employee’s motions relating to respondent’s failure to comply with the pretrial order.', 'After presiding over the numerous hearings, the Chief Judge observed that respondent was “simply using the procedures of this court to delay and harass.” Eventually, the Chief Judge dismissed respondent’s claim for trial, due to the fact that respondent refused to make payments as required by the pretrial order. Thus, the pretrial order became the court’s final order.', 'While the Workers’ Compensation Court transcripts are replete with examples of respondent’s apparent contempt for the court and the proceedings as a whole, we highlight a few particularly illustrative excerpts:', '-4-', '“[Respondent]: I would like to enter an order on that, that you’re', 'denying me a right to a speedy civil trial * * * .', '“* * *', '“[Respondent]: I will drag this on forever.', '“* * *', '“[Respondent]: I have filed, and I will file again a motion to recuse', 'you because I’m suing you personally for due process rights,', 'violations, and that is a requirement for you to recuse yourself,', 'assign it to another judge. * * * This is a rump court proceeding.', 'You’re aiding and abetting a criminal getting benefits * * * .', '“* * *', '“[Respondent]: [Stone is] making a mockery of this court, Your', 'Honor, because of your dislike for me.

The respondent appealed from this order. After temporarily staying the order, this Court declined to hear the appeal and remanded the matter to the Workers’ Compensation Court, noting that respondent had not claimed an inability to comply with the order. The respondent next sought a stay of the order from the United States District Court and the Superior Court and, after failing to receive the stay, he filed a motion with the Workers’ Compensation Court claiming an inability to meet the payment obligations “due to circumstances beyond his control, including but limited [sic] to a priority U.S. I.

During the break, respondent filed a petition for personal bankruptcy.', 'Subsequent to the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee for the PC, respondent applied to this Court for a license to practice law as a limited liability company under the name “The Law Offices of Keven A. McKenna, LLC” (the LLC). On February 23, 2011, because respondent had “made no provision for the transfer of any client files to any other entity, nor ha[d] the PC withdrawn its appearance in any pending cases,” this Court entered an order directing respondent to satisfy the Court that the PC would no longer engage in the practice of law. We stated that, until that time, respondent “may continue to practice law in his individual capacity only and not in any corporate form.” On March 24, 2011, respondent withdrew his application for a license to practice law as an LLC.', 'Notwithstanding this Court’s order, respondent continued to use a bank account in the name of “Law Offices of Keven A. McKenna, LLC.” 3 He deposited checks made payable to the LLC, as well as other checks, and he wrote checks for expenses directly related to the practice of law, including the Supreme Court attorney registration fee, Rhode Island Bar Association dues, and court filing fees. These actions form the basis for count 1, alleging respondent’s violation of Rules 3.3, 7.1, 7.5, and 8.4(c) 4 by engaging in the unauthorized practice of law as a limited liability entity in violation of this Court’s order. 3', 'On or around March 24, 2011, respondent changed the name of the bank account to “McKenna Support Services, LLC”; however, he continued to use checks bearing the name “Law Offices of Keven A.

A lawyer shall not make a false or misleading communication about the lawyer or the lawyer’s services.”', '-7-', 'During the bankruptcy proceedings for the PC, an issue arose regarding legal services that respondent had provided to the Estate of Amelia Carmone for a number of years prior to filing the bankruptcy petition. Despite having accrued a sizable amount of unpaid fees for legal services provided to this client (hereinafter known as the “Wells receivable” 5), respondent failed to report the existence of this receivable on his initial corporate bankruptcy filing.', 'The respondent filed the required Schedule B disclosure of assets on January 25, 2010, and amended it on May 3, 2010; on neither occasion did he list the Wells receivable. In March 2011, respondent disclosed to the bankruptcy trustee that the Wells receivable amounted to $63,000 and was uncollectable. During this period of time, respondent had been attempting to purchase the PC’s receivables from the trustee for $10,000.', 'On June 7, 2011, respondent appeared in the Probate Court for the Town of Bristol and asserted a lien for attorney’s fees in the amount of $93,000 against real property owned by the Carmone estate, as well as a petition for approval to sell property located at 10 Hope Street in the Town of Bristol, to satisfy the lien. 6 Although respondent represented to the bankruptcy trustee that the receivable was largely uncollectable, he did not disclose that there was real property in the estate that could potentially secure the debt. In addition, respondent did not have authority from the trustee to attempt to collect the debt himself. These actions form the basis for count 2, alleging that respondent violated Rules 3.3 and 8.4(c) by failing to disclose his income to the Bankruptcy Court, misrepresenting his interest in a receivable to that court, and by engaging in Rule 7.5 states, in pertinent part: “Firm names and letterheads. * * * (d) Lawyers may state or imply that they practice in a partnership or other organization only when that is a fact.” Rule 8.4 states, in pertinent part: “Misconduct.

In his answer to the complaint, respondent neither admitted nor denied a large number of the allegations, including those that were straightforward and clearly within his knowledge; for example, whether he had filed his bankruptcy petition and bankruptcy schedules “under oath” (despite the fact that the petition’s signature page included the language “I declare under penalty of perjury that the information provided in this petition is true and correct” and that the bankruptcy schedules contained similar language); whether he had a “Wells receivable” as property of the PC’s bankruptcy estate; and whether the exhibits to the complaint, viz., copies of his motions in the Bristol Probate Court to collect attorney’s fees for the work performed regarding the Wells receivable, were “true and accurate” copies of his own pleadings.', 'Subsequent to the U.S. Trustee’s complaint, respondent filed an application for waiver of discharge; the waiver was granted, and the Trustee dismissed the complaint. The respondent’s actions in Bankruptcy Court, as well as his actions during the lengthy Workers’ Compensation Court hearings, form the basis for count 4, alleging that he violated Rules 3.3 and 3.5(d) 7 by engaging in conduct before both tribunals that demonstrated a lack of candor, as well as an attempt to disrupt these tribunals.', 'On September 12, 2011, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel issued a subpoena to respondent, directing him to produce the records identified in Rule 1.19(a)(1)-(8) 8 and to testify regarding the 7', 'Rule 3.5(d) states, in pertinent part: “Impartiality and decorum of the tribunal.

In addition to challenging the authority of the panel to hear the matter, as well as the authority of this Court to regulate attorneys, respondent argued that there was no basis for sanctions.', 'Specifically as to count 1, respondent argued that, after the February 2011 order of this Court, he changed the name and purpose of his LLC to “McKenna Support Services, LLC” and used the bank account established under that LLC name to pay his employees, his rent, and his expenses. The respondent argued that the use of the account and the checks bearing the name of the former LLC did not constitute the practice of law, and that he had continued to use these checks as a mere matter of convenience. Regarding count 2, respondent argued that he had made no false statements on his bankruptcy filings, and that he valued the Wells receivable at $63,000 because “[n]ot all of the estate[’s] billing had been posted” and the unbilled time increased the value to $93,000. With respect to count 3, respondent argued that he had brought records to the deposition, although he made them available for inspection only, and not for copying. Further, respondent averred that he had invited Assistant Disciplinary Counsel to his law office to inspect the records there, an invitation that was declined. Finally, as to count 4, respondent argued that his actions in Workers’ Compensation Court and Bankruptcy Court are outside this Court’s jurisdiction. He further represented that there was no evidence that he had engaged in conduct intended to disrupt any tribunal.', '- 11 -', 'The panel found that there was clear and convincing evidence that respondent had violated the Rules of Professional Conduct as alleged in counts 1, 2, 3, and 4. Regarding count 1, the panel found that “[r]espondent’s use of the ‘LLC’ designation in his deposit slip/letterhead constitutes a ‘material misrepresentation of fact or law’ and is false and misleading * * * .” Further, the panel found that respondent’s testimony “by which he attempted to justify and/or excuse” these actions was “palpably disingenuous.”', 'As to count 2, the panel found that respondent “engaged in a course of conduct deliberately designed to hide the existence, value and collectability of the Wells Receivable.” This conduct included making false statements of material fact, failing to disclose material facts, and offering evidence that respondent knew to be false.', 'Regarding count 3, the panel found that respondent admitted that he did not bring all of the records requested to either his deposition or the hearing, and that his invitation to Assistant Disciplinary Counsel to inspect the records at his law office did nothing to mitigate this failure. Because the subpoena directed him to produce the records at the office of Disciplinary Counsel, he was duty bound to do so.', 'As to count 4, the panel found that during the Workers’ Compensation Court proceedings, respondent was “flippant, evasive, dilatory and disruptive.” The panel noted that it was “disturbed by [respondent’s] disrespect” for the judge who was presiding over that hearing, particularly respondent’s repeated refusal to answer simple questions posed by the court, as well as respondent’s employing the threat of a lawsuit to support his motion to recuse that judge. Finally, the panel found that respondent “was deliberately and unnecessarily disruptive and dilatory, disrespectful to the [c]ourt including the judge and opposing counsel, combative, evasive[,] unresponsive, disputatious and pugnacious in both his testimony and in his actions as counsel for himself” before that court.', '- 12 -', 'The panel rejected respondent’s argument that he was being subjected to disciplinary action because of his “controversial positions on constitutional issues.”', 'Rather, the panel concluded that “the allegations [were] sufficiently serious to warrant a recommendation for a disciplinary sanction.” The panel recommended a one-year suspension from the practice of law.

More specifically, respondent contends that this Court’s power is limited to appellate jurisdiction over statutory courts and/or that the judiciary’s inherent power is limited to adjudicating cases and controversies. He appears to argue that this Court’s creation of disciplinary procedures and the disciplinary board, as well as this Court’s promulgation of rules of professional conduct, are exercises of legislative power not delegated by the General Assembly and are, therefore, violative of the doctrine of separation of powers.', 'Contrary to respondent’s protestations, “[i]t is well settled that the authority of the Supreme Court to discipline the members of the bar * * * is plenary in nature.” In re Lallo, 768 A.2d 921, 924 (R.I. 2001).

It did so by permitting the Chief Justice both to appoint and supervise special prosecutors (which included defining the scope of the special prosecutors’ jurisdiction, releasing the special prosecutors’ findings to the public, and removing special prosecutors) and to review on appeal any felony prosecutions tried by the special prosecutor. Id. at 179. The justices concluded that these conflicting roles by the Chief Justice “threaten[ed] the institutional integrity of the Judicial Branch.” Id. (quoting Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 851 (1986)).', 'The proposed legislation at issue in In re House of Representatives impermissibly transferred to the judiciary a fundamental executive power—specifically, the “power and discretion to prosecute crimes”—which power is vested in the Office of the Attorney General by the Rhode Island Constitution. See In re House of Representatives, 575 A.2d at 179-80; see also R.I. Const., art. 9, sec. 12. In contrast, the role and function of disciplinary counsel appointed by this Court is a means to carry out an inherent judicial function: the regulation of attorneys. Furthermore, this Court is not, in the context of attorney discipline, jeopardizing its function as the court of last resort of criminal matters. Rather, this Court is the only tribunal with authority over matters of attorney discipline. See In re Commission on Judicial Tenure and Discipline, 916 A.2d 746, 751 (R.I. 2007) (noting that this Court has “steadfastly held” that the authority of this Court to discipline the bar and bench is “plenary and exclusive”). This Court has established', '- 18 - disciplinary procedures that allow initial screening and review by the board, with the assistance of Disciplinary Counsel, in order to safeguard the due process rights of attorneys subject to discipline. Furthermore, in the event an attorney disciplinary proceeding uncovers the possibility that a crime may have been committed, such matters are referred to the Office of the Attorney General to investigate and act on in accordance with its prosecutorial discretion.', 'The respondent further argues that this Court does not have jurisdiction over attorney conduct outside of the Supreme Court’s proceedings and, specifically, that attorney conduct in the Workers’ Compensation Court, the Federal Bankruptcy Court, and “professional offices” falls outside of this Court’s jurisdiction.', 'The respondent’s contention that this Court’s jurisdiction over attorney conduct is limited to actions in the Supreme Court is not warranted in law or fact. Not only would respondent’s argument render much of the professional rules of conduct nugatory, it is contrary to the well- established “power inherent in this [C]ourt to control and supervise the practice of law generally, whether in or out of court.” Rhode Island Bar Association, 55 R.I. at 129-30, 179 A. at 142 (emphasis added). Especially considering how few attorneys come before the Supreme Court and how infrequent such appearances are by the majority of attorneys who practice in this state, such a rule would utterly prevent this Court from protecting the public from incompetent, unethical, or irresponsible representation. Rather, the ethical standards imposed on attorneys historically have extended—and do still extend—beyond the courtroom. See id. at 134, 179 A. at 144 (in the English colonies, “[a]dmission to the bar meant admission to practice law, and admission to practice law comprehended all the activities of a lawyer in advising and assisting', '- 19 - others in all matters of law both in and out of court”). 16 Indeed, over a century ago, this Court recognized:', '“[A]ny conduct which demonstrates a moral condition inconsistent', 'with the proper appreciation and discharge of professional duties', 'and obligations may also form a just basis for disbarment or the', 'imposition of some lesser punishment. In fact, any conduct which', 'would preclude admission to the bar might well justify a', 'disbarment thereafter, whether such conduct be associated with the', 'discharge of strictly professional duties and obligations or clearly', 'separated therefrom.” Crafts v. Lizotte, 34 R.I. 543, 546, 84 A.', '1081, 1082 (1912). 17', 'In accordance with these principles, it is undeniable that this Court may investigate and discipline attorney conduct regardless of where that conduct takes place. Attorneys licensed in Rhode Island are held to the same professional standards whether they are practicing in the Workers’ Compensation Court, in another state court, or in a local federal court. Indeed, this Court has regularly applied Rhode Island’s Rules of Professional Conduct to attorneys practicing in the local federal district court. See, e.g., In the Matter of Schiff, 677 A.2d 422, 423, 425 (R.I. 1996) (suspending attorney from the practice of law for eighteen months for her violation of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct after she submitted a materially false affidavit to the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island); In re Petition of Almond, 603 A.2d at 1087, 1090 (denying a federal prosecutor’s petition for waiver of Article V, Rule 3.8 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct, which had been based on his contention that 16', 'See Rhode Island Bar Association, 55 R.I. at 134-35, 179 A. at 144-45 for an historical and in- depth discussion rejecting the argument that the regulation of lawyers should be limited to conduct occurring in court. 17', 'See also Rhode Island Bar Association, 55 R.I. at 135, 179 A. at 144 (quoting the Supreme Court of South Carolina, in In Re Duncan, 65 S.E. 210, 211 (S.C. 1909), as stating that “[i]t is too obvious for discussion that the practice of law is not limited to the conduct of cases in courts”); Anderson v.

Further, attorneys are held to the same ethical standards whether they are practicing in court, in a professional office, at home, on the street, over the phone, in a coffee shop, or anywhere else.', 'There are no geographic or location-specific limitations to an attorney’s ethical obligations.', 'Next, respondent claims that the supremacy clause of the United States Constitution prevents this Court from exercising authority over attorney conduct in federal courts.', '“In analyzing a claim under the supremacy clause, it is axiomatic that the supremacy clause is relevant only when there is impermissible state interference with federal law.” In re Petition of Almond, 603 A.2d at 1090 (citing Hillsborough County v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 471 U.S. 707, 712 (1985)). In the instant matter, there is no such interference because the state and federal courts have consistently been in harmony as to the proper ethical conduct of attorneys practicing in their respective courts. For instance, the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island has adopted the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct (and any additional standards of conduct set forth in its local rules). See Rule 208 of the Local Rules of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. In order to practice in the federal Bankruptcy Court in Rhode Island, an attorney must be in good standing with the bar of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island and must be admitted to practice in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. See Rule 9010-1(a) of the Rules of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Rhode Island. Further, there is no indication that these disciplinary proceedings in any way disrupted the bankruptcy proceedings in federal court, which continued to transpire without interruption from this Court, the board, or Disciplinary', '- 21 - Counsel. Nor has respondent contended that any specific disciplinary charge or applicable Rule of Professional Conduct interferes with a particular federal rule or law.', 'Accordingly, for the reasons stated above, this Court may exercise jurisdiction over attorney disciplinary matters generally, and over respondent specifically.', '2. Due Process', 'The respondent raises numerous concerns implicating his procedural due process rights under the federal and state constitutions. First, he contends he was denied his procedural due process right to “present evidence and argue law” and to be heard by the “full board.” Second, he appears to be arguing that, because this Court promulgates and enforces the Rules of Professional Conduct, appoints persons to the board, hires disciplinary counsel, and ultimately determines whether and how to discipline an attorney for misconduct, this amounts to a constitutionally infirm merger of investigatory, prosecutorial, and adjudicatory functions so as to deny respondent procedural due process. 18', 'Both the federal and state constitutions provide that no person shall be deprived of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. Amend. XIV; R.I. Const. art. 1, sec. 2.

Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335 * * * (1976).” Germane, 971 A.2d at 574. Under the Mathews test, three factors are to be considered in determining whether a procedure violates due process:', '“First, the private interest that will be affected by the official', 'action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest', 'through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of', 'additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the', 'Government’s interest, including the function involved and the', 'fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute', 'procedural requirement would entail.” Germane, 971 A.2d at 574-', '75 (quoting Mathews, 424 U.S. at 335).', 'As to the first factor, it is undisputed that respondent’s license to practice law in this state, which has been in place for forty continuous years, is a property interest sufficient to invoke due process protections.

The respondent was also permitted to submit to the board a post-hearing memorandum summarizing his position on the facts and law. Furthermore, due process does not require a hearing before the full board; hearings held before a panel of the board are appropriate to the nature of disciplinary matters. See Barber v. Exeter-West Greenwich School Committee, 418 A.2d 13, 20 (R.I. 1980) (“[d]ue process is a flexible concept and the degree of protection afforded to an individual may vary with the particular situation”).

We agree with the board’s conclusion that respondent’s failure to disclose the nature of the Wells receivable, as well as his refusal to admit or deny basic information in his answer to the complaint objecting to discharge, constituted a lack of candor toward the tribunal in violation of Rule 3.3. We also agree with the board’s findings that respondent’s conduct regarding the Wells receivable was dishonest, in violation of Rule 8.4(c). As the board concluded:', '“It is unfathomable that the serial misrepresentations and', 'omissions of material fact, as unearthed and presented in this case,', 'and which we find established by clear and convincing evidence,', 'would occur without a mindset purposely predisposed to', 'preventing the disclosure of assets which [respondent] deliberately', 'attempted to hide from creditors, including the Bankruptcy', 'Trustee.” Furthermore, a reading of the Workers’ Compensation Court transcripts, containing respondent’s painfully repetitive arguments and his steadfast resistance to the procedural boundaries of the proceedings, shows conduct clearly intended to disrupt the tribunal in violation of Rule 3.5(d).', 'We also agree with the board that respondent’s actions with regard to his use of the name “Keven A. McKenna, LLC” violated Rules 7.1, 7.5, and 8.4(c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. After receiving an order of this Court explicitly prohibiting respondent from practicing law as an LLC, he continued to use a bank account under the name of the LLC. He deposited checks for legal services into this account, with at least one made out to the LLC.', 'The respondent used this account to pay for expenses specifically associated with the practice of law, including his attorney registration fee, court filing fees, transcript fees, and title search expenses. We note the board’s determination that respondent’s justifications and excuses for these actions were “palpably disingenuous.”', '- 34 -', 'Additionally, we concur with the board’s finding that respondent’s failure to provide the records requested through Assistant Disciplinary Counsel’s subpoena constituted a violation of Rule 1.19. The respondent admitted at his deposition that he had not brought all of the records as requested, seemingly relying on a last-minute motion to quash the subpoena, which was not granted.', 'As explained supra, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel clearly had the authority to subpoena respondent’s records, and respondent intentionally failed to comply with this request.', 'E', 'Sanction', 'Chief Justice John Marshall once observed:', '“On one hand, the profession of an attorney is of great', 'importance to an individual, and the prosperity of his whole life', 'may depend on its exercise. The right to exercise it ought not to be', 'lightly or capriciously taken from him. On the other, it is', 'extremely desirable that the respectability of the bar should be', 'maintained, and that its harmony with the bench should be', 'preserved. For these objects, some controlling power, some', 'discretion ought to reside in the Court. This discretion ought to be', 'exercised with great moderation and judgment; but it must be', 'exercised; and no other tribunal can decide, in a case of removal', 'from the bar, with the same means of information as the Court', 'itself.” Ex parte Burr, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 529, 530 (1824). So too, it is the ultimate responsibility of this Court to fashion an appropriate sanction for respondent’s violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. In so doing, we customarily give great weight to the recommendation of the board. See In re Foster, 826 A.2d 949, 953 (R.I. 2003); In re Cozzolino, 811 A.2d 638, 641 (R.I. 2002). Nevertheless, this Court is the final arbiter of professional discipline. In re Foster, 826 A.2d at 953.', 'We have carefully considered the voluminous record of these proceedings, as well as the recommendation of disbarment by Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, and indeed the judgment of our dissenting colleague that the board’s recommendation is inadequate. We commend the', '- 35 - members of the board, and the members of the hearing panel in particular, for their patience in considering respondent’s sometimes repetitive arguments and continual challenges to their authority. We are ever aware of the significant role that the board plays in protecting the public and upholding the integrity of the bar and the legal profession.', 'This Court has often said that “the purposes of discipline are not punishment of the attorney but protecting the public and maintaining the integrity of the profession.” In re Scott, 694 A.2d 732, 736 (R.I. 1997). We are satisfied that the board’s recommendation of a one-year suspension from the practice of law is warranted in this case and appropriately meets the dual purposes of professional discipline. In our opinion, the record before us clearly illustrates a persistent pattern of obstreperous behavior from 2009 to the present day, and before several courts, that derogates sharply from the ethical standards to which we expect attorneys in this state to adhere.', 'We disagree, however, with the dissent’s characterization of a one-year suspension as a mere “slap on the wrist.” We do not consider insignificant a one-year hiatus in one’s chosen profession with the consequent effect on his or her livelihood.', 'In an apparent attempt to mitigate his misconduct, respondent reminds us that no client has brought a complaint against him. Unfortunately, that is not particularly relevant; the simple fact is that respondent was representing himself when the conduct that is the basis for the disciplinary action took place. The Rules of Professional Conduct are in place not solely to protect individual clients but also to protect the integrity of the judicial system itself. We would not be true to our duty of safeguarding the integrity of the profession if we were to ignore respondent’s conduct.', 'We do not take lightly the responsibility of crafting a meaningful sanction for this conduct. We are mindful of and take into account the respondent’s many years of service to his', '- 36 - clients and the bar, including his participation in the state constitutional convention and his significant pro bono work. The respondent is clearly an intelligent attorney and a passionate advocate. We profoundly hope that, in the future, those attributes will be employed more appropriately.', 'V', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated above, we order that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year, said period of suspension to commence thirty days from the date of this opinion. In order to protect the interests of his current clients, we authorize Disciplinary Counsel to supervise the orderly transfer of the respondent’s client matters to new counsel. At the conclusion of this one-year period of suspension, the respondent must apply to this Court for reinstatement pursuant to Article III, Rule 16 of the Supreme Court Rules of Disciplinary Procedure.', 'Justice Goldberg, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority decision that adopts the recommendation of the Disciplinary Board of the Rhode Island Supreme Court (the board) that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for a period of one year. I do not undertake this dissent lightly, but do so in accordance with my firm belief that the duty to protect the integrity of this profession rests with this Court and, in light of that responsibility, the sanction adopted by the majority is inadequate and fails to respond to the egregious nature and sheer number of material misrepresentations made by the respondent and, importantly, also ignores the respondent’s conduct before the board.', '- 37 -', 'Having carefully reviewed the entire record in this proceeding and in light of the recommendation of disbarment by Assistant Disciplinary Counsel who prosecuted the petition, I cannot agree with such a minimal sanction, which, in my opinion, does little to further any of the Court’s well-established goals in imposing attorney discipline. In the face of this egregious misconduct, this sanction does scant justice and overlooks the sad fact that this lawyer of many years refuses or is unable to accept the authority of the Supreme Court over the conduct of attorneys. In my opinion, this sanction amounts to a slap on the wrist.', 'I begin by noting that, before the board, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel advocated that respondent should be disbarred.', 'The board found, by clear and convincing evidence, that respondent violated the Rules of Professional Conduct in each and every count of the petition. The board also rejected respondent’s conspiracy-theory defense and his “unsupported and inflammatory assertions * * * that he [was] being subjected to disciplinary action and/or persecuted because of his controversial positions on constitutional issues,” and it concluded that his “arguments and suppositions [were] mere sophistry which [did] nothing to dissuade [the board] from its conclusion.”', 'Next, the board recommended a suspension from the practice of law for a period of one year, but did not set forth any reasoning for this recommendation. The board also failed to address the recommendation of Assistant Disciplinary Counsel that respondent be disbarred. It is this aspect of the board’s decision with which I take issue. I join the majority in commending the board, and particularly the members of the panel, for their herculean efforts in this matter and for the fine work of the Court’s Assistant Disciplinary Counsel and Deputy Disciplinary Counsel. However, it is this Court’s responsibility to impose discipline that responds to the circumstances of the case. See In re Schiff, 677 A.2d 422, 424-25 (R.I. 1996) (refusing to adopt a', '- 38 - recommendation of public censure for an attorney who filed a false fee affidavit and instead imposing an eighteen-month suspension).', 'In his memorandum to this Court—a copy of which is attached to this opinion as an Addendum—Assistant Disciplinary Counsel acknowledged the board’s recommendation of a one-year suspension; but, nonetheless, in light of respondent’s serial violations of misconduct, he argued “that the severity of [r]espondent’s actions as well as the lack of mitigation factors[,] coupled with his utter disregard for not only this process, but this Court’s authority and the protection of not only the integrity of the profession[,] but the public as well[,] warrants a significant sanction beyond the one (1) year suspension recommended by the [b]oard.” (Emphasis added.) I concur.', 'It is my belief that, when imposing attorney discipline, this Court should look to the totality of the circumstances, including the proceedings before the board. Indeed, the level of cooperation before the board and respondent’s cooperation with Disciplinary Counsel are factors that generally are brought to this Court’s attention in disciplinary matters.', 'This was not an easy road for Assistant Disciplinary Counsel. The respondent challenged his authority at every level as an ultra vires appointment by this Court. His integrity was assailed, he was referred to on numerous occasions by respondent as a “hit man for the * * * Supreme Court,” who was hired to “search and destroy” him; and, significantly, he alleged that, as a practicing lawyer, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel could expect favorable advantage because of his service to this Court. Assistant Disciplinary Counsel was sued four times—three times in federal court and once in Superior Court. The level of vilification directed by respondent toward anyone connected with the investigation and prosecution of this case, including the chair of the', '- 39 - panel and the Court’s Deputy Disciplinary Counsel and Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, is shocking and should not be overlooked by this Court.', 'I share Assistant Disciplinary Counsel’s concern that, in addition to the unassailable findings of misconduct “demonstrat[ing] a lack of candor amounting to dishonesty in dealing with various tribunals” and respondent’s “refusal or inability to recognize his obligations under the Rules of Professional Conduct[,]” respondent also violated a direct order from this Court prohibiting him from practicing law in the corporate form and thereafter engaged in a course of conduct, throughout these proceedings, in which he consistently and blatantly sought to “circumvent this Court’s authority over his law practice[.]”', 'By way of apparent mitigation of respondent’s misconduct, the majority notes that respondent has been a member of the bar for many years and has performed pro bono services during that time. This mitigation does not tip the scales for me.', 'To this day, respondent has failed to produce the documents sought by Assistant Disciplinary Counsel in defiance of a lawfully issued subpoena, on the ground that Assistant Disciplinary Counsel had no authority to issue it. He moved to quash the subpoena, not before this Court, but before the board, the day before the return date. He appeared at the deposition and flatly refused to produce the records. His statement to the board about why he refused to produce the sought-after records is emblematic:', '“I did bring the records, I did not give them to him because, as I', 'have said before, he’s an employee hired by the Supreme Court', 'who has no authority to do this. And I then filed a lawsuit against', 'him in Federal Court. So I met the request even though I thought', 'he had no statutory or constitutional authority [to] do anything of', 'the kind. He’s not an Assistant Disciplinary Counsel. He’s a hired', 'gun by the Rhode Island Supreme Court by cont[r]act. He gets', 'paid an hourly fee and he has no authority [to] do depositions or to', 'request subpoenas.” (Emphasis added.)', '- 40 - In my opinion, the fact that Assistant Disciplinary Counsel resorted to issuing subpoenas for respondent’s bank records is of no moment to this discussion. The respondent should have been suspended from the practice of law for noncompliance with Article V, Rule 1.19 of the Supreme Court Rules of Professional Conduct like every other attorney who fails to comply with Rule 1.19. In no event should respondent be readmitted to the practice of law until he produces all records that were subject to subpoena.', 'As noted, during the course of these proceedings, respondent filed numerous lawsuits against the Chief Justice, the board, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, and various court employees challenging the authority of the board and Assistant Disciplinary Counsel. Finally, after hearings that spanned over one year, the board issued its findings and submitted its recommendation to this Court. We issued an order directing respondent to appear before this Court in order to respond to the findings of the board. In response, respondent moved to recuse the members of this Court based on bias, unethical conduct, and a violation of his right to due process. Next, he filed yet another federal lawsuit—his third—seeking to restrain this Court from proceeding. That complaint was entitled “COMPLAINT TO STAY SUSPENSION OF PLAINTIFF FROM PRACTING [sic] LAW FOR HIS ACTS IN FILING FEDERAL BANKING [sic] PROCEEDING,', 'ANSWERING', 'FEDERAL', 'ADVERSARY', 'PROCEEDURES', '[sic], CHALLENGING UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTS IN FEDERAL COURT.” The respondent’s rambling discourse in this pleading, as well as his conduct in his appearances before the panel of the board, convince me that he has no insight into his obligations as a member of the bar or the gravity of his dishonesty and attorney misconduct.', 'In this eleventh-hour salvo, respondent alleged that the Supreme Court was not an adequate or fair forum to hear this matter; that the Court has no authority to suspend respondent', '- 41 - in the absence of a complaint from a client or a judge or the Bankruptcy Trustee; that the Rules of Professional Conduct are “unconstitutional”; and that Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, at the direction of his client, this Court, has undertaken “an otherwise unfounded and unconstitutional pre-textual administrative inquisition of the [p]laintiff’s practice of law to seek possible technical violations of the Rule[s] * * * of Professional Conduct[.]” He alleged that this Court has no authority over lawyers “outside of the walls of the R.I. Supreme Court, and in particular within the U.S. Bankruptcy Court”; and that the appointment of Assistant Disciplinary Counsel was in retaliation for respondent’s exercise of his rights under the First Amendment.', 'I pause to note that respondent, clearly and unequivocally, has every right to express his opinions about the members of this Court, the constitution, and his version of the separation of powers in this state and the United States; he even is free to amalgamate those doctrines as he often does. See, e.g., In re Application of Roots, 762 A.2d 1161, 1170 (R.I. 2000). Nonetheless, he must comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct.', 'The respondent was found by the board to have filed numerous motions out of time, which were declared to be specious and designed to delay the tribunal. He continued to file the same motions and make the same arguments ad nauseam. The respondent contended that the numerous allegations in the petition filed by Disciplinary Counsel amounted to “pettifoggery” and “frivolous little things” taken out of context. He also accused, without apparent foundation or good-faith basis, Barbara Margolis, the Court’s Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, of participating in the discussions and deliberations of the board. Ms. Margolis did not attend any deliberations or discussions of the board, and respondent was admonished by the Chair.', 'On numerous occasions respondent moved the Chair to recuse herself, based on his contention that her evidentiary rulings demonstrated bias. At the conclusion of the hearings', '- 42 - before the board, respondent refused to rest his case. He had no further witnesses to call. When asked if he had any other exhibits to introduce, he stated that he did, but that the Chair would “have to wait until I get them.” When informed that the exhibits were required to be produced later that day, respondent refused to produce any further evidence and refused to rest his case. The Chair declared the evidence closed. The respondent’s actions before the board, in my opinion, amounted to unprofessional conduct in violation of Article III, Rule 6(e) of the Supreme Court Rules of Disciplinary Procedure. 1', 'The respondent’s conduct, his multitude of lawsuits challenging the authority of this Court, his deceitful behavior and lack of candor―as set forth in the petition and findings of the board―his refusal to cooperate with Disciplinary Counsel, and his disobedience to a lawfully issued subpoena duces tecum, merit a significantly longer period of suspension and an order that respondent must reapply for admission to the bar, must produce the records demanded by the subpoena, and must demonstrate his fitness to practice law, including his obligation to comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct. Unless he is able to do that, respondent should be deemed unfit to practice law.', 'The respondent’s personal opinions about the current or former members of this Court have no bearing on my opinion in this case, nor do his quixotic ramblings concerning his view of our constitutional structure. The judicial power rests with this Court. The respondent’s view of the state’s separation of powers as including overlapping responsibilities and authority among 1', 'Article III, Rule 6(e) of the Supreme Court Rules of Disciplinary Procedure provides:', '“Duty to Cooperate. The failure of an attorney whose conduct is the subject of an', 'investigation authorized by these rules to comply with the reasonable orders and', 'requests of either Counsel or the Board shall constitute unprofessional conduct,', 'and any such failure shall be referred forthwith to this Court for such action as it', 'deems appropriate.”', '- 43 - the branches is irrelevant in the context of attorney regulation and discipline. Moreover, respondent’s flexible and fluid arguments about this state’s constitutional structure do not serve as a shield against his perfidious conduct or block scrutiny by this Court.', 'In addition to respondent’s behavior during the course of this investigation, my concern about the inadequate penalty also extends to the breadth and nature of his misconduct that led to the petition. It is important to note that the petition filed by Disciplinary Counsel did not concern merely one event or proceeding. The violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct did not involve a client or any zealous advocacy by respondent to protect the rights of a client. This disciplinary petition solely dealt with respondent’s operation of his law practice and his behavior before the state and federal tribunals concerning his own affairs.', 'In count 1, the board noted that respondent admitted that he was not insolvent, but he filed two bankruptcy petitions solely to obtain a stay of an order in the Workers’ Compensation Court that compelled him to pay money to a former employee. This action was taken in order to impede the Workers’ Compensation proceeding. The respondent then filed an application with this Court for permission to practice law as a limited liability company (LLC). This Court issued an order prohibiting respondent from practicing law in any corporate form until he certified that he was no longer practicing law as Keven A. McKenna, PC. He defied this order, changed the name of the corporation to McKenna Support Services, LLC, and continued to practice law under that corporate form. Significantly, practicing law as McKenna Support Services, LLC constitutes the practice of law as an LLC, the very conduct this Court proscribed.', 'The respondent failed to change his bank account, continued to deposit client checks and draw funds for operating expenses from that account, and did so until he was advised that a subpoena had issued for his banking records. He then filed a federal lawsuit seeking to quash that subpoena.', '- 44 -', 'The board found that respondent held himself out as an LLC in violation of an express order from this Court. The board also found respondent’s attempts to justify his conduct and “minimize the gravity of his diversion from the applicable disciplinary rules, as palpably disingenuous.” (Emphasis added.) Standing alone, this finding warrants further suspension. This Court frequently is asked by Disciplinary Counsel to consider an attorney’s lack of candor to Disciplinary Counsel and the board during a disciplinary proceeding.', 'Count 2 of the petition focused on respondent’s unprofessional conduct before the Bankruptcy Court—in failing to disclose income, misrepresenting his interest in a receivable, and engaging in conduct that amounted to a lack of candor and dishonesty—and in his failure to cooperate with the U.S. Trustee’s investigation. The respondent failed to report the receivable in his sworn statement to the Bankruptcy Court and to his own attorney. He unilaterally, and without notice to the Bankruptcy Trustee, filed a motion for a whopping attorney’s fee and filed an affidavit, in the Town of Bristol Probate Court, designed to place a lien against the probate estate of a former client. He got caught. The U.S. Trustee filed an adversary complaint against him and objected to any discharge. In response to this complaint, respondent proceeded to commit even more violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, including lack of candor and actions intended to disrupt the proceeding. In his answer to the adversary complaint, respondent refused to admit or deny basic information, including his refusal to admit that copies of his own pleadings were true and accurate copies. He also failed to comply with a subpoena to produce records.', 'In addressing count 2, the board made a plethora of adverse findings against respondent, including that he “made serial misstatements and misrepresentations regarding his financial affairs, or omitted material facts which he was under an obligation to disclose under sworn', '- 45 - statement in the Bankruptcy Court and in testimony at hearing on the instant [p]etition.” The board set forth seven separate material misrepresentations with respect to this receivable. Additionally, the board found that respondent “engaged in a course of conduct deliberately designed to hide the existence, value and collectability of the Wells Receivable. This course of conduct included the making of false statements of material fact, the failure to disclose material facts and the offering of evidence that the [r]espondent knew to be false.” The board concluded that this conduct simply cannot be countenanced. The board also declared:', '“It is unfathomable that the serial misrepresentations and', 'omissions of material fact, as unearthed and presented in this case,', 'and which we find established by clear and convincing evidence,', 'would occur without a mindset purposely predisposed to', 'preventing the disclosure of assets which [respondent] deliberately', 'attempted to hide from creditors, including the Bankruptcy', 'Trustee.”', 'The board also found that respondent’s conduct was intended to and did disrupt the tribunal. The board also rejected, as ringing hollow, respondent’s tired refrain that neither the board nor this Court has jurisdiction over lawyers in federal court proceedings. See In re Schiff, 677 A.2d at 424 (attorney disciplined for filing false document in United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island).', 'Count 3 relates to respondent’s unprofessional conduct with respect to a deposition conducted by Assistant Disciplinary Counsel and respondent’s subsequent refusal to maintain records as mandated by Rule 1.19. The respondent was served with a lawfully issued subpoena directing him to appear and bring certain records and to testify with respect to the veracity and completeness of the records produced. He refused to do so. The night before the scheduled deposition, he moved to quash the subpoena on the ground that Assistant Disciplinary Counsel did not have the authority to conduct the disciplinary investigation. The board could discern no', '- 46 - credible authority to support this assertion and found that respondent refused to comply with the subpoena in violation of Rule 1.19 and, further, that he engaged in obstreperous tactics and conduct before the board. This conduct is unacceptable. Attorneys are required to cooperate in any investigation by Disciplinary Counsel or face serious consequences. This Court has not hesitated to respond appropriately when called upon to do so. See In re D’Ambrosio, 29 A.3d 1241, 1241-42 (R.I. 2011) (mem.) (suspending respondent from the practice of law for failure to comply with a duly authorized subpoena directing him to provide financial records to Disciplinary Counsel in connection with a disciplinary complaint); In re Williams, 791 A.2d 486, 486 (R.I. 2002) (mem.) (disbarring an attorney―after an initial suspension―for disregard of the Court’s order to comply with subpoenas issued in connection with a disciplinary investigation).', 'Count 4 brings us to yet another forum, the Workers’ Compensation Court, where respondent disrupted the proceedings, failed to exhibit candor, accused the Chief Judge of bias against him, and threatened the Chief Judge, declaring that he was “suing you personally because you’re trying to make, take money out of my pocket. I’m going to take money out of your pockets.” The board found that respondent was flippant, evasive, dilatory, and disruptive when he refused to disclose his home address to the Workers’ Compensation Court, noting that documents he filed in the Bankruptcy Court, the Office of the Secretary of State, and in everyday correspondence included the number and name of the street address he refused to disclose to the court. Additionally, the board found that respondent refused to admit the existence of pretrial orders that were part of the court record and refused to answer straightforward questions and feigned a lack of recollection of his claim for a trial and feigned a lack of understanding of simple questions. The board found that respondent was “deliberately and unnecessarily disruptive and dilatory, disrespectful to the [c]ourt[,] including the judge and opposing counsel,', '- 47 - combative, evasive, unresponsive, disputatious and pugnacious in both his testimony and in his actions as counsel for himself before the Workers’ Compensation Court * * *.”', 'Accordingly, based on the numerous, indeed successive and escalating, incidents of dishonesty and unprofessional conduct committed by respondent, all of which related to his conduct as an attorney and officer of this Court, I am of the belief that a suspension of one year does not respond to the seriousness of the violations, their number, or their scope. Although this Court appropriately accords deference to the recommendations of the board, we also pay close attention to the arguments of the Disciplinary Counsel, who have an opportunity to appear before the Court when discipline is recommended.', 'In this instance, although acknowledging the recommendation of Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, the board failed to set forth any discussion of its reasons for rejecting the recommendation and instead recommended a suspension of one year.', 'In appropriate cases, this Court has elected not to adopt the recommendation of the board. See In re Schiff, 677 A.2d at 424-25 (declining to follow the board’s recommendation of a public censure and imposing an eighteen-month suspension for filing a false fee affidavit in federal court); Lisi v. Resmini, 603 A.2d 321, 324 (R.I. 1992) (rejecting the board’s recommendation of a sixty-day suspension and ordering a suspension of one year for filing a false jurat). In Carter v. Muka, 502 A.2d 327 (R.I. 1985), this Court initially suspended and, after a lengthy evidentiary proceeding before the full Court—which was necessary because a respondent filed suit against the entire disciplinary board—subsequently disbarred Betty Muka for, among other things, filing unfounded lawsuits with the intent to harass or injure another; knowingly advancing a claim that was unwarranted under existing law; engaging in conduct which was degrading to a tribunal; and knowingly making false accusations against a judge, including vituperative and unsupported accusations against a justice of the Superior Court and other members of the bar. Id. at 328-30.', '- 48 - Although Muka certainly represents an extreme case, this Court’s concerns for the rights of individuals who were hauled into court based on Attorney Muka’s baseless claims and the rights of litigants in our courtrooms, including her “utter disregard for the requirements of law and the rights of any person who has the temerity to disagree with her[,]” id. at 330, are relevant to this analysis.', 'In conclusion, it is my opinion that the sanction recommended by the board, and adopted by the majority, is wholly inadequate and, when compared to discipline imposed upon other members of the bar for a single violation of the disciplinary rules, is disparate.', 'Although I do not, as the majority suggests, consider “a one-year hiatus” from the practice of law to be “insignificant,” I continue to believe that the sanction in this case, for what is serial misconduct involving deceit and dishonesty, is a nominal sanction that does not respond to this Court’s goal of maintaining the integrity of this honorable profession.', 'Furthermore, it is my belief that the respondent should not be readmitted to the practice of law unless and until he produces the records that were the subject of a lawfully issued subpoena. This Court has never overlooked an attorney’s refusal to produce records sought by Disciplinary Counsel.

The plaintiff, Joseph Laplante,1 appeals pro se from the Providence County Superior Court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendants, Rhode Island Hospital, Lifespan, Inc., Frantz J. Gibbs, M.D., and Michael P. Bradley, M.D.2 This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a close review of the record and careful consideration of the parties’ arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The other plaintiff named in the complaint, Suzanne Laplante, is not a party to the instant appeal, as her claims were withdrawn earlier in the litigation. 2', 'We note that there were three other defendants named in Mr. Laplante’s initial complaint: Thomas G. Lemke, M.D., Jac D. Scheiner, M.D., and Scott M. Levine, M.D. Doctor Scheiner was dismissed from the case prior to this appeal, and Drs. Lemke and Levine received judgments in their favor at earlier stages in the litigation. None of the just-referenced individuals is a party to the instant appeal. Accordingly, where referenced hereinafter, the term “defendants” embraces only Rhode Island Hospital, Lifespan, Inc., Dr. Gibbs, and Dr. Bradley.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On February 23, 2006, Joseph Laplante filed a pro se complaint in Superior Court against defendants, advancing therein claims of medical malpractice and negligence, inter alia.3 According to the complaint, the underlying events that gave rise to Mr. Laplante’s claims began three years earlier, in February of 2003, when Mr. Laplante was injured in a car accident. He alleged that, following the accident, he was transported from the scene by ambulance to Rhode Island Hospital (the Hospital) and admitted to the trauma unit.', 'The thrust of Mr. Laplante’s allegations concern his stay at the Hospital following the accident. Mr. Laplante alleged that, in February of 2003, while at the Hospital, he was “deprived of many treatments * * * and was discharged early because of lack of insurance.” Mr. Laplante further claimed that he was readmitted to the Hospital in March of 2003, only a few weeks after his initial stay, and was thereafter diagnosed with a fractured pelvis. Accordingly, Mr. Laplante asserted that defendants were negligent in light of their purported failure to diagnose his fractured pelvis during his initial stay at the Hospital and that their negligence was the cause of his deficient treatment and premature discharge.', 'In March of 2006, defendants answered Mr. Laplante’s complaint; and, in due course, the parties embarked on a lengthy period of discovery. From the Superior Court record, it is clear that Mr. Laplante, then represented by counsel, failed to comply with several of defendants’ discovery requests and subsequently failed to comply with Superior Court orders compelling such compliance.

The hearing justice granted the motion for conditional dismissal and required that Mr. Laplante disclose his expert witness by February 21, 2011 as a precondition to vacating the dismissal order. When Mr. Laplante again failed to make such disclosure, defendants moved for an entry of final judgment.', 'The defendants allege that, during the subsequent hearing on defendants’ motion for entry of final judgment, Mr. Laplante indicated that he planned to pursue his case based upon the theory of res ipsa loquitur. In spite of this contention regarding Mr. Laplante’s theory of the case, after hearing arguments from the parties on defendants’ motion, the hearing justice issued an order barring Mr. Laplante from “engaging the services of an expert witness or witnesses to offer testimony at trial, whether through deposition or live testimony.” The hearing justice added that defendants would be permitted thereafter to file a motion addressing whether Mr. Laplante could proceed on his claims in the absence of testimony from an expert witness.', 'Shortly thereafter, in March of 2011, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, advancing precisely the argument referred to by the hearing justice––viz., that Mr. Laplante could not carry his burden of proof without the benefit of expert testimony. Moreover, they 4', 'For the sake of clarity, we shall refer to the Superior Court justices who presided over the hearings at issue in this opinion simply as “the hearing justice.”', '-3- alleged that the facts in Mr. Laplante’s case would not support the application of the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.', 'On May 17, 2011, the hearing justice heard arguments on defendants’ motion for summary judgment. First, the hearing justice found that res ipsa loquitur did not apply in the instant case, noting that Mr. Laplante would not be able to make the requisite showings that his injury would normally not occur in the absence of negligence, nor would he be able to show that no outside force caused his fractured pelvis, rather than defendants’ alleged negligence. Second, the hearing justice found that, without expert testimony, a jury would be unable to determine whether defendants proximately caused Mr. Laplante’s injuries. Accordingly, the hearing justice granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment. From that decision, Mr. Laplante timely appealed.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'We have long recognized that “[s]ummary judgment is a drastic remedy, and a motion for summary judgment should be dealt with cautiously.” Beauregard v.

Zoning Board of Review of Newport, 64 A.3d 1171, 1174 (R.I. 2013). Accordingly, this Court has long adhered to the principle that “[w]e will affirm the grant of summary judgment only [i]f we conclude, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, that there is no genuine issue of material fact to be decided and that the moving party is entitled to', '-4- judgment as a matter of law.” DeMaio v.

However, he later retained an attorney to represent him. On appeal, Mr. Laplante is appearing pro se once more.', '-5-', 'A', 'The Alleged Issues of Fact', 'Mr. Laplante first argues that the hearing justice failed to acknowledge several triable issues of material fact that he contends should have precluded summary judgment in defendants’ favor. In support of his argument, Mr. Laplante proffers his hospital records, a discharge summary, and his own assertions regarding the conduct of defendants during his treatment; he contends that said exhibits establish the existence of a genuine dispute as to material facts. In addition, he contends that a factfinder would not need an expert to draw conclusions from these exhibits regarding defendants’ negligence. However, we reject Mr. Laplante’s contentions in light of our well-established precedent.', 'Under Rhode Island law, in order for a plaintiff to make out a case of medical malpractice, the plaintiff must provide “expert testimony * * * to establish deviation from the standard of care when the lack of care is not so evident as to be obvious to a lay person.” Malinou v. Miriam Hospital, 24 A.3d 497, 509 (R.I. 2011) (emphasis added). By contrast, where the lack of care is “so obvious as to be within the layman’s common knowledge,” expert testimony is unnecessary; for example, such a situation might occur if a surgeon were to leave an instrument inside a patient. Marshall v. Tomaselli, 118 R.I. 190, 196, 372 A.2d 1280, 1283 (1977); see also Foley v.

Cajun Music Ltd., 694 A.2d 686, 690-91 (R.I. 1997). In addition, this is not the type of case in which defendants’ alleged negligence would be obvious to a layperson. The question of whether and how defendants’ diagnosis and treatment of Mr. Laplante aggravated his pelvic fracture is one that must be answered with expert testimony. See, e.g., Malinou, 24 A.3d at 509 (holding that “the appropriate treatment of a patient with a documented history of dysphagia [difficulty swallowing], who experienced respiratory failure allegedly caused by aspiration” was not evident to an ordinary person); Foley, 899 A.2d at 1277 (holding that the alleged negligence involved in a “delay of more than five hours from the time [the plaintiff] was admitted to the emergency room until the radiology department reported the results of her CT scan” would not be obvious to an ordinary person); cf. Khan v. Singh, 975 A.2d 389, 395 (N.J. 2009) (“[In] our earlier decision[,] * * * we permitted the inference [of negligence] in a matter in which a surgeon left a sponge inside of a patient.”).', 'In light of the foregoing, we hold that the hearing justice correctly found that Mr. Laplante could not establish any triable issues of material fact without expert testimony; accordingly, the hearing justice did not err in granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on these grounds.', '-7-', 'B', 'Res Ipsa Loquitur', 'Next, Mr. Laplante argues that the hearing justice erred in finding that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur did not apply in the instant case. We agree with the hearing justice and hold that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur cannot properly be applied to the facts of this case.', 'At the outset, it is important to note that the use of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine in medical malpractice cases is disfavored. See Wilkinson v. Vesey, 110 R.I. 606, 630, 295 A.2d 676, 691 (1972) (“As a general rule res ipsa is not applied in medical malpractice actions.”). We have described the doctrine as follows: “[R]es ipsa loquitur establishes inferential evidence of a defendant’s negligence, thus making out a prima facie case for a plaintiff, and casts upon a defendant the burden of rebutting the same to the satisfaction of the jury.” McLaughlin v. Moura, 754 A.2d 95, 98 (R.I. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). For a plaintiff to utilize this doctrine, “three conditions must be met: (1) the accident or injury must be of a kind which does not occur in the absence of someone’s negligence; (2) such accident or injury must be caused by an agency or instrumentality in the exclusive control of the defendant; and (3) it must not have been caused by any voluntary act or contribution on the part of the plaintiff.” Marshall, 118 R.I. at 197-98, 372 A.2d at 1284. With respect to causation (the second condition), we have held that “the causal connection between negligence and a plaintiff’s injury must be established by competent evidence and may not be based on conjecture or speculation.” McLaughlin, 754 A.2d at 98 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).', 'Such competent evidence is often provided by expert testimony; as we stated in Wilkinson, 110 R.I. at 631, 295 A.2d at 691, “[i]f the determination of negligence does not fall within the ken of the jury’s practical common sense, [res ipsa loquitur] can be called upon if', '-8- there is expert testimony that the injury complained of would not have occurred had the physician exercised due care.”', 'In the instant case, Mr. Laplante cannot demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to the applicability of res ipsa loquitur.

Wormuth, 997 N.E.2d 133, 136 (N.Y. 2013) (“[I]n the context of a medical malpractice case based upon a foreign object, [r]es ipsa loquitur is applicable where * * * [the object] is unintentionally left in a patient following an operative procedure[.]”) (emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Khan, 975 A.2d at 395.', 'Second, Mr. Laplante has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact as to the conditions required to invoke res ipsa loquitur. For example, it should be recalled that a plaintiff relying upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur must demonstrate that “such accident or injury [was] * * * caused by an agency or instrumentality in the exclusive control of the defendant.” Marshall, 118 R.I. at 198, 372 A.2d at 1284 (emphasis added). In the instant case, Mr. Laplante has pointed to no evidence that, during the time period that elapsed between Mr. Laplante’s admission to the Hospital in February of 2003 and his diagnosis weeks later in March of 2003, nothing, other than defendants’ alleged negligence, caused or aggravated his pelvic fracture. In other words, while Mr. Laplante contends that it was defendants’ misdiagnosis and premature discharge that caused or aggravated his fractured pelvis, he has failed to offer any evidence to', '-9- exclude the possibility that, in the intervening time between his February and March stays at the Hospital, he or a third party undertook some action that caused or aggravated his pelvic fracture.', 'The nature of res ipsa loquitur is to permit a plaintiff to demonstrate that “the injury complained of would not have occurred had the physician exercised due care.” Wilkinson, 110 R.I. at 631, 295 A.2d at 691. In the instant case, Mr. Laplante cannot make this demonstration without expert testimony and without evidence establishing the requisite conditions in order to utilize the res ipsa loquitur doctrine.

48,": v. : Huhtamaki, Inc., et al. :",non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Robinson, for the Court. This case arose from the refusal of the defendant Huhtamaki, Inc. (Huhtamaki) to indemnify the plaintiff, Ferris Avenue Realty, LLC (Ferris), after Ferris incurred certain costs related to the cleanup of hazardous substances. After a thirteen-day trial, the jury found in favor of Ferris. On appeal, Huhtamaki argues that the trial justice erred in: (1) construing an indemnity agreement executed by the parties; (2) admitting certain testimony from Ferris’s expert witness; (3) admitting allegedly spoliated evidence; (4) instructing the jury; and (5) permitting Ferris to rely upon what Huhtamaki contends was “a pyramid of inferences” as it sought to prove its case.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 22, 2003, Ferris purchased from Huhtamaki approximately twenty-two acres of property located in East Providence (the Property). At the time of that purchase, the parties executed a document entitled “Indemnity Agreement Regarding Hazardous Materials” (the', '-1- Indemnity Agreement).1', 'Simply put, the Indemnity Agreement provided that, upon the occurrence of certain conditions, Huhtamaki would reimburse Ferris for environmental cleanup costs.', 'Thereafter, in 2005, Ferris sought to build a residential complex on a section of the Property referred to by both parties as Parcel A.2 Accordingly, the firm of Vanasse, Hangen, Brustlin, Inc. (VHB) was hired to inspect the entire Property, including Parcel A. In the course of its inspection, VHB conducted soil and groundwater testing on samples taken from Parcel A. Analysis of those samples revealed that Parcel A’s soil and groundwater were contaminated with hazardous substances in amounts that violated the minimum quality standards established and enforced by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM). Specifically, VHB discovered in the samples certain chlorinated industrial solvents including “1,1,1- tricholoethane” (TCA) and “tetrachloroethylene” (PCE).3', 'On December 19, 2005, after finding the just-referenced hazardous substances in the soil and groundwater samples taken from Parcel A, VHB submitted a plan to DEM, in which it reported the presence of hazardous substances on Parcel A and proposed a remediation plan; that proposed plan included excavating the contaminated soil. Very shortly after that plan was 1', 'The Indemnity Agreement is discussed further in Part III.A, infra. 2', 'Parcel A consists of 4.5 acres located at the northeast extremity of the Property. 3', 'The substance referred to as PCE throughout this opinion (and in many of the documents referenced herein) is known variously as “perchloroethylene,” “tetrachloroethylene,” and “tetrachloroethene.” We recognize that two of the names by which PCE is known (“tetrachloroethylene” and “tetrachloroethene”) are spelled in a confusingly similar way.', '-2- submitted, on December 21, 2005, DEM sent a missive entitled “Letter of Responsibility”4 to both Ferris and Huhtamaki.5', 'That letter indicated, inter alia, that hazardous substances, including PCE, had been found on the Property.', 'On January 30, 2006, over a month after the Letter of Responsibility was sent, Ferris began excavating the affected soil from Parcel A; the process of excavation continued until February 10, 2006. Shortly thereafter, in a letter dated February 14, 2006, Ferris advised Huhtamaki that it was “being notified herein, pursuant to Section 6 of the Indemnity Agreement, of the claim or demand by RIDEM and the fact that [Ferris] has and will incur costs and expenses for which you [Huhtamaki] are responsible under the terms of the Indemnity Agreement.” Huhtamaki responded in a letter dated March 10, 2006, in which it refused to indemnify Ferris on the ground that the latter company had “failed to provide notice with reasonable promptness,” which Huhtamaki contended was required by the Indemnity Agreement. After Huhtamaki’s refusal, Ferris filed a complaint in the Superior Court for Providence County, on April 16, 2007, thereby commencing the present litigation. Huhtamaki answered in due course and asserted several counterclaims.', 'A', 'Ferris’s Motion for Partial Summary Judgment', 'On October 22, 2010, after both parties had engaged in substantial discovery, Ferris moved for partial summary judgment, seeking a favorable ruling as to what it characterized as 4', 'Some of the documents referenced in this Court’s discussion have headings which use all capital letters, are underlined, or employ bold-face type. We have conformed those headings to our usual style throughout this opinion. 5', 'It was established in the course of litigation that DEM sent the Letter of Responsibility to Huhtamaki in error due to the fact that DEM believed that Huhtamaki still operated the Property. Nevertheless, it is uncontested that Huhtamaki received and reviewed the Letter of Responsibility.', '-3- the “validity and enforceability of the Indemnity Agreement;” in due course, that motion was granted. The trial justice6 rejected Huhtamaki’s contention that it could not possibly be liable to Ferris because, under Huhtamaki’s interpretation of the Indemnity Agreement, Ferris was entitled to assert a claim for indemnification only in connection with third-party actions.', 'For the trial justice to be able to pass upon Ferris’s right (vel non) to assert a claim for indemnification for voluntarily incurred cleanup costs (as opposed to a claim for those cleanup costs that might be required by a third party like DEM), he was required to determine which part of Section 6 of the Indemnity Agreement applied—i.e., did Section 6(c) or Section 6(a) control? Ferris argued that Section 6(c) clearly constituted a vehicle for it to assert indemnification claims against Huhtamaki with respect to the cleanup costs incurred by Ferris in January and February of 2006. Section 6(c) reads in pertinent part as follows:', '“6. Procedure. All claims for indemnification by a party', 'under this Agreement shall be asserted and resolved as follows:', '“* * *', '“(c) If [Ferris] should have a claim against [Huhtamaki]', 'hereunder which does not involve a claim or demand being', 'asserted against or sought to be collected from it by a third party,', '[Ferris] shall send a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to', '[Huhtamaki]. If [Huhtamaki] disputes such claim, such dispute', 'shall be resolved by litigation in an appropriate court of competent', 'jurisdiction.” (Emphasis added.) On the basis of this language, Ferris argued that the Indemnity Agreement sets forth a procedure for Ferris to bring a claim for indemnification on its own behalf. 6', 'Since the same judicial officer presided over both the motion for partial summary judgment and the subsequent trial, we shall refer to him throughout as the trial justice.', '-4-', 'By contrast, Huhtamaki stoutly maintained that, pursuant to the Indemnity Agreement, Ferris was authorized to assert a claim for indemnification only in connection with actions initiated against it by a third party pursuant to Section 6(a) of the Indemnity Agreement.', 'After asserting that Section 6(a) rather than Section 6(c) applied, 7 Huhtamaki (in both its memorandum in opposition to Ferris’s motion for partial summary judgment and in its counterclaim for breach of contract) contended that, even if Ferris could recover under the Indemnity Agreement for claims not associated with third parties, Ferris had not complied with the requisite “Claim Notice” provisions contained in Section 6(a).', 'Section 6(a) reads, in pertinent part, as follows:', '“(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which', '[Huhtamaki] would be liable to [Ferris] * * * is asserted against or', 'sought to be collected from [Ferris] by a third party, [Ferris] shall', 'with reasonable promptness give notice (the ‘Claim Notice’) to', '[Huhtamaki] of such claim or demand, specifying the nature of and', 'specific basis for such claim or demand and the amount or the', 'estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible * * *.', '[Huhtamaki] shall not be obligated to indemnify [Ferris] under this', 'Agreement with respect to any such claim or demand if [Ferris]', 'fails to notify the [Huhtamaki] thereof in accordance with the', 'provisions of this Agreement, and, as a result of such failure,', '[Huhtamaki’s] ability to defend against the claim or demand is', 'materially prejudiced. [Huhtamaki] shall have ten (10) days from', 'the delivery or mailing of the Claim Notice (the ‘Notice Period’) to', 'notify [Ferris] (i) whether or not it disputes the liability * * * and', '(ii) whether or not it desires * * * to defend [Ferris] against such', 'claim or demand * * *.” (Emphasis added.) Referencing the just-mentioned provision, Huhtamaki argued that, because Ferris sent the February 14, 2006 “Claim Notice” letter after it had excavated the soil in question, Ferris had not complied with the “reasonable promptness” requirement contained in Section 6(a). Huhtamaki 7', 'In seeking to explain what purpose is served by Section 6(c), Huhtamaki contended, rather delphically, that Section 6(c), when read “in context,” applies only “to claims of [Ferris] that are not sought by a third party, but which must still be necessary response costs reasonably incurred by [Ferris] that are necessarily associated with such a mandatory action.”', '-5- added that it was “prejudiced” in that it did not have the opportunity to clarify with DEM what actions were required on the property to “protect the public health.”', 'With respect to the notice issue, Ferris contended that, because Section 6(c) states that Ferris is required simply to give “Claim Notice” to Huhtamaki, the “reasonable promptness” requirement embodied in Section 6(a) was not applicable. Ferris further argued that, even if Section 6(a) applied, there had de facto been reasonably prompt notice because Huhtamaki had received DEM’s Letter of Responsibility at a point in time before the process of removing the contaminated soil began.', 'As previously indicated, the trial justice granted Ferris’s motion for partial summary judgment with respect to the issue of whether the Indemnity Agreement provided Ferris with a right to seek indemnification for its own claims (as opposed to a claim for those cleanup costs that might be required by a third party).8 The trial justice’s lengthy decision dated February 18, 2011 grapples in a scholarly manner with the competing contentions of the parties as to that issue. Relevant to our analysis here, he held that Section 6(c), rather than Section 6(a), controlled—because he viewed Section 6(c) as expressly setting out the procedure for Ferris to initiate its own claims for indemnification against Huhtamaki.', 'In addressing Huhtamaki’s breach of contract counterclaim (in which Huhtamaki alleged that Ferris had breached the Indemnity Agreement by failing to provide the requisite “Claim Notice”), the trial justice found that the “reasonable promptness” requirement was not embodied in Section 6(c). The trial justice then determined that “the February 14, 2006 letter from [Ferris] 8', 'The trial justice also granted Ferris’s motion for summary judgment with respect to all five counts contained in Huhtamaki’s counterclaims. Huhtamaki had asserted counterclaims for: (1) fraudulent inducement; (2) fraudulent misrepresentation; (3) negligent misrepresentation; (4) breach of contract; and (5) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.', '-6- to [Huhtamaki] fulfilled the notice requirements as specified by Section 6(c) of the Indemnity Agreement * * *.”', 'Thereafter, Huhtamaki moved for reconsideration. The trial justice ultimately denied Huhtamaki’s motion for reconsideration, but he nonetheless indicated by way of clarification that his earlier decision had undertaken “the narrow task of interpreting the Indemnity Agreement and determining whether [Ferris’s] right to indemnification was limited to third-party actions, or whether the agreement also contemplated indemnification of [Ferris’s] own claims.” The trial justice further stated that Ferris would still have to establish the following at trial: “(1) whether hazardous substances or materials were located on the Property; (2) whether the hazardous substances or materials, if any, were on the Property prior to the [2003] Closing; (3) whether [Ferris] incurred costs or [d]amages as a result of the hazardous substances or materials; and (4) whether [Ferris’s] costs or [d]amages, if any, were reasonably incurred.”', 'B', 'Huhtamaki’s Motion in Limine', 'Before trial, Huhtamaki moved in limine to exclude all evidence that had been derived from the soil excavated from Parcel A on the theory that there had been spoliation of evidence. At the November 5, 2012 hearing on that motion, Huhtamaki argued that Ferris’s excavation deprived Huhtamaki of the ability to conduct its own tests and to challenge VHB’s conclusion that the soil was contaminated. The trial justice denied Huhtamaki’s motion seeking preclusion of the above-referenced evidence, but he allowed Huhtamaki to depose Ferris’s expert with respect to the issue of spoliation. The trial justice also allowed Huhtamaki to designate an expert to testify on its behalf.', '-7-', 'C', 'The Testimony at Trial', 'Thereafter, the case was tried before a jury over thirteen days in November and December of 2012. Although both parties presented multiple witnesses, only certain portions of the trial testimony are relevant to Huhtamaki’s arguments on appeal.', 'Accordingly, we summarize below the salient aspects of what occurred at trial in the order of their relevance to the claims on appeal.', '1.', 'The Testimony of Timothy O’Connor', 'Timothy O’Connor, an environmental engineer with VHB, testified for Ferris at trial. Mr. O’Connor’s testimony mainly addressed the voluminous environmental reports detailing the extensive environmental history of the Property.9 Mr. O’Connor’s testimony concerning that environmental history was mostly uncontested.', 'However, Huhtamaki took issue with Mr. O’Connor’s opinion that, based on his survey of the environmental history, the pollution which VHB found on Parcel A in 2005 was present at the time of the closing in 2003—said fact being one of the elements which Ferris had to prove at trial.', 'i.', 'The Uncontested Testimony', 'Mr. O’Connor first reviewed the pertinent environmental history, focusing on three reports:', '(1) a 1986 Complaint to DEM and DEM’s subsequent investigation; (2) a 1989 9', 'After Mr. O’Connor detailed his expertise in environmental engineering and the remediation of contaminated sites, Ferris offered him as an expert. Huhtamaki objected on the ground that there was a lack of foundation as to Mr. O’Connor’s qualifications to opine on a key element that Ferris would be required to prove at trial—viz., whether the hazardous substances found on Parcel A in 2005 were present at the time of the closing in 2003. The trial justice excused the jury, heard arguments from both parties, and then ruled as follows: “[A]ssuming an appropriate foundation is laid by the plaintiff in connection with opinions sought from this witness, the witness will be permitted to give those opinions.”', '-8- Preliminary Assessment also completed by DEM; and (3) a 1990 environmental report prepared by Szepatowski Associates, an environmental consulting firm (Szepatowski Report). The latter two reports all noted that hazardous wastes, including TCA and PCE, had been generated on the Property. Mr. O’Connor testified that, based on the factual assertions set forth in the 1986 DEM Complaint, DEM had, in Mr. O’Connor’s words, “recommended the site to the Superfund program for assessment as potentially one of the nation’s worst hazardous waste sites.”10 He added that, as a result of the 1986 DEM Complaint and the 1989 Preliminary Assessment, the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) hired Roy F. Weston, Inc. (Weston) to determine whether the Property should be listed as a Superfund site. In its 1993 Final Site Inspection Report (the Weston Report), Weston stated that the testing of soil samples from Parcel A revealed the presence thereon of hazardous substances, including TCA and PCE. Mr. O’Connor then testified that the EPA ultimately opted not to list the Property on its National Priorities List, which list included the country’s “worst hazardous waste sites.”', 'It was further the testimony of Mr. O’Connor that the next environmental inspection in the Property’s history was performed in August of 1997 by Integrated Chemical & Environmental Engineering (ICEE), an environmental consulting firm.11 Mr. O’Connor testified 10', '“Superfund is the name given to the environmental program established [by Congress] to address abandoned hazardous waste sites.

(Nyman), the owner of the site at the time of ICEE’s 1997 investigation, was required to report the findings to DEM because ICEE had found TCA levels which exceeded residential regulatory minimum standards, in addition to other hazardous substances on the Property. Along with its reporting the findings to DEM, in October of 1997, Nyman hired Paragon Environmental Services, Inc. (Paragon) to remediate the Property. After several excavations and two rounds of soil testing, Paragon found levels of PCE in the soil samples that exceeded allowable regulatory standards. Paragon also found low concentrations of PCE in the groundwater. On December 31, 1998, Paragon issued a Closure Report, which Mr. O’Connor explained is a “regulatory required document that is submitted at the end of a remedial action.”13 This Closure Report clearly stated that Paragon “did not intend for [its] study to be an exhaustive investigation of subsurface conditions on the site.”', 'In response to Paragon’s Closure Report, DEM issued a “no further action letter” dated October 31, 2000 (the No Further Action Letter). Mr. O’Connor testified that, while a letter of compliance “is intended to indicate that a site has been adequately addressed to the fullest extent of the regulations,” no further action letters “are meant to be specific to one incident.” Mr. O’Connor further explained that the issuance of a no further action letter simply signifies that DEM does not require a party to take further action related to a specific instance of pollution. In 12', 'Although ICEE also noted the presence of PCE in the groundwater, those levels of PCE did not violate the quality standards that were applicable at the time. 13', 'Mr. O’Connor testified that DEM did not mandate that additional excavation be conducted after Paragon’s 1997-1998 investigation in view of the fact that any further excavation would be below the “groundwater table” and the applicable regulations did not apply to “a sample taken below the groundwater table.”', '- 10 - fact, the No Further Action Letter pertinent to the instant case specifically states, in bold-face type, that it “is not a letter of compliance pursuant to remediation regulations.”', 'Mr. O’Connor proceeded to testify that VHB performed the next environmental testing on Parcel A in 2005, the results of which ultimately gave rise to the present litigation. As previously explained, Ferris had sought to develop the Property for residential purposes, and VHB had been engaged to test soil and groundwater samples from Parcel A; that testing revealed that the soil and groundwater were contaminated with PCE in concentrations exceeding DEM’s minimum regulatory quality standards.', 'VHB’s groundwater and soil testing also revealed concentrations of TCA, but at levels that did not surpass the applicable minimum standard. Mr. O’Connor testified that, as a result of VHB’s soil and groundwater testing, VHB identified three areas of Parcel A for excavation, all of which areas lay beneath approximately ten feet of uncontaminated soil.', 'ii.', 'The Contested Testimony', 'After Mr. O’Connor’s extensive summary of the Property’s environmental history, counsel for Ferris asked him to opine as to whether the hazardous substances that VHB found on Parcel A in 2005, specifically TCA and PCE, were present at the time of the real estate closing in 2003. Huhtamaki objected to this line of questioning, arguing that Mr. O’Connor did not have the requisite scientific expertise to render such an opinion. Huhtamaki was opposed to allowing Mr. O’Connor to testify as to this point undoubtedly because one of the elements which Ferris was required to prove at trial was whether the hazardous substances or materials found in 2005 were present on the Property at the time of the closing in 2003. After a voir dire examination of Mr. O’Connor was conducted, the trial justice concluded that the witness would be permitted to testify that the materials found in 2005 were also present in 2003. However, the trial justice', '- 11 - further ruled that Mr. O’Connor would not be permitted to offer an opinion as to exactly when the contaminates were first discharged onto Parcel A.', 'Mr. O’Connor then offered his expert opinion that the hazardous substances (TCA and PCE) which VHB found in 2005 were present on Parcel A in 2003. He explained that he based his opinion on: (1) the fact that the 1986 DEM Complaint, the 1989 Preliminary Assessment by DEM, the 1990 Szepatowski Report, and the 1993 Weston Report all documented the use of TCA and PCE at the facility; (2) the fact that the Weston, ICEE, and Paragon reports all documented the presence of TCA and PCE in the soil and groundwater samples from Parcel A; (3) the fact that VHB was remediating the same general area of the Property as had been examined by Weston, ICEE, and Paragon; and (4) the fact that VHB found the contaminated soils underneath ten feet of clean soil.', '2.', 'The Testimony of Dr. Paul Boehm', 'Endeavoring to counter Mr. O’Connor’s expert testimony, Huhtamaki called Dr. Paul Boehm, an environmental forensic chemist, as an expert witness. Doctor Boehm described certain tests that, based on the substance’s level of degradation, may allow a scientist to determine how long a substance has been in the environment. Doctor Boehm also testified that, once contaminated soils are removed from their natural state, any samples from those soils are “inappropriate for doing forensic testing” since a scientist needs to test the soil in its natural state in order to determine the lateral and vertical extent of any contamination.', '3.', 'The Testimony of Rochelle Stringer, Esq.', 'In addition to the testimony from the above-referenced experts, Attorney Rochelle Stringer, an employee of Huhtamaki who bore the title of general counsel, testified for Huhtamaki. Attorney Stringer testified that it was she who sent Ferris the March 10, 2006 letter', '- 12 - denying, on the basis of a purported lack of timely notice under the Indemnity Agreement, Ferris’s claim for indemnification. She also testified that the allegedly untimely notice prevented Huhtamaki from testing the contaminated soil as it lay in its natural state in order to determine if the contaminants were on the Property at the time of the 2003 closing.', 'Attorney Stringer further testified that, after Huhtamaki received the Letter of Responsibility which had been sent by DEM, she directed Robert Steeves, Huhtamaki’s corporate environmental manager, to contact DEM to ensure that that agency was aware that Huhtamaki was no longer the operator of the Property and, for that reason, had been sent the letter in error. Thereafter, in a letter which she wrote to DEM, dated January 6, 2006, Attorney Stringer memorialized Mr. Steeves’s conversation with DEM to the effect that Huhtamaki had been sent the December 21, 2005 Letter of Responsibility by mistake.', 'On cross-examination, Attorney Stringer admitted that Huhtamaki had received the Letter of Responsibility from DEM and that, as of January 3, 2006 at the latest, she was aware that there was a report indicating that there had been a release of hazardous substances on the Property. She then admitted that, in spite of Huhtamaki’s possible liability under the Indemnity Agreement, she had not contacted Ferris about the Letter of Responsibility or any potential cleanup.14', '4.', 'The Testimony of Robert Steeves', 'Robert Steeves, Huhtamaki’s corporate environmental manager, also testified for Huhtamaki.

First, it argues that the trial justice erred in holding that Ferris’s February 14, 2006 letter constituted sufficient notice under the Indemnity Agreement. Second, Huhtamaki contends that the trial justice erred in permitting Mr. O’Connor to testify as to whether the contamination found in 2005 was present at the time of the closing in 2003. Third, Huhtamaki maintains that, pursuant to the concept of spoliation, the trial justice should have excluded all evidence relating to the soil samples that were taken from Parcel A in 2005. Fourth, it avers that the trial justice committed errors of law in instructing the jury. Finally, Huhtamaki asserts that Ferris’s case was predicated upon a legally improper “pyramid of inferences.” 16', 'The civil judgment form dated December 17, 2012 indicates that, in addition to the $251,121.06 in damages awarded by the jury, Huhtamaki was liable for $186,834.07 in interest and costs as of that date.', '- 15 -', 'We address each issue in turn. Due to the fact that differing standards of review apply to the various issues on appeal, we shall recite the applicable standard as we address each issue.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', '“Claim Notice”', 'Huhtamaki first argues that the trial justice erred in finding that Ferris’s February 14, 2006 letter constituted sufficient “Claim Notice” pursuant to the terms of the Indemnity Agreement. On appeal, Huhtamaki admits that Section 6(c), which contains the contested “Claim Notice” term, governs the procedure for the present case.17', 'However, Huhtamaki contends that “Claim Notice” is actually defined in Section 6(a) in such a way that “Claim Notice” is imbued by Section 6(a) with a meaning that stays with it wherever that term is thereafter encountered in the Indemnity Agreement.', 'As previously explained, Section 6(a) sets forth the procedure governing third-party claims under the Indemnity Agreement. In the event of a third-party claim, Section 6(a) requires that Ferris “with reasonable promptness give notice (the ‘Claim Notice’) to [Huhtamaki] of such claim or demand, specifying the nature of and specific basis for such claim or demand and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent then feasible * * *.” (Emphasis added.) Huhtamaki contends that the “reasonable promptness” requirement of Section 6(a) should be read into Section 6(c), due to the fact that it also uses the term “Claim Notice.” Consequently, Huhtamaki argues, Ferris failed to meet the “reasonable promptness” requirement—because Ferris sent the February 14, 2006 letter to Huhtamaki only after having excavated the 17', 'As indicated above, Huhtamaki adopted a different position in the Superior Court—viz., that Section 6(c) was inapplicable to Ferris’s claim for indemnification. See Part I.A, supra.', '- 16 - contaminated soils from Parcel A. Under Section 6(a), lack of reasonably prompt “Claim Notice” relieves Huhtamaki from its obligation to indemnify Ferris if Huhtamaki’s “ability to defend against the claim or demand is materially prejudiced.” (Emphasis added.) Huhtamaki contends that it was materially prejudiced because the lack of prompt notice prevented it from testing the contaminated soil on its own. Accordingly, Huhtamaki contends that it was relieved from liability under the Indemnity Agreement and that the trial justice erred in granting partial summary judgment in Ferris’s favor with respect to the “Claim Notice” issue.', '1.', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court reviews the grant of summary judgment in a de novo manner.

(Emphasis added.) Huhtamaki argues that it was materially prejudiced by what it views as belated notice because it received Ferris’s February 14, 2006 letter after Ferris had excavated the contaminated soil.', 'Accordingly, Huhtamaki argues that it was not able to conduct testing of the soil on its own in order to challenge the findings of the VHB company.', 'However, it is crystal clear from the record that Huhtamaki received express actual notice that hazardous substances had been found on the Property; such actual notice occurred when Huhtamaki received the Letter of Responsibility from DEM dated December 21, 2005.

We similarly need not and therefore do not opine as to whether the February 14, 2006 letter satisfied the “reasonable promptness” criterion. See id. 19', 'Huhtamaki argues on appeal that “Claim Notice” is a defined term that necessarily carries with it, from Section 6(a), the “reasonable promptness” requirement wherever “Claim Notice” appears in other sections of the Agreement (notably in Section 6(c)). However, in view of what Huhtamaki argued at the summary judgment stage, the crux of what the trial justice had to resolve in this regard was whether Section 6(a) or Section 6(c) applied. At no time at the summary judgment stage (or in its motion for reconsideration) did Huhtamaki argue to the trial justice that “Claim Notice” was a defined term with the same meaning in all sections of the Indemnity Agreement. Huhtamaki did eventually raise that particular hermeneutic argument in its Renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law and in its Motion for a New Trial. While this chronological reality might mean that the defined term argument has been sufficiently preserved for appellate review, it is nonetheless unavailing in view of the crucial consideration that Huhtamaki in fact received actual notice of the pollution.', '- 18 - investigation of which would lead him to information of such fact * * *.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Letter of Responsibility indicated, among other things, that hazardous substances, including PCE, in excess of DEM regulations had been found on the Property. Additionally, Robert Steeves testified that, after a January 3, 2006 telephone conversation with DEM, he understood that DEM had sent the Letter of Responsibility as a result of the fact that the owner of the site (Ferris) had found contaminants on the Property and wanted to remove them. It follows that Huhtamaki was not materially prejudiced by any arguable delay in the sending of “Claim Notice” because it received actual notice of the pollution and was apprised of the likelihood of excavation. See, e.g., United States v. Aarons, 310 F.2d 341, 343, 345, 348 (2d Cir. 1962) (Friendly, J.) (holding that, because the defendants had actual knowledge of a Coast Guard order temporarily closing a portion of the Thames River at New London, they could be criminally prosecuted for violating the order, even though notice of the order had not been published in the Federal Register, as was expressly required by the Federal Register Act (44 U.S.C. §§ 301-314) and § 3(a) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 1002(a))).20', 'In view of our conclusion that Huhtamaki was not materially prejudiced because it received actual notice of the pollution and was therefore not relieved of its obligations under the Indemnity Agreement, we affirm the trial justice’s grant of partial summary judgment with respect to the right of Ferris to pursue an indemnification claim for the cleanup costs. 20', 'The Second Circuit opinion that is cited in the text, United States v.

According to Huhtamaki, Mr. O’Connor lacked the expertise to opine as to the length of time that any hazardous substance may have been present on the Property.

The trial justice reasoned that “the study of historic stone walls was unreliable because it had not garnered sufficient acceptance in the scientific community or been subjected to adequate peer review.” Id. at 5-6. This Court reversed, contextualizing the holding in DiPetrillo, supra, and noting that “satisfaction of DiPetrillo’s reliability test is unnecessary when the principles underlying an expert’s opinion are neither novel nor highly technical.” Id. at 12.', 'As was the case with respect to the expert testimony at issue in Morabit, we agree with the trial justice in the instant case, who ruled that Mr. O’Connor’s testimony “was not so', '- 21 - technical that it required peer-reviewed publication support, but his opinion was helpful to the jury because of his skills, experience, training, and education in environmental engineering— skills beyond the understanding of laypersons of ordinary intelligence.”', 'Mr. O’Connor’s testimony mainly involved explaining to the jury the numerous environmental reports concerning the Property. After meticulously referencing that material, Mr. O’Connor opined that TCA and PCE were present on Parcel A before 2003 and that the VHB company found concentrations of TCA and PCE on Parcel A in 2005. Mr. O’Connor then made what strikes us as being an entirely reasonable inference—viz., that the hazardous substances found by VHB in 2005 were present on the Property in 2003. Mr. O’Connor explained this inference by: (1) noting that a number of environmental reports dating back to 1986 indicated that TCA and PCE had been generated on the Property; (2) further noting that the 1993 Weston Report, the 1997 ICEE report, and the 1998 Paragon report all documented the presence of TCA and PCE in the soil and groundwater samples; (3) pointing out that the VHB company also found TCA and PCE in the same area that Weston, ICEE, and Paragon had previously tested (viz., Parcel A); and (4) observing that VHB found the contaminated soil underneath at least ten feet of clean soil.', 'This Court has previously emphasized that, when ruling on the admissibility of expert testimony, a trial justice should not interpret the rules of evidence in such a “narrow and stringent” manner so as to “impermissibly conflate[] her own functions with those of the jury.” Gallucci, 709 A.2d at 1064.

In fact, at the end of the voir dire, the trial justice had expressly prohibited him from opining as to the time of the discharge into the soil. Instead, Mr. O’Connor maintained that, based solely on his review of the Property’s extensive environmental history, he could reasonably infer that TCA and PCE were present on Parcel A in 2003.

Additionally, according to Mr. Steeves’s testimony, in a January 3, 2006 phone conversation, DEM told Huhtamaki that Ferris planned to excavate the contaminated soil. Thus, unlike the parties in Innis Arden Golf Club and Berrios, Huhtamaki was not meaningfully prejudiced by Ferris’s excavation of the soils because it was aware of Ferris’s planned excavation for nearly a month before it occurred and never objected or took other action. In view of the fact that Huhtamaki was not meaningfully prejudiced by the removal, we discern no abuse of discretion in the trial justice’s decision to admit the evidence regarding the contaminated soils.', 'D', 'Jury Instructions', 'Huhtamaki also contends that there was error in the trial justice’s jury instructions concerning: (1) the “Claim Notice” issue; and (2) the spoliation of evidence. It is well settled that this Court reviews jury instructions in a de novo manner. King v. Huntress, Inc., 94 A.3d 467, 482 (R.I. 2014); see also Oden v. Schwartz, 71 A.3d 438, 450 (R.I. 2013).

Caster’s Inc., 970 A.2d 541, 545 (R.I. 2009). Moreover, we review jury instructions “in light of the meaning and interpretation that a jury composed of ordinary, intelligent lay persons would give them.” Hueston v. Narragansett Tennis Club, Inc., 502 A.2d 827, 829 (R.I. 1986). In addition, this Court has made it clear that “[a]n erroneous charge warrants reversal only if it can be shown that the jury could have been misled to the resultant prejudice of the complaining party.” Contois v. Town of West Warwick, 865 A.2d 1019, 1022 (R.I. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '1.', 'The Absence of an Instruction as to “Claim Notice”', 'Huhtamaki first argues that the trial justice erred in failing to instruct the jury “to make a specific finding as to whether [Ferris] had provided ‘Claim Notice’ to Huhtamaki.” However, as discussed previously, the trial justice determined, at the summary judgment stage, that the February 14, 2006 letter constituted sufficient “Claim Notice” under the Indemnity Agreement. See Part I.A, supra. Accordingly, the sufficiency of “Claim Notice” was not an issue for the jury to grapple with at trial. Moreover, it is our view that Huhtamaki was not materially prejudiced (and therefore not relieved of its obligations under the Indemnity Agreement even if we assume that Section 6(a) applies to the instant case) by any purported delay in the providing of notice by Ferris because Huhtamaki received actual notice of the pollution. See Part III.A.2, supra. It necessarily follows that we discern no error in the trial justice’s refusal to give such an instruction.', '- 26 -', '2.', 'The Spoliation Instruction', 'Next, Huhtamaki challenges the trial justice’s jury instruction concerning spoliation.22 At trial, Huhtamaki objected to the trial justice’s instruction, arguing that the spoliation instruction 22', 'The trial justice’s instruction relative to the spoliation of evidence reads as follows:', '“You have heard evidence in this case that [Ferris]', 'excavated soil from Parcel A, and that Huhtamaki did not have an', 'opportunity to perform certain testing on that soil as it lay in the', 'ground.

On appeal, Huhtamaki not only argues that the instruction imposed upon it a duty to preserve evidence (an objection which it sufficiently articulated at trial), but it also raises a new challenge to the jury instruction. For the first time on appeal, Huhtamaki argues that the trial justice erred in failing to sufficiently specify that the negligent destruction of relevant evidence would be sufficient to allow an adverse inference; it further argues that the trial justice compounded this alleged error when he stated in his jury instructions: “If the spoliation of the evidence is attributable to carelessness or negligence on the part of the spoliator, you may consider whether the carelessness or negligence was so gross as to amount to a deliberate act of spoliation.”', 'Pursuant to this Court’s raise or waive rule, “a litigant cannot raise an objection or advance a new theory on appeal if it was not raised before the trial court.” Town of Barrington v. Williams, 972 A.2d 603, 609 (R.I. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Berman v. Sitrin, 101 A.3d 1251, 1266 (R.I. 2014); Pollard v. Acer Group, 870 A.2d 429, 432 (R.I. 2005). We have consistently been exacting about applying the raise or waive rule in the face of inadequate objections to jury instructions. See King, 94 A.3d at 483; see also Tyre v. Swain, 946 A.2d 1189, 1200 (R.I. 2008).', 'Notably, Rule 51(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure “bars a party from challenging an erroneous instruction unless [the party] lodges an objection to the charge which is specific enough to alert the trial justice as to the nature of [the trial justice’s] alleged error.” Botelho, 970 A.2d at 548 (internal quotation marks omitted). As we have stated, “[t]he rationale behind this rule is to allow the trial justice an opportunity to make any necessary corrections to his or her instructions before the jury begins its deliberations.”', 'then I instruct you that you may not infer that because the soil was', 'destroyed that the evidence would have been unfavorable to', '[Ferris’s] position in this case.”', '- 28 - DiFranco v.

Papa Razzi, 899 A.2d 437, 444 (R.I. 2006) (“Absent a sufficiently specific objection, the trial justice cannot be expected to divine the nature of counsel’s objection.”). Because Huhtamaki failed to raise at trial its newly minted objection to the trial justice’s charge on spoliation that it now advances on appeal, Huhtamaki’s arguments as to same are deemed to have been waived. See State v. Figuereo, 31 A.3d 1283, 1288-89 (R.I. 2011) (stating that the defendant’s claims of error on appeal as to the jury instruction were subject to waiver because the objections which the defendant advanced on appeal were different from those advanced at trial).', 'Turning next to the objection to the jury instruction which Huhtamaki did properly preserve (viz., that the instruction imposed a duty on Huhtamaki to preserve evidence), it is our view that said objection is without merit. Specifically, Huhtamaki takes issue with the following instruction:', '“If you find that Huhtamaki knew or should have known', 'that [Ferris] planned to excavate the soils from Parcel A before', '[Ferris] did so, and that Huhtamaki had an opportunity to request', 'that [Ferris] refrain from excavating the soil and allow Huhtamaki', 'an opportunity to test it in the ground, and if you find further that', 'Huhtamaki did nothing to stop [Ferris] from excavating the soil,', 'then I instruct you that you may not infer that because the soil was', 'destroyed that the evidence would have been unfavorable to', '[Ferris’s] position in this case.” Huhtamaki asserts that said language impermissibly imposed upon it a “pre-litigation duty” to preserve evidence that was not in its possession or control.', 'When viewed in the entirety, however, the trial justice’s instruction substantially mirrors the instruction which this Court expressly deemed “appropriate” in Tancrelle, 756 A.2d at 749- 50 n.3. It is important to realize that, in conducting appellate review, we examine the charge to the jury “in its entirety, rather than examining single sentences or selective parts of the charge in', '- 29 - isolation, * * * [outside of] the context in which they were rendered.” King, 94 A.3d at 482 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Botelho, 970 A.2d at 545. In our judgment, the one sentence that Huhtamaki challenges on appeal did not derogate from the correctness of the trial justice’s overall charge to the jury. See Hueston, 502 A.2d at 829 (“Challenged instructions must be evaluated as a whole in light of the meaning and interpretation that a jury composed of ordinary, intelligent lay persons would give them.”); see also Lieberman v. Bliss-Doris Realty Associates, L.P., 819 A.2d 666, 672 (R.I. 2003) (“[W]e shall not exaggerate out of context a single word or phrase or sentence in an instruction; rather, the challenged portion will be examined in the context of the entire instruction.”) (internal quotation marks omitted); State v. Brown, 798 A.2d 942, 948 (R.I. 2002).', 'In fact, the trial justice’s instruction makes clear that, in deciding the issue of spoliation, the jury should “consider all of the facts and circumstances which were proved at trial and which are pertinent to that item of evidence.” Such pertinent “facts and circumstances” certainly include the fact that Huhtamaki had actual notice that contaminants had been found on the Property nearly a month before Ferris completed the excavation. Finally, other than arguing that there was an error, Huhtamaki has failed to show how, by virtue of this one sentence in the trial justice’s charge, the jury “could have been misled to the resultant prejudice of the complaining party.” Contois, 865 A.2d at 1022 (internal quotation marks omitted). Consequently, we discern no reversible error in the challenged instruction.', 'E', 'Pyramid of Inferences', 'Finally, Huhtamaki contends that Ferris’s case was built on an improper “pyramid of inferences.” This Court has previously stated that “[a] pyramiding of inferences takes place', '- 30 - when an inference is drawn from the underlying facts and a second inference is then drawn from that primary inference.” Mead, 899 A.2d at 441 n.3 (internal quotation marks omitted). Such pyramiding of inferences “must be rejected as being without probative force where the facts from which it is drawn are susceptible of another reasonable inference.”', 'Waldman v. Shipyard Marina, Inc., 102 R.I. 366, 374, 230 A.2d 841, 845 (1967).', 'In support of its argument, Huhtamaki contends that Ferris’s “primary inference” was that hazardous materials remained on Parcel A after Paragon completed its remediation in 1998. Huhtamaki argues that, because “evidence at trial, including Paragon’s remedial work, [and] the No Further Action Letter * * * established that Parcel A was clean as of 1998. * * * [T]he only way for [Ferris] to prove its case was to have the jury draw a competing inference--namely, that Paragon did not fully clean Parcel A * * *.”', 'It is our view, however, that Huhtamaki’s argument is at best a mischaracterization. First, in spite of Huhtamaki’s contentions to the contrary, there was no evidence at trial that Parcel A was clean as of 1998. In fact, the very evidence that Huhtamaki points to belies its contention. As previously mentioned, Huhtamaki argues that Paragon’s remedial work, and the No Further Action Letter from DEM both established that Parcel A was clean as of 1998. However, Paragon’s Closure Report, which was issued at the end of Paragon’s remediation activities, explicitly states:', '“Paragon did not intend for [its] study to be an exhaustive investigation of subsurface conditions on the Site.” As to the No Further Action Letter, it explicitly states, in bold-face type, that it was “not a Letter of Compliance pursuant to the Remediation Regulations.” It is eminently clear to us that the No Further Action Letter is simply evidence that DEM did not mandate any further action—not that the site was deemed to be clean of hazardous materials.', '- 31 -', 'By contrast, the inference for which Ferris advocated before the jury was that the hazardous substances (including TCA and PCE), which the VHB company discovered in 2005, were also present on Parcel A in 2003; the reasonableness of that inference is amply supported by the record. Mr. O’Connor testified extensively about the Property’s environmental history, including the fact that the historical reports indicated that TCA and PCE were generated on the site and that TCA and PCE were both found in the soil and groundwater of Parcel A prior to 2003. The fact that VHB found those two substances (TCA and PCE), in the course of its own testing in 2005 in the same area underneath approximately ten feet of clean soil, supports a reasonable inference that those hazardous substances were present on Parcel A in 2003. As we have previously stated, “a reasonable inference from established facts is evidence and * * * such an inference should be considered and given effect by the trier of facts.” Oury v. Greany, 107 R.I. 427, 431, 267 A.2d 700, 702 (1970). And it is a basic principle that “[i]nferences and presumptions are a staple of our adversary system of factfinding.” State v.

(Brayman), appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the defendant, James M. Lamphere, the Town Planner for the Town of Hopkinton, denying Brayman’s declaratory judgment action on the basis of Brayman’s purported failure to exhaust its administrative remedies. On appeal, Brayman argues, inter alia, that the trial justice1 erred in denying it declaratory relief because the parties did not have a meaningful opportunity to brief and/or argue whether the administrative exhaustion doctrine should apply to the present case. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2009, Brayman applied to the Town Planning Board for a preliminary plan approval of a minor subdivision.

In a letter dated July 14, 2009, the Town Planner stated that he would certify the subdivision application as complete once Brayman submitted proof of payment of all taxes due—including personal property taxes as well as real property taxes.', 'Instead of paying the outstanding personal property taxes, on May 3, 2010, Brayman filed a complaint in the Superior Court for Washington County, seeking a writ of mandamus to compel the Town Planner to certify Brayman’s subdivision application as complete (Count One). Thereafter, on July 14, 2010, the Town Planner moved to dismiss Count One, alleging that, inter alia, Brayman had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies in view of the fact that it had not appealed the Town Planner’s decision to the Platting Board of Review.3 In further support of his motion to dismiss, the Town Planner also argued that his refusal to certify Brayman’s subdivision application as complete did not involve a ministerial act such as might be amenable to a writ of mandamus. In due course, Brayman objected to the Town Planner’s motion to 2', 'Article XI, Section A.1 of the Town of Hopkinton’s Land Development & Subdivision Regulations states: “The Town Planner of the Town of Hopkinton is hereby designated as the Administrative Officer * * * .” 3', 'Article XII, Section A.1 of the Town of Hopkinton’s Land Development & Subdivision Regulations reads in pertinent part as follows: “Any party aggrieved by a decision of * * * the Administrative Officer shall have the right to appeal that decision to the Platting Board of Review * * * .”', '-2- dismiss and also moved to amend its complaint in order to add a count seeking declaratory judgment; it sought a declaration to the effect that the term “property taxes” in the Checklist refers only to real property taxes. On October 18, 2010, the Town Planner filed an objection to Brayman’s motion to amend.', 'On March 21, 2011, the trial justice heard arguments relative to the above-referenced motions. The trial justice first granted Brayman’s motion to amend its complaint to add a count seeking declaratory relief (Count Two). The Town Planner then argued that both counts should be dismissed because Brayman had not appealed the Town Planner’s decision to the Platting Board of Review and, therefore, had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial justice, finding that the Town Planner’s decision was “not ministerial but * * * within the sound exercise of his discretion,” granted the Town Planner’s motion to dismiss Count One (the mandamus count). With respect to Count Two, however, he summarily ruled that “[t]he declaratory judgment action survives * * * .”', 'Thereafter, in April and May of 2012, the declaratory judgment action still being viable, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment seeking a ruling as to the meaning of “property taxes” in the Checklist. Brayman’s sole argument was that the term “property taxes” refers only to real property taxes, whereas the Town Planner’s sole argument was that the term “property taxes” includes both real and personal property taxes. Neither party made reference to the administrative exhaustion doctrine in their respective memoranda of law or at the hearing on the cross-motions, which was held on May 21, 2012.

This is so because we adhere to the principle that, “when a trial justice considers and rules on an case (albeit on a ground unrelated to what was argued in the motions for summary judgment), the appeal from the denial of the summary judgment motions is procedurally appropriate. See Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 942 A.2d 284, 290 (R.I. 2007).

Nolan, 755 A.2d 799 (R.I. 2000), contends that the trial justice’s dismissal of Count Two (the declaratory judgment count) on the basis of the administrative exhaustion doctrine should nevertheless be upheld. We do not deem it necessary to recount here the fairly complex factual and procedural context of the Nolan decision. Suffice it to say that, in the end, this Court concluded that the applicant for the certificate of need that was at issue in that case had sufficiently alluded to the principle of administrative finality in the Superior Court—albeit not in those precise words.

In the case at bar, in stark contrast to what transpired in Nolan, the administrative exhaustion doctrine (a close cousin to the administrative finality principle that was at issue in Nolan) was not raised by the Town Planner at the summary judgment stage in 2012 so as to allow Brayman an opportunity to object to its', '-6- applicability.

However, that issue was neither briefed nor argued at the summary judgment stage. Accordingly, we need not address that argument in this opinion. See, e.g., Ryan v.

On appeal, the appellants contend that the hearing justice erred in: (1) vacating the entry of default against the defendant Alan Goulart; (2) denying Ms. Huntley’s applications for entry of default against the defendants Gerald Coyne and Patrick Lynch; and (3) imposing a monetary sanction upon Attorney Gelfuso pursuant to Rule 11 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After carefully considering the record, the memoranda submitted to this Court on behalf of the parties, and the oral arguments of counsel, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The factual background of this case was fully narrated in our previous opinion, which determined that the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island was entitled to preclusive effect pursuant to the doctrine of res judicata. See Huntley v. State, 63 A.3d 526, 531-33 (R.I. 2013) (Huntley I).1 Accordingly, we refer the interested reader to our opinion in Huntley I, and we shall set forth herein only the facts necessary to our analysis of this most recent appeal. See id.', 'Undaunted by our opinion in Huntley I, which was issued on April 12, 2013, Ms. Huntley opted to take the position that her state court action was still viable because Mr. Goulart,2 Mr. Coyne, and Mr. Lynch3 (the individual defendants) purportedly had not pled or otherwise defended the civil action that was the subject of our earlier opinion. Accordingly, on May 20, 2013, Ms. Huntley filed an application for entry of default against Mr. Goulart. In support of that application, Attorney Gelfuso submitted an affidavit, wherein he stated that Mr. Goulart had “failed to plead or otherwise defend as to the Plaintiff’s Complaint.” Default entered against Mr. Goulart on May 21, 2013. A few days later, on May 23, 2013, Attorney Gelfuso informed counsel for the individual defendants, by e-mail, that he had filed an entry of default against Mr. Goulart and that he planned to file similar defaults against Mr. Coyne and Mr. Lynch. 1', 'In Huntley v. State, 63 A.3d 526 (R.I. 2013), we expressly stated that the federal court judgment referred to in the text hereof was “entered for the defendants, State of Rhode Island, Patrick Lynch and the RI Attorney General’s Office, against the plaintiff, Dawn L. Huntley, pursuant to the Order dated October 4, 2010 [granting] Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss.” Id. at 529. 2', 'Mr. Goulart is now a magistrate. 3', 'At the time when this case was litigated, Mr. Lynch was the Attorney General.', '-2- Thereafter, on June 4, 2013, Ms. Huntley did in fact file applications for entry of default against Mr. Coyne and Mr. Lynch, although the clerk did not enter those two defaults. One day later, on June 5, 2013, Mr. Goulart filed a motion to set aside the entry of default against him pursuant to Rule 55(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, and he also filed a motion for sanctions against Attorney Gelfuso and Ms. Huntley. Mr. Coyne and Mr. Lynch also filed objections to the pending applications for entry of default against them.', 'On June 19, 2013, a justice of the Superior Court heard Mr. Goulart’s motion to set aside the default as well as the motion for sanctions against Attorney Gelfuso and Ms. Huntley. However, when the case was called for hearing, Attorney Gelfuso was not present in the courtroom, and he could not be located.4', 'Although an attorney who was associated with Attorney Gelfuso was in the courtroom, that attorney was admittedly unprepared to argue in Attorney Gelfuso’s stead. The hearing justice then proceeded to vacate the default entered against Mr. Goulart and continued the remaining matters until June 27, 2013.', 'On the latter date, the hearing justice heard arguments relative to Ms. Huntley’s applications for default against Mr. Coyne and Mr. Lynch, in the end sustaining the objections of both men. The hearing justice stated that the record “clearly established that the defendants, Alan Goulart, Gerald Coyne, Patrick Lynch, as well as other defendants * * * not only answered but vigorously defended the claims against them.” On the same date, the hearing justice also heard arguments regarding the motion for sanctions. The hearing justice then ruled that the applications for default had not been filed in good faith; accordingly, he sanctioned Attorney 4', 'At the call of the calendar, Attorney Gelfuso had indicated that he was present and was ready to proceed.', '-3- Gelfuso in the amount of $1,000, and he sanctioned Ms. Huntley by prohibiting her from “submitting any additional pleadings in this matter.”5', 'On July 8, 2013, both an order reflecting the hearing justice’s decision and a final judgment in favor of defendants were entered. The appellants filed a timely joint notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'With respect to the hearing justice’s decision to vacate the entry of default against Mr. Goulart, it is well settled that “the appropriate standard for the Superior Court to apply on a motion to vacate default before judgment on the default has been entered is the ‘good cause’ standard under Rule 55(c).” Reyes v. Providence Place Group, L.L.C., 853 A.2d 1242, 1247 (R.I. 2004).', 'Additionally, since appellants take issue with the hearing justice’s denial of Ms. Huntley’s applications for entry of default against Mr. Coyne and Mr. Lynch, we note that Rule 55(a) states: “When a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend as provided by these rules and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter the party’s default.” Accordingly, for the hearing justice to have erred in denying Ms. Huntley’s applications, Mr. Coyne and Mr. Lynch “must have failed either to plead or otherwise to defend [the] case.” Naylor v. Marold, 542 A.2d 662, 664 (R.I. 1988).', 'With respect to the monetary sanction against Attorney Gelfuso, Rule 11 “provides trial courts with broad authority to impose sanctions against attorneys for advancing claims without 5', 'The appellants do not challenge on appeal the sanction against Ms. Huntley.', '-4- proper foundation * * * .” Michalopoulos v. C & D Restaurant, Inc., 847 A.2d 294, 300 (R.I. 2004).

Carrasco, 918 A.2d 213, 217 (R.I. 2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Michalopoulos, 847 A.2d at 300. Accordingly, “this Court will not reverse a trial justice’s imposition of sanctions unless the trial justice has abused his [or her] discretion in imposing that sanction.” Michalopoulos, 847 A.2d at 300; see also Lett v. Providence Journal Co., 798 A.2d 355, 367-68 (R.I. 2002).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'A', 'The Individual Defendants’ Alleged Defaults', 'The appellants set forth a number of arguments to support their contention that the hearing justice erred in removing the default entered against Mr. Goulart and in declining to enter a default against Mr. Coyne and Mr. Lynch. Specifically, appellants assert: (1) that this', '-5- Court’s decision in Huntley I applied only to the state because the individual defendants did not plead or otherwise defend; and (2) that the Office of the Attorney General had no authority to represent the individual defendants.', 'First, the fatuousness of appellants’ contention that the individual defendants failed to plead or otherwise defend in this case is made clear by even a cursory reading of Huntley I. In our opinion in that case, we very clearly stated: “Here, where defendants are all members of state government or employees of the Attorney General’s office, they are clearly in privity with the named defendant State of Rhode Island.” Huntley I, 63 A.3d at 531. Given that this Court’s decision barring Ms. Huntley’s claims on the basis of res judicata applies to the individual defendants, the hearing justice acted quite correctly in denying the applications for default against Mr. Coyne and Mr. Lynch and in removing the entry of default against Mr. Goulart. 6 See Urena v. Theta Products, Inc., 899 A.2d 449, 454 (R.I. 2006); see also Naylor, 542 A.2d at 664.', 'As for appellants’ contention that the Office of the Attorney General was not authorized to represent the individual defendants, we first note that this issue has no bearing on the issue of whether the individual defendants pled or otherwise defended in this civil action. Moreover, appellants do not have standing to challenge the Office of the Attorney General’s representation of the individual defendants in this case. See McKenna v. Williams, 874 A.2d 217, 223 n.4 (R.I. 2005) (“We cannot presently conceive of any circumstances when it would be the role of the Superior Court or this Court to question a constitutional officer’s decision to represent or decline to represent a state official who is sued in connection with his or her duties.”); see generally 6', 'While appellants gravely erred in alleging that any of the individual defendants were in default, their argument as to Patrick Lynch is especially specious—since he is expressly named in the federal court judgment upon which Huntley I based its ruling as to the res judicata effect thereof. See footnote one, supra.', '-6- Mottola v. Cirello, 789 A.2d 421, 425 (R.I. 2002) (“It is not the province of this Court, or the Superior Court, to dictate how the Attorney General elects to carry out the statutory functions of his office.”).', 'In sum, given that Huntley I is clearly applicable to the individual defendants and that the appellants have no standing to challenge the individual defendants’ representation by the Office of the Attorney General, “[t]here is nothing more to be said; this case is over.” Palazzo v. Alves, 944 A.2d 144, 155 (R.I. 2008); see also Arena v. City of Providence, 919 A.2d 379, 396 (R.I. 2007) (“It is time for this litigation to end.”).', 'B', 'The Alleged Due Process Claims', 'The appellants’ additional argument that they were denied due process because the hearing justice “prejudged the matter” is utterly meritless. Since the appellants neither moved for recusal nor raised the alleged issue of bias on the record, we deem that argument to have been waived. See Krivitsky v. Krivitsky, 43 A.3d 23, 32 (R.I. 2012). Moreover, our review of the record has revealed absolutely no evidence of bias on the part of the conscientious hearing justice to whom this case was assigned.', 'C', 'The Sanction', 'After the hearing on June 27, 2013, the hearing justice sanctioned Attorney Gelfuso by imposing a $1,000 fine upon him pursuant to Rule 11; he levied that sanction in view of Attorney Gelfuso’s statement in an affidavit that the individual defendants had “failed to plead or otherwise defend.” We agree with the hearing justice that a review of the record in this case shows that the individual defendants had in fact pled and defended. As such, we conclude that', '-7- the hearing justice correctly found that Attorney Gelfuso’s affidavit in support of the applications for default was not well founded in fact, was not filed in good faith, and was interposed for the improper purposes of harassing the individual defendants, causing an unnecessary delay, and needlessly increasing the cost of the litigation. See Rule 11 (“The signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by the signer that * * * to the best of the signer’s knowledge, information, and belief formed after reasonable inquiry it is well grounded in fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument * * *, and that it is not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation.”). In light of Attorney Gelfuso’s rather egregious misrepresentations, the hearing justice’s monetary sanction of $1,000 cannot reasonably be said to be at all excessive. Accordingly, given that the hearing justice carefully reviewed the record and found that Attorney Gelfuso’s filings were not well grounded, we discern no abuse of discretion in the hearing justice’s sanction.

51,State : v. : Ana M. Cruz.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Ana M. Cruz, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction, having been found guilty on two counts: (1) resisting arrest in violation of G.L. 1956 § 12-7-10; and (2) disorderly conduct in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-45-1. On appeal, the defendant argues that her right to counsel, guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution, was violated when the trial justice allowed her to represent herself at trial without first determining whether she had made a knowing and intelligent waiver of her right to counsel. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Procedural History', 'On July 7, 2012, police officer Jared Hardy of the Cranston police department received a dispatch call regarding a “report of a one-year-old walking around nude in the street” near 57 Lakeside Drive. Because that area in Cranston was part of Officer Hardy’s “beat,” he drove there immediately in order to respond to the call. Officer Hardy arrived, ninety seconds later, at 57 Lakeside Drive in his patrol car and dressed in his police uniform. After scanning the area for children, he did not find a nude child in front of that address. Therefore, he approached the residence at 57 Lakeside Drive and unsuccessfully tried to “raise the resident.” He testified that he rang the doorbell, as well as knocked several times. Officer Hardy testified that he heard “children’s voices coming from the backyard,” which led him to go around to the back, because “that[] [was] the nature of the call.” Next, he entered the backyard; he testified that he did not have to pass through a fence or gate to do so.', 'Once in the backyard, Officer Hardy testified, he saw two young males, approximately five and three years of age. Further, he described, “[t]he three-year-old was wearing a T-shirt, underwear, no pants and he was playing around in a patio that had several pieces of broken glass spread about it.” Officer Hardy testified that the backyard was on a steep hill, which led directly down to a lake without anything besides “a lightly wooded area” obstructing access to the water. He stated that these children were not being supervised at the time in the backyard. At trial, defendant’s daughter, Esmerelda Morontoro, testified that she was in the upstairs window at the time throwing a toy parachute down to the children while they were playing in the backyard. While still in the backyard, the officer questioned the children about the present location of their parents. In response, the smaller child indicated that his mother was inside and offered to bring', '-2- the officer to her. Officer Hardy testified that “[t]here [wa]s a three-year-old I don’t think should be unsupervised especially around a lake, pantless and barefoot in a glassy area. I think it was a dereliction of my duty if I walked away from that three-year-old with no adult supervision.” Consequently, the officer followed the two children into the home to find the boy’s mother.', 'After walking through a playroom and kitchen, he entered a living room where he came upon four women in conversation. Officer Hardy testified that defendant was among the group and that he asked the women which one was the mother of the scantily-clad three-year-old. At trial, defendant testified that she was cleaning up the living room when the officer entered her home and she asked, “could I help you?” Because Officer Hardy entered the home to find the smaller child’s mother, he continued to pursue that line of questioning with the women. At trial, the officer testified that he believed one of the women, Crystal Bretton, was the smaller child’s mother based upon his observations of the child pointing to her and her ensuing nervous demeanor. According to defendant’s testimony, Bretton was upstairs when the officer entered; shortly after she came downstairs, Officer Hardy said that he was going to call the Department of Children, Youth and Families (DCYF). Officer Hardy, however, repeatedly denied that he ever made any call or reference to DCYF.', 'Officer Hardy testified that defendant was “getting between me and [Bretton] and beginning to raise her voice.” Furthermore, he testified that defendant was “pointing her finger in my face. Everything she sa[id] [wa]s in an aggressive manner, you don’t have a right to be talking to my daughter,[1] you don’t have the right to be in here.” Officer Hardy testified that defendant had put her hands on him “several times,” including pushing his hand down as he tried to write. As this behavior continued, tensions escalated among the parties. Abruptly, Bretton 1', 'The defendant stated to the trial justice that Bretton was her daughter.', '-3- ran from the house and Officer Hardy pursued her. This swift departure prompted defendant to go out into the street where, according to the officer, she yelled, “you don’t have the right to ask her any questions, don’t tell him anything.” While defendant, Officer Hardy, and Bretton were outside, the melee intensified; Officer Hardy testified that defendant grabbed Bretton and told her to run to the house, then the officer grabbed Bretton and felt defendant “jump onto [his] back.” 2 Officer Hardy explained that he used his shoulder radio to call for backup, saying “they’re fighting with me.” He further testified that this trio then re-entered the house with defendant still on his back. Soon after other police officers arrived, Officer Hardy was finally able to handcuff and arrest defendant when he “pushed [defendant] into a bedroom and pushed her facedown on the bed.” After the arrest, the officer escorted defendant outside and placed her in a police cruiser. Subsequently, Bretton was also apprehended and arrested.', 'Following the chaotic events at her home, defendant was charged with: (1) assault and battery in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-3; (2) resisting arrest in violation of § 12-7-10; and (3) disorderly conduct in violation of § 11-45-1. After a District Court trial on November 28, 2012, defendant was found not guilty of assault and battery and guilty of resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. The defendant received a one-year guilty filing on the resisting arrest offense and twenty hours of community service on the disorderly conduct offense. The defendant appealed her conviction to the Superior Court on November 28, 2012. A jury trial occurred in the Superior Court on June 11 and 13, 2013, on the counts of resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. 2', 'Following Officer Hardy’s testimony regarding these alleged actions of defendant, the trial justice instructed the jury that defendant was found not guilty of the charge of assault in a prior proceeding before a different judge. Subsequently, the trial justice in her jury instructions told the jurors that they should not consider any evidence of alleged facts giving rise to the assault charge of which defendant was previously found not guilty in District Court.', '-4-', 'Waiver of Counsel', 'Prior to the trial, the trial justice offered defendant, who at the time was represented by counsel, the opportunity to accept a one-year filing, during which period defendant would maintain her not-guilty plea on the condition that she “keep the peace and be of good behavior.” The charges would then be dismissed. The defendant rejected the offer, and the trial justice proceeded to empanel a jury. 3 3', 'The trial justice engaged in a colloquy with defendant regarding her option to maintain her not- guilty plea on a one-year filing rather than proceed to trial, a portion of which we quote below:', '“THE COURT: * * * If you abide by that condition of', 'being peaceful and not committing any new crimes for a one-year', 'period, after the year ends, everything, all these records, are', 'destroyed, the case goes away completely.

State v. Sampson, 24 A.3d 1131, 1139 (R.I. 2011); see also State v. Brumfield, 900 A.2d 1151, 1153 (R.I. 2006); State v. Laurence, 848 A.2d 238, 253 (R.I. 2004); State v. Thornton, 800 A.2d 1016, 1026 (R.I. 2002). Nevertheless, “[e]ven when the de novo standard is applied to issues of constitutional dimension, we still accord a hearing justice’s findings of historical fact, and inferences drawn from those facts, great deference in conducting our review.” State v. Eddy, 68 A.3d 1089, 1098 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Thornton v. State, 948 A.2d 312, 316 (R.I. 2008)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, defendant argues that her Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated because the trial justice permitted her to represent herself without first determining whether she had made a constitutionally valid, knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel. In particular, defendant contends that the trial justice failed to determine whether she “understood the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation * * *.”', 'The state argues that defendant made a voluntary waiver of her right to counsel and “that she appreciated the risks in so doing[] * * *.” Additionally, the state asserts that the colloquies at trial demonstrate that defendant’s waiver of counsel was constitutionally valid in that it was “knowing and informed.”', 'The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 10 of the Rhode Island Constitution afford an accused the right to the assistance of counsel in all criminal', '- 12 - prosecutions. See Laurence, 848 A.2d at 252.', '“Whether defense counsel is retained or appointed, this right ensures that the trial is fair.” Id. A criminal defendant also has the right to proceed pro se at trial representing himself or herself, provided that his or her waiver of counsel is valid. E.g., State v. Spencer, 783 A.2d 413, 416 (R.I. 2001); State v. Chabot, 682 A.2d 1377, 1379-80 (R.I. 1996); see also Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 819 (1975) (“The Sixth Amendment does not provide merely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right to make his [or her] defense.”). In order for a waiver to be valid, a defendant must waive his or her right to counsel voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently. State v. Bluitt, 850 A.2d 83, 88 (R.I. 2004); see also Iowa v. Tovar, 541 U.S. 77, 88 (2004). When confronted with a defendant’s purported waiver of counsel, this Court employs a two-prong analysis to determine the validity of that waiver. Laurence, 848 A.2d at 253. It is well settled that we must first determine whether the waiver was “voluntary,” and then we must determine whether the waiver was “knowing and intelligent.” Id. (quoting Thornton, 800 A.2d at 1025); see also Bluitt, 850 A.2d at 87.', 'In conducting this constitutional inquiry, this Court examines the totality of the circumstances. Chabot, 682 A.2d at 1379-80. A valid waiver is effective only if a “defendant ‘knows what he [or she] is doing and his [or her] choice is made with eyes open.’” Id. at 1380 (emphasis omitted) (quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835). A criminal defendant, therefore, should be “made aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation.” Id. (quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835). To that end, the presence of a detailed colloquy between a trial justice and a defendant on the record assists the trial justice in ascertaining the knowing and intelligent nature of a defendant’s waiver. See Spencer, 783 A.2d at 416. However, this Court has recognized that “such an inquiry is not constitutionally required.” Id.; see also Thornton, 800 A.2d at 1026.', '- 13 - Instead, “[w]e are persuaded that an examination of the totality of the circumstances, in light of the particular stage of the proceedings at the time the waiver is proposed, is the better approach to determine whether a waiver of counsel is knowing, voluntary and intelligent.” Thornton, 800 A.2d at 1027 (quoting Spencer, 783 A.2d at 417). Moreover, a trial justice “need not make any assessment of the extent of the defendant’s technical legal knowledge in determining the defendant’s knowing exercise of the right to defend himself.” State v. Briggs, 787 A.2d 479, 485 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Costa, 604 A.2d 329, 330 (R.I. 1992)).', 'In Chabot, 682 A.2d at 1380, we elucidated six factors (Chabot factors) to aid trial justices in assessing the validity of a waiver of counsel when the competence of a defendant is in question at the time of the ostensible waiver. These factors include:', '“(1) the background, the experience, and the conduct of the', 'defendant at the hearing, including his age, his education, and his', 'physical and mental health; (2) the extent to which the defendant', 'has had prior contact with lawyers before the hearing; (3) the', 'defendant’s knowledge of the nature of the proceeding and the', 'sentence that may potentially be []imposed; (4) the question of', 'whether standby counsel has been appointed and the extent to', 'which he or she has aided the defendant before or at the hearing;', '(5) the question of whether the waiver of counsel was the result of', 'mistreatment or coercion; and (6) the question of whether the', 'defendant is trying to manipulate the events of the hearing.” Id. This Court has articulated that the application of these factors by a trial justice is mandatory only when the mental competency5 of a defendant is at issue. Laurence, 848 A.2d at 254. Moreover, 5', 'The Supreme Court has recognized that there is no meaningful distinction between the competency of a defendant to stand trial and the competency of a defendant to waive counsel. Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 387, 399 (1993). In Godinez, the Supreme Court stated:', '“Nor do we think that a defendant who waives his [or her]', 'right to the assistance of counsel must be more competent than a', 'defendant who does not, since there is no reason to believe that the', 'decision to waive counsel requires an appreciably higher level of', '- 14 - we recommend, but do not require, the consideration of the Chabot factors under a trial justice’s analysis of the totality of circumstances even in cases in which a defendant is considered competent. Laurence, 848 A.2d at 253-54; Briggs, 787 A.2d at 486 (“While not mandatory, the factors set forth in Chabot may be used as a guide in determining a valid waiver of counsel.”); see Spencer, 783 A.2d at 417.', 'We first consider the voluntariness of defendant’s waiver of counsel.', 'On appeal, defendant’s arguments appear to focus on the second prong of our waiver analysis, alleging a constitutional deficiency in the knowing and intelligent nature of her waiver. Nevertheless, we briefly examine whether defendant waived her right to counsel voluntarily. On the heels of her request to release counsel, defendant plainly conveyed to the trial justice, “I will represent myself.” As this Court has previously recognized, “[i]t is generally acknowledged that absent any showing of ‘good cause’ for a defendant’s refusal to accept court-appointed counsel, such refusal is functionally equivalent to a voluntary waiver of the right to counsel.” Laurence, 848 A.2d at 253 (quoting Thornton, 800 A.2d at 1025). Moreover, on the record before us, the', 'mental functioning than the decision to waive other constitutional', 'rights.” Id. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court did establish that states may “adopt competency standards that are more elaborate than the [Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402 (1960),] formulation * * *.” Godinez, 509 U.S. at 396, 402 (“In [Dusky], we held that the standard for competence to stand trial is whether the defendant has a ‘sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding’ and has ‘a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.’”). Under this Court’s precedent, “[w]e previously have determined that a defendant is subjected to a heightened standard of competency when he [or she] attempts to waive counsel and appear pro se.” State v. Thomas, 794 A.2d 990, 994 (R.I. 2002). This heightened standard requires the application of the Chabot factors when a defendant’s mental competency is in question at the time of the waiver, in order to determine whether a defendant is making a voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver. State v. Chabot, 682 A.2d 1377, 1380 (R.I. 1996). In the present case, no suggestion was made either at trial or on appeal that defendant was not competent to stand trial. This opinion is confined to the facts of this case and the only issue on appeal, which is whether defendant’s waiver of counsel was constitutionally valid.', '- 15 - lengthy colloquies between the trial justice and defendant establish that defendant’s decision—to waive counsel and proceed pro se at trial—was a product of her own free will. For these reasons, we are satisfied that defendant’s waiver of counsel was voluntary.', 'Next, we consider whether defendant’s waiver of counsel was knowingly and intelligently executed. The trial justice engaged in an extended colloquy with defendant, during which she had the benefit of seeing and hearing defendant firsthand, to augment defendant’s rationale and responses now on the record before us. The defendant’s conduct throughout that colloquy demonstrated her dissatisfaction with her counsel and her belief that “[she] could do it better [her]self.”', 'Accordingly, the trial justice inquired whether defendant knew how to represent herself at trial. In response, defendant informed the trial justice that she was unable to read or write and did not know how to represent herself, but nevertheless she made it clear that it was her intent to proceed pro se. Over the course of the colloquy, the trial justice endeavored to, and in our opinion did, make defendant “aware of the dangers and disadvantages of self- representation.” Chabot, 682 A.2d at 1380 (quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835). In particular, the trial justice explained the potential difficulties of self-representation given the complex rules of the courtroom, which the trial justice made clear she would require defendant to follow. Furthermore, the trial justice expressed her concerns that defendant’s lack of knowledge of law and trial procedure “c[ould] cause a trial not to be fair.” Despite the trial justice’s repeated admonitions, defendant remained firm in her choice to represent herself without any assistance of counsel.', 'In exploring defendant’s options moving forward, the trial justice did revisit her offer of a not-guilty filing provided defendant “keep the peace and be of good behavior.” In response, defendant again explained the rationale behind her refusal to accept the not-guilty filing, which', '- 16 - demonstrated her reasonable apprehension and concern based on her previous interactions with police and her neighbors. When she initially rejected the trial justice’s offer of a not-guilty filing, defendant explained: “I came from the Dominican Republic. I have an organization. I help a lot of kids to keep them off the street, teach them about their rights, the same way I’m going through right now and I’m innocent and if I decide to take this, I will not live with myself at all.” The defendant’s introspection evidences her grasp of the circumstances before her, as well as the potential perils beyond her control associated with the not-guilty filing. Later in the colloquy, when defendant did not appear amenable to any option besides proceeding pro se, the trial justice presented the option of having her attorney serve as standby counsel.', 'Although the trial justice engaged in a colloquy with defendant, she did not explicitly apply the Chabot factors. Nevertheless, even though the factors remain relevant, this Court has consistently stated that a trial justice is required only to employ the Chabot factors when there are questions regarding the mental competency of a defendant. See, e.g., Thornton, 800 A.2d at 1027; Briggs, 787 A.2d at 486; Spencer, 783 A.2d at 416-17. Now, on appeal, the argument that defendant advances suggests that, as the trial progressed, her conduct brought to light questions concerning her mental competency. She contends that the trial justice erred in not probing more deeply into her mental health because “red flags were waving for Chabot’s application in this matter since there were legitimate doubts about most of the Chabot factors.” 6 A self-represented litigant’s performance at trial, however, does not inform the knowing and intelligent nature of his or her original waiver of counsel. Rather, the relevant time frame for assessing the validity of a 6', '“In Chabot, this Court held that if a defendant waives his [or her] right to counsel and, in doing so, creates a legitimate doubt about his [or her] mental condition, then ‘it [is] incumbent upon the trial justice to conduct a more searching inquiry of [the] defendant’s then existing mental health and physical condition[.]’” Rose v. State, 994 A.2d 662, 664 (R.I. 2010) (mem.) (quoting Chabot, 682 A.2d at 1380).', '- 17 - defendant’s waiver of counsel and, similarly, questions regarding her competency to do so, is at the time of the waiver. See Rose v. State, 994 A.2d 662, 664 (R.I. 2010) (mem.); State v. Holdsworth, 798 A.2d 917, 923 (R.I. 2002). In this case, the record is devoid of any concern raised in the colloquy between the trial justice and defendant, or by her former counsel, as to her mental competency. Thus, considering the facts before the trial justice at the time of defendant’s waiver, it is unlikely that they gave rise to “legitimate doubts about * * * defendant’s mental condition.” Chabot, 682 A.2d at 1380.', 'Moreover, the trial justice had no circumstances before her to suggest that defendant was presently affected by or had a history of any psychiatric diagnosis or treatment. See Rose, 994 A.2d at 664-65, 665 n.6 (noting that there was no evidence in the record to alert the hearing justice to the defendant having any potential mental disability that warranted the application of the Chabot factors). As such, the facts of this case are distinct from those in Chabot, 682 A.2d at 1380, where the trial justice knew that the defendant had been a patient and had been prescribed medication in a psychiatric care unit for five months before the probation-revocation hearing. In that case, we held that the defendant’s waiver of counsel was not valid because a more thorough inquiry, involving the Chabot factors, was necessary based on those facts. Id. at 1380-81. Similarly, in Holdsworth, 798 A.2d at 924, the trial justice was aware that the defendant had previously been a patient at a mental health facility. In light of that fact, this Court determined that the defendant’s waiver of counsel was not valid because the trial justice had not applied the Chabot factors. Id. at 924-25.', 'At the time of defendant’s waiver of counsel, the record before us, however, does not present analogous facts. Therefore, although an explicit Chabot discussion would have been preferable, the absence of such a colloquy does not infect defendant’s waiver of counsel with any', '- 18 - constitutional defect. As our review is confined to the written record, we emphasize the fact that the trial justice, who had the benefit of seeing and hearing defendant firsthand, made the decision that application of the Chabot factors was not necessary. 7 Moreover, much of the information that a Chabot analysis is intended to mine was unearthed during the colloquy between the trial justice and defendant. It was revealed that defendant was at the time a fifty-two-year-old widow who owned her own home; her children were teachers and she was involved in the community, particularly with “kids.” She acknowledged that she could not read or write, but she answered the trial justice’s questions and at all times was respectful to the court. Not only was defendant represented by counsel during all preliminary proceedings in Superior Court, she was also represented by counsel throughout her trial and conviction in the District Court. Further, there is absolutely no indication that she was trying to manipulate the proceedings or that her waiver was the result of mistreatment or coercion. On the contrary, defendant resolutely maintained her desire to waive counsel and proceed on her own behalf before the court.', 'Also, defendant repeatedly expressed her unwillingness to accept a one-year not-guilty filing of the charges, realizing that the charges would not disappear during that year. She explained that she lived in a predominantly white neighborhood, which she described as “the wrong neighborhood,” and she expressed a distrust of both her neighbors and the police because she is “Spanish.” She indicated that this incident was not the first time the police had come into her house without an invitation. She maintained her innocence and clearly did not want these charges hanging over her head for another year. Rather, she wanted them resolved by a jury 7', 'See Commonwealth v. Simpson, 704 N.E.2d 1131, 1136 (Mass. 1999) (addressing the issue of the defendant’s competency to stand trial and noting that “[t]he [trial] judge, unlike appellate judges, had the advantage of seeing and hearing the defendant.”); Commonwealth v. DeMinico, 557 N.E.2d 744, 748 (Mass. 1990) (same).', '- 19 - trial. We cannot conclude that, as defendant argues on appeal, the very fact that she rejected a not-guilty filing “was not a rational decision.”', 'We next turn to address defendant’s appellate argument that chronicles her many deficiencies in self-representation at trial to bolster her contention that the Chabot factors should have been applied. The Supreme Court has established that “the competence that is required of a defendant seeking to waive h[er] right to counsel is the competence to waive the right, not the competence to represent h[er]self.” Godinez v. Moran, 509 U.S. 387, 399 (1993). “Thus, while ‘[i]t is undeniable that in most criminal prosecutions defendants could better defend with counsel’s guidance than by their own unskilled efforts,’ * * * a criminal defendant’s ability to represent h[er]self has no bearing upon h[er] competence to choose self-representation.” Id. at 400 (quoting Faretta, 422 U.S. at 834).', 'Further, the Supreme Court, as well as this Court, has made clear that “technical legal knowledge” is not relevant to whether a defendant made a knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel. See, e.g., Faretta, 422 U.S. at 836; Sampson, 24 A.3d at 1143; Costa, 604 A.2d at 330. Consequently, we do not consider defendant’s missteps at trial due—at least in large part—to her lack of knowledge of law and trial procedure as part of the knowing and intelligent inquiry in our waiver validity analysis. Moreover, we echo one of the Supreme Court’s fundamental teachings on the right of self-representation that, “although [defendant] may conduct h[er] own defense ultimately to h[er] own detriment, h[er] choice must be honored out of ‘that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.’” Faretta, 422 U.S. at 834 (quoting Illinois v. Allen, 397 U.S. 337, 350-51 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring)).', 'Although it would have been preferable for the trial justice to specifically address some of the pertinent Chabot factors, we are not persuaded that such an inquiry would have produced', '- 20 - any evidence to suggest that defendant’s waiver of counsel was not knowing and intelligent. See Spencer, 783 A.2d at 417-18. Accordingly, in light of the particular stage of the proceedings, the facts before the trial justice at the time of waiver, and the trial justice having the benefit of seeing and hearing defendant, we believe that the trial justice engaged in a pragmatic colloquy sufficient to establish the validity of defendant’s waiver. See id.', 'After careful consideration of the totality of the circumstances at the time of the defendant’s waiver, we conclude that the record establishes the defendant’s voluntary, knowing, and intelligent waiver of her right to counsel. The defendant made her choice—eyes wide open—to waive counsel and represent herself at trial.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.

We are called upon to determine whether a dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure in favor of the state- chartered workers’ compensation insurance provider, The Beacon Mutual Insurance Company (Beacon), and against the plaintiffs, a certified class of approximately 14,000 Beacon policyholders, was properly granted. 1 In the proceedings below, a justice of the Superior Court found that the plaintiffs’ claims were derivative in nature and, as a consequence, were subject to 1', 'The named plaintiffs include Heritage Healthcare Services, Inc. (Heritage), Vito’s Express, Inc., Swimming Pool Specialist, Inc., J. Broomfield and Sons, Inc., Sterling Investigative Services, Inc., and Leonelli and Vicario, Ltd. In addition to the named plaintiffs, suit was filed on behalf of the following class of plaintiffs, “[a]ll Beacon policyholders who held a Beacon Workers Compensation & Employers Liability Policy (‘the Policy’) during the period from September 26, 2001 to March 22, 2006 and did not receive a consent-to-rate discount during that time.” On January 19, 2011, the Superior Court certified the class and appointed the named plaintiffs, excluding Heritage, to serve as the class representatives. See Heritage Healthcare Services, Inc. v. The Beacon Mutual Insurance Co., No. PB-02-7016, 2011 WL 202299 at *10 (R.I. Super. Ct. Jan. 19, 2011).', '-1- the procedural requirements set forth in G.L. 1956 § 7-1.2-711(c) 2 and Rule 23.1 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. 3 There was no dispute with the hearing justice’s finding that the plaintiffs had failed to file suit in accordance with § 7-1.2-711(c) and Rule 23.1. As a result, he dismissed the complaint and entered judgment on behalf of Beacon. On appeal, the plaintiffs insist that their claims met the requirements of a direct, and not a derivative, action. Accordingly, the plaintiffs argue that the Superior Court erred in dismissing their complaint. In contrast, Beacon argues that dismissal of the complaint was proper because the plaintiffs’ claims are classically derivative in nature and thus subject to the procedural prerequisites of such cases, prerequisites that were not satisfied before suit was commenced. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Beacon was created as a legislative response to a growing workers’ compensation insurance crisis in the state. 4 P.L. 2003, ch. 410, § 3(f).

Accordingly, Beacon was established to act as the “workers’ compensation insurance carrier of last resort.” Id.', 'Beacon’s charter provides that the company is to be “operated as a domestic mutual insurance company.” 6', 'P.L. 2003, ch. 410, § 3(b).', 'The charter further specifies that the “management and control of [Beacon] is vested solely in the board.” Id. at § 5. As such, Beacon’s board has been granted the authority to exercise certain enumerated powers. Id. at § 10. Specifically, Beacon has the discretion to “[d]eclare dividends to its policyholders when there is an excess of assets over liabilities, and minimum surplus requirements” have been attained. Id. at § 10(6). Further, Beacon’s charter says that Beacon “may” declare dividends, evidencing that this power is discretionary.', 'Id.', 'In addition, Beacon and “any workers’ compensation insurance policyholder may mutually consent to modify the rates for that policyholder’s workers’ compensation insurance policy, provided [Beacon] files notice of the modification with the director of the department of business regulation.” Id. at § 11(d)(2). Finally, Beacon’s charter provides in part that “[a]ll premiums and other money paid to [Beacon] * * * are the sole property of [Beacon] and shall be used exclusively for the operation and obligations of [Beacon].” Id. at § 14. With Beacon’s statutory framework as a background, we turn our attention to the allegations set forth in plaintiffs’ complaint.', 'In December 2002, Heritage Healthcare Services, Inc. (Heritage) initiated litigation against Beacon, seeking to recover under the theories of breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duties. Since that time, this case has traveled what this Court has previously described 5', 'We have previously determined that the statutory phrase “lowest possible price” does not create a private cause of action.

During the somewhat Methuselah-like life of this case, numerous motions to amend have been granted that have altered the nature of plaintiffs’ complaint as well as the composition of the parties thereto. 7', 'The plaintiffs allege that, from September 2001 to March 2006, Beacon “engaged in a systematic scheme to divert over $101 million to a small percent of its policyholders rather than distributing it equitably to all its policyholders.” The plaintiffs contend that to advance this scheme, Beacon ceased formally declaring and distributing annual dividends from 2002 until 2004. The plaintiffs further contend that Beacon “charg[ed] inequitable and unauthorized lower premiums,” referred to as consent-to-rate discounts, to certain of its largest policyholders, instead of filing lower rates for all its policyholders. The plaintiffs maintained that the consent-to-rate discounts were “unauthorized and illegal” because Beacon lacked the authority to consent to a lower rate for certain of its policyholders to the exclusion of the other policyholders. As a result, plaintiffs in essence conclude that because of the consent-to-rate discounts, they were denied money that should have been equitably distributed to all policyholders as dividends.', 'In addition, plaintiffs allege that Beacon breached its fiduciary and implied duties of good faith and fair dealing because the company was “systematically operated in a corrupt, improper and unlawful manner.” Similarly, plaintiffs allege that Beacon “breached its duty to treat all its policyholders fairly and equally by distributing significant profits (in the form of lower net premiums) to [its largest p]olicyholders at the expense of all its other policyholders.” Moreover, 7', 'In September 2008, a justice of the Superior Court granted plaintiffs’ motion to file a ninth amended class action complaint. It is well established that the filing of an amended complaint supersedes the original complaint and becomes the operative pleading for purposes of Rule 12 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. See Hall v. Insurance Co. of North America, 666 A.2d 805, 806 (R.I. 1995). Accordingly, we shall confine our review to plaintiffs’ ninth amended class action complaint.', '-4- plaintiffs contend that Beacon engaged in “favoritism and bias in pricing” as well as “inappropriate and lavish spending.” Finally, plaintiffs allege that “Beacon was not operated soundly and with customary prudence, appropriate checks and balances, accountability or transparency.”', 'As a result, plaintiffs filed suit seeking “an accounting, restitution and/or damages, and an injunction prohibiting [Beacon] from engaging in [similar conduct] in the future.”', 'On February 17, 2012, Beacon filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that plaintiffs’ claims were derivative and therefore subject to the procedural prerequisites contained in § 7-1.2-711(c) and Rule 23.1. 8 The plaintiffs objected to Beacon’s motion. After hearing argument on the motion and objection thereto, on June 11, 2012, the Superior Court issued a written decision, wherein it applied the test articulated in Tooley v. Donaldson, Lufkin, & Jenrette, Inc., 845 A.2d 1031, 1039 (Del. 2004), and determined that plaintiffs’ claims were derivative, not direct, in nature. The Superior Court reached this conclusion after making two findings: (1) it was Beacon that primarily suffered the harms alleged by plaintiffs; and (2) Beacon would receive the benefit of any recovery in this matter. Because the hearing justice determined that plaintiffs’ claims were derivative in nature, he concluded that they were governed by § 7-1.2-711(c) and Rule 23.1. The hearing justice then found that plaintiffs had failed to satisfy the procedural prerequisites set forth in the statute and the rule, and he dismissed the complaint. On December 17, 2012, after the hearing justice denied plaintiffs’ motion to 8', 'Rule 12(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides:', '“After the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the', 'trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings.

The plaintiffs filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“A Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings provides a trial court with the means of disposing of a case early in the litigation process when the material facts are not in dispute after the pleadings have been closed and only questions of law remain to be decided.” Haley v. Town of Lincoln, 611 A.2d 845, 847 (R.I. 1992) (citing 5A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil 2d § 1367 at 509-10 (1990)). “A Rule 12(c) motion is tantamount to a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, and the same test is applicable to both, that is, is it clearly apparent that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts to support the complaint.” Collins v. Fairways Condominiums Association, 592 A.2d 147, 148 (R.I. 1991). The standard to be applied to a Rule 12(c) motion is “restrictive,” particularly when “the questions of law applicable to the controversy are fact intensive.” Haley, 611 A.2d at 847, 848. The court must accept that “[t]he factual allegations contained in the nonmovant’s pleadings are admitted as true for purposes of the motion,” and “[a]ll proper inferences * * * are to be drawn in favor of the nonmovant.” Id. at 847. Thus, to prevail on a Rule 12(c) judgment on the pleadings, the defendant must “demonstrate to a certainty that the plaintiff will not be entitled to relief under any set of facts that might be proved at trial.” Haley, 611 A.2d at 847.', '-6-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, plaintiffs argue that the hearing justice erred when he held that their claims were derivative in nature and when he dismissed their complaint for not satisfying the procedural requirements associated with a derivative action. To the contrary, plaintiffs contend that their claims are direct, because governing law entitles them to an equitable distribution of the excess surplus of the company and because they suffered disproportionate harm as compared to other policyholders. 9', 'Further, plaintiffs argue that Beacon’s failure to formally declare a dividend does not transform the nature of their claims from direct to derivative. Finally, plaintiffs insist that the hearing justice erred in holding that Beacon was authorized to distribute consent-to-rate discounts to its policyholders. In contrast, Beacon argues that the hearing justice properly ruled that plaintiff’s claims were derivative and therefore subject to the statutory procedural 9', 'In addition, plaintiffs argue that their claims are direct because Beacon’s board abdicated its responsibilities; however, a review of the record reveals that plaintiffs failed to timely raise this argument during the lower-court proceedings. Pursuant to this Court’s time-honored raise-or- waive rule, issues not properly presented before the trial court may not be raised for the first time on appeal. Federal National Mortgage Association v. Malinou, 101 A.3d 860, 865 (R.I. 2014) (citing Peloquin v. Haven Health Center of Greenville, LLC, 61 A.3d 419, 430 (R.I. 2013)). The plaintiffs raised their abdication argument for the first time in their motion to reconsider. This Court has previously stated that arguments raised for the first time in a motion to reconsider are not timely, and should not be considered, because it would permit “two bites at the apple.” Flanagan v. Blair, 882 A.2d 569, 574 (R.I. 2005). However, and even in the face of plaintiffs’ waiver, the cases cited in support of their abdication argument are readily distinguishable from the situation before the Court at this time. In Parnes v. Bally Entertainment Corp., 722 A.2d 1243, 1244 (Del. 1999), the court was presented with a corporate stockholder’s challenge to the fairness of a corporate merger, a claim that is clearly distinguishable from this case. Further, in Grimes v. Donald, 673 A.2d 1207, 1213 (Del. 1996), the court relied primarily upon the plaintiff’s desired remedy, a declaration that certain employment agreements were void, to find the claims were direct. Here, plaintiffs do not seek a declaration; rather, they seek “an accounting, restitution and/or damages, and an injunction prohibiting [Beacon] from engaging in [similar conduct] in the future.”', '-7- prerequisites because it was Beacon that suffered the harm and because the remedy, therefore, belongs to Beacon alone, and not to any individual policyholder.', 'The parties agree that the test articulated by the Supreme Court of Delaware in Tooley, 845 A.2d at 1033, should be applied to this case to determine whether plaintiffs’ claims are derivative or direct in nature. 10 The relevant inquiry, as enunciated in Tooley, is two-fold: “(1) who suffered the alleged harm ([Beacon] or the suing [policyholders], individually); and (2) who would receive the benefit of any recovery or other remedy ([Beacon] or the [policyholders], individually)?” Id. at 1033. If Beacon suffered the harm and would be entitled to receive the requested relief, the claim is derivative. See id. at 1039; see also Halliwell Associates, Inc. v. C.E. Maguire Services, Inc., 586 A.2d 530, 533 (R.I. 1991) (explaining that a claim seeking “to redress a wrong done to the corporation, or if the claim arises solely as a consequence of a corporate wrong,” is derivative in nature). Conversely, the claim is direct if plaintiffs can demonstrate that they have suffered harm “independent of any alleged injury to [Beacon]” that would entitle them to an individualized recovery. Tooley, 845 A.2d at 1039. “Such a claim is distinct from an injury caused to [Beacon] alone * * * [because] the recovery or other relief flows directly to [plaintiffs], not to [Beacon].” Id. at 1036.', 'At the outset, plaintiffs argue that their claims should be determined to be direct for two reasons. First, plaintiffs argue that governing law entitles them to an equitable distribution of Beacon’s excess surplus; therefore, they say, their claims are direct.', 'However, plaintiffs’ argument is at odds with their complaint. The gravamen of plaintiffs’ complaint is that Beacon engaged in a scheme whereby it ceased formally declaring dividends in favor of all policyholders 10', 'See Bove v. Community Hotel Corp. of Newport, Rhode Island, 105 R.I. 36, 42, 249 A.2d 89, 93 (1969) (explaining that Delaware case law is the leading authority in the field of corporate law).', '-8- so that it could give consent-to-rate discounts to its largest policyholders. The plaintiffs contend that, through this artifice, Beacon was able to funnel $101 million in excess surplus to its largest policyholders rather than equitably distributing it to all policyholders via a dividend. However, by distributing the $101 million in the form of consent-to-rate discounts, those assets were entirely diverted from Beacon. Therefore, Beacon never collected the $101 million because it was distributed in the form of lower premiums charged to its largest policyholders; that money never became excess surplus that could have been distributed equitably. Put simply, because the $101 million was never collected by Beacon, it never ripened into an excess surplus that could be subject to a distribution.', 'It is true that, in a mutual insurance company, “the premium exacted is necessarily greater than the expected cost of the insurance, as the redundancy in the premium furnishes the guaranty fund out of which extraordinary losses may be met * * * .” Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Lederer, 252 U.S. 523, 525 (1920). Generally, “[i]t is of the essence of mutual insurance that the excess in the premium over the actual cost as later ascertained shall be returned to the policyholder.” Id. However, in this case, pursuant to Beacon’s charter, the decision to return excess surplus was entirely discretionary. P.L. 2003, ch. 410, § 10(6). Therefore, until the board declares an excess surplus, Beacon was under no duty to issue dividends to all policyholders. Id.', 'In other words, even if the $101 million had been collected, that would not have necessarily entitled plaintiffs to an equitable distribution of those funds because Beacon’s charter is clear that the board has the discretion, but is not required, to “[d]eclare dividends to its policyholders when there is an excess of assets over liabilities, and minimum surplus requirements” are satisfied. P.L. 2003, ch. 410, § 10(6). Thus, we are not persuaded by plaintiffs’ argument that they have a direct claim under governing law. Even viewing the', '-9- allegations set forth in the complaint in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, it is our opinion that it was Beacon, not the plaintiffs individually, which suffered the harm when $101 million in prospective premiums were diverted as consent-to-rate discounts. See Tooley, 845 A.2d at 1033. As a result, it “logically follow[s]” that Beacon, not plaintiffs, would benefit by any recovery. Id. at 1036.', 'Second, plaintiffs argue that they suffered disproportionate harm as compared to other policyholders; therefore, their claims should be considered to be direct.', 'To support this argument, plaintiffs rely upon Kramer v. Western Pacific Industries, Inc., 546 A.2d 348 (Del. 1988), and Gatz v. Ponsoldt, No. Civ.A. 174-N, 2004 WL 3029868 (Del. Ch. Nov. 5, 2004). However, we find these cases to be of no assistance to plaintiffs. In Kramer, 546 A.2d at 352, the plaintiffs challenged several corporate transactions that occurred shortly before a buyout merger. The plaintiffs argued that their claims were direct in nature because their respective portions of the proceeds from the merger had been reduced by the corporate transactions. Id. Nonetheless, the court found that the plaintiffs’ claims were derivative, because the corporation, not the individual shareholders, had suffered the harm of decreased corporate value. Id. at 352- 53.', 'Likewise, in Gatz, the plaintiffs filed what was styled as a direct action, challenging four separate corporate transactions. Gatz, 2004 WL 3029868 at *6. The court found that three of the claims were derivative, and the fourth, alleging that the board benefitted a specific class of stock over others, was indeed direct. Id. at *7-8. The court reasoned that the fourth claim was direct because the overall value of the corporation was unaffected by the transaction, while at the same time a certain class of shareholders had been harmed. Id. at *8. This is distinguishable from the', '- 10 - present case because Beacon was clearly harmed when it did not collect $101 million in premiums that had been absorbed as consent-to-rate discounts.', 'Next, plaintiffs argue that, notwithstanding the fact that Beacon never formally declared a dividend, their claims are direct because they seek to remedy an inequitable distribution of excess surplus.', 'In support, plaintiffs rely upon Kimberly-Clark Corp. v. Factory Mutual Insurance Co., 566 F.3d 541, 547 (5th Cir. 2009), for the proposition that mutual insurance companies are required to distribute their excess surplus to policyholders. In our opinion, that case does not buttress plaintiffs’ argument. The court in that case was clear that policyholders have an equitable right to a mutual insurance company’s surplus only when the company announces a surplus. Id. at 548. The court held that “when a distribution is declared, the company becomes liable to pay the policyholders because they collectively own any announced distribution from the surplus.” Id. at 549. Therefore, policyholders are entitled to an equitable distribution only when a declaration of surplus has been declared. Id.', 'Here, plaintiffs concede that Beacon never declared a dividend or distribution. Instead, plaintiffs alleged that Beacon, in a surreptitious maneuver, gave consent-to-rate discounts to select policyholders. However, because Beacon never declared a distribution or surplus, we conclude that plaintiffs had no entitlement to a distribution. Kimberly-Clark, 566 F.3d at 549.', 'Finally, plaintiffs insist that the hearing justice erred in holding that Beacon was authorized to distribute consent-to-rate discounts to its policyholders. Instead, plaintiffs contend that, consistent with a finding made by the Department of Business Regulation, Beacon’s charter provides only for consent-to-rate increases. However, even assuming that plaintiffs are correct that, in the absence of authority to do so, Beacon provided consent-to-rate discounts, that does not transform their claims from derivative to direct. Indeed, it is our opinion that it would be', '- 11 - Beacon, not plaintiffs individually, that would suffer any harm occasioned by the inappropriate premium discounts because Beacon necessarily would have collected less money in premiums than it should have collected. Therefore, because Beacon suffered the harm, it is Beacon that would be entitled to any recovery. Accordingly, under the tenets set forth in Tooley, plaintiffs’ claims are derivative in nature.', 'Because we have determined that the plaintiffs’ claims are derivative in nature, it necessarily follows that they were required to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in § 7-1.2-711(c) and Rule 23.1 before they commenced this suit. Section 7-1.2-711(c)(1) provides, in pertinent part, that a corporate shareholder may not initiate suit against the corporation until “[a] written demand ha[s] been made upon the corporation to take suitable action.” Further, Rule 23.1 requires that “[t]he complaint shall also allege with particularity the efforts, if any, made by the plaintiff to obtain the action the plaintiff desires from the directors or comparable authority and, if necessary, from the shareholders or members, and the reasons for the plaintiff’s failure to obtain the action or for not making the effort.” Failure to satisfy these prerequisites mandates the dismissal of a derivative action. See Giuliano v. Pastina, 793 A.2d 1035, 1037 (R.I. 2002); Hendrick v. Hendrick, 755 A.2d 784, 793-94 (R.I. 2000). Here, a review of the record reveals that the plaintiffs made no such demand on Beacon before they initiated this action. Additionally, the plaintiffs’ complaint is silent as to what efforts they took to obtain their desired remedy before they filed suit. Based upon these facts, the Superior Court’s dismissal for noncompliance with § 7-1.2-711(c) and Rule 23.1 was proper.', '- 12 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, to which the papers in the case may be remanded.', '- 13 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Heritage Healthcare Services, Inc., et al. v.

The defendants request that this Court reverse the rulings of the Superior Court justice: (1) denying the defendants’ motion to compel additional testimony from material fact witnesses; (2) granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a protective order limiting the defendants’ planned neuropsychological examination of the plaintiff; and (3) revoking the pro hac vice admission of defense counsel. We granted the defendants’ petition for the issuance of a writ of 1', 'Although four justices have written in this matter, it should be noted that the entire Court is unanimous on every issue before it with the exception of the pro hac vice revocation, concerning which a majority of the Court is in agreement.', '-1- certiorari and heard oral arguments on October 2, 2014. For the reasons set forth herein, we deny the petition for certiorari in part and grant it in part.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In March 2008, plaintiff, Kristopher Plante 2 (plaintiff or Kristopher) was injured in a head-on collision with Stack on Route 102 in Burrillville, Rhode Island. It is undisputed that Stack operated his vehicle while he was intoxicated, failed to activate his headlights, and crossed the center line in the road, crashing into plaintiff’s vehicle. On July 29, 2010, plaintiffs filed a complaint sounding in negligence against Stack and the Disabled American Veterans Department of Massachusetts, Inc., the owner of the vehicle driven by Stack. The defendants do not dispute liability insofar as it relates to the accident, but they do dispute Kristopher’s claim for damages.', 'In the complaint, plaintiffs alleged that Stack’s negligence has left Kristopher with “severe and permanent injuries to his mind and body” and that the injuries were of such a significant nature that Kristopher could no longer perform his usual activities. In addition, plaintiffs alleged that Kristopher had suffered a loss of earnings and a permanent loss of earning capacity. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that Kristopher suffered cognitive difficulties as a result of the accident, including concentration issues during his first year as an undergraduate student at the University of Rhode Island. The defendants concede that Kristopher suffered orthopedic and head injuries, but they contend that Kristopher has made a nearly complete physical and cognitive recovery. 2', 'The plaintiff’s parents, Timothy and Teresa Plante, are also “plaintiffs” in this matter, as they brought a claim for economic damages stemming from the costs of Kristopher’s injuries and subsequent treatment. References to “plaintiff” will, however, refer solely to Kristopher Plante.', '-2-', 'The defendants responded with an answer to the complaint and a third-party complaint for contribution and indemnity against Bella Restaurant. The third-party complaint alleged that Bella Restaurant violated the Dram Shop Act, G.L. 1956 chapter 14 of title 3, when it negligently and/or recklessly served Stack while he was in a state of intoxication as defined by § 3-14-3(c). The defendants further alleged that Bella Restaurant knew, or reasonably should have known, that Stack was visibly intoxicated when it served alcohol to him.', 'On October 11, 2011, defendants petitioned for the admission of Attorney Darrell Mook (Attorney Mook) pro hac vice as associate trial counsel on the grounds that Attorney Mook specialized in dram shop cases and had a long-standing relationship with defendants’ insurer.', 'This petition was granted by a Superior Court justice on October 21, 2011.', 'Kristopher Plante’s deposition was taken at the offices of plaintiffs’ counsel on April 9, 2012, at about 10 a.m, concluding at about 3 p.m. that same day. 3 At the deposition, Kristopher revealed that his parents divorced in 2009, one year after the accident. Upon learning of the divorce, Attorney Mook asked a series of follow-up questions about the Plantes’ living arrangements, to which plaintiffs’ counsel objected. The plaintiffs’ counsel indicated that the question dealt with an improper subject matter and was an attempt to embarrass the deponent. Over counsel’s objection, Kristopher answered that his parents were living together prior to 2009. At other points in the deposition, Attorney Mook asked questions about various matters pertaining to Kristopher’s bicycle use, romantic relationships, sexual activity, and religious beliefs.', 'The depositions of Kristopher’s parents, Teresa (Mrs. Plante) and Timothy (Mr. Plante), took place on May 2, 2012, at the offices of plaintiffs’ counsel. Mrs. Plante’s deposition lasted 3', 'Excluding an hour lunch break and other short breaks, this deposition lasted about four hours.', '-3- about one hour and forty-five minutes, and Mr. Plante’s deposition lasted about two hours. Toward the end of Mrs. Plante’s deposition, Attorney Mook began to question her about the divorce to ascertain the effect it might have had on Kristopher. The plaintiffs’ counsel objected to this line of questioning and expressed concern over its personal nature. Attorney Mook asked if Mrs. Plante could give the reason for the divorce, to which plaintiffs’ counsel objected and instructed Mrs. Plante not to answer on the ground that it was not relevant to the case. Asserting that the Plantes’ divorce was highly relevant, Attorney Mook asked if she had had a discussion with Kristopher regarding the divorce, to which she gave an affirmative response.', 'When Attorney Mook asked for specifics relating to that conversation, plaintiffs’ counsel again objected and instructed Mrs. Plante not to answer. Attorney Mook then reiterated that the divorce was relevant since it could have been a “stressor” in Kristopher’s life and could have affected his overall development.', 'Notwithstanding that explanation, plaintiffs’ counsel instructed Mrs. Plante not to answer the questions.', 'Attorney Mook then shifted the questioning toward the potential impact of the divorce on Kristopher, but Mrs. Plante testified that Kristopher was “fine with it.” After Mrs. Plante stated that her son seemed “a little slow,” based on comments made to her by a friend who was a special needs teacher, Farzana Jalalkhan, Attorney Mook suspended the deposition subject to a reservation of rights on the questions that were not answered upon the instruction of plaintiffs’ counsel.', 'At Mr. Plante’s deposition, defense counsel announced that he was going to ask divorce- related questions, to which plaintiff’s counsel objected and again instructed the deponent not to answer. Once more, defense counsel explained that he was not trying to embarrass plaintiffs, but that he sought to understand the effect the divorce might have had on Kristopher. Later in the', '-4- deposition, Attorney Mook asked Mr. Plante about Mrs. Plante’s current living arrangements, specifically about whether she was living with somebody at that time. The plaintiffs’ counsel objected and instructed Mr. Plante not to answer on the ground that it had nothing to do with this case “in any conceivable realm.” Attorney Mook then asked if Mr. Plante knew Mrs. Plante’s friend Farzana, to which Mr. Plante replied that he did. Attorney Mook continued, asking what the relationship was between Mrs. Plante and Farzana and, specifically, whether they were involved in a romantic relationship. The plaintiffs’ counsel objected to each question and instructed Mr. Plante not to answer. Subsequent questions regarding Kristopher’s feelings about Mrs. Plante’s relationship with Farzana were objected to in the same fashion. Attorney Mook concluded that line of questioning by reserving the right to ask those questions if a judge should order Mr. Plante to respond.', 'On August 2, 2012, following a failed attempt at mediation, defense counsel informed plaintiffs’ counsel of his intent to reconvene Mr. and Mrs. Plante’s depositions on the issues surrounding the divorce. Defense counsel also notified plaintiffs’ counsel that he intended to have Kristopher examined by a neuropsychologist and that he intended to depose two or more of Kristopher’s treating physicians. In their August 3, 2012 response, plaintiffs’ counsel reasserted that any divorce discussion was irrelevant and put defendants on notice that any further depositions would have to be completed by August 30, 2012, the time set for close of discovery. On August 7, 2012, defendants identified their examining neuropsychologist as Nancy Hebben, Ph.D., and asked that Kristopher attend an examination on September 21, 2012. The plaintiffs agreed to the examination request, but required that it be performed before the close of discovery on August 30th.', '-5-', 'On August 9, 2012, defendants filed a motion to compel further deposition testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Plante regarding the reasons for the divorce. On August 20, 2012, plaintiffs filed a motion to appoint a single justice to preside over all future discovery and trial on the ground that discovery had not been properly conducted. The Presiding Justice thereinafter assigned the case to a single justice.', 'Between August 24 and August 29, 2012, defense counsel deposed three of Kristopher’s treating physicians. Sherri Provencal, Ph.D., the doctor who had performed neuropsychological examinations on Kristopher shortly after the accident in May 2008, was deposed on August 24, 2012. Over plaintiffs’ counsel’s objection, Dr. Provencal testified that a divorce or parenting issue could be a “stressor” for a young person entering high school or college.', 'Further questioning was also objected to by plaintiffs’ counsel on the ground that Dr. Provencal was not testifying as an expert witness, but as a fact witness. Similar objections were made at the depositions of Richard M. Terek, M.D., Kristopher’s original orthopedic surgeon, and Danny E. Humbyrd, M.D., who had been retained by Kristopher’s parents to give a second opinion regarding Kristopher’s femur fracture.', 'On September 12, 2012, plaintiffs filed four pleadings with the court: (1) objections to defendants’ motion to extend the depositions of Mr. and Mrs. Plante, and to compel Kristopher’s attendance at the neuropsychological examination; (2) a motion for a protective order regarding the neuropsychological examination, asking that it be limited in time and scope such that plaintiffs’ counsel be allowed to be present; (3) a motion to amend the complaint to add a claim for punitive damages based on the use of alcohol; and (4) a motion to revoke Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission on the grounds that he had not provided the dram shop assistance which', '-6- was the alleged reason for his admission; that his questioning of plaintiffs had been personally invasive and harassing; and that he had sought opinions from plaintiffs’ fact witness experts.', 'The matters were heard by the assigned hearing justice on September 18, 2012. The hearing justice began by deferring to rule on Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice status, allowing him two weeks to respond and to obtain counsel. The hearing justice then permitted defendants’ neuropsychological examination of Kristopher by Dr. Hebben on the condition that no history be taken and that plaintiff be allowed to have up to two representatives at the examination, including an attorney and/or a nurse paralegal. Finally, the hearing justice summarily denied defendants’ motion to compel further deposition testimony from the Plantes. 4', 'At the hearing on the motion to revoke Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission, which was conducted on October 2, 2012, plaintiffs contended that Attorney Mook questioned Drs. Provencal and Humbyrd as if they were expert witnesses when they were clearly designated as fact witnesses. In his defense, Attorney Mook asserted that his questioning was merely an attempt to test the foundation for the medical interpretations and opinions of the deponents. Attorney Mook also reiterated his position that the divorce was relevant to assessing Kristopher’s mental and cognitive state in the time period that formed the basis for calculating plaintiffs’ damages.', 'Upon conclusion of the parties’ arguments, the hearing justice found that Attorney Mook had violated Rules 11 and 26(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, and as a result she revoked his pro hac vice admission. She concluded that questions regarding Kristopher’s sexual activity, his romantic life, the Plantes’ divorce, and Mrs. Plante’s sexual orientation were too personal in nature and that the questions in these areas were designed to humiliate and 4', 'The hearing justice also granted plaintiffs’ motion to amend the complaint so as to include a claim for punitive damages.', '-7- embarrass the deponents. Citing Ondis v. Pion, 497 A.2d 13 (R.I. 1985), she concluded that Attorney Mook had crossed the line with plaintiffs’ treating physicians by asking them to explain the basis for their opinions and medical interpretations. In addition to revoking Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission, the hearing justice ordered that Attorney Mook present a copy of her decision to opposing counsel in any case where he had already been granted pro hac vice admission in Rhode Island as well as in any future cases in Rhode Island where he sought appointment.', 'One week later, on October 9, 2012, the hearing justice heard further arguments on the conditions sought to be placed on the neuropsychological examination to be conducted by Dr. Hebben. The defendants contended that the presence of a third party in the interview portion would not be an issue, but that the presence of a third party during the testing portion of the examination would “disrupt the testing protocols.” 5 Highlighting the length of Kristopher’s deposition, as well as the questioning that she perceived was designed to embarrass and humiliate the witness, the hearing justice upheld the conditions already placed on the neuropsychological examination. The hearing justice found that the conditions would serve to protect plaintiff from “further humiliation, embarrassment and exhaustion.”', 'The defendants filed their petition for a writ of certiorari on October 26, 2012, which this Court granted on June 3, 2013. Before this Court, defendants ask that each of the hearing justice’s three rulings – the denial of the motion to compel further testimony from the Plantes regarding the divorce, the granting of plaintiffs’ motion for a protective order regarding the neuropsychological examination, and the revocation of Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission – be reversed. 5', 'This was substantiated by an affidavit executed by Dr. Hebben on September 24, 2012.', '-8-', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“Our review of a case on certiorari is limited to an examination of ‘the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.’” State v.

Kent has spent the better part of his distinguished career studying and commenting on this state’s Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'Professor Kent recognizes that “the discovery machinery is designed to operate largely without judicial intervention. Professional cooperation on the part of counsel is essential to an effective working of the system.” Robert B. Kent et al., Rhode Island Civil Procedure § 26:1, V-11 (West 2006). Quoting a former Superior Court justice, Kent declares: “The discovery provisions of the new [sic] rules require liberal interpretation if they are to serve the intended purpose. The so-called ambush theory of trial is laid to rest. Both sides are now able, if they know the rules and use them skillfully, to come to trial better prepared to meet contentions, arguments and evidence of the other side.” Id. (quoting Licht, Observations on Some Aspects of the Discovery Provision of the New Rules, 1966 Rhode Island Bar Annual 1, 7). “The scope of discovery is exceedingly broad,” and its principal limitations are that the information sought must be relevant to the pending matter and not privileged. Id., § 26:3 at V-12.', 'Professor Kent’s teachings on depositions are especially helpful to this Court.', 'He instructs that, in the event of an objection to “the competency of a witness or the competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony,” opposing counsel should not advise the deponent not to answer the question. Robert B. Kent et al., § 30:8 at V-47. Instead, “[w]hatever the objection may be, Rule 30(d)(1) [of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure] requires counsel to make it in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive way.” Robert B. Kent et al., § 30:8 at V-47. Professor Kent opines, “[i]f the objection cannot be cured, the record should reflect that fact as', '- 10 - well as the ground on which it is based. The witness should answer and the deposition should continue.” Id.', 'Professor Kent acknowledges that there are still very limited circumstances in which it is appropriate for counsel to instruct a deponent not to answer a question. He notes that this rule “is designed to protect both the witness and the adverse party from bad faith or unprofessional conduct of the deposition by examining counsel.” Robert B. Kent et al., § 30:8 at V-48. He laments, however, that “[a]ll too often some counsel have instructed the deponent not to answer the posed question for a variety of insubstantial reasons, such as to thwart the discovery of unfavorable facts or to distract the examining attorney from a particular line of questions.” Id.', 'In Kelvey v. Coughlin, 625 A.2d 775 (R.I. 1993), we addressed the problem that arises when counsel instructs a deponent not to answer certain questions that have been put to him. There, we assessed the merits of the appeal under an abuse of discretion standard and found that the hearing justice was within her discretion when she ordered the defendant to resubmit to deposition. Id. at 776. Examining Rules 26(b)(1) and 30(c), we held that “[t]he only instance, we repeat, the only instance in which an attorney is justified in instructing a deponent not to answer is when the question calls for information that is privileged.” Kelvey, 625 A.2d at 776. When an attorney instructs a deponent not to answer certain questions, that attorney becomes an arbiter, a situation we have consistently sought to avoid. See id. (“It is not the prerogative of counsel, but of the court to rule on objections.” quoting Shapiro v. Freeman, 38 F.R.D. 308, 311 (S.D.N.Y. 1965)).', '- 11 -', 'A', 'Motion to Compel Additional Testimony from the Plantes', 'The defendants contend that the hearing justice abused her discretion when she denied their motion to compel additional testimony of the Plantes regarding their separation and divorce. They argue that plaintiffs’ counsel violated the holding in Kelvey when he instructed the Plantes not to answer certain questions about their divorce and its effect on Kristopher. The defendants claim that the information they were seeking was relevant because the divorce could have had an impact on Kristopher’s cognitive condition. In response, plaintiffs contend that questions about the divorce could not have been calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, but were instead meant to embarrass, confuse, and humiliate the Plantes.', 'The questions plaintiffs’ counsel instructed the Plantes not to answer centered on the reason for the divorce, Mrs. Plante’s current living arrangement and romantic life, and, significantly, the Plantes’ communications with Kristopher on those issues. As defendants point out, none of this is privileged information. Although plaintiffs’ counsel did not comply with our holding in Kelvey, we nevertheless conclude that the hearing justice did not err in denying defendants’ motion to reopen discovery. The few questions that plaintiffs’ counsel instructed the Plantes not to answer came toward the end of depositions cumulatively totaling nearly four hours and 200 transcript pages. Although not explicitly stated, the hearing justice’s reasoning for denying the motion to compel can be gleaned from the September 18, 2012 hearing, when she expressed her concern about the intrusive nature of this questioning and its potential to chill plaintiffs’ resolve.', 'Although we do not retreat from our holding in Kelvey, we are not convinced that the hearing justice erred in her denial of the motion to compel, especially in light of the length of', '- 12 - both depositions, and the point at which they concluded. We find the grounds for the hearing justice’s denial of the motion to compel to be reasonable given the extent of the deposition, and we affirm that portion of the ruling.', 'B', 'Limits on the Neuropsychological Examination', 'The defendants next contend that the protective order prohibiting their neuropsychologist from taking a history from plaintiff and allowing plaintiff up to two representatives in the examination room during testing impeded their expert from performing a meaningful examination.', 'The plaintiffs assert that Dr. Hebben does not need to take a history from Kristopher because one could be gleaned from his deposition and treating physicians’ reports. The plaintiffs also claim that there is no substantial proof that representatives at the examination would affect testing. We will address these issues in turn.', '1', 'History Taking', 'We have not previously determined whether a hearing justice is within his or her discretion to preclude a history taking during a court-ordered examination. Rule 35(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides that the hearing justice has control over “the time, place, manner, conditions, and scope of the [mental or physical] examination and the person or persons by whom it is to be made.” We gain guidance from treatises that have shed light on the issue of history taking. “The doctor must be permitted to take the party’s history and to ask such other questions that will enable him or her to formulate an intelligent opinion', '- 13 - concerning the nature and extent of the party’s injuries.” 8B Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure § 2236 at 297 (2010). 6', 'In our opinion, without the ability to take a history, Dr. Hebben would be unable to delve into areas tailored to her own examination; inquire into Kristopher’s current neuropsychological status; and, perhaps most importantly, ask pointed follow-up questions that might assist her in reaching an informed medical conclusion. Additionally, without a history, her examination will not mirror the examination of plaintiffs’ expert, where a history was taken. See Henderson v. Newport County Regional Young Men’s Christian Association, 966 A.2d 1242, 1246 (R.I. 2009) (noting that this state’s liberal discovery rules “generally favor[] the reciprocal disclosure of relevant information”).', 'While we acknowledge the length of time that Kristopher has already been questioned, we also recognize that the examination is a significant event in this litigation, and, in our opinion, it was error to so severely limit one party from having access to material information. On balance, we are satisfied that, barring extreme circumstances that we do not see here, the 6', 'Various federal courts have also addressed this issue and come to the conclusion that, with respect to medical examinations, there is no substitute for a history taking. See Romano v. II Morrow, Inc., 173 F.R.D. 271, 273 (D. Or. 1997) (“The questioning of the plaintiffs by defense counsel during the taking of their depositions, the historical medical records, and the answers of the plaintiffs to interrogatories are no substitute for the answers to questions that a physician must pose to a patient during a physical examination. All of the questions that a medical doctor needs to ask, in particular follow-up questions, cannot be determined in advance of the medical examination.”); see also Ragge v. MCA/Universal Studios, 165 F.R.D. 605, 609 (C.D. Cal. 1995) (“Because the mental examination provides one of the few opportunities for a defendant to have access to a plaintiff, and the only opportunity for a defendant to have a plaintiff examined by [the] defendant’s expert, some preference should be given to allowing the examiner to exercise discretion in the manner and means by which the examination is conducted, provided it is not an improper examination.”). Although federal district court decisions are not binding on this Court, they may guide us in the interpretation of our own rules. See Crowe v. Countryside Realty Associates, Co., LLC, 891 A.2d 838, 840 (R.I. 2006) (“[W]here the federal rule and our state rule of procedure are substantially similar, we will look to the federal courts for guidance or interpretation of our own rule.”).', '- 14 - better practice is to allow a history to be taken by defendants’ expert. The limitation on the taking of a history would be an impediment to the formulation of knowledgeable medical opinions and conclusions. We thus quash that portion of the hearing justice’s protective order precluding Dr. Hebben from taking a history at her examination of Kristopher.', '2', 'Presence of Representatives', 'Again, we have not previously addressed the issue of whether an examinee should be permitted to have representatives, including an attorney, in the room during the testing phase of a Rule 35 examination.7 The defendants have submitted numerous scientific and medical studies that decry the presence of any third parties, especially attorneys, in the room during the entirety of a psychological examination. They have also provided an affidavit from Dr. Hebben in which she avers that the presence of third parties would violate standard procedure and render her “unable to conduct a fair and accurate neuropsychological examination of [Kristopher].” The plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that there is no objective harm caused by third-party observers and that the hearing justice was well within her discretion to allow for the presence of third-party observers at the testing phase of the examination.', 'As Wright and Miller recognize, a Rule 35 examination is “an important, perhaps crucial, event in the development of the case.” 8B Charles Alan Wright et al., § 2236 at 291. Despite the examination being taken by one party’s expert, the examiner is supposed to act independently and objectively, rather than favoring the party who has hired him or her. Id. at 292. Courts have responded to this issue in a variety of ways, based on the particular circumstances of each case. Id. at 294. Wright and Miller acknowledge the concern many courts share that the examination 7', 'We note that defendants do not contest the presence of third parties during the interview or history taking phase of the examination. See p.8, supra.', '- 15 - is meant to be scientific rather than adversarial and that the presence of an attorney or other representative of the examinee has the potential to “disrupt, or defeat the purpose of, the examination.” Id. at 292. The norm in federal courts is to bar counsel unless good cause is shown. Id. at 298. 8', 'We certainly agree that Kristopher was subjected to a searching and exhaustive deposition in which he was asked to answer invasive questions of a personal nature, to the extent that some type of protection might arguably have been reasonable. We also recognize, however, that the presence of plaintiffs’ counsel during the testing phase of the examination has the potential to generate an adversarial environment and prejudice the results. We agree with those federal authorities who assert that this condition is reserved for rare occasions where good cause is shown, and we are not persuaded that this is that case. Further, plaintiffs’ neuropsychologist was not encumbered by this condition, and the creation of an uneven playing field violates this state’s broad and balanced discovery rules. See Henderson, 966 A.2d at 1246. As a result, we conclude that the order allowing plaintiffs’ attorney to be present during the testing phase of the examination was improper, and we quash that portion of the ruling.', 'Because, however, persuasive authority is mainly concerned with attorney presence except in rare situations, we see no abuse in the hearing justice allowing a third-party 8', 'See Holland v. United States, 182 F.R.D. 493, 495 (D.S.C. 1998) (“The weight of federal authority * * * favors the exclusion of the plaintiff’s attorney from a Rule 35 examination absent a compelling reason.”). The presence of third parties in the testing phase of the examination has been considered a “distraction,” turning what should be an objective inquiry into “an adversarial, partisan atmosphere.” Shirsat v. Mutual Pharmaceutical Co., 169 F.R.D. 68, 70, 71 (E.D. Pa. 1996). In addition, federal courts have expressed concern that the presence of an attorney during the testing phase of a psychological examination could lead to a scenario where that attorney becomes a witness in the case. See Hertenstein v. Kimberly Home Health Care, Inc., 189 F.R.D. 620, 629 (D. Kan. 1999) (“[T]he presence of a lawyer creates a potential ethical problem since he becomes a possible witness and might therefore have to withdraw as trial counsel.”). Again, although federal district court decisions are not binding on this Court, they may guide us in interpreting our own rules. See n.5, supra.', '- 16 - representative, such as a nurse paralegal, to be present and provide protection. We thus modify the protective order to reflect this conclusion.', 'C', 'Revocation of Attorney Mook’s Pro Hac Vice Admission', 'Finally, defendants ask that we overturn the hearing justice’s revocation of Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission. The defendants point out that Attorney Mook’s questioning of the Plantes during their depositions adhered to the directives espoused in Kelvey and that his questioning of plaintiffs’ physician fact witnesses was merely an attempt to elicit straightforward medical treatment and prognosis testimony. The defendants rightfully express their concern that this order will always be a “scarlet letter” 9 for Attorney Mook, in that it will impede his ability to successfully apply for future pro hac vice admission, at least in Rhode Island, or may affect his malpractice insurance coverage. In response, plaintiffs contend that defense counsel’s behavior was outrageous and thus constituted sufficient evidence for the hearing justice to have imposed this severe punishment. In addition, plaintiffs argue that Attorney Mook’s involvement in the case for his purported dram shop expertise is no longer necessary because he has yet to actually conduct any dram shop-related discovery. 10', 'General Laws 1956 § 11-27-5 provides: “No person, except a duly admitted member of the bar of this state, whose authority as a member to practice law is in full force and effect, shall practice law in this state.” We have previously recognized, however, that “circumstances might arise when a particular client might on ‘special and infrequent occasion and for good cause 9', 'The Scarlet Letter is an 1850 work of fiction written by Nathaniel Hawthorne, telling the story of a young woman forced to wear a scarlet “A” as a symbol of shame. 10', 'It should be noted that defendants’ pro hac vice petition in the present case was based not only on Attorney Mook’s specialized knowledge with respect to dram shop cases, but also on his long-standing relationship with defendants’ insurer.', '- 17 - shown’ require the assistance of an out-of-state attorney in a particular court proceeding in this state * * *.” In re Ferrey, 774 A.2d 62, 63-64 (R.I. 2001).

See In re Ferrey, 774 A.2d at 64.', 'Rule 9 provides, in pertinent part:', '“(a) * * * Any attorney who is a member of good standing of the bar of any other', 'state * * * may, upon special and infrequent occasion * * * be permitted in the', 'discretion of this Court * * * to participate to such an extent as the court may', 'prescribe in the presentation of a cause or appeal in this or any court * * *', 'provided, however, that * * * a member of the bar of this state * * * shall assume', 'full responsibility for them and for the conduct of the cause and of the attorney to', 'whom such privilege is accorded * * *.', '“ * * * Unless the Supreme Court [or] the court granting pro hac vice', 'admission * * * permits otherwise, any attorney who is granted such leave * * *', 'shall not engage in any proceeding * * * unless there is present * * * a member of', 'the bar of Rhode Island who shall be prepared to continue with the proceeding * *', '* in the absence of counsel who has been so granted leave.', '“Good cause for according such privilege shall be limited to facts or', 'circumstances * * * includ[ing] * * * a showing that the cause involves a complex', 'field of law in which the nonresident attorney is a specialist [or] a long-standing', 'attorney-client relationship * * *.”', 'Rule 11 provides that “a trial justice has discretionary authority to formulate what he or she considers to be an appropriate sanction, but must do so in accordance with the articulated purpose of the rule: ‘to deter repetition of the harm, and to remedy the harm caused.’” Pleasant Management, LLC, 918 A.2d at 217 (quoting Michalopoulos, 847 A.2d at 300). Barring an erroneous understanding of the law or a clearly erroneous evaluation of the evidence, we “will not reverse a trial justice’s imposition of sanctions for a litigant’s misconduct.” Id. “[W]e will reverse an imposed sanction only if the trial justice has abused his [or her] discretion in imposing that sanction.” Id.', '- 18 -', 'The hearing justice explained that her decision to revoke Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission was based on his behavior at the depositions of both the Plantes and the physicians who had been designated as fact witnesses. She believed that the questioning of the Plantes was an attempt to embarrass, humiliate, and chill their resolve, in violation of Rules 11 and 26(f). Although Attorney Mook attempted to explain the relevance of his questioning, the hearing justice characterized his style as a “fishing expedition,” and concluded that his actions rose “to the level of outrageous and egregious conduct.”', 'Although we acknowledge that Attorney Mook’s questioning of the Plantes was somewhat unorthodox, sometimes tedious, and arguably offensive, we do not agree that the severity of this punishment was appropriate in light of the fact that plaintiffs’ counsel was not blameless in allowing the litigation to reach this point. Although the questions were of a personal nature, plaintiffs’ counsel cited to no privilege, as required by the strong and unequivocal language in Kelvey, when instructing deponents not to answer. See Kelvey, 625 A.2d at 776. Pursuant to Rule 30(d)(3), counsel’s remedy was to cease the deposition and bring the matter to the immediate attention of a Superior Court justice. See Kelvey, 625 A.2d at 777 (“The harm caused by being required to take additional depositions of a witness who fails to answer a question based on an improperly asserted objection far exceeds the mere inconvenience of a witness having to answer a question which may not be admissible at the trial of the action.” quoting W. R. Grace & Co. v. Pullman Inc., 74 F.R.D. 80, 84 (W.D. Okla. 1977)).', 'The hearing justice also found that Attorney Mook’s questioning at the depositions of Drs. Humbyrd and Provencal “crossed the line” to the point of warranting the imposition of sanctions. Citing Ondis as well as L’Etoile v. Director of Public Works of Rhode Island, 89 R.I. 394, 153 A.2d 173 (1959), and Sousa v. Chaset, 519 A.2d 1132 (R.I. 1987), the hearing justice', '- 19 - noted that counsel for one party may not compel a nonparty witness to give an expert opinion when that witness has not been engaged as an expert. The hearing justice did not misstate our holding that “an expert witness who ha[s] not been engaged but merely subpoenaed [cannot] be compelled to give opinion testimony against his will.” Ondis, 497 A.2d at 18. Nevertheless, especially in light of the fact that no guidance was sought from a Superior Court justice, we are troubled by the severity of this punishment.', 'As we have noted, plaintiffs’ counsel was not free of culpability in allowing the depositions of the physician fact witnesses to spiral out of control. Clearly bothered by Attorney Mook’s allegedly impermissible questioning, plaintiffs’ counsel lodged myriad objections and, at the deposition of Dr. Humbyrd, repeatedly informed the deponent that he was not required to answer defense counsel’s questions. While not as clear a violation of Kelvey, this tactic was comparable to the actions taken by plaintiffs’ counsel at the Plantes’ depositions, and it similarly violated the spirit of Kelvey that prevents counsel from acting as the judge. See Kelvey, 625 A.2d at 776 (“It is not the prerogative of counsel, but of the court to rule on objections.” quoting Shapiro, 38 F.R.D. at 311).', 'Additionally, it is essential to bear in mind that plaintiffs alleged that Kristopher suffered cognitive difficulties and “severe and permanent injuries to his mind and body” as a result of the March 2008 accident. In view of that allegation, it is understandable that defense counsel made an effort to delve into what circumstances, other than the accident, might have caused Kristopher to suffer these difficulties.', 'It may be fairly said that the impropriety of Attorney Mook’s questioning of the fact witnesses was debatable. He asked the fact witnesses to elaborate on the grounds for their diagnoses, treatment, and prognoses, and for the basis of their findings.', 'These were not', '- 20 - hypothetical questions asked in an effort to extract expert opinions. Rather, Attorney Mook arguably was seeking to elaborate on the reports that were in his possession. While Attorney Mook’s questions may have treaded into inadmissible inquiry, they could have been resolved at the time of trial and without his removal from the case. See State v. Silvia, 898 A.2d 707, 716 (R.I. 2006) (“The determination of whether evidence is relevant is confided to the sound discretion of the trial justice * * *.”). Given that there was no clear violation of Ondis, there were no grounds for such a severe sanction in this case.', 'Moreover, although they were clearly aware of the proper remedy pursuant to Rule 30(d)(3), plaintiffs’ counsel chose not to exercise it.', 'At the deposition of Dr. Provencal, plaintiffs’ counsel declared, “I’m going to, if you persist in this line of questioning, get a [S]uperior [C]ourt judge on the phone to deal with this issue * * *.” A similar exchange transpired at Dr. Humbyrd’s deposition, where plaintiffs’ counsel asked defense counsel: “Do you want to adjourn the deposition right now and walk across the street to [S]uperior [C]ourt?” We cannot agree that Attorney Mook deserved this sanction when counsel for both sides were partially to blame for allowing the situation to become problematic. As a result, we conclude that the revocation of Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission for his conduct at the fact witness depositions was an abuse of discretion.', 'We take this opportunity to note that “sanctions are a badge of reprobation that can haunt an attorney throughout his or her career * * * [And that the] ramifications * * * go far beyond the particular case.” In re Plaza-Martinez, 747 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2014). Thus, trial courts “must take care in balancing these competing concerns” with the facts in the record, and when those facts do not support the stated grounds for punishment, the sanction should be vacated. Id. In the present case, it is our opinion that the facts in the record do not support the hearing justice’s', '- 21 - grounds for revoking Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission. Because this sanction was not “to deter repetition of the harm [or] to remedy the harm caused,” we conclude that it was an abuse of discretion for the hearing justice to have imposed it. Pleasant Management, LLC, 918 A.2d at 217 (quoting Michalopoulos, 847 A.2d at 300).', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for certiorari in part and grant it in part. We affirm the hearing justice’s ruling denying the defendants’ motion to compel additional testimony from Mr. and Mrs. Plante and therefore quash the writ of certiorari with respect to this issue. We grant certiorari on the issue of the history-taking and quash that portion of the ruling barring a history from being obtained at Kristopher’s examination. We affirm in part, however, the hearing justice’s ruling granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a protective order, allowing one non-attorney representative to join Kristopher for the testing phase of the examination, and we quash the writ of certiorari on this issue. Finally, we grant certiorari on the pro hac vice issue and quash that portion of the ruling revoking Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission. We remand this case to the Superior Court with our decision endorsed thereon.', 'Justice Robinson, concurring. I concur in the judgment of the majority as to each of the discovery-related issues addressed in the opinion of the Court. With respect to the revocation of Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice status, however, I feel obliged to state that I perceive no sanctionable conduct (let alone conduct warranting the revocation of pro hac vice status) in the depositions of Kristopher Plante and his parents. The complaint in this personal injury action, in which there was the potential for substantial damages, specifically alleged that Kristopher Plante', '- 22 - had suffered “severe and permanent injuries to his mind and body” (an allegation that is further described in the opinion of the Court). In view of that allegation, it is my opinion that defense counsel was professionally obliged to conduct discovery as to what other “stressors” might have had a causal effect on Kristopher Plante’s post-accident cognitive state. In carrying out that task by taking the deposition of Kristopher and his parents, I can discern no abusive questioning by Attorney Mook. One or other questions may have wandered into irrelevancy, but that is not uncommon in the deposition process—and I believe that the “no harm no foul” rule would be applicable thereto. I need not go on at length setting forth my views in this regard; suffice it to say that I am convinced that I would be abdicating my responsibility if I did not at least indicate in summary terms this basis for my belief that the pro hac vice status of Attorney Mook should not have been revoked by the trial justice.', 'Chief Justice Suttell, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur with the opinion of the majority affirming the hearing justice’s denial of the defendants’ motion to compel additional testimony of the Plantes.', 'I also agree that the hearing justice erred in precluding Dr. Hebben from taking a history from Kristopher and in allowing the plaintiffs’ counsel to be present during the neuropsychological examination, but that the protective order should be modified to allow a third-party representative of the plaintiffs to be present. I depart from the majority, however, with respect to its holding that the hearing justice improperly revoked Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice status. Although I acknowledge this to be a very close question, after reviewing the record, I cannot conclude that the hearing justice abused her discretion in so doing.', '- 23 -', 'Article II, Rule 9(a) of the Supreme Court Rules, Admission of Attorneys and Others to Practice Law, permits admission of out-of-state attorneys to appear in our courts, “upon special and infrequent occasion and for good cause shown * * * in the discretion of this Court * * *.” As the hearing justice correctly observed, however, once granted, pro hac vice status is not a constitutionally protected property interest; rather, it is a privilege that may be revoked in the discretion of the court. Nevertheless, in light of a client’s interest in being represented by an attorney of his or her own choice and the realities of today’s practice, in which jurisdictional boundaries seemingly have less and less significance, pro hac vice status ought not to be revoked lightly.', 'In this case, the hearing justice held two hearings on plaintiffs’ motion to revoke with a two-week interval to afford Attorney Mook “a greater opportunity to respond and to engage counsel” if he so chose. At the conclusion of the hearings, she made specific findings that Attorney Mook’s actions were “improper and abusive” and that he had violated Rules 11 and 26(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The majority states that it is “troubled by the severity of th[e] punishment.” I am too, but I believe that the majority fails to give proper deference to the factual findings of the hearing justice.', 'The hearing justice determined that many of the questions posed to Kristopher during his nearly five-hour deposition were not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible, or even relevant, evidence. She concluded that “Mr. Mook sought to embarrass him and humiliate him.” She highlighted questions concerning Kristopher’s religious affiliation, his road bike, his sexual activity during high school, and even the corsage he bought for his prom date. The hearing justice also considered Attorney Mook’s questioning of Kristopher’s parents concerning the circumstances surrounding their divorce and his mother’s sexual orientation, noting that', '- 24 - Kristopher’s “voluminous” treatment records were “devoid of anything connecting [Kristopher’s] alleged injury damages to his parents’ divorce.” The hearing justice found no legitimate basis for exploring these “highly personal and sensitive issues.” On the contrary, she found that such questions were intended “to embarrass, humiliate, and harass the Plantes and to discourage them from pursuing the claim.” Significantly, the hearing justice rejected Attorney Mook’s proffered reasons for asking many of the questions, characterizing his explanation as disingenuous.', 'With respect to the depositions of Dr. Humbyrd and Dr. Provencal, they were both clearly deposed as fact witnesses rather than as expert witnesses. Both parties acknowledged as much in an exchange of correspondence shortly before the depositions took place. Rhode Island law is well-settled that a nonparty witness may not be compelled to render an expert opinion in a case where he or she has not been engaged as an expert. See Sousa v. Chaset, 519 A.2d 1132, 1136 (R.I. 1987); Ondis v. Pion, 497 A.2d 13, 18 (R.I. 1985); L’Etoile v.

At the outset of the deposition, Dr. Humbyrd was asked whether he had been asked by any party to be an expert witness, to which he replied “no.” A review of the deposition transcript reveals that plaintiffs’ counsel interjected objections to questions designed to elicit expert testimony from Dr. Humbyrd no less than eleven times. All of which questions he answered. After the twelfth objection, Dr. Humbyrd simply refused, stating, “Counselor, I will not respond to that question. * * * It’s beyond the scope of my -- the requisition was for me to testify regarding my treatment of Mr. Plante, which I have done. I will not comment in general orthopedic terms regarding anything beyond the scope of that.” Nevertheless, Attorney', '- 25 - Mook persisted until Dr. Humbyrd indicated that he would want his own counsel present if he were to render an opinion.', 'The hearing justice found that:', '“Mr. Mook willfully violated the well-established law in', 'attempting to require Dr. Humbyrd to testify as an expert[,] * * *', 'that [he] knowingly deceived [p]laintiff’s counsel by stating in', 'writing before the deposition that he was going to treat', 'Dr. Humbyrd as a fact witness when in fact * * * he intentionally', 'engaged in a line of questioning reserved for [an] expert witness[,]', '* * * [and] that Mr. Mook failed to show Dr. Humbyrd adequate', 'respect by ignoring his statement that he would want to have', 'counsel present if asked expert questions.” On balance, I cannot conclude that the hearing justice’s ruling in this regard was based on an erroneous assessment of the evidence.', 'Similarly, during the deposition of Dr. Provencal, plaintiffs’ counsel placed numerous objections on the record, many of which were predicated on the doctor’s appearance as a fact witness. At one point, plaintiffs’ counsel interjected, “I’m going to, if you persist in this line of questioning, get a [S]uperior [C]ourt judge on the phone to deal with this issue * * *.” Doctor Provencal answered all of the questions, however, and the deposition appears to have proceeded in relative tranquility. Nevertheless, as the hearing justice correctly observed, Attorney Mook “ignored” the many objections to his questions that clearly seemed to have been posed for no other purpose than to elicit opinion testimony.', 'Based upon my review of the record, I do not believe that the hearing justice abused her discretion in revoking Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission. Moreover, I disagree with the majority’s assessment that the conduct of plaintiffs’ counsel at the depositions of the two doctors somehow ameliorated Attorney Mook’s impermissible questioning. As my aunt was fond of instructing, “two wrongs do not make a right.” The behavior of plaintiffs’ counsel has little, if', '- 26 - any, bearing on the repeatedly improper questioning of a fact witness by Attorney Mook. The mere assertion of objections is perfectly appropriate under Kelvey v. Coughlin, 625 A.2d 775 (R.I. 1993). Moreover, plaintiffs’ counsel did not inform Dr. Humbyrd that he was “not required to answer that question” until after he had already lodged twelve objections and after Dr. Humbyrd had already refused to answer a question.', 'With respect to Dr. Provencal’s deposition, although plaintiffs’ counsel made a bevy of objections and indicated that she would call a judge if Attorney Mook continued to ask inappropriate questions, she never instructed the witness not to answer a question.', 'I am fully in accord with the majority’s adherence to the holding in Kelvey, 625 A.2d at 776. An attorney may instruct a witness not to answer a question only when the question calls for information that is privileged. Id.', 'Rule 30(d)(3) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, however, permits a party or deponent to demand a suspension of the deposition to make a motion or obtain a ruling by telephone “upon a showing that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party * * *.”', 'That is not to say, however, that an attorney may conduct a deposition with impunity in the absence of the opposing party seeking such relief. Good faith is expected in all proceedings by members of the bar, whether active members of the bar or those admitted pro hac vice. Here, the hearing justice found that Attorney Mook persisted in asking plaintiffs questions that were not designed to elicit admissible evidence, but rather to embarrass, humiliate, and harass them, and to discourage them from pursuing the litigation. She also found that he intentionally, and over objection, asked questions of fact witnesses that were specifically designed to elicit inadmissible opinion testimony.', '- 27 -', 'I am satisfied that the hearing justice’s decision to sanction Attorney Mook by revoking his pro hac vice admission, although perhaps harsh, is supported by the record. I would therefore affirm the hearing justice’s ruling in that regard. I would vacate, however, that portion of her ruling ordering him to provide a copy of the order and transcript of the decision “to any other Superior Court Justice within this state to whom he has applied, or will apply in the future, for pro hac vice status.” The revocation of his pro hac vice status is a matter of weighty significance for both Attorney Mook and the bar, and thus one that need not bear any scarlet embellishment.', 'Justice Goldberg, concurring in part and dissenting in part. As an initial matter, I note that the fact that four justices have found it appropriate to write on the issue of the revocation of the pro hac vice admission—which is guided by an abuse-of-discretion standard— speaks loudly. This is a decision that is committed to the trial justice. Because I am of the opinion that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion when she revoked Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice status, I respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority decision. The grant of pro hac vice admission in this state is a privilege which is “permitted in the discretion of this Court[.]” Article II, Rule 9(a) of the Supreme Court Rules, Admission of Attorneys and Others to Practice Law. When an out-of-state attorney is accorded such a privilege, it is incumbent upon that attorney to comport himself or herself in accordance with the laws of this state and the rules of the Rhode Island Judiciary. See Cooper v. Hutchinson, 184 F.2d 119, 123 (3rd Cir. 1950) (stating that the rights and duties of pro hac vice counsel, once admitted, are identical to those of a barred attorney). When an attorney fails to comply, as is the case here, it is within the inherent power of the court to remedy the situation. See Standing Committee on Discipline of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California v. Ross, 735 F.2d 1168,', '- 28 - 1170 (9th Cir. 1984) (“Any court which has the power to admit attorneys to practice may also sanction them for unprofessional conduct.”); see also Baldwin Hardware Corp. v. FrankSu Enterprise Corp., 78 F.3d 550, 562 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (concluding that power to sanction “encompasses the authority to suspend an attorney admitted pro hac vice from further practice before the court,” citing United States v. Engstrom, 16 F.3d 1006, 1012 (9th Cir. 1994)); Royal Indemnity Co. v. J.C. Penney Co., 501 N.E.2d 617, 620 (Ohio 1986) (“[O]nce pro hac vice status is extended, a trial court retains the power to revoke the status.”). A decision to revoke the pro hac vice status of an attorney is committed to the sound discretion of the trial justice. See Fremming v. Tansey, 626 A.2d 219, 220 (R.I. 1993) (review of trial justice’s decision to impose sanction is guided by abuse-of-discretion standard).', 'Attorney Mook was admitted pro hac vice in this case for two purported reasons: (1) his expertise regarding dram shop claims 1 and (2) his prior relationship with “the client”—not defendant Daniel Stack, but rather his insurance company. As a prerequisite to admission pro hac vice, Attorney Mook was required to be sponsored by a licensed attorney who maintains an office in Rhode Island; whether the local counsel met the requirement that he maintain an office in this state is questionable, at best. Nonetheless, this formality was not the basis for the revocation of Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission. 2 1', 'As the trial justice alluded, any dram shop claim on behalf of the insurance company is dubious, at best, given that it was Attorney Mook’s client who was the drunk driver in this case, and his insurance company is seeking indemnity from the barroom where he got drunk. See G.L. 1956 chapter 14 of title 3. 2', 'This Court previously found that noncompliance with this prerequisite was not fatal to a pro hac vice admission and granted a ten-day window in order for pro hac vice counsel to obtain a proper sponsoring attorney. See In re Gauvin, 779 A.2d 645, 645-46 (R.I. 2001) (mem.).', '- 29 -', 'The trial justice’s basis for revoking the pro hac vice admission of Attorney Mook was twofold. 3 First, she determined that Attorney Mook’s examination of Kristopher, Teresa, and Timothy was “well beyond the letter and spirit of Rule 26 [of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure] * * * [and that Attorney Mook] sought to embarrass [them] and humiliate [them].” The trial justice determined that Attorney Mook’s questions about highly personal and sensitive issues were not geared to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, but rather, were geared “to discourage [plaintiffs] from pursuing the claim.” 4 The trial justice concluded that “[n]o 3', 'While not a basis for the trial justice’s revocation or a reason for my dissent, it should be noted that Attorney Mook misstated when he first learned of the divorce between Teresa and Timothy. In his pleadings and at the hearings before the trial justice, Attorney Mook insisted that the first time he learned of the divorce was at the deposition of Teresa and Timothy. However, it was actually Kristopher who first informed Attorney Mook of the divorce, and Attorney Mook in fact questioned Kristopher about the divorce, three weeks before the depositions of Teresa and Timothy. 4', 'A sample—but certainly not a complete list—of such questions by Attorney Mook include:', '1. “Q [posed to Kristopher]: All right. I don’t want to embarrass you, but I want to', 'ask you, were you sexually active with [your girlfriend] during high school?”', '2. “Q [posed to Kristopher]: Okay. And after the accident when you were at URI', 'you would see [your girlfriend]. Were you still sexually active with her?”', '3. “Q [posed to Kristopher]: Must be a very fun situation, huh?” after eliciting that', 'Kristopher was living with his ex-girlfriend.', '4. “Q [posed to Teresa]: Did [Kristopher] ever discuss with you his sexual activity', 'with his girlfriends during high school before the accident?”', '5. “Q [posed to Teresa]: Okay. Can you just * * * tell me in a succinct way what the', 'reason was why you decided to divorce?”', '6. “Q [posed to Timothy]: Did [Kristopher] ever share with you or did you ever', 'discuss with him his sexual activity, if any, with [his girlfriend]?”', '7. “Q [posed to Timothy]: You had not discussed [the divorce] with your wife', 'before she asked you for a divorce the first time around the fall of ’09, correct?”', '8. “Q [posed to Timothy]: Again, I’m going to ask you for the record again what', 'were the reasons for the divorce that your wife gave to you when she asked you', 'for the divorce?”', '9. “Q [posed to Timothy]: Okay. As far as you know since ’09 has you[r] wife been', 'dating or had any relationships since ’09 when she asked for the divorce?”', '10. “Q [posed to Timothy]: Do you know her relationship with Farzana?”', '11. “Q [posed to Timothy]: Do you know if Farzana is your - - is Ter[esa’s] lover?”', '- 30 - reasonable attorney would have determined this line of questioning to be calculated to the discovery of admissible evidence.” Although I agree with this finding, I am of the opinion that standing alone, this behavior, although deplorable, may not have risen to such a level of impropriety as to warrant revocation.', 'It is the trial justice’s second basis for revocation of Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission, his conduct during the deposition of the treating physicians that convinces me that the trial justice acted appropriately. The trial justice relied on well-established precedent in Ondis v. Pion, 497 A.2d 13 (R.I. 1985) and Sousa v. Chaset, 519 A.2d 1132 (R.I. 1987), that a fact witness can never be compelled to provide an expert opinion. The trial justice noted the multiple objections from not only plaintiffs’ counsel, but from Dr. Humbyrd himself to questions that called for Dr. Humbyrd to give an expert opinion. Ultimately, the trial justice found', '“that [Attorney] Mook wilfully [sic] violated the well-established', 'law in attempting to require Dr. Humbyrd to testify as an expert.', '* * * The [c]ourt concludes that [Attorney] Mook knowingly', 'deceived [p]laintiff’s [sic] counsel by stating in writing before the', 'deposition that he was going to treat Dr. Humbyrd as a fact witness', 'when in fact at some point * * * he intentionally engaged in a line', 'of questioning reserved for [an] expert witness.” After conducting a thorough review of the record, the trial justice stated that she found “sufficient basis on this record to determine that [Attorney Mook’s] conduct r[ose] way above zealous advocacy, reaching the level of egregiousness envisioned by Rule 11 [of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure].”', '12. “Q [posed to Timothy]: Are you aware if Kris has knowledge of whether or not', 'Farzana is Ter[esa’s] lover?”', '13. “Q [posed to Timothy]: Have you ever discussed with Kris his knowledge of', 'whether or not he knows if Farzana is Ter[esa] Plante’s lover or not?”', '14. “Q [posed to Timothy]: Have you discussed with Kris his feelings about his', 'mother’s relationship, whatever it is, with Farzana?”', '- 31 -', 'In my opinion, the conduct exhibited by Attorney Mook was censurable and beyond the bounds of acceptable behavior. Attorney Mook knowingly and willfully violated established law in this state and exhibited a complete disregard of the well-established rule that a fact witness may not be compelled to offer an expert opinion against his or her will. See Sousa, 519 A.2d at 1136 (“An expert who has not been engaged, but only subpoenaed, cannot be compelled to give opinion testimony against his or her will.”). Attorney Mook knew full well that Dr. Humbyrd was noticed as a fact witness only—a situation that was acknowledged in correspondence between Attorney Mook and counsel for plaintiffs 5—yet he proceeded to pose a litany of questions that would require Dr. Humbyrd to give an expert opinion. In the face of numerous questions that called for an expert opinion, objections were raised by plaintiffs’ counsel as well as Dr. Humbyrd. At one point, Dr. Humbyrd stated that he would not answer a question and, when challenged by Attorney Mook as to the basis for not answering, Dr. Humbyrd replied: “[i]t’s beyond the scope of my—the requisition was for me to testify regarding my treatment of Mr. Plante, which I have done. I will not comment in general orthopedic terms regarding anything beyond the scope of that.” After Dr. Humbyrd’s assertion—that he did not want to provide “further conjecture as to any future issues regarding this patient”—Attorney Mook pressed on, again asking essentially the same question. At that point, Dr. Humbyrd made an unequivocal request to have his personal attorney present. 6 This request was ignored, and 5', 'Preceding the deposition, Attorney Mook wrote to plaintiffs’ counsel stating that if Kristopher’s treating physicians—Dr. Humbyrd included—were not designated as trial experts then he would “proceed to notice these depositions as fact witnesses only.” The plaintiffs’ counsel later advised Attorney Mook that the treating physicians would be fact witnesses and not experts. 6', 'Doctor Humbyrd stated: “If I were going to respond to that question, I would want counsel of my own representing me before I respond to it, and I do not have counsel present. I was subpoenaed to testify regarding my records, which I have done, I think very adequately, and I think very clearly, and I think I’ve spelled it out. So to go beyond this point and further', '- 32 - Attorney Mook persisted and posed the same question that had prompted Dr. Humbyrd to request the presence of his personal attorney. Except this time Attorney Mook explicitly asked for a “yes or no” response—as if this would change Dr. Humbyrd’s stance on whether the question called for him to give an expert opinion.', 'Instead of acknowledging that Dr. Humbyrd was noticed purely as a fact witness and, therefore, could not be compelled to give an expert opinion, Attorney Mook issued the following admonition:', '“I just want to warn you, Doctor—not warn you. I just want to say', 'on the record that I disagree with your impression of the legal', 'significance of this question. We may well have to go before a', 'judge, ask the judge to make a decision about this issue, that series', 'of questions. If the judge rules in favor of my view of the', 'question, then we will require to have you come back and ask you', 'maybe five minutes of questions on that issue, or you can answer it', 'on the record, however you can, and whether or not it’s ever', 'admissible later will be decided by a judge.', '“But the preferential way that the appeals court says it', 'should be done is that the witness should answer the question, and', 'any fight over the legality of the question and answer can be', 'determined once it’s in a transcript, and some judge can decide', 'once at trial or in a proceeding if it’s admissible or not. So you can', 'do whichever way you prefer. I’m just saying.” This conduct is improper and amounts to an implied threat to the doctor that he will be further inconvenienced by having to return for “five minutes of questions” if a judge decides the questions should be answered. Tellingly, the witness persisted in his refusal to answer the questions, and the defense has not sought a ruling compelling Dr. Humbyrd to provide further testimony. The position taken by Attorney Mook—that the treating physician must give an conjecture as to any future issues regarding this patient, who I’m currently not treating, is beyond the scope of what is requested of me, as the subpoenaed person here.”', '- 33 - expert opinion against his will—mirrors the strict adherence to Kelvey v. Coughlin, 625 A.2d 775 (R.I. 1993) that the majority opinion espouses. I disagree with this reasoning and suggest that it ignores an important part of our discovery jurisprudence and fails to acknowledge Ondis and Sousa.', 'Here, Dr. Humbyrd was subpoenaed purely as a fact witness. Yet, questions were posed seeking his expert opinion. Clearly this is contrary to our well-established law as set forth in Sousa and Ondis. By implicitly elevating the holding of Kelvey over the safeguards announced in Sousa and Ondis, the Court is creating a hard-and-fast rule that does not serve the bar or the bench and leaves counsel in a quandary about terminating a deposition of their client’s treating physician based on opposing counsel’s defiance of our settled law. Kelvey addressed whether opposing counsel can instruct a witness not to answer a question. In this case, Dr. Humbyrd refused to answer these inappropriate questions, rightfully, I conclude. Doctor Humbyrd had an absolute right not to answer questions that sought an expert opinion, yet the majority opinion criticizes plaintiffs’ counsel for not standing mute and employs this criticism as grounds for reversing the trial justice. Lawyers are not potted plants and it is not in the nature of experienced trial lawyers to remain silent while another lawyer tramples on the rights of their client’s treating physician. We should not require that they do so.', 'Furthermore, the alleged Kelvey violation committed by plaintiffs’ counsel in no way should be considered a mitigating factor when examining the conduct of Attorney Mook. Whether or not plaintiffs’ attorney elected to stop the deposition pursuant to Rule 30(d)(3) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure 7 has no bearing on the fact that the questioning by 7', 'Rule 30(d)(3) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides:', '- 34 - Attorney Mook was improper and deceitful. Stated differently, our decision in Kelvey does not give an attorney carte blanche to question a witness regarding improper topics or require a fact witness to render expert opinions only to postpone the resolution of the admissibility until the time of trial. That does not un-ring the bell and is small comfort to those who practice in the arena. Thus, even if the proper procedure was to stop the deposition to obtain a ruling from a Superior Court justice—a course of action suggested by plaintiffs’ counsel but rebuffed by Attorney Mook—the failure to do so does not absolve the conduct of Attorney Mook. I can think of no more inappropriate line of questioning than trying to force a fact witness to answer questions requiring expert opinion in contravention of our well-established precedent. Sousa, 519 A.2d at 1135-36; Ondis, 497 A.2d at 18. On this basis alone, I believe that the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in deciding to revoke the pro hac vice admission of Attorney Mook. The fact that Attorney Mook did not pose hypothetical questions to Dr. Humbyrd, as the majority notes, is of no moment to this analysis; as the witness stated, the questioning sought “further conjecture as to any future issues regarding [Kristopher].” This is opinion testimony.', 'While Attorney Mook’s questioning of Dr. Humbyrd provided the trial justice with ample basis to revoke Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission, the manner in which Attorney Mook conducted the depositions of Kristopher, Teresa, and Timothy and comported himself before the trial justice supplied further evidence warranting the revocation. The trial justice conducted a thorough review of the questions that she deemed inappropriate and afforded', '“At any time during a deposition, on motion of a party or of the deponent', 'and upon a showing that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in', 'such manner as unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or', 'party, the court in which the action is pending or the court in the county where the', 'deposition is being taken may order the officer or examining attorney conducting', 'the examination to cease forthwith from taking the deposition or may limit the', 'scope and manner of the taking of the deposition as provided in Rule 26(c).”', '- 35 - Attorney Mook ample opportunity to explain why these questions could lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. This exchange spanned twelve pages of the hearing transcript. Two weeks later, when rendering her decision, the trial justice stated that:', '“[a]t the hearing * * * the [c]ourt attempted to elicit from', '[Attorney] Mook a legitimate basis for the questions. [Attorney]', 'Mook addressed that issue again today. The [c]ourt is not satisfied', 'and was not satisfied two weeks ago with his explanation and find', 'that they were disingenuous. I reject them.” The trial justice’s conclusion that Attorney Mook’s conduct was “outrageous and egregious” and his explanations “disingenuous” demonstrates to me that she carefully considered whether revoking Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission was warranted. Consequently, I agree with the Superior Court justice’s conclusion that the questioning was plainly improper, and I cannot agree with the majority’s characterization that it was merely “unorthodox.” Additionally, the trial justice enunciated that her decision was based upon “a very significant and sufficiently lengthy record[.]” See Williams & Connolly, L.L.P. v. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc., 643 S.E.2d 136, 148 (Va. 2007) (concluding that circuit court did not abuse its discretion in revoking pro hac vice admission of attorney). It is apparent from a review of the record that the trial justice properly exercised her discretion.', 'Furthermore, it is evident that the trial justice acted with due diligence by proceeding in the manner she did and making detailed and appropriate record findings. After a thorough search of the law of other jurisdictions on this distasteful topic, it is evident that appellate courts vacate such revocation orders for two primary reasons: 8 (1) the pro hac vice attorney was not given adequate notice and hearing; or (2) in a criminal case, the client’s Sixth Amendment right to 8', 'Other than decisions based on the two identified grounds, there is a dearth of case law reversing revocation of pro hac vice admissions on abuse-of-discretion grounds.', '- 36 - counsel of his or her own choosing was not properly considered.', 'Here, the trial justice appropriately dealt with both of these concerns.', 'First, she conducted an initial hearing on September 18, 2012. At the conclusion of this hearing she stated, “I feel that because I may revoke your pro hac vice status, I want to give you a greater opportunity to respond and to engage counsel if you so choose. Therefore, as it relates to this motion, I’m continuing it for further hearing and decision.” Two weeks later, the trial justice again gave Attorney Mook the opportunity to respond to the alleged egregious conduct. 9 Only after this hearing did the trial justice render her decision.', 'Second, the trial justice concluded that Attorney Mook’s clients would not be prejudiced because local counsel was able to take over as lead counsel. Although the trial justice did not undertake a Sixth Amendment balancing test, such is not required in a civil action sounding in tort. See United States v. Nolen, 472 F.3d 362, 375, 376 (5th Cir. 2006) (concluding that a criminal defendant’s Sixth Amendment rights must be weighed when revoking pro hac vice admission of a criminal defendant’s counsel). I am of the opinion that the trial justice’s finding that defendant in this civil action would not be prejudiced by revocation of Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission was more than sufficient.', 'Accordingly, I am satisfied that the order revoking Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission is sufficient to remedy the conduct in this case. However, I am not convinced that the additional requirement that Attorney Mook advise opposing counsel of this matter in any future case serves any useful purpose and is overly burdensome. 9', 'Attorney Mook took advantage of this opportunity, filing supplemental material, including an affidavit of his educational background and subsequent legal accomplishments. Additionally, he sought to address many of the concerns identified by the Superior Court justice at the earlier hearing. He was found to be disingenuous.', '- 37 -', 'For the foregoing reasons, I would grant certiorari as it relates to the Superior Court justice’s revocation of Attorney Mook’s pro hac vice admission but would vacate that portion of the order requiring Attorney Mook to present a copy of her decision to opposing counsel in any present or future case where he sought pro hac vice admission in Rhode Island.

The plaintiff, Mary Lou Dauray (plaintiff or Dauray), brings three separate appeals, each of which challenges the Superior Court’s determination that she did not have standing in each of the three cases filed in the Superior Court, resulting in the dismissal of her claims. The three appeals brought by Dauray are: (1) an appeal of a probate court order admitting the will of Dauray’s aunt, Gabrielle D. Mee (Gabrielle), 1 claiming that the will was executed through undue influence, fraud, and mistake in the inducement; 2 (2) an appeal 1', 'First names may be used throughout this decision for ease of reading.

(Legion of Christ); 3 and (3) an appeal from an action alleging that Bank of America, N.A. (BOA)4 breached its fiduciary duties as the trustee of multiple trusts set up by Gabrielle and her late husband. 5 A justice of the Superior Court granted summary judgment in all three actions in favor of the various defendants on the grounds that Dauray lacked standing to bring the claims pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 33-18-17 or under the common law. The trial justice determined that Dauray was not “a person legally interested in the estate” of Gabrielle because, in her deposition testimony, Dauray expressly disavowed any recovery in these actions, and also because the instruments at issue clearly directed that all of the couple’s assets were to go to charity, thus depriving Dauray of any potential pecuniary interest. Additionally, Dauray alleges that the trial justice erred when he awarded attorneys’ fees to the defendants when Dauray sought to amend her reasons of appeal from the probate court pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 33-23-1(a)(2). 6 For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgments of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'A review of the record in each case, including deposition testimony submitted at summary judgment, reveals the following facts.

During their lifetime, the Mees accumulated great wealth. 8', 'On February 8, 1982, Timothy created a charitable remainder unitrust (CRUT), for the benefit of Timothy and Gabrielle during their lifetimes, and, after their death, for the benefit of charities.', 'The original charitable beneficiary under the CRUT was The Hope Charitable Foundation, a nonprofit entity created by Timothy in 1967. Later that year, on September 30, 1982, Gabrielle created a trust indenture (the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust). Under its original terms, the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust was to terminate upon Gabrielle’s death and pour over into The Hope Charitable Foundation, the same charitable beneficiary of the CRUT.', 'On January 29, 1985, Timothy established the Timothy J. Mee Foundation (the Foundation). The Foundation was “formed, and shall be exclusively administered and operated for charitable purposes.” Significantly, “[n]either the income nor the assets of [the Foundation] shall ever inure to the benefit of the [s]ettlor or any other private person.” In order to fund the Foundation, Gabrielle amended the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust on February 18, 1985. The amendment provided that all income that Gabrielle was entitled to receive as a lifetime beneficiary from the CRUT would be paid to the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust and, upon Gabrielle’s death, the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust would terminate and all income and principal was to be paid to the Foundation. Finally, the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust was amended so that upon Timothy’s death the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust would become irrevocable. The Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust was amended once more, on May 3, 1985. As 7', 'Timothy had two children from a prior marriage.

Timothy passed away later that year, on December 18, 1985. Gabrielle lived for another twenty- two years.', 'On October 22, 1987, Gabrielle created another charitable trust, known as the Gabrielle D. Mee Trust. The Gabrielle D. Mee Trust was to pay income to the Contemplatives of Our Lady of Joy, Inc. (the Contemplatives). The Contemplatives, at the time, were a small religious order—founded by two brothers from Rhode Island—with only preliminary recognition from the Roman Catholic Church. The Gabrielle D. Mee Trust provided that the “trustees may terminate the [t]rust for any reason at any time that [the Contemplatives] has not been officially recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, or otherwise approved by the trustees in their sole and absolute discretion[.]” Gabrielle permitted the Contemplatives to live—rent-free—at her property in North Smithfield.', 'In or about August 1989, Gabrielle first learned of the Legion of Christ from a fellow parishioner. 9 Thereafter, Gabrielle visited the Legion of Christ at their center in Cheshire, Connecticut, to learn more about them. The Legion of Christ was established in Mexico by Father Marcial Maciel Degollado (Father Maciel), who served as the General Director of the Legion of Christ until 2005. After learning more about the Legion of Christ, either personally or through trust officers who researched the organization at her behest, Gabrielle made a million- dollar donation to the Legion of Christ. Gabrielle stated that after this discovery she “caught 9', 'Although Gabrielle maintained that she first learned of the Legion of Christ from a fellow parishioner, a trust officer contended that he informed Gabrielle about the Legion of Christ. This discrepancy is of no consequence to this opinion.', '-4- fire” and “knew that [the Legion of Christ] was the way to go”—presumably with her charitable donations, and later with a vocation lasting for the remainder of her life.', 'On October 10, 1991, Gabrielle executed a will that revoked all prior wills and codicils (1991 Will). Importantly, the 1991 Will directed that 10 percent of the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust was to benefit Americans United for Life (AUL) and 90 percent was to go to the Legion of Christ. The residue of her estate was devised “to the trustee then serving under the [Gabrielle Mee Revocable] Trust.”', 'Later that year, in November 1991, Gabrielle became a consecrated woman with the Regnum Christi, an organization associated with the Legion of Christ. In order for Gabrielle to become a consecrated woman, however, certain qualifying prerequisites, including educational requirements and the “typical” path that consecrated women go through, were waived by Father Maciel. 10 Another condition of becoming a consecrated woman of the Regnum Christi was that members were expected to donate half of their assets to the organization after fifteen years and all of their assets after twenty-five years. Gabrielle began residing at the Regnum Christi facility in Wakefield, Rhode Island, at this time. 11 On November 23, 1991, Father Maciel wrote to Gabrielle and encouraged Gabrielle to submit a monthly budget to priests of the Legion of Christ in order to fulfill her promise of poverty as a consecrated woman. 10', 'The Statutes of the Regnum Christi Movement stated that consecrated women “typically follow the following path:” (1) one year of formation; and (2) three to four years of study of “spirituality, general culture, pedagogy, philosophy, theology, writing and public speaking and other subjects that are useful for the apostolate * * *.” 11', 'Eventually, Gabrielle relocated to her former North Smithfield property, which she transferred to the Legion of Christ, along with other consecrated women. She lived there during her remaining years.', '-5-', 'During her time at Regnum Christi, Gabrielle considered herself the grandmother of the younger consecrated women. 12 Gabrielle believed that Father Maciel was a saintly man, and she relied upon other Legion of Christ priests to be her spiritual advisers. In September 1995, Gabrielle authored a short account of her journey toward becoming a consecrated woman, in which she expressed great delight at all the Regnum Christi had given her spiritually. However, the record before us also discloses that, when family members visited Gabrielle, the visits were monitored to some extent by other Regnum Christi members. When one friend attempted to contact Gabrielle, she was told on multiple occasions that Gabrielle was either indisposed or not feeling well.', 'Furthermore, Gabrielle was denied a request she made to a “tribunal” for permission to visit family members out of state.', 'On January 11, 1994, Gabrielle amended the Gabrielle D. Mee Trust by substituting the Legion of Christ as the beneficiary, to the exclusion of the Contemplatives. This occurred after Gabrielle learned that a male member of the Contemplatives had been accused of soliciting sex from another male. Gabrielle withdrew support of the Contemplatives and evicted them from the North Smithfield property. Around this time, Gabrielle deeded the North Smithfield property to the Legion of Christ.', 'On September 2, 1994, the Foundation was amended and renamed The Timothy J. Mee Charitable Trust. The amendment provided that the trust was to “support exclusively the Legion of Christ * * *. However, should the said Legion [of Christ] ever cease to be an organization exempt from taxation under §501(c)(3) of the [Internal Revenue] Code or cease to be faithful to the Holy Father as determined by the Roman Pontiff or his designee, then the [t]rust shall be a 12', 'In describing her life at the Regnum Christi, Gabrielle stated: “I enjoyed the life very much. * * * It was everything I wanted. It was most fulfilling. And the nice part is, here I was at 80 [years old] and surrounded with such a young family. So I became the grandmother officially. I had some beautiful, very wonderful grandchildren.

Again the same conditions were imposed on Hombre Nuevo Rhode Island, Inc. and the next organization was Mater Ecclesiae, Inc., and thereafter, the last alternative beneficiary, The Papal Foundation, all with the same conditions. Finally, if The Papal Foundation ceased to be a § 501(c)(3) organization or faithful to the Pope, the trust was to support “such entity or entities that are tax-exempt under §501(c)(3) of the code as the [t]rustee shall in its sole discretion determine, provided, that the [t]rust shall not support any entity or activity which is opposed to the teachings or doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church.”', 'All the named beneficiaries, with the exception of The Papal Foundation, were entities related or associated with the Legion of Christ. Additionally, the amendment established an advisory committee “composed of three persons appointed by the President of the Legion of Christ,” designed to make recommendations regarding trust distributions, which recommendations the trustee was to consider when making distributions.', 'Finally, the amendments provided that no further amendments could be adopted without the consent of Gabrielle or, if Gabrielle was deceased, the advisory committee. These amendments allegedly were drafted by Father Anthony Bannon of the Legion of Christ, at the request of Gabrielle, and were adopted by BOA as trustee.', 'On January 6, 1995, Gabrielle executed a codicil to her 1991 Will, in which she bequeathed 100 percent of the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust to the Legion of Christ. Effectively, the codicil excluded AUL from her will and combined their 10 percent bequest with the Legion of Christ’s 90 percent bequest. The residuary clause of the 1991 Will was not affected by this codicil.', '-7-', 'The Legion of Christ purchased a former IBM training complex in Westchester County, New York, known as “Thornwood,” in the fall of 1996. The purchase price for this property was $35 million.', 'The Legion of Christ was able to purchase Thornwood thanks in part to a $25 million loan and a $5 million revolving line of credit from BOA. When extending the loan and line of credit, a BOA officer relied on representations by the Legion of Christ that repayments would come from Gabrielle and the various trusts. In fact, beginning in January 1997, Gabrielle directed that income generated by the CRUT be directed to the Legion of Christ, rather than the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust.', 'This income represented approximately 50 percent of the debt service for the mortgage loan.', 'On February 23, 1997, The Hartford Courant published an article detailing scandals within the Legion of Christ, particularly concerning conduct by Father Maciel. According to the article, nine men had accused Father Maciel of sexually abusing them between the 1940s and 1960s. The victims also alleged that Father Maciel molested upwards of thirty boys during the same time period. The article also stated that Father Maciel was previously investigated— although cleared of any wrongdoing at the time—for abusing drugs, misusing money, and engaging in other improprieties.', 'It is unclear whether the Regnum Christi members were informed of these allegations and, if so, to what extent. What is clear is that Father Bannon apologized to BOA for not notifying it of the accusations before the report was published. The record is silent as to whether Gabrielle was personally notified of the accusations by Father Bannon or BOA.', 'On March 18, 1999, Gabrielle executed yet another codicil to her 1991 Will.

Mee Trust and The Timothy J. Mee Charitable Trust were amended on the same day and in like manner.', 'On December 14, 2000, Gabrielle executed a new will (2000 Will). The 2000 Will exercised her power of appointment over the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust in favor of the Legion of Christ and also left the residue of her estate to the Legion of Christ. The investment restrictions that were the subject of the 1999 codicil also were incorporated.', 'The major distinctions between the 1991 Will (and codicils executed thereafter) and the 2000 Will were that the residuary beneficiary was changed from the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust to the Legion of Christ and that the 2000 Will appointed Father Bannon as executor of the estate rather than BOA. However, BOA remained as an alternate executor. Father Bannon had previously been granted a durable power of attorney, authorizing him to represent Gabrielle in any discussions with BOA regarding the various trusts.', 'In December 2000, the Legion of Christ requested that BOA terminate the Gabrielle D. Mee Trust and distribute its res to The Timothy J. Mee Charitable Trust—of which the Legion of Christ was the sole beneficiary—in order to discharge its mortgage debt. In March 2001, before BOA could respond, Gabrielle and the Legion of Christ brought an action in the Superior Court, alleging that BOA breached its duty of loyalty by making the 1996 loans instead of taking principal out of the two trusts to fund the purchase of Thornwood. In the midst of the litigation, Gabrielle executed a codicil to her 2000 Will on September 20, 2002. The codicil revoked', '-9- BOA’s status as an alternate executor and named a Legion of Christ priest as the new alternate executor. 13 In August 2003, the parties reached a settlement that was approved by the Superior Court and the Attorney General, Division of Charitable Trusts. As part of the settlement, the Gabrielle D. Mee Trust was liquidated and The Timothy J. Mee Charitable Trust was amended and restated, such that it was due to terminate on December 31, 2042. Additionally, as part of the settlement, Gabrielle released BOA from any and all claims which were or which could have been brought before August 26, 2003.', 'On May 19, 2006, an official “Communiqué Concerning Founder of Legionaries of Christ” was issued by the press office of Pope Benedict XVI. The Communiqué publicized that misconduct allegations were lodged against Father Maciel beginning in 1998 and that, in 2001, then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger had authorized an investigation. Father Maciel retired from the Legion of Christ in 2005 after he was “invite[d] * * * to a reserved life of penitence and prayer, relinquishing any form of public ministry.” The Communiqué acknowledged the worthiness of the Legion of Christ despite Father Maciel’s transgressions. Father Maciel died on January 30, 2008.', 'Beginning in late 2006, Gabrielle directed a number of gifts to the Legion of Christ. In September 2006, she instructed BOA to distribute an additional $3,000 a month from her trust to the Legion of Christ. In December 2006, she made a $1,210,000 gift to the Legion of Christ from her personal account. In August 2007, she again made a $590,000 gift from her personal account to the Legion of Christ.

By stipulation of the parties, the will and codicil thereto were admitted to probate on February 4, 2010. On February 24, 2010, Dauray filed an appeal in the Superior Court. In December 2010, Dauray was deposed and asked for the basis of her challenge to the validity of the will. When asked about fraud as a basis for the challenge, Dauray testified that she wished “to take back the word fraud.” However, on May 11, 2011, Dauray moved to amend her reasons of appeal of the probate court to include allegations of fraud, deceit, and mistake by inducement. In a bench decision, the trial justice granted the motion to amend but did so by conditioning the filing of the amendment on the payment of “all legal fees and costs incurred * * * in connection with the preparation for and the taking of the deposition, and the preparation for and the hearing on the motion[.]” On November 17, 2011, the Superior Court justice entered an order directing Dauray to pay a total of $24,418 in legal', '- 11 - fees as a condition of the amendment. Dauray filed a motion requesting the court to vacate or reconsider the order, which was denied.', 'In May 2011, Dauray filed two additional lawsuits: one against the Legion of Christ seeking to recover gifts made by Gabrielle to the Legion of Christ during her lifetime; and the second against BOA, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties that BOA, as trustee, owed Gabrielle. The three cases were consolidated for the purposes of discovery. During her deposition and in her filings with the court, Dauray consistently declared that she was not seeking to recover any of Gabrielle’s assets for herself, but rather, wanted to ensure that the assets were distributed according to her aunt’s intentions.', 'Summary judgment motions on all three cases 14 were heard together in August 2012. The trial justice issued a written decision on September 7, 2012, granting summary judgment in favor of all defendants on the grounds that Dauray lacked standing to bring the actions.

The plaintiff argues that standing results from G.L. 1956 § 33-1-1, which provides that, when a person dies intestate with no surviving descendants, parents or siblings, the estate passes in equal portions to the descendants of the deceased’s siblings—the nieces and nephews of the intestate. It is undisputed that Dauray is Gabrielle’s next of kin; and, if intestacy were to result, Dauray would inherit from Gabrielle’s estate. Dauray asserts that the mere possibility that she may inherit through intestacy is sufficient to grant her standing to challenge the validity of the will.', 'Dauray argues that, in construing the facts in the light most favorable to her as the nonmoving party, as is required at summary judgment, the 2000 Will will be invalidated. Thus,', '- 13 - Dauray asserts that the 1991 Will controls the administration of Gabrielle’s estate. However, she argues that only a portion of that will is valid. According to Dauray, the 10 percent bequest to AUL of the 1991 Will is valid and enforceable, but the 90 percent bequest to the Legion of Christ fails because, she alleges, that bequest also was obtained by undue influence and fraud. Therefore, Dauray asserts that the 90 percent bequest would fall into the residuary clause. See Smith v. Ahearn, 52 R.I. 346, 348, 161 A. 117, 118 (1932) (holding that a void bequest passes to the residue of the estate). According to Dauray, “the Legion [of Christ] was also named the residuary beneficiary of [Gabrielle’s] 1991 will. In Rhode Island, where the residuary clause of a will fails, the estate must pass by the laws of intestacy.” Under this scenario, Dauray asserts that partial intestacy would result, and thus, as an heir-at-law, she has standing to challenge the validity of the will.', 'Conversely, the Legion of Christ argues that Dauray has no standing to challenge the validity of the will because she has not suffered any injury in fact. The Legion of Christ cites to Dauray’s own statements—which the Superior Court relied upon—that she disavowed any personal interest in Gabrielle’s estate, but rather, wanted to assure that Gabrielle’s estate goes to charities that were consistent with Gabrielle’s desires. 15', 'However, were this Court to adopt Dauray’s premise on standing—that the 1991 Will controls the distribution of her estate due to undue influence and fraud—Dauray still lacks standing to pursue this action because there simply is no legitimate path to partial intestacy. As Dauray argues, the invalidity of a will procured as a result of undue influence does not revoke a prior will that properly was executed. See Reese v. Court of Probate of Newport, 9 R.I. 434, 435 15', 'Because we conclude that Dauray does not have standing without reaching the issue of her purported “disavowal,” we decline to address that portion of the trial justice’s decision. Additionally, we decline to address the issue of cy pres for the same reason.', '- 14 - (1870); see also 25 A.L.R.2d 657 (1952). Accordingly, as Dauray asserts, if the 2000 Will were invalidated, the 1991 Will would control. Further, if, as Dauray contends, the 90 percent bequest to the Legion of Christ was invalid due to undue influence or fraud, then that bequest would pass to the residuary beneficiary. See Smith, 52 R.I. at 348, 161 A. at 118; Todd v. St. Mary’s Church, Portsmouth, R.I., 45 R.I. 282, 285, 120 A. 577, 578 (1923).', 'However, Dauray’s characterization of the residuary clause of the 1991 Will is incorrect. The residuary clause does not name the Legion of Christ as the beneficiary—as Dauray submits—but rather, the 1991 Will states: “I give all the residue of my estate * * * to the trustee then serving under the [Gabrielle Mee Revocable] Trust.” Thus, the residuary clause of the 1991 Will would not lapse, and it would be impossible for intestacy to occur. 16', 'At the time of Gabrielle’s death, the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust was to terminate and pour over into the Foundation, which was later renamed The Timothy J. Mee Charitable Trust— assuming any assets remained after Gabrielle exercised her power of appointment. The Timothy J. Mee Charitable Trust has a number of potential Legion of Christ-related beneficiaries, but should they all fail, then the trust was to benefit The Papal Foundation, and if not The Papal Foundation, then an organization determined by the trustee. Thus, even if the Legion of Christ procured its bequests by exerting undue influence over Gabrielle, Dauray still has no possibility of inheriting because The Papal Foundation would take as an alternate beneficiary of The Timothy J. Mee Charitable Trust. See In re Estate of Lewis, 411 So.2d 368, 370-71 (Fla. Dist. 16', 'Of note, although perhaps irrelevant to the current standing analysis, is that at the time the 1991 Will was first executed, the residue was to go to the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust and then to the Foundation. The Foundation, at this time, was “exclusively administered and operated for charitable purposes” and did not name any specific beneficiaries. It was not until 1994 that the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust and the Foundation were amended to benefit the Legion of Christ. Thus, at the time of the execution of the 1991 Will, the residuary clause would inure to the benefit of “charitable purposes” through administration of the Foundation.', '- 15 - Ct. App. 1982) (“The basic question to be answered is: Will the widow derive some pecuniary or other beneficial interest if she successfully contests and avoids the other devise? If she will benefit she has standing, and if she will not, then she has none.”); In re Estate of Prynn, 315 A.2d 265, 267 (Pa. 1974) (“If any specific bequest in the 1970 will were found invalid, nothing would prevent it from passing by the residuary clause.', 'Accordingly, the heirs could in no circumstances benefit from the invalidity of any bequest provided by the 1970 will. Since the heirs cannot benefit, they have no standing to object.”).', 'Our careful examination of the record before us demonstrates that the assets from the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust would pour over to The Timothy J. Mee Charitable Trust, and BOA, the trustees in 1991, would make distributions in accordance with the trust instruments. The terms of the trust provided for a series of alternative beneficiaries, including The Papal Foundation, which was not a Legion of Christ-related entity. Additionally, according to the terms of the trust, “[n]either the income nor the assets of [The Timothy J. Mee Charitable] Trust shall ever inure to the benefit of the [s]ettlor or any other private person.” (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, because there was a valid and enforceable residuary clause, there was never a possibility that intestacy would result, even if the allegations of undue influence and fraud were proven.', 'Dauray points to our opinion in Spooner v. Tucker, 86 R.I. 266, 134 A.2d 403 (1957) as support for her contention that she need only show that, should intestacy result from a will contest, she would take as an heir-at-law, not the likelihood that intestacy would result. We note that Spooner concerned an appeal by the heirs-at-law from the denial of a motion to intervene in the action, in which this Court addressed the issue of standing. We stated:', '“This is not to say, however, that where a motion is made', 'to dismiss an appeal for want of [standing] on the ground the', '- 16 -', 'prospective appellant is not a ‘person aggrieved’ within the', 'meaning of the statute, he will not be required to prove the', '[standing] allegations, that is, the truth of the allegations of the', 'circumstances upon which he relies in claiming to be a ‘person', 'aggrieved.’” Id. at 271-72, 134 A.2d at 406. In the case before us, Dauray asserts that she is an interested party as a result of a lapsed residuary clause in the 1991 Will. However, she makes this argument by mischaracterizing the actual residuary bequest. Thus, even if the bequest to the Legion of Christ in the 1991 Will were to fail, the residuary clause of the 1991 Will provides that any lapsed gift be directed to the Gabrielle Mee Revocable Trust. Because there is no possibility that Dauray would take, she cannot be a person aggrieved.', 'The rule adopted by Spooner, and later applied in Apollonio v. Kenyon, 101 R.I. 578, 586-87, 225 A.2d 778, 783 (1967), that an heir-at-law seeking to challenge a will need only prove that he or she would be eligible to inherit should intestacy result, does not, by itself, confer standing if it can be shown that a probate appellant has no interest in the estate. Once it becomes obvious that there no longer exists a justiciable question by a person with a stake in the outcome, the litigation may not continue. Such a situation was considered by this Court in Insana v. Rhode Island Hospital Trust Co., 110 R.I. 476, 294 A.2d 181 (1972). In Insana, the heirs-at-law sought to intervene in the same manner as the heirs-at-law in Spooner. The Court stated that:', '“the Superior Court must first determine upon motion that ‘[w]here', 'a person seeks to be added as a party appellant when a[] [probate]', 'appeal is pending and thereby seeks to become a party to that', '[probate] appeal, he must establish that he has an interest in the', 'estate and that he is aggrieved by the decree. The burden of', 'showing this is on the [party seeking to intervene].’” Insana, 110', 'R.I at 477, 294 A.2d at 182 (quoting Spooner, 86 R.I. at 273, 134', 'A.2d at 407 (emphasis added)). This Court declared that “[t]he purported intervenors have not * * * even alleged that they have the status of interested parties, which is necessary to bring them before the Superior Court.” Id.', '- 17 - (emphasis added). In these circumstances, Dauray has failed to produce evidence demonstrating that the residuary clause of the 1991 Will would lapse resulting in distribution under the laws of intestacy. Accordingly, Dauray has not suffered an injury in fact and there no longer remains “a justiciable question as to [her] right to share in the deceased’s estate.” Apollonio, 101 R.I. at 587, 225 A.2d at 783.', 'Our brief survey of other jurisdictions supports this reasoning as the generally accepted manner to determine standing in a will contest. See Annot. 64 A.L.R.3d 261, § 2(a) (1975) (“It has been held in a number of cases that the residuary clause of the will involved therein would not be invalidated by undue influence exerted as to some other portion of the instrument, such determination often being made in the course of the court’s holding that heirs[-]at[-]law had no standing to challenge any portion of the will other than the residuary clause if the latter was assumed to be valid.” (emphasis added)).', 'In Batt v. Vittum, 30 N.E.2d 394 (Mass. 1940), the appellant and heir-at-law of the testatrix challenged the validity of a will that contained four numbered paragraphs. Paragraphs one and two of the will were bequests to an educational institution. Paragraph three of the will was a residuary clause that provided: “[a]ll the rest, residue, and remainder of my estate, of whatever nature or sort, and wherever the same may be situated * * * I give, devise, and bequeath to my dear friend, Miss. A. Laura Batt.” Id. at 395. The residual legatee under paragraph three was named the executor in paragraph four. When the will was presented for probate, lines had been drawn through paragraphs one and two in their entirety and through the words “the rest, residue, and remainder of” in paragraph three. The appellant argued that paragraphs one and two of the will had been revoked. However, the court determined that the appellant had', '- 18 -', '“no standing to make this contention unless the effect of paragraph', 'numbered [three] as a residuary clause has been destroyed. If its', 'effect as such a clause ha[d] not been destroyed the appellant as an', 'heir-at-law and next of kin of the deceased w[ould] take nothing', 'from her estate whether or not paragraphs numbered [one] and', '[two] have been revoked.” Id. at 395 (emphasis added).', 'Similarly, in In re Carothers’ Estate, 150 A. 585 (Pa. 1930), the appellant—who was an heir-at-law of the deceased—challenged a certain specific legacy as procured by undue influence. The will included several such legacies, including a bequest to the appellant, and also a residuary clause that left the residue to a nursing home. Id. at 585. The court determined that, even if the appellant was successful in striking down the specific bequests, she would receive nothing because she was not a residuary legatee. Id. at 586. Thus, the court concluded that:', '“[w]here the contestant to a will which is void in part receives no', 'benefit from the contest, he is not entitled either to sustain a caveat', 'or to take an appeal from the action of the court below; therefore', 'he has no interest in the distribution. * * * A party who has no', 'interest in the distribution is not a ‘person aggrieved,’ and cannot', 'take an appeal under this act.” Id.', 'Moreover, in In re Estate of Molera, 100 Cal. Rptr. 696 (Cal. Ct. App. 1972), the appellant, who was an heir-at-law of the deceased, sought to invalidate certain bequests that were made to the son and daughter of the attorney who had drafted the will of the deceased as procured by undue influence. The will at issue included a residuary clause that named four hospitals as the residuary beneficiaries. Observing that there existed valid residuary legatees that would take if the devises to the attorney’s children were deemed void, the court stated: “[a]ppellants as heirs under the intestacy laws would not * * * be entitled to any part of such lapsed or void devise.” Id. at 702. The court concluded that “appellants have not shown that they have a direct contingent pecuniary interest in the devolution of the testatrix’s estate * * *.” Id.; see also In re Land’s Estate, 137 P. 246, 248 (Cal. 1913) (“[O]rdinarily a petition showing that', '- 19 - the contestant is an heir[-]at[-]law of the deceased sufficiently shows the requisite interest to contest a will. As we have seen, however, the heir[-]at[-]law may be without such right by reason of other facts.”).', 'Our conclusion today also recognizes the long-standing presumption under our law that intestacy is disfavored, especially in the face of a valid residuary clause. See Industrial National Bank of Rhode Island v. Glocester Manton Free Public Library of Glocester, Rhode Island, 107 R.I. 161, 169, 265 A.2d 724, 728 (1970). In Glocester Manton, this Court held that “the avoidance of intestacy is favored, especially when the partial intestacy relates to the residuary estate. This is so because it is assumed that, when a person makes a will, he intends to dispose of his entire estate.” Id. To avoid the possibility of intestacy in Glocester Manton, this Court concluded that a lapsed residuary bequest was to be distributed among the remaining residuary beneficiaries, as opposed to the heirs-at-law of the testatrix, even though the remaining residual legatees were not within the purview of the contemplated statute that permitted such a distribution. Id. at 170-71, 265 A.2d at 729.', 'Statutory Standing', 'Dauray next claims that she has standing to bring claims on behalf of the estate to recover assets for the estate pursuant to § 33-18-17. Dauray argues that, as a person “legally interested in the estate of a deceased person,” she may bring suit to challenge inter vivos gifts made by Gabrielle to the Legion of Christ that were procured by fraud and undue influence. Furthermore, Dauray contends that, because a claim for breach of fiduciary duty survives death, the claim is an asset of the estate that she has standing to recover.', 'The defendants argue that Dauray lacks standing in accordance with § 33-18-17 because under no circumstances would the property at issue benefit Dauray or the other heirs-at-law.', '- 20 - Rather, defendants argue that, if any of the property were to be recovered, it would go to a charity based upon Gabrielle’s clear desires and intent—the same result, we note, that Dauray purportedly seeks to effectuate by bringing these claims. The defendants contend that Dauray is not a person legally interested in the estate because she has suffered no injury in fact, since there was never any possibility that she would inherit from Gabrielle’s estate.', 'Section 33-18-17 provides:', '“If an administrator, executor, or guardian shall be', 'requested by any person legally interested in the estate of a', 'deceased person * * * to commence an action or proceeding to', 'recover any property, personal or real, which the legally interested', 'person may have reason to believe should be recovered for the', 'benefit of the estate, and if the administrator, executor, or guardian', 'shall * * * refuse, neglect or for any reason be incompetent, to', 'commence the action or proceeding, the legally interested person', 'may institute proceedings in the name of the estate of the deceased', 'person, or person under guardianship, in the same manner and to', 'the same extent as the administrator, executor, or guardian may do', 'in the case of personal property, and in the case of real estate in the', 'same manner as a guardian, devisee, or heir at law may do, to', 'recover the property.”', 'We are satisfied that § 33-18-17 does not vest Dauray with standing because she is not a “person legally interested in the estate.” As discussed above, because there is no possibility of intestacy resulting, Dauray has no interest in her aunt’s estate. See In re Estate of Molera, 100 Cal. Rptr. at 702; Batt, 30 N.E.2d at 395; In re Estate of Prynn, 315 A.2d at 267. Since Dauray does not have a legal interest in the estate, she cannot bring a claim pursuant to § 33-18-17.', 'Accordingly, we affirm the trial justice’s decision as to plaintiff’s lack of standing.', 'Attorneys’ Fees', 'Dauray asserts that it was an abuse of discretion for the trial justice to impose attorneys’ fees as a condition for Dauray to amend her reasons for appeal of the probate court decision. Dauray contends that the statute that the trial justice relied upon, § 33-23-1(a)(2), does not', '- 21 - provide statutory authority to impose attorneys’ fees and that, by doing so, the trial justice ran afoul of this Court’s pronouncements concerning our adherence to the traditional “American Rule” 17 with respect to imposition of attorneys’ fees.', 'The defendants in the will contest action argue that the imposition of attorneys’ fees by the trial justice was proper. Initially, defendants contend that § 33-23-1(a)(2) provides the requisite statutory authority for the imposition of attorneys’ fees because the statute states: “unless, for cause shown, and with or without terms, the [S]uperior [C]ourt shall allow amendments and additions thereto.” (Emphasis added.) According to defendants, an award of attorneys’ fees falls within the scope of the phrase “with or without terms.” The defendants also argue that the trial justice was acting within his sound discretion when he imposed fees in this instance, noting that the trial justice declared that the addition of a fraud claim “seem[ed] to fly in the face of testimony adduced from the appellant during the course of [her] deposition.”', '“The issue of whether there exists a basis for awarding attorneys’ fees generally is legal in nature, and therefore our review of such a ruling is de novo.” Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island v. Najarian, 911 A.2d 706, 709 (R.I. 2006). “Only if it is determined that there is such a basis, then this Court will review a motion justice’s actual award of attorneys’ fees for an abuse of discretion.” Id. (citing Kells v. Town of Lincoln, 874 A.2d 204, 214 (R.I. 2005)).', 'Initially, we are skeptical that § 33-23-1(a)(2) provides the requisite statutory authority to impose attorneys’ fees.', 'The defendants’ contention—and by extension the trial justice’s determination—that the phrase “with or without terms” encompasses attorneys’ fees is debatable. In Waldeck v. Piner, 488 A.2d 1218, 1220 (R.I. 1985), we declared that attorneys’ fees were not 17', 'The “American Rule” provides that, apart from some exceptions, litigants bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs absent contractual liability or statutory authority. See Moore v. Ballard, 914 A.2d 487, 489 (R.I. 2007).', '- 22 - contemplated by the term “costs” and that “[a]bsent express statutory authority, counsel fees are not awardable as part of the costs of litigation.” However, for purposes of the present appeal, we will assume, and not decide, that § 33-23-1(a)(2) supplies the requisite statutory authority for the award of attorneys’ fees. We nevertheless conclude that the trial justice abused his discretion in ordering that Dauray pay attorneys’ fees for “all reasonable legal fees and costs incurred by the [defendants] in connection with the preparation for and the taking of the [plaintiff’s] deposition, and the preparation for and the hearing on the [m]otion to [a]mend[.]” At the time the fees were awarded, plaintiff had been deposed by defendants.', 'By motion to the trial justice, Dauray sought to add fraud as a basis of appeal from the probate court. The defendants argued before the Superior Court justice that they would be prejudiced by this amendment because it “would require the taking of further discovery and may require the retaking of [plaintiff’s] deposition.” However, the fee award by the trial justice was entirely retrospective, requiring Dauray to pay for depositions that already had taken place. If the award were to be applied prospectively—that is for any costs that would be incurred as a result of the amendment, such as a future deposition of Dauray regarding fraud as a basis for appeal—then it may have been an exercise of the trial justice’s sound discretion. As this Court has held:', '“discretion is not exercised by merely granting or denying a party’s', 'request.

Carter,', '121 R.I. 1, 4-5, 393 A.2d 1102, 1105 (1978). It is our considered opinion that the imposition of retrospective attorneys’ fees, in this case, does not comport to what is “right and equitable under the circumstances and the law.” Id. at 5, 393', '- 23 - A.2d at 1105. Therefore, we vacate the decision of the trial justice requiring the plaintiff to pay attorneys’ fees in order to amend her reasons for appeal of the probate court decision.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court in part and vacate in part.

55,State : v. : Victor Arciliares. :,non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Victor Arciliares, appeals from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury trial in Providence County Superior Court. The defendant was found guilty of five offenses, most notably murder in the first degree of Alfredo Barros, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1. This case came before the Supreme Court for argument on October 29, 2014. The defendant contends that the trial justice erred when he curtailed the extent to which the defendant was allowed to cross-examine a key police witness. The defendant claims that the exclusion of the proffered evidence was reversible error and merits a new trial.', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we agree, vacate the defendant’s convictions, and remand the case to the Superior Court for a new trial.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 30, 2010, at about 3 a.m., Alfredo “Pauly” Barros was shot and killed as he sat behind the wheel of a motor vehicle at a Pawtucket intersection. In Barros’s car were two', '-1- passengers, one of whom, Ruben Gomes, was injured in the shooting. That night, during the course of their investigation, Pawtucket police discovered several shell casings at the intersection of George and Marrin Streets, but they recovered no weapon, nor was any weapon ever presented at trial. The passengers in Barros’s car each gave statements to police. Each of them mentioned a black BMW from which shots were fired. However, as was the case with the weapon, that vehicle was never located.', 'The homicide investigation soon focused on a Shell gas station on Thurbers Avenue in Providence, because police had obtained information that Barros and his passengers may have been involved in an “altercation” there earlier that evening. The investigation dragged out over several months, but by June 2011, eight months later, no arrests had been made. However, a break in the case finally arose when the lead detective, Det. Richard LaForest, 1 received a call from an investigator at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) informing him that an inmate had information about the Barros murder. Ultimately, that jailhouse informant would provide information that would implicate defendant as the shooter in the October 30, 2010 murder.', 'Indictment and Trial', 'On May 30, 2012, after hearing testimony from the informant, a grand jury returned a seven-count indictment arising out of the shooting. 2 The six counts against defendant were counts: (1) murder in the first degree of Alfredo Barros, in violation of § 11-23-1; (2) discharging a firearm while committing a violent crime, the murder of Alfredo Barros, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-47-3.2; (3) discharging a firearm from a motor vehicle in a manner 1', 'Among the parties’ briefs, trial exhibits, and grand jury transcripts, Det. LaForest’s last name is spelled variably as, “LaForest” and “Laforest.” For consistency, we will use “LaForest.” 2', 'All except count 6 pertained to defendant. In count 6 of indictment No. P1/12-1521BG, it was alleged that Rolando Rojas did murder Alfredo Barros, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-23-1. Rojas and Arciliares were not tried together; therefore, neither Rojas nor count 6 of the indictment have any relevance to this appeal.', '-2- that created a substantial risk of death to Ruben Gomes, in violation of § 11-47-51.1; (4) assault with intent to murder Ruben Gomes, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-1; (5) use of a firearm in the attempted commission of a violent crime resulting in an injury to Ruben Gomes, in violation of § 11-47-3.2; and (7) conspiracy to do an unlawful act, to wit, murder, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-1-6.', 'On January 17, 2013, a jury trial began before a justice of the Superior Court. The state called Dr. Priya Banerjee, an Assistant Medical Examiner, who testified that the manner of death was homicide by gunshot wounds. In her testimony, the medical examiner made use of a number of autopsy photographs. One image was a color photograph that depicted the dissected heart and lungs of the victim. The defendant objected to this photograph. At sidebar, defense counsel called the photograph “really, really gruesome,” and said, “the only purpose for bringing [it] in is to inflame and to prejudice the jury unnecessarily.”', 'The state argued that the photograph was necessary to show the trajectory of the bullet and to prove there was only one shooter involved. The trial justice found the state’s argument convincing and said, “[a]s far as autopsy photographs are concerned, I would suggest to you this one is pretty tame, and I’m going to overrule the objection.” The photograph entered evidence as trial exhibit No. 19.', 'The state also presented the testimony of several witnesses who had been present at the scene of the Barros murder. Those witnesses included Ptlm. Justin Gould of the Pawtucket Police Department, as well as Ruben Gomes and Jason DaCruz, the two passengers in Barros’s car. Lastly, the state presented the core of its case; the testimony of Det. LaForest and Raymond Baccaire, the cooperating witness, who recounted defendant’s alleged jailhouse confession. The defendant alleges that it was during the testimony of Det. LaForest that the error of law occurred.', '-3-', 'Detective LaForest’s Testimony', 'Detective LaForest was called to the scene of the Barros murder early on that October morning and was in charge of the investigation that followed.', 'In that investigation, Det. LaForest visited the Thurbers Avenue Shell station, from which Barros’s car had traveled, seeking video surveillance footage from the night of the murder. Detective LaForest went to retrieve the video because he had received information that “there was an altercation with the deceased at that Shell station.” Detective LaForest testified that the video showed that there had been between 50 and 100 people at the Shell station that night, including three Providence police officers who had responded to an earlier fight that did not involve Barros or his passengers. Detective LaForest testified that, when he culled the video, he was able to confirm that defendant was among the crowd at the Shell station that evening. The state later introduced at trial a photograph of defendant from that video. The detective said he was familiar with defendant’s appearance because he had been “in the presence of [defendant],” on May 17, 2011. 3 Another photograph from that evening showed defendant standing outside at the gas pumps with a man named Rolando Rojas and another man. A third photograph showed Rojas getting into a black BMW automobile, but that picture did not include either defendant or the third man from the earlier picture.', 'Detective LaForest then testified about his meeting with Raymond Baccaire, the cellmate of defendant, who contended that defendant had admitted to him that he was the shooter in the Barros murder. That meeting was prompted by information Det. LaForest had received from ACI Special Investigator Nuno Figueiredo. Investigator Figueiredo relayed to Det. LaForest that Baccaire had information about a homicide. Detective LaForest denied that he had revealed to 3', 'On this day, May 17, 2011, defendant was confined to the ACI on an unrelated charge.', '-4- Investigator Figueiredo anything beyond “just the basic” facts of the Barros murder. Detective LaForest’s meeting with Baccaire occurred on June 7, 2011, and, until that time, the investigation was simply “ongoing,” and no arrests had been made. 4', 'On cross-examination, Det. LaForest admitted that in his review of the gas station video, he did not see any “altercation” between the members of Barros’s car and defendant, even though he had looked for one. The defendant’s counsel then brought up Det. LaForest’s May 17, 2011, meeting with defendant. 5 Detective LaForest testified that he remembered the meeting that had taken place at the ACI, but the state objected to defendant’s next question. 6 At sidebar, defense counsel proffered the evidence that she hoped she would elicit from Det. LaForest: that what had transpired at his meeting with Arciliares may have been “one of the sources of Baccaire’s information about the crime.” 7 Defense counsel said, “I’m not going to ask [Det. 4', 'At that time, little information about the investigation had been released publically. Detective LaForest testified on direct examination:', '“Q: And because this investigation was ongoing by the time that you met with', 'Mr. Baccaire, and no arrests had been made, to your knowledge, had any of that', 'documentation been released outside of the Pawtucket Police Department or the', 'State of Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office?', '“[Defense Counsel]: Objection.', '“[Trial Justice]: Overruled.', '“A: No, it was not.” 5', 'From the cross-examination of Det. LaForest:', '“Q: Now, when you had met—I think you testified that you had met my client,', 'Victor Arciliares, at the ACI on May 17th of 2011; correct?', '“A: I did state that, yes.” 6', 'From the cross-examination of Det. LaForest:', '“Q: And you went there to talk to Mr. Arciliares that day, didn’t you?', '“[Assistant Attorney General]: Objection.', '“[Trial Justice]: Let’s have a conference.” 7', 'Defense counsel’s argument at sidebar was that at that meeting:', '-5- LaForest] what my client said.” The Assistant Attorney General disagreed saying, “it would in a sense be almost a Harnois issue.” 8 See State v. Harnois, 638 A.2d 532, 535-36 (R.I. 1994) (holding that the defendant had a right to refuse to testify, but adding that “[h]e may not testify by other means, including by way of the unsworn statements made to police”). The prosecutor also suggested that any subsequent questioning on the ACI meeting on cross-examination would be outside the scope of direct examination, because on direct Det. LaForest never specifically said the meeting was at the ACI, simply that he had at one time seen defendant. 9 At this point, the trial justice sustained the objection to the question, not specifying whether his ruling was predicated on this Court’s holding in Harnois or that it exceeded the scope of direct examination. The cross-examination of Det. LaForest continued, with the detective testifying that no murder weapon was ever found, that no black BMW specified by witnesses and seen on the gas station video was ever located, and that no connection was ever established by the police between', '“Victor saw photographs, the photographs from the Shell station. This is one of', 'the things that I think Baccaire will testify to, that he spoke with my client about', 'it, and it is our position that this is one of the sources of Baccaire’s information', 'about the crime. I’m not going to ask him what my client said, as if I want to ask', '[defendant] through this witness.” 8', 'In full, the prosecutor said:', '“My position is that if she wants that evidence spread on the record, it would in a', 'sense be almost a Harnois issue. She’s trying to get in through this detective the', 'fact that Mr. Arciliares saw photographs, and then use that fact almost as a', 'substitute for the defendant’s testimony.” 9', 'The prosecutor’s argument and the ruling by the trial justice was as follows:', '“[Defense counsel]: Judge, the witness brought it up. I think he mentioned May', '17th, meeting with my client, and I’m entitled to ask.', '“[Assistant Attorney General]: On direct he didn’t say where he had seen it. It', 'was the question of, did you have occasion to see Mr. Arciliares prior to trial, and', 'he said May 17th, and specifically stayed away from the fact [defendant] was in', 'prison.', '“[Trial Justice]: I think I’m going to sustain the objection at this point. Later on,', 'if something evolves that would invite this, we’ll take another look at it.”', '-6- Barros or the occupants of his car and defendant. The May 17 meeting was not discussed further and, after a brief re-direct examination, the state called another witness.', 'Baccaire’s Testimony', 'The state then called Raymond Baccaire to the stand.', 'The prosecutor began his examination with a lengthy recitation of Baccaire’s extensive criminal record and elicited from the witness that he had been incarcerated at the ACI in May 2011. Baccaire testified that, while he was housed at the ACI, he was familiar with defendant from recreation time among the general population. Baccaire also testified that he and defendant had become acquaintances, through meals and playing cards. According to Baccaire, he told defendant about his family and “what I got charged with, what I did wrong, and stuff like that.” In their conversations, Baccaire said defendant revealed the shooting incident in Pawtucket, saying that it started with “a fight that took place at a Shell gas station * * * they started arguing, and they came out, they had words, and they got in the car and left.”', 'Later, Baccaire and defendant became cellmates, spending almost eighteen hours a day together confined to their cell. Baccaire testified that, after they became cellmates, defendant began to reveal more details about the Barros shooting. Baccaire recounted that defendant said that he had gotten into an argument inside the Shell station and that the confrontation escalated outside, at which point defendant got into a BMW 745 and proceeded to follow Barros’ car as it proceeded out of the station’s lot. Baccaire testified that defendant said a highway chase began, but that defendant quickly exited the highway to get his hands on a weapon, “somewhere off the [highway]. I don’t know if it was the Chad Brown area,” because while he was at the Shell station, “[defendant said he] had nothing on him at the time.” Baccaire testified that defendant told him that they got back on the highway, exited in Pawtucket and “they spotted [Barros’s] car,', '-7- and they couldn’t believe they found them.” Baccaire said that defendant told him that at this point “[t]hey pulled up to the side and shot through—shot through the windows of the vehicle.” Baccaire went on to recount the cooperation agreement that he had entered into with the Attorney General’s Office, conceding when pressed by defense counsel, that he was “trying to help [himself] get out of the ACI.” Nonetheless, Baccaire maintained that his testimony had been truthful. After the testimony of Baccaire, the state rested its case. 10', 'Attempt to Recall Detective LaForest', 'On January 23, 2013, defendant made an effort to recall Det. LaForest as a witness in his case-in-chief for the purpose of asking the detective questions about the May 17, 2011 meeting, questions which defendant had been precluded from asking on cross-examination. Outside the hearing of the jury, the trial justice said that the state’s objection to Det. LaForest’s testimony “is probably well-founded,” but allowed defense counsel to place an offer of proof on the record. 11 Defense counsel stated she wished to question Det. LaForest “in a very limited scope,” about the ACI meeting at which Det. LaForest questioned defendant about details of the Barros murder. 12 10', 'At the close of the state’s evidence, the trial justice granted an acquittal on the conspiracy count, count 7, pursuant to defendant’s motion under Rule 29(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. An acquittal may be ordered by a trial justice when “after the evidence on either side is closed, if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of such an offense or offenses.” Id. 11', 'After returning from a brief recess after the close of the state’s evidence, the trial justice began:', '“[Trial Justice]: All right. I had an [sic] a brief conference with counsel. [The', 'defendant’s attorney] wants to recall Detective LaForest, and I have indicated to', 'her that the State’s objection to doing what she wants to do is probably well-', 'founded. You can place it on the record properly, if you want.” 12', 'Defense counsel’s offer of proof was as follows:', '“I would seek to recall Detective LaForest to the stand to testify in a very limited', 'scope regarding his visit to the ACI on May [17th] of 2011 to interview my client,', 'Victor Arciliares, regarding this homicide. * * * In the course of that interview,', '-8- Initially, defendant contended that Det. LaForest went to the ACI to “talk to [defendant] as a witness, not as a suspect.” The state objected, citing Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, and arguing that whether the detective viewed defendant as either a suspect or a witness was an opinion of which the relevance “seems tenuous and can lead to confusion in the minds of the jurors.” 13 The trial justice agreed, sustaining the state’s objection. The defendant then offered additional reasoning for the testimony; that Det. LaForest’s disclosing of the investigation’s information to defendant was a possible way Baccaire got the “shreds of fact” with which to testify that defendant was involved with the murder. Defense counsel argued that defendant may have learned details of the murder from Det. LaForest, and then relayed them to Baccaire, because, “the May 17, 2011 interview by [Det.] LaForest, and my client’s comments regarding that interview by Baccaire, are an alternative source [for the facts Baccaire testified to].” 14 The trial justice did not agree, saying simply, “I disagree with you. I won’t permit him to testify to that.” Detective LaForest was not recalled to the stand.', 'Detective LaForest showed my client photographs from—taken from the Shell', 'station video * * * . What I am after is the fact that Detective LaForest went to', 'the ACI to interview my client shortly prior to Baccaire coming forward as a', 'witness * * * that Detective LaForest showed my client photographs from the', 'Shell station video, and questioned him about the events at the Shell station that', 'evening. That’s what I’m after.” 13', 'Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence states in part, “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury * * * .” 14', 'Defense counsel’s offer of proof continued:', '“It is the defense’s position that my client’s comments to Baccaire, and', 'you’ll recall Baccaire testifying regarding my client talking about the police', 'coming to the ACI to interview him, are an alternative source of the shreds of fact', 'that Baccaire has used to weave the tapestry of his testimony. The State has made', 'quite clear that it intends to argue that there is no alternative source for the threads', 'used to weave that tapestry, and I would submit that the May 17, 2011 interview', 'by [Det.] LaForest, and my client’s comments regarding that interview by', '-9-', 'Closing Arguments and Post-Verdict Proceedings', 'After being thwarted in his attempt to call Det. LaForest as a witness, defendant’s case- in-chief was succinct; he briefly recalled Ptlm. Gould for the purpose of having the officer testify that, when he arrived on the scene, passenger Jason DaCruz initially told him that the shooter’s vehicle was a “black Cherokee,” which contradicted the testimony DaCruz had given during the state’s case. Closing arguments began, and in the state’s closing the prosecutor asked repeatedly, “[h]ow did [Baccaire] have access to all of this information? * * * How could Mr. Baccaire have possibly known[?]” The prosecutor went on, “[h]ow could [Baccaire] have known, except by hearing it from someone who was there, someone who acknowledged being at the Shell station and was at the Shell station?” The prosecutor concluded by saying it was defendant’s words, conveyed through Baccaire, that built the “wall of evidence * * * so high, so thick, he cannot scale it.”', 'On the same day, counts 1 through 5 went to the jury for deliberation.', 'During deliberation, the jury sent a note to the trial justice, informing him that “[w]e are at a point when we cannot arrive at a unanimous verdict,” indicating that it was how Baccaire had gotten his information and “if some or all was from another source,” that was vexing the panel. 15 The next day, January 25, 2013, the trial justice addressed the question by delivering an Allen charge, a standard jury instruction designed to assist juries that claim to be at a deadlock. Allen v. United', 'Baccaire, are an alternative source. So the [trial justice’s] ruling is preventing me', 'from laying the factual foundation for that argument.” 15', 'The note was written by the foreperson on the afternoon of January 24, 2013, the second day of deliberation; it read:', '“We are at a point when we cannot arrive at a unanimous verdict. We are', 'currently at an 11-1 impasse. The issue is the information given to Mr. Baccaire', 'and if he was given all of this by the defendant or if some or all was from another', 'source.”', '- 10 - States, 164 U.S. 492, 501 (1896) (upholding a trial justice’s encouragement of jurors to listen to the opinions of other jurors to resolve a deadlock). The defendant objected, arguing that the proper thing to do would be to declare a mistrial. The trial justice disagreed and imparted the charge, noting that the language he employed had been approved by this Court in State v. Rodriguez, 822 A.2d 894, 899-904 (R.I. 2003). The same afternoon, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts.', 'On February 1, 2013, a hearing was held on defendant’s motion for a new trial, under the provisions of Rule 33 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. 16 In his motion, defendant argued that the refusal to allow Det. LaForest to testify about what he told defendant at their meeting at the ACI was an error of law worthy of a new trial. Defense counsel again articulated why she should have been allowed to question Det. LaForest, urging that the trial justice’s “decision not to permit [Det.

First, defendant argues that the refusal to allow him to question Det. LaForest about the May 17, 2011, meeting he had with defendant, wherein the detective discussed the details of the investigation, was reversible error that merits a new trial. Next, defendant contends that the trial justice erred when he gave an Allen charge to the deadlocked jury instead of declaring a mistrial. Third, defendant finds error in the admission of an autopsy photograph of the victim’s heart and lungs, which he contends was inflammatory and therefore unduly prejudicial. Lastly, defendant', '- 13 - contends that the trial justice erred in not granting his motion for a new trial because the jury’s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. In reviewing the four arguments made by defendant, we find error only in the first. It is our opinion that the trial justice erred when he restricted defendant from questioning Det. LaForest about what Det. LaForest said during his interview with defendant. Accordingly, we vacate the conviction and remand for a new trial. 18', 'The Proffered Evidence was Relevant', 'Cross-examination is perhaps the most powerful tool with which a criminal defendant may extract hints of bias, show a lack of credibility, or impeach portions of the existing evidence against him.', 'Cross-examination is not boundless; questions posed to a witness must be calculated to obtain evidence that is relevant, meaning that it has “any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” State v. Brown, 42 A.3d 1239, 1244 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence). The defendant contends that the testimony of Det. LaForest about the ACI meeting is relevant because, as counsel put on the record at sidebar, Det. LaForest “questioned [defendant] about the events” leading up to the Barros murder. The defendant argues that this is relevant because it tends to undermine the basis of the state’s theory: that Baccaire knew certain undisclosed details of the Barros murder only because defendant was the shooter and he divulged those details to Baccaire. We agree with defendant that the evidence was relevant, because, if believed by the trier of fact, it tended to make the state’s theory less probable, in that it suggests that Det. LaForest’s interview with 18', 'Though we vacate the convictions and remand for a new trial, based on the first alleged error, we are aware that there may be further proceedings in this matter. Therefore, we shall also address below, defendant’s contention that the admission of several photographs was prejudicial.', '- 14 - defendant was an alternative way in which defendant could have learned the details of the murder; details that he later passed on to Baccaire.', 'Detective LaForest’s Testimony Would Not Implicate Harnois', 'It is a foundational principle of our jurisprudence, as set forth in Rule 402 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, that all relevant evidence begins as admissible, subject only to well- founded exceptions. 19 It is the state’s contention that the evidence defendant sought to introduce through cross-examination was subject to one such exception, the evidentiary bar set forth in Harnois. See Harnois, 638 A.2d at 535-36. Allowing this line of questioning, the state argues, would effectively have allowed defendant to testify through Det. LaForest. Id. This perception of the evidence appeared to play a part in the trial justice’s restriction of defendant’s cross- examination. At the hearing on defendant’s motion for a new trial, the trial justice said, “I do have a recollection that there was a Harnois type of objection voiced by the State,” and that he was “satisfied that [sustaining the state’s objection] was not an error.” However, we do not agree with this characterization.', 'In Harnois, 638 A.2d at 535, the defendant availed himself of his constitutional right not to testify. However, the defendant sought to admit statements into evidence that he had made to the police, which were contained in police reports. Id. This Court deemed that these statements did not fit either the statement by party-opponent or the so-called “catchall” provisions of our exceptions to the hearsay rule. Id. at 536. We noted that the defendant was the party offering the 19', 'Rule 402 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides:', '“All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the', 'Constitution of the United States, by the constitution of Rhode Island, by act of', 'congress, by the general laws of Rhode Island, by these rules, or by other rules', 'applicable in the courts of this state. Evidence which is not relevant is not', 'admissible.”', '- 15 - self-serving statements at trial, none of the hallmarks of trustworthiness were present, and the state would be deprived of the opportunity to cross-examine the defendant. Id. at 535-36 (discussing why the evidence conformed to neither Rules 801(d)(2)(B) nor 803(24) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence). 20 Here, by contrast, defendant wished to ask of Det. LaForest what Det. LaForest said at their meeting at the ACI, not what he himself had said. In State v. Dennis, 893 A.2d 250 (R.I. 2006), we addressed this situation. In that case, we summed up the rule in Harnois, stating, “a non-testifying defendant could not introduce his own statements through the testimony of investigating officers * * * .” Dennis, 893 A.2d at 264 (citing Harnois, 638 A.2d at 535-36). However, as is the case here, the defendant in Dennis sought to ask police detectives about statements the defendant alleged the detectives made to him during questioning. Id. The Dennis scenario, asking a detective to recount his own statements that he made at a meeting with the defendant, is exquisitely similar to that of defendant and Det. LaForest. Therefore, the holding in Harnois is here, as it was in Dennis, “inapposite to the situation.” Dennis, 893 A.2d at 264.', 'Rule 403 Would Not Bar Detective LaForest’s Testimony', 'The state also argued that its objection was founded on the fear that the testimony would instill “confusion in the minds of the jurors” and that, therefore it should be barred by Rule 403. Rule 403 allows the exclusion of relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by, among other things, undue prejudice. To be sure, any evidence that defendant could produce that would undercut the state’s underlying theory, that Baccaire could have only gotten the information from defendant if defendant was the murderer, is inherently prejudicial to 20', 'This Court characterized the situation thusly, “[t]he defendant was seeking to offer testimony through his statements, which might raise reasonable doubt in the minds of a jury, yet would deprive the state of the opportunity of cross-examination. The rules of evidence will not be manipulated in this way.” State v. Harnois, 638 A.2d 532, 536 (R.I. 1994).', '- 16 - the state’s case. However, “[a]ll evidence supportive of [defendant’s theory of the case] is prejudicial to a prosecutor’s case, but such evidence will be excluded only if its prejudicial effect outweighs the degree of its probative value.” State v. Tavarozzi, 446 A.2d 1048, 1051 (R.I. 1982). Here, the trial justice’s ruling stymied defendant from arguing to the jury that the details of the Barros murder were no longer closely kept and confined only to the halls of the Pawtucket Police Department or the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office.', 'The jury should have been able to consider that evidence as it struggled to weigh the credibility of Baccaire’s testimony about how he had obtained knowledge of the details of the crime. In our judgment, defendant had a right to allow the jury to decide whether those details could have come from defendant “venting,” as his counsel contended, about “[Det.] LaForest coming to talk to him about this shooting, and falsely accusing him of being the shooter,” or whether Baccaire knew those details because defendant was the shooter who admitted the crime to Baccaire. Indeed, there was some confusion in the minds of the jurors, evidenced by the jury’s note during deliberation. That note to the trial justice asked whether there was “another source” for Baccaire’s information. Additional evidence, clarifying the interplay between Det. LaForest, defendant, and Baccaire, was certainly fodder for the jury’s deliberation. In our opinion, there would be nothing unduly prejudicial to the state’s case resulting in Det. LaForest testifying about his own statements at the May 17, 2011 meeting, and it was therefore “not within the bounds of discretion to exclude that relevant testimony.” Tavarozzi, 446 A.2d at 1051. Denying this cross-examination was an error that prejudiced defendant to such an extent that defendant’s Rule 33 motion for a new trial should have been granted after the jury’s verdict.', 'This Court is satisfied that defendant’s proffered evidence was relevant, would not have confused the issues or misled the jury, and did not implicate our prohibition in Harnois.', '- 17 - Accordingly, not permitting defendant to ask relevant questions of Det. LaForest was beyond the limits of the trial justice’s discretion. Preventing defendant from eliciting the foundation for a defense that he knew the details of the murder because Det. LaForest had revealed them to him, rather than because he was the murderer, was prejudicial error because it undercut Arciliares’s strongest defense. See State v. Manocchio, 523 A.2d 872, 875 (R.I. 1987). 21 As it stood, the testimony of Baccaire was quite a thin reed from which the state hung its case, and allowing the source of that testimony to go largely unchallenged was, in our opinion, error.', 'The Contested Photograph Was Properly Admitted', 'We are aware that our mandate will engender further proceedings in this case, including the possibility of a new trial. Therefore, we believe it to be prudent to address the defendant’s third argument; that admitting trial exhibit No. 19, a photo of the murder victim’s dissected heart and lungs, was an error.', ""We are limited in the review of such evidentiary decisions to determining whether, by admitting the contested photographs, the trial justice went beyond the bounds of his or her discretion. Brown, 88 A.3d at 1119. The photographs in Brown included one of the “victim's neck, shoulders, and head with his skin peeled back over his skull and hair protruding from the folded over skin from his scalp,” which this Court called “disturbing to the point of being grisly.” Id. at 1120. Nevertheless, we found the admission of all three contested images was within the trial justice’s discretion. 22 Id. The photographs were helpful to the jury 21"", 'Similarly, State v. Manocchio, 523 A.2d 872, 873 (R.I. 1987), involved one key prosecution witness, whom the defendant was restricted from cross-examining. This Court found the restriction “extremely harmful to the development of Manocchio’s defense by restricting his ability to attack the credibility of the most important witness presented in support of the charges against him.” Id. at 875. 22', 'Here, as in Brown, defendant is not disputing the cause of death and does not object to all of the autopsy photographs. State v. Brown, 88 A.3d 1101, 1120 (R.I. 2014). In Brown, the defendant contested three photographs he alleged inappropriately influenced the jury, Arciliares limited his objection to only one photograph. Id.', ""- 18 - as “visual aids to explain Doctor Cherkov's testimony about the effect of the blunt-force trauma.” Id. at 1121. In this case, the photograph admitted over objection against Arciliares is similarly graphic. However, it assists in illustrating the medical examiner’s testimony, and tends to prove the state’s theory of a single shooter. Because the photograph is relevant and would help the jury to understand the witness’s testimony, we conclude that the trial justice did not err when he allowed it to be admitted."", 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the judgment of conviction and remand this case to the Superior Court for a new trial.', 'Justice Goldberg, concurring. I concur in the majority’s decision in this case. I write separately, however, in order to reiterate this Court’s concern as expressed in previous opinions about the potential for reversible error when the state seeks to exclude defense witnesses or limit evidence sought to be introduced by criminal defendants. Whether in the context of motions in limine or unrecorded conferences in chambers, when defendants are precluded from calling witnesses in order to introduce probative and relevant defense evidence, the likelihood of reversible error is manifest. It is, after all, the defendant’s trial.', 'This Court has stated that we “cast a jaundiced eye to the overuse of motions in limine.” State v. Scanlon, 982 A.2d 1268, 1275 n.11 (R.I. 2009).', 'All too often the constitutional safeguards guaranteed to criminal defendants under the state and federal constitutions are impacted, and this Court is left with no choice but to vacate the resulting convictions. See, e.g., State v. Clark, 974 A.2d 558, 563 (R.I. 2009); State v. Andujar, 899 A.2d 1209, 1213, 1221-22', '- 19 - (R.I. 2006); State v. Oliveira, 730 A.2d 20, 23-24 (R.I. 1999); State v. Haslam, 663 A.2d 902, 909-11 (R.I. 1995). As a result, this Court has cautioned prosecutors seeking to exclude defense evidence and trial justices who are confronted with a request by the state to limit or exclude defense witnesses, to proceed with caution and to create an adequate record. See Clark, 974 A.2d at 564 (“Likewise, when faced with a request by the state in a criminal case to limit or exclude evidence, it is incumbent upon the trial justice to conduct a voir dire hearing or otherwise carefully review the challenged evidence and cautiously exercise his or her discretion, ever mindful of the potential for prejudicial error.”).', 'The majority correctly notes that this Court will disturb a decision of the trial justice to limit the scope of examination only when the trial justice has abused his discretion and prejudicial error results. See State v. Brown, 709 A.2d 465, 473 (R.I. 1998). However, as this Court previously has stated, “[c]lear abuse occurs when a defendant is prejudiced because his or her attorney is not allowed to engage in what is otherwise an appropriate line of cross- examination.” State v. Wright, 817 A.2d 600, 610 (R.I. 2003) (citing State v. Tempest, 651 A.2d 1198, 1212 (R.I. 1995)). This is equally applicable when a defendant is precluded from calling a witness to present probative defense evidence. “A request by the state to limit or exclude the presentation of defense witnesses in a criminal trial should be received with caution and carefully reviewed by the trial justice, who, although exercising his or her broad discretion to determine its relevance, is faced with the potential for prejudicial error to the defendant.” State v.

The hearing justice concluded that Carol was entitled to retroactive payments dating back to October 2007 and that Raymond, although not yet retired from state service, was obligated to make monthly payments to Carol in the amount of $928.56.

Further ambiguity regarding the valuation date is apparent given the parties’ stated intention “that there shall be an equitable division of all property belonging to them.” Because this agreement is not susceptible to “‘one reasonable meaning’ when read in a ‘common sense manner,’” we find it to 7', 'While Carol’s papers contend that G.L. 1956 § 9-20-10 applies to the present case, it is clear from her discussion of the statute that she is referring to G.L. 1956 § 9-21-10.', '-6- be ambiguous.', 'Carney, 89 A.3d at 776 (citing Garden City Treatment Center, Inc. v. Coordinated Health Partners, Inc., 852 A.2d 535, 542 (R.I. 2004)).', '“When a provision in a settlement agreement is ambiguous, we have held that ‘the practice of this Court is to adopt that construction which is most equitable and which will not give to one party an unconscionable advantage over the other.’” Janson v. Janson, 773 A.2d 901, 903 (R.I. 2001) (quoting Flynn v. Flynn, 615 A.2d 119, 122 (R.I. 1992)). “In determining which construction of the decision’s and the agreement’s ambiguous pension provisions would be ‘most equitable’ to the parties in this case, we must interpret them in the context of the parties’ overall agreement concerning the distribution and valuation of the entire marital estate.” Id. Any “ambiguity should be resolved such that the final division of the entire marital estate is consistent with the unambiguous portions of the parties’ property-settlement agreement and with the principles underlying an equitable distribution of that estate.” Id.', 'Because the agreement was ambiguous as to when Carol was entitled to share in Raymond’s pension, the hearing justice properly resolved “the ambiguity based upon principles of equitable distribution.” Janson, 773 A.2d at 903. Here, the parties agreed to a one-half division of Raymond’s pension “calculated as if [Raymond] had left State service on April 2, 1996 retroactive to [Raymond’s] 60th birthday of October 5, 2007, and each and every month thereafter until [Raymond] retires * * *.” In the absence of clarity as to the pension valuation date, the hearing justice’s conclusion that the distribution of the pension should manifest itself in the form of $930.31 per month from October 5, 2007 to June 4, 2013 was an equitable resolution. As we held in Janson, 773 A.2d at 904, the hearing justice in the present case “had the authority * * * to effectuate an equitable distribution” of Raymond’s pension when she', '-7- awarded Carol her share of the monthly pension payments that Raymond would have received if he had retired in October 2007, when he became eligible to do so.', 'In Bober v. Bober, 92 A.3d 152, 165 (R.I. 2014), this Court restated the parameters for the division of a marital asset when that asset is controlled by one spouse. We held that “one spouse should not be allowed to defeat the other spouse’s interest in an asset earned and accumulated during the marriage by invoking a condition wholly within his or her control.” Id. (quoting Allard v. Allard, 708 A.2d 554, 558 (R.I. 1998)). Further, this Court reiterated that, “‘in the absence of a clear agreement specifying * * * when the husband’s pension was to be valued and distributed to the wife, * * * it was inequitable for the trial justice to allow the husband to “unilaterally deprive” the wife of her share of the pension by delaying his retirement’ until some uncertain future date.” Id. at 163 (quoting Janson, 773 A.2d at 904). Given the similarities between the present case and Bober, it is our belief that it would be inequitable to allow Raymond’s refusal to retire to deprive Carol of her entitlement to monthly pension payments.', 'Raymond’s second claim on appeal is that interest should not have been awarded on the $25,000 because the agreement provides for interest only in the event he retired with a disability pension. In so arguing, however, Raymond overlooks the fact that an award of interest may be appropriate in any breach of contract action. Section 9-21-10(a) provides, in relevant part:', '“In any civil action in which a verdict is rendered or a decision made for', 'pecuniary damages, there shall be added by the clerk of the court to the amount of', 'damages interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum * * *.

In that case, we acknowledged that “[t]he award of interest in the absence of statutory authorization is extraordinary and will be granted only under', '-8- the most unusual circumstances * * *.” Id. at 270 (quoting Bristol and Warren Gas Co. v. Burke, 493 A.2d 834, 836 (R.I. 1985)).

Norberg, 417 A.2d 1352, 1357 (R.I. 1980)).', 'It is undisputed that Raymond failed to place the required $25,000 in an escrow account. Because property settlement agreements are examined under contract law, Raymond’s inaction constituted a breach of contract, and the hearing justice’s award of interest under § 9-21-10 was appropriate. See Donelan, 741 A.2d at 270 (“[P]roperty settlement agreement[s] * * * [are] governed by contract principles.”).', 'Finally, with regard to Raymond’s appeal of the award of attorney’s fees, we note that the hearing justice never calculated them.

The note stated in relevant part: “I understand that the Lender may transfer this Note. The Lender or anyone who takes this Note by transfer and who is entitled to receive payments under this Note is called the ‘Note Holder.’” To secure payment obligations under the note, Genao executed a mortgage (the mortgage) on the property in favor of MERS. The mortgage deed denominated Genao as the borrower and mortgagor and specified that MERS was the mortgagee, acting as nominee for lender, Equity One, and lender’s successors and assigns. The mortgage deed included the statutory power of sale in favor of MERS as well as its “successors and assigns.” In the event that Genao failed to fulfill his obligations under the note, it was provided that MERS had the right to enforce its interests, “including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property.”', 'Equity One subsequently transferred the note to CBA Commercial, LLC, which then transferred the note to Deutsche Bank.

On October 12, 2010, Genao filed an action in the Providence County Superior Court seeking declaratory relief, injunctive relief, an order quieting title, and compensatory damages. The complaint alleged that the assignment from MERS to Deutsche Bank was invalid because the signer did not have authority and that defendants lacked standing to foreclose. The Superior Court responded by issuing a restraining order halting the foreclosure.', 'On January 26, 2012, pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, Genao filed a notice to depose a MERS designee on thirty “topics,” most concerning the authority of Denise Bailey, the official who authorized the aforementioned mortgage assignments. In response, MERS filed a motion for a protective order, in which it argued that Genao lacked standing to challenge an assignment to which he was not a party.

Before us, MERS argues that the first hearing justice erred in failing to restrict discovery because plaintiff has no standing to challenge the validity of an assignment to which she is neither a party nor a third-party beneficiary. MERS asserts that any contention on the part of plaintiff that its officials lacked the requisite authority renders the assignments, at most, voidable. Genao, on the other hand, challenges the authority of Denise Bailey to sign the assignment of the mortgage on behalf of MERS and contends that the first hearing justice did not err because the issue of an agency relationship between MERS and the owner of the note is a question of fact.', '-5-', '“Standing is a threshold inquiry into whether the party seeking relief is entitled to bring suit.” Narragansett Indian Tribe v. State, 81 A.3d 1106, 1110 (R.I. 2014) (citing Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce v. Public Utilities Commission, 452 A.2d 931, 932, 933 (R.I. 1982)). “[T]he essence of the question of standing is whether the party seeking relief has alleged such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to ensure concrete adverseness that sharpens the presentation of the issues * * *.” Id. (quoting Blackstone Valley Chamber of Commerce, 452 A.2d at 933). This Court has rejected the argument that “an individual who is not a party to a contract may assert the rights of one of the contracting parties in order to void a contract or have it declared unenforceable.” Sousa v. Town of Coventry, 774 A.2d 812, 815 n.4 (R.I. 2001); see also DePetrillo v. Belo Holdings, Inc., 45 A.3d 485, 492 (R.I. 2012) (rebuffing a third party’s attempt to invalidate a contract). In Mruk, 82 A.3d at 536, we carved out an exception to the general rule that third parties do not have standing to challenge a contract. Specifically, we held that, because they are asserting their own rights, homeowners have standing to “challenge the assignment of mortgages on their homes to the extent necessary to contest the foreclosing entity’s authority to foreclose.” Id. We cautioned, however, that this holding should be narrowly construed to encompass only those situations where a mortgagor challenges an “‘invalid, ineffective, or void’ assignment of the mortgage.” Id. (quoting Culhane v. Aurora Loan Services of Nebraska, 708 F.3d 282, 291 (1st Cir. 2013)).', 'Recently, in Cruz v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., No. 2012-136-M.P., slip op. at 8 (R.I., filed Jan. 13, 2015), we adopted the rationale of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Wilson v. HSBC Mortgage Services, Inc., 744 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2014). Expounding upon the exception carved out in Mruk, we agreed with the First Circuit that a challenge to an officer’s scope of authority alleges a voidable, rather than void, contract. See', '-6- Cruz, slip op. at 8 (citing Wilson, 744 F.3d at 10). Because the plaintiff merely alleged a voidable contract, and because she was not a party to the assignment, we held that she lacked standing to challenge it.', 'Id. (“[A] * * * mortgagor does not have standing to challenge shortcomings in an assignment that render it merely voidable at the election of one party but otherwise effective * * *.” quoting Wilson, 744 F.3d at 9). In light of our holding in Cruz, we are of the opinion that, even if residential property formed the basis for his challenge, and it does not, Genao nevertheless lacked standing to challenge the assignment in question. Consequently, we believe the first hearing justice erred when he denied the motion by MERS for a protective order.', 'Additionally, the property forming the basis for this suit is commercial, as opposed to residential, and Genao admits to “operat[ing it] as a business and rental property.” It follows, then, that Genao’s claims do not fall within the narrow exception we carved out in Mruk for homeowners challenging void assignments. See Mruk, 82 A.3d at 536 (“[H]omeowners in Rhode Island have standing to challenge the assignment of mortgages on their homes to the extent necessary to contest the foreclosing entity’s authority to foreclose.”).', 'Because the property in question is not a personal residence and Genao is not challenging the assignment as a private residential homeowner, we cannot say that he has standing to pursue his claims. See id. (“[T]his exception is confined to private residential mortgagors challenging the foreclosure of their homes.”). For this further reason, the first hearing justice should have granted the motion by MERS for a protective order.', 'However, even if we were to assume that Genao had standing to challenge the assignment in question, there is no basis for overturning the second hearing justice’s grant of summary judgment in favor of Litton and Deutsche Bank. Genao contends that summary', '-7- judgment should not have been granted because MERS did not possess the note when the mortgage was assigned to Deutsche Bank and because MERS did not have the authority to assign the mortgage. We have addressed and rejected each of these arguments in a series of recent cases dealing with nearly identical issues.', 'See Breggia v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 102 A.3d 636, 640-41 (R.I. 2014); see also Mruk, 82 A.3d at 534-37; Bucci, 68 A.3d at 1081-83.', 'In Bucci, we cited with approval the First Circuit’s reasoning in Culhane, explaining that “[t]he law contemplates distinctions between the legal interest in a mortgage and the beneficial interest in the underlying debt[,] [and that] [t]hese are distinct interests [that] may be held by different parties.” Bucci, 68 A.3d at 1088 (quoting Culhane, 708 F.3d at 292). As a result, we concluded that the mortgage and note could be separated and that MERS could serve as mortgagee with the statutory power of sale while not simultaneously holding the note. See id. at 1081 (“The plaintiffs explicitly granted the statutory power of sale and the right to foreclose to MERS * * *.”). We see no reason to depart from that rationale in the present case.', 'Further, in Mruk, we rejected the argument that MERS lacked the authority to assign the mortgage on the ground that MERS, as the holder of the legal title to the mortgage, “always * * * acted as an agent of the owner of the equitable title.” Mruk, 82 A.3d at 537 (quoting Bucci, 68 A.3d at 1088). Given that the facts of the present case are almost identical to those in Mruk, we see no reason to deviate from our reasoning in that case.

The gathering that evening consisted of McKiernan, Burke, Krista Archer, Wade Berard, Brian Petabella, and Samantha Grasso. At one point during the evening, Grasso asked McKiernan for permission to borrow the GMC Sonoma truck to find her boyfriend, Mike Gauthier. McKiernan declined to give her permission.', 'Notwithstanding his refusal, Grasso found McKiernan’s keys and took the truck without permission. Later, Archer allowed McKiernan to use her red Nissan Altima (the Bower or insured vehicle) to search for the truck. This vehicle was owned by Archer’s grandmother, Rita Bower. Prior to trial, Quincy admitted that Bower, as the vehicle owner, gave permission to Archer for the regular use of the vehicle and specifically for its use on the evening of February 22 and early morning hours of February 23, 2006.

As they searched the streets, they came upon two people walking along Davidson Road. The two young men were Hough and Nicholas Messier. According to plaintiff’s testimony, as the vehicle approached them, McKiernan rolled down his window and yelled “[v]arious obscenities” at them as the vehicle passed by. McKiernan testified that he considered his insults to be funny jokes about the boys’ mothers that amused his laughing companions in the vehicle. McKiernan indicated in his testimony that he circled around and drove by plaintiff and Messier several times, hurling insults and flashing the high beams, as his passengers continued to “egg” him on.', 'McKiernan testified that, after such passages, he stopped the insured vehicle when he spotted his missing truck. He further testified that he waited some period of time, between five and ten minutes, before exiting the insured vehicle, while plaintiff and Messier talked to the people in his truck. Concerning the proximity of the insured vehicle in relation to Hough, plaintiff testified that McKiernan stopped the car “about two or three car lengths ahead of us.” McKiernan testified that the car was “[t]hree or four car lengths” away from plaintiff and Messier. McKiernan also testified that, as he was sitting in the car, someone flicked a cigarette, which hit him in the face. Agitated and annoyed, McKiernan, along with Burke and Berard, jumped out of the car and chased Messier. McKiernan first shoved Messier, but then instead pursued Hough once Messier demonstrated that he was still holding his cigarette.', 'Turning his attention to plaintiff, McKiernan swung at him but plaintiff “ducked” thereby avoiding the blow.

His treating physician removed a portion of his skull in order to relieve the pressure, thereby allowing his brain to swell and eventually heal. The portion of his skull that was removed was then implanted in his abdomen until it could be replaced in his skull. The plaintiff endured a long road to recovery with multiple surgical procedures and rehabilitation, including occupational, physical, and speech therapy.', 'On September 16, 2008, plaintiff filed suit against McKiernan alleging negligence, assault, and battery. Subsequently, plaintiff amended his complaint three times to add parties and allegations. In the first amended complaint, plaintiff added negligence claims against Phillip and Darlene Burke (parents of Brian Burke), 4 as well as Diane Archer (mother of Krista Archer). 5 In the second amended complaint, plaintiff added a negligence claim against Bower (grandmother of Krista Archer) as the vehicle owner, along with a Jane Doe negligence count 3', 'Archer had already left in the GMC Sonoma truck. 4', 'Summary judgment was granted in favor of the Burkes on August 23, 2012.

At the conclusion of plaintiff’s case, Quincy moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The trial justice granted the motion in favor of Quincy, determining that the owner-liability statute applied, but that Quincy, as the insurer of the vehicle owner, was exempt from liability on the basis that McKiernan had furnished proof of financial responsibility. Final judgment for Quincy was entered on November 30, 2012, and plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on December 18, 2012. 7 The trial against McKiernan proceeded on the sole issue of damages 8 and the jury returned a verdict awarding plaintiff $1.75 million. 9 6', 'General Laws 1956 § 27-7-2 provides in pertinent part:', '“An injured party, * * * in his or her suit against the', 'insured, shall not join the insurer as a defendant. * * * [W]here', 'before suit has been brought and probate proceedings have not', 'been initiated the insured has died, or where a suit is pending', 'against an insured in his or her own name and the insured died', 'prior to judgment, * * * the injured party * * * may proceed', 'directly against the insurer.” 7', 'The plaintiff’s notice of appeal, filed on December 18, 2013, was premature because a final judgment had not yet been entered for all parties.

The plaintiff contends that Quincy failed to prove that McKiernan satisfied the statutory requirements necessary to avoid vicarious liability under the exemption. In addition, plaintiff asserts that there was a sufficient nexus between his injuries and the insured vehicle to warrant the application of § 31-33-6 and the imposition of liability on Quincy. The plaintiff also avers that Quincy can be held liable under the statute even if the vehicle owner owed no duty of care to plaintiff. Finally, plaintiff argues that McKiernan’s battery did not constitute a superseding, intervening cause to cut off Quincy’s liability.', 'Quincy argues that the trial justice was correct in ruling that the owner-liability statute, § 31-33-6, does not apply to the present case because McKiernan was independently insured under an automobile policy issued by Allstate. Further, Quincy argues that, even if the trial', '-7- justice erroneously determined that McKiernan satisfactorily furnished proof of financial responsibility, the trial justice’s grant of judgment as a matter of law for Quincy was nevertheless proper. Quincy asserts that the ruling was proper because plaintiff’s injuries did not result from an accident involving the insured motor vehicle.', 'Although plaintiff’s arguments focus on the requisites for furnishing proof of financial responsibility, we must first determine if, as the trial justice concluded, the owner-liability statute applies to the facts of this case. Thus, we begin with the threshold issue of whether Quincy, as the insurer of the deceased vehicle owner, can be held vicariously liable pursuant to § 31-33-6 for McKiernan’s intentional misconduct apart from the insured vehicle. The interpretation and application of statutory language lies at the heart of this dispute; it is our task, therefore, to delineate the scope of the term “accident” within § 31-33-6, the owner-liability statute.', 'At common law, an agency relationship between a vehicle owner and driver was necessary in order to hold the owner vicariously liable for acts of the driver. Kernan v. Webb, 50 R.I. 394, 398, 148 A. 186, 188 (1929). 10 “The enactment of § 31-33-6 abrogated this common law rule by statutorily extending the liability of an automobile owner to situations in which no common law agency relationship existed.” Dias v. Cinquegrana, 727 A.2d 198, 199 (R.I. 1999).

The precise meaning of the term “accident” has perhaps been more elusive, but we have held that it encompasses intentional acts, “an interpretation that, of course, is a broad one, but one that we believe is consistent with the purpose of § 31-33-6, namely, to protect an innocent victim from having to shoulder the expense of an injury.” Dias, 727 A.2d at 200.', 'Thus, in Dias, 727 A.2d at 199-200, we concluded that the statute applied to impose liability on the vehicle owner for the permissive driver’s intentional act of striking the plaintiff’s motorcycle with the insured motor vehicle.', 'Our holding in Dias was consistent with the fundamental policy underlying § 31-33-6, namely, to protect innocent victims from bearing the burden of injury expense.', 'Consistently, and without departure, however, we have applied this statute only in cases where the driver’s negligent or intentional use or manipulation of a motor vehicle precipitated an “accident,” in which the insured vehicle caused a “car injury” to the victim.

Rather, we interpret § 31-33-6 as imposing vicarious liability upon the owner of a motor vehicle for the acts—intentional as well as unintentional—of anyone using or operating the vehicle with the consent of the owner. A plaintiff carries the burden, however, of establishing a causal relationship between the use of the vehicle and the injuries sustained by the plaintiff.', 'Here, plaintiff failed to establish such a causal connection. It is our opinion that the fact that McKiernan drove by plaintiff several times, flashing the high beams and yelling obscenities from the insured vehicle, bears too tenuous a connection with plaintiff’s injuries to impute statutory liability to the vehicle owner. It is uncontroverted that McKiernan stopped the vehicle at least two car lengths away from plaintiff and exited the vehicle before delivering the crippling blow. The plaintiff’s injuries resulted from a physical altercation at a distance from the insured vehicle and unrelated to the operation of the insured vehicle.', 'The plaintiff draws an analogy to a series of uninsured motor vehicle cases to argue that the insured vehicle in this case need not be the actual instrumentality causing his injuries.

Olivier, 574 A.2d 1240, 1240-41 (R.I. 1990), the victim was shot and killed by an uninsured motorist immediately following an automobile accident in which she had been a passenger. In that case we adopted the “some nexus” standard from a Florida Supreme Court decision, Government Employees Insurance Co. v. Novak, 453 So.2d 1116, 1119 (Fla. 1984), to guide us in our interpretation of uninsured motorist coverage language requiring the injury to “arise out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.” Olivier, 574 A.2d at 1242', '- 11 - (emphasis omitted). Even though the victim was killed while standing approximately 117 feet away from the vehicle, this Court in Olivier, 574 A.2d at 1241, 1242-43, determined that there was “a substantial nexus * * * between the decedent’s status as a passenger in the insured motor vehicle and her being attacked with a dangerous weapon by an enraged motorist while she was waiting to be interviewed concerning the circumstances of an accident.”', 'In Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Tavarez, 754 A.2d 778, 779 (R.I. 2000), an insured motorist was shot and killed while driving his motor vehicle by two assailants who were pursuing him in an uninsured vehicle. Relying upon Olivier, this Court held that the decedent’s death arose out of the use of the uninsured vehicle, which was being used “as a means of transportation to chase [the decedent], and as a shooting platform to bring about his murder.” Id. at 780. Subsequently, in Skaling v. Aetna Insurance Co., 799 A.2d 997, 1013 (R.I. 2002), we spoke of “the minimal evidentiary nexus required to establish liability” under the uninsured motorist (UM)/underinsured motorist (UIM) provisions of the insurance policy at issue in that case. This Court in Skaling stated:', '“We recently have had occasion to interpret the meaning of', 'language in an insurance policy that, in order to recover UM UIM,', 'the injuries must arise out of ‘the ownership, maintenance or use’', 'of the uninsured/underinsured vehicle and held that this provision', 'does not mean ‘proximately caused by, but [has] a broader', 'meaning that simply required some nexus between the motor', 'vehicle and the injury.’ [Tavarez, 754 A.2d at 780] * * *.

Although the policy considerations underlying both the', '- 12 - uninsured motorist provisions in insurance policies and § 31-33-6 are similar—to provide a means of recovery to injured persons—there are fundamental distinctions.', 'The uninsured motorist cases all concern the interpretation of contract language, generally to the effect that the injury “must arise out of the ownership, maintenance or use of the uninsured motor vehicle.” See Olivier, 574 A.2d at 1242 (emphasis omitted). Because their function is to extend coverage broadly, such terms should be construed liberally. Id.', 'Section 31-33-6, on the other hand, abrogates the common law rule that shielded an automobile owner “from liability for the negligence of a person to whom the owner entrusted the vehicle unless such negligence occurred while the operator was engaged in conducting business for the owner.” Dias, 727 A.2d at 199. The statute extends liability to the owner whenever the driver has the consent of the owner, unless the driver has provided proof of financial responsibility. Significantly, such liability is extended to the owner only “in the case of an accident.” Section 31-33-6. Although we have interpreted this term to include the intentional as well as negligent acts of the driver, we do not understand the statutory language to impute liability upon the owner of a motor vehicle for all acts of a permissive driver, particularly those that are not related to the operation of the vehicle. Rather, there must be a causal relationship between the operation or use of the vehicle and the injuries sustained by the plaintiff.', 'In the case at hand, plaintiff has failed to demonstrate such a causal connection. His injuries were solely the result of McKiernan’s punch. At no time was he ever struck by the insured vehicle itself, nor was either he or McKiernan in the vehicle when plaintiff was punched. The mere fact that McKiernan drove to and from the scene of the incident in the insured vehicle, or even that he and his companions circled plaintiff and taunted him from the vehicle, does not establish the causal connection required to impute liability under § 31-33-6.', '- 13 -', 'We are satisfied, therefore, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff, that the evidence adduced at trial was not sufficient to survive Quincy’s Rule 50 motion.

For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On the evening of February 4, 2009, Bitgood and Ryan Gardiner were patrons at the bar on defendant’s premises. Two physical altercations occurred between the men; the first inside the bar, and the second in defendant’s parking lot approximately ten to fifteen minutes later. The plaintiff sustained serious injuries, requiring a two-week stay in the hospital and two months at home to recover. In April 2010, plaintiff filed a complaint in the Providence County Superior Court, alleging that his injuries resulted from defendant’s negligence. In its answer, defendant claimed comparative negligence and improper venue among various affirmative defenses. Pursuant to defendant’s motion to change venue, the case was transferred to Washington County in July 2010. The case was tried before a jury in the Washington County Superior Court in May 2013.', 'While there was no dispute that Gardiner assaulted plaintiff twice within a fifteen-minute period, none of the trial witnesses relayed why or how the altercations began. The plaintiff testified that he had no memory of the incident. His last memory of the evening was driving his truck to the end of his driveway on his way to Post 27 to pick up a bartender who needed a ride home. The plaintiff stated that he had diabetes, and that if his blood sugar dropped too low “[he is] like in a blackout. [He] can still function but [he does not] know what [he is] doing.” Daniel Baruti, the Hopkinton Police Department lieutenant who oversaw the investigation into the incident, testified that the investigation had not revealed how the first incident started.', '-2-', 'Robin McCoombs, the bartender on duty the night of the incident, was the only trial witness other than plaintiff who was present in the barroom during the first altercation. 1 She testified that she had observed Gardiner that evening; she described him as belligerent, obnoxious, vulgar, antagonizing other patrons, and looking for a fight. McCoombs saw Gardiner repeatedly punch and kick plaintiff on the floor of the bar, but she did not see how the assault started because her back had been to plaintiff and Gardiner. McCoombs recalled, however, that, shortly before the first altercation began, plaintiff was seated at the bar and Gardiner walked past plaintiff on his way toward the door. From these observations and the location within the barroom of the first fracas, McCoombs inferred that plaintiff “had to walk” to the area of the “initial assault.”', 'Jennifer Place’s deposition testimony was read into the record at trial.', 'She was defendant’s bar manager, and she testified that Gardiner was “known to have a black belt in karate and he’s known to get violent.” On the night of the incident, Place was in the hall outside the barroom when the first altercation occurred. She recalled that she went into the bar when she heard yelling, and there she saw Gardiner and plaintiff “in a scuffle on the floor.” Once the fighting was over, she watched Gardiner leave the premises and then she spoke with plaintiff. The plaintiff told Place that he was fine and was going to head home. Place stated that she was standing outside on the steps when Gardiner returned “about ten minutes” later. As soon as she realized that Gardiner had returned, she “yelled to the bartender to call the police” and then told Gardiner to get back in his truck. She said that Gardiner replied, “[H]e cut me, he’s a dead man.” Place testified that she did not see the second altercation because she went inside, but 1', 'McCoombs testified as an adverse witness; therefore much of her testimony on direct examination by plaintiff’s counsel consisted of responding “yes” or “no” to counsel’s leading questions, as well as acknowledging the accuracy of her prior deposition testimony.', '-3- that, after she saw Gardiner drive away, she observed plaintiff unconscious and bleeding. The police and rescue arrived minutes later.', 'At trial, it was undisputed that no one had called the police either during or immediately after the first assault. McCoombs testified that she had not called the police because she had not believed that Gardiner would return. McCoombs also stated that plaintiff had not asked her to call the police and declined her offer to call an ambulance. She acknowledged, however, that she locked the door behind Gardiner after he left. Place testified at her deposition that she had not believed that the police needed to be called after the first altercation. James R. Taft, Sr., then a member of defendant’s executive board as finance officer and liaison between the bar manager and the executive board, was in defendant’s basement on February 4, 2009 for a meeting. Taft’s deposition, which was read into the record during trial, reflected that he went upstairs when he heard a “large commotion,” but that “it was relatively calm in the bar when [he] got up there,” and the police were not needed because “[t]o the best of [his] knowledge,” everything was under control at that point. Taft saw “no damage to the [premises], * * * nobody on the floor, and * * * nobody fighting in the building.”', 'Sergeant Robert Kenyon, a police officer with the Hopkinton Police Department, testified that he was dispatched to Post 27 on the evening of the incident. He arrived less than two minutes after the police station received the call about the disturbance.', 'Sergeant Kenyon testified that, if he had been dispatched either during or immediately after the first altercation, then, based on his location at that time, he would have arrived at Post 27 in five to six minutes (i.e., prior to the second altercation).', 'Several witnesses testified that defendant had a written policy in place for handling emergency situations. The policy in effect on the date of the incident directed its staff to call the', '-4- police when “a situation [got] out of control.” 2 A few months after the incident, defendant changed its policy regarding when its staff were to call the police. Place testified that the new policy directed staff to call the police “anytime there was even a verbal argument or * * * any physical altercation.” Michael Alger, who took over as Post 27’s commander four months after the incident, testified that he created this new policy after he took over as commander in part because “the town licensing board demanded it to be written * * * [and] required [Post 27] to have new guidelines.” The new policy also required bartenders to use a panic alarm whenever they believed a disturbance either might occur or was occurring; the signal from that alarm went directly to the Hopkinton Police Department.', 'Baruti, who oversaw the investigation into the incident, expressed his opinions regarding the standards of care for maintaining the safety and security of patrons in a bar following a physical altercation, as well as the instructions provided to staff on handling physical altercations that occur on the premises. 3 He testified that, based on his twenty-three years of experience, the general standard of care “expected” by the law enforcement community was that police would be called during or after each physical altercation “to secure that particular scene and make it safe, not only for the patrons, but also for the people that you’re calling to the scene.” Baruti opined that defendant had not met this standard of care because, if the police had been called after the 2', 'The defendant’s Bar Management & Organizational Manual, section 10, paragraph 4 stated that “in the event a situation gets out of control, call 911 and request the local police. Next call the bar manager to inform of the situation.” 3', 'While plaintiff’s counsel laid an extensive foundation upon which Baruti could have been qualified to testify as an expert witness, the record does not reflect that Baruti was tendered to the court for approval to testify as an expert. The record does reflect, however, that Baruti provided expert opinion testimony without objection from defendant. In addition, in the trial justice’s ruling on defendant’s motion for a new trial and/or remittitur, she treated Baruti’s testimony as that of an expert in the area of public safety. At oral argument before this Court, plaintiff’s counsel suggested that discussions occurred off the record in which the parties agreed that Baruti would testify as an expert.', '-5- first altercation, then the second altercation would not have occurred. As to the standard of care for the policy and procedures that a bar should have had in place for bar staff confronted with a physical altercation between patrons, Baruti testified that the policy should have been to immediately report the event to the police. Baruti opined that defendant’s policy on February 4, 2009 did not meet the standard of care because it allowed the bartenders to make subjective decisions about when a situation was out of control and therefore when to call the police.', 'At the conclusion of all the testimony, plaintiff submitted several medical affidavits with records and bills attached. The plaintiff testified that he sustained injuries that included a “[l]acerated liver, broken back, damage to [his] right arm, gallbladder removed[,] * * * part of [his] bowel and intestine [removed], and * * * colon damage.” He further testified that he spent two weeks in the hospital, then two months at home recuperating. His mother, sister, and nephew took turns looking after his daily needs, and he visited a primary care physician once a month for two years. The plaintiff was admitted again to the hospital two years later on an emergency admission to remove a stitch that had been left inside his abdomen from one of the operations conducted immediately after the incident. The plaintiff testified that, during the eighteen years before his injuries, he did “all construction work, concrete, running equipment, all labor stuff,” either for “Triton Marine on the New London sub base” or at Cherenzia Excavation in Westerly. The plaintiff began “light duty” work on a part-time basis four months after the incident. His return to work was against his doctor’s recommendation, but plaintiff stated that he “had bills to pay, no money coming in.” The plaintiff “pretty much” resumed normal duties and full-time hours six months after the incident. At the end of the trial, plaintiff requested damages that included reimbursement for medical bills, lost wages, and pain and suffering.', '-6-', 'The jury returned a verdict that found both parties negligent and attributed eighty percent of the negligence to defendant and twenty percent of the negligence to plaintiff. The jury awarded $448,130 to plaintiff, which represented the full amount plaintiff had requested. After reducing the award by twenty percent for plaintiff’s comparative negligence and adding statutory interest at the rate of twelve percent, the total amount awarded to plaintiff was $543,433.13. The defendant thereafter filed a motion for a new trial and/or remittitur (for a reapportionment of comparative negligence) pursuant to Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.

Since the altercation was over and Gardiner had left the premises, defendant argues, it did not breach its “duty to exercise reasonable care to protect [plaintiff] from reasonably foreseeable harm at the hands of Gardiner” by not calling the police. The defendant highlights the trial justice’s finding that McCoombs was credible and consistent in her testimony that she did not believe that either the first altercation was out of control or that a second one would occur.', 'The plaintiff counters that, given the evidence on record regarding Gardiner’s reputation, “a reasonably prudent person would have called the police” immediately upon the first sign of an attack. The plaintiff also argues that the evidence presented regarding defendant’s change in policy also supported the jury’s verdict because the adoption of the stricter policy was evidence of defendant’s negligence.', 'At the hearing on defendant’s motion, the trial justice articulated the standard of review for a new trial motion and then summarized the evidence presented at trial. The trial justice found that McCoombs, the only witness other than plaintiff who was both present in the barroom and who testified in person at trial, was “credible and unwavering in her testimony that she did not believe that the first altercation was out of control, or that there would be a second altercation.” The trial justice also commented, however, that McCoombs twice testified to locking the door after Gardiner left “to, quote, make sure that he did not come back in.” The trial justice highlighted the undisputed fact that defendant changed its emergency situation policy after the incident, and she commented that the jury was instructed that they could consider this subsequent remedial measure when deciding whether defendant breached its duty. The trial justice stated that the credible evidence established “not only that an altercation took place * * *', '-9- but that Gardiner was known to the staff as having a reputation of being violent, that he was acting obnoxious and belligerent and looking for a fight, that he set [plaintiff] as his target * * *.” The trial justice concluded that “[t]he credible evidence presented was so evenly balanced and such that different minds can naturally and fairly come to different conclusions on the defendant’s liability for negligence. Accordingly, this Court is required to deny the motion for a new trial.”', 'Based on our review of the record, we are well satisfied that the trial justice engaged in the appropriate analysis of defendant’s motion, neither overlooked nor misconceived material evidence, and was not otherwise clearly wrong. When the evidence is evenly balanced, a jury verdict must stand. Manning, 991 A.2d at 408. We therefore affirm the denial of defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'B', 'Alternate Motion for Remittitur', 'The defendant also argues that the trial justice was clearly wrong when she denied its alternative motion for remittitur because this ruling “overlooked the inescapable conclusion that there could not have been a second altercation if the first altercation did not occur and there would not have been the first altercation if [plaintiff] had not voluntarily left the safety of his barstool.” The defendant contends that the trial justice overlooked evidence that plaintiff’s negligence was either equal to or greater than defendant’s negligence, including Place’s testimony that plaintiff turned down an offer to call an ambulance and plaintiff’s failure to leave its premises immediately after the first altercation. During oral argument before this Court, defendant also asserted that the trial justice was remiss by not placing more weight on the', '- 10 - reasonable inference that plaintiff chose to approach Gardiner prior to the first altercation notwithstanding Gardiner’s reputation.', 'A trial justice can employ the mechanism of remittitur to either “reassess an erroneous damage award” or “correct a jury’s misapportionment of liability as it may relate to comparative negligence.” Cotrona v. Johnson & Wales College, 501 A.2d 728, 734 (R.I. 1985). A remittitur is appropriate when a “jury award clearly appears to be excessive or is found to be the result of the jury’s passion and prejudice.” Lennon, 901 A.2d at 590.', 'At the hearing, the trial justice noted that it:', '“was clear * * * that the plaintiff was negligent in getting out of his', 'seat in the first instance and walking to where Gardiner was', 'between the end of the bar and the door; the point at which the first', 'altercation ensued. * * * [T]his was not a wise move for the', 'plaintiff[] [a]nd the jury responded accordingly by finding him 20', 'percent comparatively negligent.” She ruled that “the apportionment rendered by the jury does respond truly to the merits of the controversy.', 'It administers substantial justice, and is supported by the fair weight of the evidence” because the worst of plaintiff’s injuries occurred during the second altercation.

60,Patricia Pacheco : v. : Nestor Marulanda. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The defendant, Nestor Marulanda, appeals from an order of the Family Court following the expedited motion by the plaintiff, Patricia Pacheco, to suspend the defendant’s visitation rights with the parties’ minor child. In this appeal, the defendant argues that the hearing justice abused his discretion because he failed to consider that the suspension of visitation rights adversely affects the best interests of the child. On November 6, 2014, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of the parties and examining the memoranda that they submitted, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the order of the Family Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The parties are the parents of a minor child, Alanna. On March 30, 2011, plaintiff filed a motion in the Family Court seeking joint custody of Alanna with defendant as well as physical', '-1- placement in favor of herself. The defendant objected to plaintiff’s motion and filed his own motion for relief as well as a motion to adjudge plaintiff in contempt premised on her failure to return all his personal property, a battle that had been waged in a separate legal action. The motions were heard by a justice of the Family Court, and on June 24, 2011, an order was entered granting joint custody to the parties, physical placement with plaintiff, and visitation in favor of defendant.', 'The order specified that defendant would have visitation with Alanna “[e]very Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to Monday 12:00 noon.” Further, the order mandated that defendant continue his previously court-ordered alcohol treatment.', 'On April 11, 2013, defendant filed a motion requesting the court to adjudge plaintiff in willful contempt for alleged violations of the June 24, 2011, order. Specifically, defendant contended that plaintiff had denied his regular visitations with Alanna in direct contravention of the court order.', 'The plaintiff filed an objection to defendant’s motion to adjudge her in contempt, as well as her own motion to suspend visits and modify custody. In her filings, plaintiff contended that, on or about March 24, 2013, defendant broke into her home and pilfered her jewelry. She also claimed that defendant had allegedly been discovered in a highly intoxicated state in a vehicle with four blown-out tires and with her jewelry in his pockets. As a result, defendant was arrested and charged with breaking and entering; a criminal no-contact order also was issued forbidding him to be in contact with plaintiff. Further, plaintiff alleged that defendant had a serious substance-abuse issue that caused her to be concerned for the well-being of Alanna and herself. The plaintiff sought an order: (1) granting her sole custody of Alanna, (2) suspending defendant’s visitation, and (3) requiring defendant to undergo substance-abuse treatment as well as random drug testing before visitation with Alanna was resumed.', '-2-', 'On June 5, 2013, the parties convened with a justice of the Family Court. After spending what the hearing justice described as an “inordinate amount of time in chambers,” the parties were able to agree on the terms of an order. On June 25, 2013, a consent order was entered granting defendant visitation with Alanna “one day (from morning until evening) per weekend, either Saturday or Sunday by agreement of the parties (not overnight).” Further, the order provided “[t]hat the [d]efendant’s visit[s] with the minor child shall be supervised at all times by the paternal grandparents.”', 'This, however, did not resolve the couple’s difficulties. In August 2013, plaintiff filed an expedited motion to suspend defendant’s visitation.', 'In her filing, plaintiff alleged that defendant’s visitations with Alanna had not been supervised, in direct contravention of the June 25, 2013, order. The plaintiff maintained that it was in Alanna’s best interest to suspend defendant’s visitation until such time as he “can demonstrate better judgment and the level of maturity required to honor [the Family Court’s] Order.”', 'On August 19, 2013, plaintiff’s expedited motion to suspend defendant’s visitation was heard by the same justice of the Family Court who had entered the previous order. When he testified at the hearing, defendant conceded that on three separate occasions he visited with Alanna without the supervision of his parents. First, defendant stated that “one time I took her to [a] water park which was with my brother and his family, my little nephew.” The defendant insisted that this visit was not unsupervised because he was with his brother, who was a well- respected person. Second, defendant explained that during another visitation, his stepfather, a lawyer, left to visit clients at the Adult Correctional Institutions and his mother left to go to a clinic. He said that while both of his parents were away, a police officer discovered defendant,', '-3- unsupervised, with Alanna. Finally, defendant stated that on one other occasion he, along with his brother, took Alanna to the park without his parents being present.', 'Despite conceding that on three separate occasions he was with Alanna without his parents’ supervision, defendant insisted that he did not believe there was a need for supervision of his visits with Alanna. In response, the hearing justice directed defendant’s attention to paragraph two of the June 25, 2013, order which reads “[t]hat the [d]efendant’s visit[s] with minor child shall be supervised at all times by the paternal grandparents.” The defendant explained to the hearing justice that he understood the term “supervision” to mean that his parents could designate another person, such as his brother, to supervise his visitation with Alanna.', 'At the conclusion of the testimony, the hearing justice made several findings of fact. First, the hearing justice found that defendant had admitted to three separate incidents in which he was with Alanna, unsupervised by his parents. Second, with respect to defendant’s stated understanding of the order, the hearing justice found defendant’s testimony to not be credible, stating that “[t]he Court does not believe the [d]efendant when he testifies that he misunderstood the [June 25, 2013] order of the Court.” Finally, the hearing justice found defendant to be in “willful and malicious contempt” of the court’s June 25, 2013, order. As a result, the hearing justice modified defendant’s visitation and directed that “[a]ny and all visitation will take place at the courthouse, until further order of this Court.”', 'On September 4, 2013, defendant filed a motion for an emergency stay in the Family Court. As grounds, defendant argued that no evidence had been presented demonstrating that the best interests of Alanna had been harmed by the alleged violations of the June 25, 2013, order. Further, defendant asserted that the hearing justice’s reasons for suspending his visitation were', '-4- purely punitive in nature.', 'Finally, defendant argued that the suspension of visitation was contrary to the best interests of Alanna and would result in irreparable harm to the child.', 'On September 6, 2013, defendant’s motion for an emergency stay was heard before the same justice of the Family Court who had heard the earlier expedited motion to suspend. The hearing justice recounted the testimony that had been elicited at the August 19, 2013, hearing, including defendant’s claimed misunderstanding of the June 25, 2013, order.', 'Further, the hearing justice recalled that defendant had conceded that he had been with Alanna on at least three occasions unsupervised by his parents. The hearing justice clarified that following the August 19, 2013, hearing, defendant’s visitation rights had not been suspended; rather, consequent to defendant’s failure to follow prior orders of the court, visitation was modified in that it was to take place at the courthouse. As a result, the hearing justice denied defendant’s motion for an emergency stay. The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the hearing justice abused his discretion in suspending his visitation. 1 Specifically, defendant argues that the hearing justice abused his discretion when he found him in contempt, because the intent of the June 25, 2013, order that he allegedly violated could have been easily misconstrued as “some kind of consent order” as opposed to “an order entered into the record.”', 'Further, defendant argues that it was error to suspend his visitation in the absence of any showing of harm or danger to Alanna. Finally, defendant urges that the suspension of his visitation has caused irreparable harm to Alanna.', 'Conversely, plaintiff argues that the hearing justice neither abused his discretion nor overlooked or misconceived material evidence when he found defendant in willful contempt of 1', 'After a review of the papers that defendant filed with this Court, we are unable to clearly discern whether he is appealing the hearing justice’s finding of contempt or the remedy that was imposed as a result of that finding. At oral argument, defendant’s counsel clarified that defendant was appealing both the contempt finding as well as the remedy that was imposed.', '-5- the court’s June 25, 2013, order. The plaintiff contends that defendant’s assertion that his visitation rights have been suspended is a “bold misrepresentation of the facts” because the court’s September 9, 2013, order makes clear that visitation could continue but that it was merely modified in that it must take place at the courthouse. Finally, plaintiff argues that the June 25, 2013, order, of which defendant was found to be in violation, was a valid and enforceable order and that defendant’s contention that he misunderstood that order is unavailing.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'General Laws 1956 § 15-5-16(d)(1) provides in pertinent part that “[i]n regulating the custody of the children, the court shall provide for the reasonable right of visitation by the natural parent not having custody of the children * * * .” We have oft echoed this sentiment, stating that “[v]isitation rights are to be strongly favored and will be denied only in an extreme situation in which the children’s physical, mental, or moral health would be endangered by contact with the parent in question.” Africano v. Castelli, 837 A.2d 721, 728 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Suddes v. Spinelli, 703 A.2d 605, 607 (R.I. 1997)). This Court reviews a Family Court’s decision modifying visitation rights to determine whether an abuse of discretion has occurred. Waters v. Magee, 877 A.2d 658, 664 (R.I. 2005) (citing Africano, 837 A.2d at 728). “A trial justice’s findings in this regard will not be disturbed on appeal unless he or she overlooked or misconceived evidence or was clearly wrong.” Laurence v. Nelson, 785 A.2d 519, 520 (R.I. 2001) (citing Silvia v. Silvia, 711 A.2d 1149, 1150 (R.I. 1998) (mem.)). Finally, it is well established that the court’s foremost consideration when making a decision that affects visitation rights is the “best interests of the child.” Waters, 877 A.2d at 664 (quoting Dupré v. Dupré, 857 A.2d 242, 251-52 (R.I. 2004)).', '-6-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'We will begin our analysis by addressing defendant’s first contention on appeal, namely, that the hearing justice erred when he found defendant in contempt of the June 25, 2013, order. The defendant argues that the hearing justice failed to properly exercise his discretion because the intent of the June 25, 2013, order could have been easily misconstrued to permit another party, such as his brother, to provide the supervision because it was “some kind of consent order” as opposed to “an order entered into the record.” However, this Court has stated, in regard to a consent agreement as to visitation entered into by the parties, that “[o]nce the court entered the order, it became an order of the court and a finding of that court.” Rubano v. DiCenzo, 759 A.2d 959, 962 n.2 (R.I. 2000) (citing State v. Lush, 103 N.W.2d 136, 138 (Neb. 1960)).', 'Having determined that the order was completely valid and entitled to be enforced in accordance with its terms, we now turn our attention to the issue of whether defendant complied with it and the reasonable consequences that might flow from any noncompliance.', 'It is undisputed—indeed defendant has conceded—that on three separate occasions he was with Alanna absent the supervision of his parents. While defendant argued that he believed his visits with Alanna did not require supervision in accordance with the terms of the order, the hearing justice explicitly found otherwise; he determined defendant’s testimony to be not credible, stating that “[t]he Court does not believe the [d]efendant when he testifies that he misunderstood the [June 25, 2013] order of the Court.” As a result, the hearing justice found defendant to be in “willful and malicious contempt.” It is well established that the credibility determinations made by a trial justice sitting without a jury are entitled to substantial deference. D’Ellena v. Town of East Greenwich, 21 A.3d 389, 391-92 (R.I. 2011). A review of the record reveals nothing that', '-7- undermines the trial justice’s finding that defendant lacked credibility. The hearing justice did not overlook or misconceive material evidence and he was well within the bounds of his discretion when he found defendant to be in contempt of the June 25, 2013, order.', 'In addition, defendant has appealed the remedy that was imposed following the finding of contempt. The defendant argues that it was error to modify his visitation in the absence of any showing of harm or danger to Alanna because the modification has caused irreparable harm to Alanna. It is significant that the hearing justice specifically found that defendant had an alcohol abuse problem, that he had broken into plaintiff’s home and stolen various items of jewelry from her, and that he violated the court’s June 25, 2013, order as to supervised visitation on at least three occasions.', 'We believe that these findings clearly identify behavior that reasonably warrants concern about possible harm or danger to Alanna. Further, notwithstanding defendant’s assertions to the contrary, his visitation with Alanna was never suspended. The order that entered following the hearing clearly and unambiguously stated that “any and all visitation will take place at the courthouse until further order of the Court.” Thus, it is apparent on the face of the court’s order that defendant could, in fact, have visitation with Alanna; however, it must take place at the courthouse. Therefore, defendant’s contention that he was denied visitation with Alanna absent a finding of harm or danger is meritless. The hearing justice considered the extensive history underlying the interaction between these parties, and he was within the bounds of his discretion, indeed his responsibility, to structure an appropriate remedy.', 'Finally, it appears that the defendant takes issue with the fact that the hearing justice neglected to make explicit findings of fact with respect to the best interests of the child prior to modifying his visitation. Previously, this Court was confronted with an appeal from an order modifying a child-custody arrangement wherein the defendant argued that the trial justice erred', '-8- by failing to use the phrase “change in circumstances” before he modified custody. Kenney v. Hickey, 486 A.2d 1079, 1082 (R.I. 1985). In that case, we explained that the trial justice’s failure to use the phrase “change in circumstances” was of “no legal significance” because implicit in the trial justice’s specific findings of fact was that circumstances had changed. Id. Likewise, in this case, the hearing justice did not make an explicit finding regarding the best interests of Alanna. However, the hearing justice did find, in no uncertain terms, that the defendant had an alcohol abuse problem, that he had broken into the plaintiff’s home and stolen various items of jewelry, and that he had violated the court’s order on at least three occasions, an order that was clearly designed to protect the child. Clearly implicit in these specific findings of misconduct on the part of the defendant is a determination that modifying the visitation was in Alanna’s best interests. As a result, we can divine no error committed by the hearing justice.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Family Court, to which the papers in the case may be remanded.', '-9-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Patricia Pacheco v.

After hearing the arguments of the parties and examining the memoranda that they submitted, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument.

To finance that transaction, plaintiff executed an adjustable-rate note, payable to New Century Mortgage Corporation (New Century), in the amount of $255,000. The note was secured by a mortgage on the property denominating plaintiff as borrower and MERS as mortgagee, acting as a “nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns.” Both the note and the mortgage designated New Century as the lender.', 'Further, the mortgage provided that “[b]orrower does hereby mortgage, grant and convey to MERS, (solely as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns) and to the successors and assigns of MERS * * * with the Statutory Power of Sale.” The mortgage was recorded in the land evidence records of the Town of Foster on February 4, 2007.', 'On April 2, 2007, New Century filed for bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. On March 19, 2008, during the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, New Century filed a notice of rejection of executory contract regarding its membership agreement with MERS and its status as a MERS member.', 'Subsequently, on July 20, 2009, MERS, claiming to act as New Century’s nominee, purportedly assigned the mortgage to UBS, recording the assignment in the land evidence records of Foster. However, on December 28, 2010, UBS assigned the mortgage to USA Residential. Once again, that assignment was recorded in the land evidence records of Foster.', '-2- Thereafter, USA Residential and its loan servicer, Rushmore, commenced foreclosure proceedings against plaintiff.

The plaintiff also sought to quiet title to the property and enjoin defendants from instituting any further foreclosure or eviction actions. Attached to plaintiff’s complaint were several documents, including copies of the note, mortgage, purported assignments of the mortgage, New Century’s notice of rejection of executory contract, and the MERS bylaws.', 'On November 8, 2011, defendants, in lieu of an answer, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting that plaintiff should be barred from challenging the foreclosure sale because it already had been conducted, that plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the validity of the assignments, and that USA Residential could properly foreclose on the property despite not being the original lender or note holder. The plaintiff objected to defendants’ motion, averring that she had met her burden of stating a claim upon which relief could be granted.', 'On April 24, 2012, defendants’ motion to dismiss was heard by a justice of the Superior Court. The hearing justice issued a written decision, finding that plaintiff lacked standing to challenge the assignments of the mortgage, but that even if she did, the assignments were valid, and the foreclosure proper.

McGarry, appeals from the denial of his motion for a new trial after a jury verdict entered in favor of the defendant, Marilyn Pielech, in her capacity as Treasurer and Finance Director of the Town of Cumberland (town), in a suit alleging age discrimination in hiring. 1 This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on October 29, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and we shall proceed to decide the appeal at this time, without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Ms. Pielech is now the sole defendant because the named individual members of the Cumberland School Committee were granted a judgment as a matter of law at the close of plaintiff’s evidence, pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. That ruling was not appealed to this Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In this appeal, we address the issues arising from the second trial of plaintiff’s claim of age discrimination arising from the failure to hire him for one of two positions as an English teacher at Cumberland Middle School. 2 The first time these parties were before this Court, we affirmed the grant of a new trial for defendant, pursuant to Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, on the discrimination claim. 3 On remand to the Superior Court, plaintiff again litigated the claim of discrimination to a jury, but this time a verdict was returned in favor of defendant. After the verdict, the trial justice denied plaintiff’s motion for a new trial. The plaintiff now appeals from the adverse jury verdict.', 'The events that give rise to the facts underlying plaintiff’s one remaining claim took place more than fifteen years ago. 4 McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 275-79 (R.I. 2012) (McGarry I). McGarry had been employed as a substitute teacher with the Cumberland school system during the 1997-1998 school year. In July 1998, plaintiff applied for two openings at Cumberland Middle School, both in the English department, for the 1998-1999 school year. The plaintiff was interviewed for both positions, but ultimately the town appointed other candidates. The various candidates, including plaintiff, were interviewed by a committee that consisted of 2', 'The record notes the school is now called Joseph L. McCourt Middle School. 3', 'For a complete recitation of the facts and evidence produced at the first trial, see McGarry v.

Originally, plaintiff received a favorable verdict on both claims. However, both verdicts were vacated when the trial justice granted Rule 50 judgments to the defendant, and in the alternative granted motions for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. On his first appeal, plaintiff did not contest the judgment, or the alternative grant of a new trial, as to the retaliation claim; therefore, this Court’s decision addressed only the discrimination claim. McGarry I, 47 A.3d at 279 n.8. In that opinion, we vacated the Rule 50 judgment on the discrimination claim, but affirmed the Rule 59 grant of a new trial to defendant on the discrimination claim only. McGarry I, 47 A.3d at 286.', '-2- Joyce Hindle-Koutsogiane (Koutsogiane), the principal of the Middle School, and two teachers from the English department. At the interview, members of the committee took notes, rated each of the candidates’ responses to a series of questions, and made other general observations that would be helpful in making the hiring decision. In August 1998, after he was not hired for either position, McGarry asked Ms. Koutsogiane for permission to review his personnel file. In his review, plaintiff discovered that there were no interview sheets from the July 1998 interview. No explanation has ever been offered by defendant as to why the interview sheets were not available.', 'After reviewing the file, plaintiff concluded that age discrimination was the explanation for the town’s failure to hire him for one of the positions. At the time of his application, plaintiff was fifty-six years of age; the two candidates who were selected to fill the positions were less than forty years of age. The plaintiff had earned a degree from Providence College in 1968 and a master’s degree in business from Bryant University in 1980. 5 Further, plaintiff was certified to teach a number of academic subjects, including English, social studies, and business. McGarry had taught in the town’s school system previously, during the 1969-1970 school year, but he spent the next twenty-six years working in a variety of managerial positions in the trucking industry.', 'Years later, plaintiff decided to reactivate his teaching certificate, and he began working again in the town as a substitute teacher in the spring of 1997. The following year, 1998, plaintiff began the application process during which he alleges the discrimination occurred.', 'In December 1998, McGarry took his claims to the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights (commission), alleging that he was not hired for either of the two positions as a result of 5', 'The first successful candidate had a college degree with specializations in writing and journalism. The second successful candidate had a master’s degree in teaching.', '-3- age discrimination. On June 27, 2000, the commission gave McGarry a notice of a right to sue, pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 28-5-24.1(a), allowing him to file a complaint in Superior Court. On August 8, 2000, plaintiff filed suit against the town and the individual members of the school committee. The suit alleged two pertinent claims: age discrimination in violation of the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act, G.L. 1956 § 42-112-1, and the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act, G.L. 1956 § chapter 5 of title 28, and retaliation based on the same. A trial commenced on the claims in February of 2010 and it featured the testimony of plaintiff, Ms. Koutsogiane, and several other officials in the Cumberland school system. When plaintiff testified, he admitted he had no direct evidence that he was a victim of age discrimination. The missing interview notes were addressed in the testimony of Ms. Koutsogiane, Mr. Joseph M. Nasif, Jr., the superintendent of schools from 1996 to 2005, and Mr. Roger Parent, a former principal who was familiar with the interview process. However, no witness could explain why the interview sheets were missing from plaintiff’s file and accordingly, the judge gave the jury an instruction on spoliation of the evidence. 6 On February 24, 2010, a verdict was returned for plaintiff on both counts; the jury awarded $329,814.18 in damages. However, upon motion by defendant, the verdicts were vacated and a judgment as a matter of law, in accordance with Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, was entered for defendant on both counts. Alternatively, the trial justice granted defendant’s motions for a new trial, premised on Rule 59, on both claims.', 'McGarry appealed the trial justice’s ruling to this Court, but in his appeal, with respect to the retaliation claim, he failed to address either the Rule 50 judgment entered for defendant or 6', 'The judge found that it was a regular practice to draft and use these interview sheets as part of the hiring process and that, at the time of trial, the school department could not locate these documents. The trial justice told the jury that they “may infer that the missing evidence would have been unfavorable to the position of the defendant.”', '-4- the Rule 59 grant of a new trial. This Court vacated the trial justice’s Rule 50 finding on the discrimination claim that was before it, but we affirmed the Rule 59 grant of a new trial on that one claim. On remand, plaintiff had a second jury trial before a different justice of the Superior Court. That trial commenced with pretrial motions on December 6, 2012.', 'On that day, several issues were addressed. The first was the retaliation claim, which plaintiff’s attorney conceded was no longer viable, stating on the record “[w]e never challenged that in the Supreme Court, so there’s not much more I can say about whether or not the 1999 retaliation claim survives.” The trial justice agreed, ruling that that claim “will not be going to the jury here.” Second, defendant moved to exclude certain testimony about a July 26, 1999, letter the town’s counsel penned in opposition to plaintiff’s original filing with the commission in 1998. The trial justice allowed plaintiff to testify at the hearing on the motion in limine before she ruled on the letter’s admissibility. In his testimony, plaintiff disputed certain allegations that were made in the letter, specifically that he had made a verbal outburst at a school committee meeting after he learned that he would not be appointed to a business teaching position in the 1997-1998 academic year. The letter further contained an erroneous statement that plaintiff was not certified to teach English at the time of the 1998 decision on hiring an English teacher. In ruling on the motion, the trial justice deemed the letter to be inadmissible, except for the limited purpose of showing the false statement about plaintiff’s teaching certificate. The judge said that she believed the remaining contested portions, which concerned plaintiff’s decreasing use as a substitute teacher and the 1997 teaching position, were not in issue, and were not sufficiently probative on the age-discrimination claim before the jury. The trial justice reasoned that any possible relevance that the outburst at the school committee meeting might have was', '-5- substantially outweighed by the danger of confusing the issues and misleading the jury, and therefore she excluded the majority of the letter.', 'On December 10, 2012, the trial began. On the second day, Ms. Koutsogiane testified about the hiring process and the use of the interview notes, which she referred to as rating sheets. She explained that the rating sheets were used to foster discussion between the interviewers after each interview.', 'She further testified that at the conclusion of the interview process, the committee selected its top three candidates and then “sen[t] those three with our recommendations up to the Superintendent’s Office.” During trial, plaintiff indicated that he would seek a jury instruction that, because defendant failed to preserve the records from the 1998 interview, there had been a violation of a federal regulation, 29 C.F.R. § 1602.14 (2012), 7 as well as G.L. 1956 § 28-6.4-1. 8', 'The trial justice addressed the requested instructions before Superintendent Nasif testified because she presumed her ruling would impact plaintiff’s questioning of him. The trial justice refused to offer a specific instruction to the jury, as plaintiff had requested, because she found the two laws inapplicable to plaintiff’s case. Citing the 7', 'The regulation is published by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) under the powers delegated to it by federal labor laws. See 29 C.F.R. § 1602.1 (2012) (listing the purpose and scope of the record-keeping regulations). The regulation states in relevant part:', '“Where a charge of discrimination has been filed * * * against an employer under', 'title VII, the [Americans with Disabilities Act], or [Genetic Information', 'Nondiscrimination Act], the respondent employer shall preserve all personnel', 'records relevant to the charge or action until final disposition of the charge or the', 'action.” Id. § 1602.14 at 176. 8', 'If given proper notice, employers are required by this statute to allow their employees to inspect their personnel files, except:', '“This section does not apply to records of an employee relating to the', 'investigation of a possible criminal offense or records prepared for use in any', 'civil, criminal, or grievance proceedings, any letter of reference,', 'recommendations, managerial records kept or used only by the employer,', 'confidential reports from previous employers, and managerial planning records.”', 'G.L. 1956 § 28-6.4-1(a)(4).', '-6- language of the regulation, the trial justice ruled that because plaintiff’s claim was not “filed against an employer under [T]itle VII or the [Americans with Disabilities Act],” 29 C.F.R. § 1602.14 did not apply because it was meant to apply to only those “particular acts.” 9 Further, the Rhode Island statute, § 28-6.4-1, did not apply because the interview notes were similar to “letters of reference and recommendations,” which are exempt from the requirement concerning the inspection of records. However, when she instructed the jury, the trial justice did include the standard spoliation instruction with regard to the missing interview notes.', 'On December 13, 2012, the jury returned a verdict for defendant. The plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial, which the trial justice denied. The plaintiff made a timely appeal to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court has held that “the admissibility of evidence is a decision within the sound discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Dubois, 36 A.3d 191, 199 (R.I. 2012) (citing State v. Merida, 960 A.2d 228, 237 (R.I. 2008)). Thus, we will affirm the hearing justice’s decision unless he or she has not properly exercised that discretion. Id.

See 29 C.F.R. § 1602.01 (defining scope of the regulation plaintiff cites).

Second, he urges that the trial justice’s refusal to impart a jury instruction on a federal regulation and a state statute misconstrued the law.', '-8- Lastly, plaintiff contends that the judge erred in not allowing him to present evidence of his retaliation claim. We conclude that these arguments lack merit and we will address them in turn.', 'A. Preclusion of the 1999 Letter', 'Questions on admission of evidence are rightly settled by the trial justice. Rule 104(a) of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“the admissibility of evidence shall be determined by the court”). When exercising this authority, the trial justice has broad discretion and will not be determined to be in error if he or she properly exercises that discretion. See Dubois, 36 A.3d at 199. A trial justice may properly exclude evidence, although relevant on some point, if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of confusing the issues before the jury. See Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence (“evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury”); Accetta v. Provencal, 962 A.2d 56, 60 (R.I. 2009) (reciting the process for admission of evidence). The plaintiff claims that there was error occasioned by the failure to admit the 1999 letter from defendant’s counsel to the commission as well as by the trial justice’s refusal to allow him to question witnesses about the letter. The trial justice did allow plaintiff to address the factual inaccuracy in the letter pertaining to his teaching certificate, and plaintiff did do so at trial. What the trial justice did not allow were the statements in the letter about the school department’s declining use of plaintiff as a substitute teacher, the alleged outburst at the school committee meeting, and a 1997 business teacher position that was not in issue in the discrimination claim.', 'The plaintiff argued that the letter was relevant because it evidenced the shifting rationales that defendant had for not hiring him for either of the two English teacher positions, thereby demonstrating that defendant’s reasons were a mere pretext for age discrimination.', '-9- However, the trial justice decided that any probative value those portions of the letter would have for this purpose was outweighed by the risk of confusion of the issues and thus it had the potential to mislead the jury. It is significant that the jury in plaintiff’s second trial was deciding only the discrimination claim for the 1998 teaching vacancies. After a review of the record, it is our opinion that the trial justice was within the bounds of her discretion when she excluded the letter from the jury’s consideration at plaintiff’s trial, and we will not disturb her decision.', 'B. Jury Instruction on 29 C.F.R. § 1602.14 and § 28-6.4-1', 'A trial justice has the duty to ensure that the charge she gives to the jury appropriately states the applicable law in the case before it. Long, 61 A.3d at 445. Here, McGarry asked the trial justice to instruct the jury on two pieces of legislation, both of which the judge found to be inapplicable. The first was 29 C.F.R. § 1602.14, a federal regulation promulgated to require employers to adhere to the record-keeping requirements of Title VII, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA). See 29 C.F.R. § 1602.1 (defining the purpose and scope of the record-keeping regulations). The second was § 28-6.4-1, which pertains to the records an employer must allow an employee to inspect. See chapter 6.4 of title 28.', 'The trial justice determined that the facts of the case before the jury did not warrant an instruction on either enactment because neither was germane to the claim in dispute. The trial justice noted that the federal regulation and the section in which it was found “was promulgated to aid in the enforcement of particular acts.” Those legislative enactments, she noted, were expressed in 29 C.F.R. § 1602.14, as Title VII, the ADA, and GINA, and plaintiff’s claim did not involve any of them. The plaintiff’s suit advanced state law claims only.', '- 10 -', 'The trial justice determined that § 28-6.4-1 did not apply because the interview notes in question were not the types of documents that an employee has a statutory right to inspect. Rather, she found that they were akin to “letters of reference and recommendations,” which the statute exempts. Ms. Koutsogiane testified that the purpose of the interview rating sheets was to assist the committee in making its recommendation to the superintendent, not to make the ultimate decision of whom to hire. The trial justice concluded that the interview rating sheets were “not a record having to do with hiring. These are notations.” The trial justice allowed the jury to consider the fact that the rating sheets were missing, by way of a spoliation instruction, but she declined to instruct on the Rhode Island statute, reasoning that it did not apply to this type of document. We see no error in the trial justice’s determinations.', 'C. Preclusion of Retaliation Claim', 'This Court strongly adheres to its “waive-or-raise” rule that requires parties to raise allegations of error in the lower court and argue the issue in their briefs on appeal. Rule 16(a) (“questions not raised and points not made ordinarily will be treated as waived”); Bowen Court Associates, 818 A.2d at 728. The plaintiff’s first trial included a claim for retaliation, in addition to the claim for age discrimination. At the conclusion of the first trial, the trial justice wrote a decision addressing both claims, and he granted the defendant a judgment as a matter of law explicitly on “[the] [p]laintiff’s age discrimination and retaliation claims.” In the alternative, the trial justice granted the defendant’s motions for a new trial, also on both claims. In the plaintiff’s first appeal to this Court, he did not raise or argue either the Rule 50 judgment granted to the defendant or the Rule 59 grant of a new trial with respect to his claim of retaliation. McGarry I, 47 A.3d at 276 n.4 (“[o]n appeal, plaintiff did not pursue his retaliation claim”). Considering the nature of the first trial justice’s plainly unambiguous conclusion, it is our opinion that the', '- 11 - plaintiff should have known that he would be required to pursue his retaliation claim on appeal or it would be waived. See Estate of Meller, 554 A.2d at 654 (this Court expects that “the briefs before us will contain all the arguments that the parties wish us to consider”). Indeed, at a pretrial hearing in advance of the plaintiff’s second trial, his counsel conceded, “[w]e never challenged that in the Supreme Court.” The second trial justice, relying on this Court’s mandate, correctly prohibited any evidence on the retaliation claim because it would unnecessarily confuse the issues before the jury.

After considering the parties’ submitted memoranda and oral arguments, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the petition at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we quash the order denying MERS’ motion for a protective order. 1', 'For a detailed explanation of the role of MERS in the mortgage industry, we refer the reader to our opinion in Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069, 1072-73 (R.I. 2013).', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On February 23, 2007, Cruz executed a promissory note (the note) in favor of New Century Mortgage Corporation (New Century) in the amount of $334,400, plus interest. 2 The note stated in relevant part: “I understand that Lender may transfer this Note. Lender or anyone who takes this Note by transfer and who is entitled to receive payments under this Note is called the ‘Note Holder.’” To secure payment obligations under the note, Cruz executed a mortgage (the mortgage) on her real estate located at 24 Janet Drive, Johnston, Rhode Island (the property). The mortgage deed denominated Cruz as the borrower and mortgagor and specified that MERS was the mortgagee, acting as nominee for lender New Century, and lender’s successors and assigns. The mortgage deed included the statutory power of sale in favor of MERS as well as its “successors and assigns.” In the event that Cruz failed to fulfill her obligations under the note, it was provided that MERS had the right to enforce its interests, “including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property.” The mortgage deed was duly executed and recorded in the Land Evidence Records for the Town of Johnston on February 26, 2007.', 'New Century subsequently endorsed and transferred the note to USA Residential Properties, LLC (USA Residential), and on August 1, 2010, Rushmore Loan Management Services, LLC (Rushmore) became the servicer for Cruz’s loan. On August 8, 2008, MERS, as nominee for the original lender, New Century, assigned its interest in the mortgage to ACT Properties, LLC (ACT Properties); and, on April 13, 2010, ACT Properties assigned its interest in the mortgage to USA Residential. 2', 'Juan Vargas also executed the promissory note and the mortgage, but he is not a party to this action.', '-2-', 'When Cruz failed to make timely payments, Rushmore, acting on behalf of USA Residential, initiated foreclosure proceedings, sending notice of default to Cruz and scheduling a foreclosure sale for February 18, 2011. On February 15, 2011, Cruz filed an action in the Providence County Superior Court seeking a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, an order quieting title, and compensatory damages. The complaint alleged that the assignment from MERS to ACT Properties was invalid because the signer was unauthorized and that defendants lacked standing to foreclose. The Superior Court responded by issuing a temporary restraining order halting the foreclosure sale.', 'On July 28, 2011, MERS filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that, among other things, Cruz did not have standing to challenge the assignments of the mortgage. On July 29, 2011, pursuant to Rule 30(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, Cruz responded by filing a notice to depose a MERS designee on twenty topics, most concerning the authority of Francis J. Nolan, the official who executed the aforementioned mortgage assignment from MERS to ACT Properties. On November 2, 2011, after the parties agreed to continue the deposition to a future date, Cruz filed a second Rule 30(b)(6) notice to depose a MERS designee. In response, MERS filed a motion for a protective order, in which it argued that Cruz’s requests sought information that was irrelevant, overly broad, and unduly burdensome. At a November 16, 2011 hearing, a Superior Court justice denied the motion for a protective order; and, on December 12, 2011, an order implementing the decision was entered. On January 6, 2012, Cruz filed a third Rule 30(b)(6) notice to depose a MERS designee, but this deposition was canceled by agreement of the parties.', 'On January 26, 2012, Cruz filed a fourth Rule 30(b)(6) notice to depose a MERS designee as to the authority of the official who executed the assignment from MERS to ACT', '-3- Properties, and MERS responded by filing a second motion for a protective order. 3 The hearing justice denied the motion for a protective order at a March 27, 2012 hearing, and an order implementing that decision was entered on April 12, 2012. 4 On May 2, 2012, MERS filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to this Court; and, on June 12, 2013, this Court granted the petition, directing the parties to address the issue of Cruz’s standing in light of Bucci v.

Belo Holdings, Inc., 45 A.3d 485, 492 (R.I. 2012) (rebuffing a third party’s attempt to invalidate a contract).', 'This Court first addressed the issue of standing to challenge the assignment of a mortgage in Mruk, where we carved out an exception to the general rule espoused in DePetrillo that third parties do not have standing to challenge a contract.', 'In Mruk, we recognized that our jurisprudence appeared to be dispositive on this issue, but we concluded that those cases were “paint[ed] with too broad a brush.” Mruk, 82 A.3d at 536 (quoting Culhane v. Aurora Loan Services of Nebraska, 708 F.3d 282, 290 (1st Cir. 2013)). Distinguishing Mruk from the typical third party standing case, we reasoned that “the homeowners here are not attempting to assert the rights of one of the contracting parties; instead, the homeowners are asserting their own rights not to have their homes unlawfully foreclosed upon.” Id. Consequently, we found that the homeowners had standing to “challenge the assignment of mortgages on their homes to the extent necessary to contest the foreclosing entity’s authority to foreclose.” Id. We cautioned, however, that this holding should be narrowly construed to encompass only those situations where a mortgagor challenges an “‘invalid, ineffective, or void’ assignment of the mortgage.” Id. (quoting Culhane, 708 F.3d at 291). Moreover, we agreed that mortgagors do “not have standing to challenge shortcomings in an assignment that render it merely voidable at the election of one party but otherwise effective to pass legal title.” Id. (quoting Culhane, 708 F.3d at 291).', 'The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit recently limited standing to challenges of assignments that are void, as opposed to voidable, in Wilson v. HSBC Mortgage', '-6- Services, Inc., 744 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2014). 5 In Wilson, the First Circuit explained that a plaintiff has standing to challenge an “assignment as void because success on the merits would prove the purported assignee is not, in fact, the mortgagee and therefore lacks any right to foreclose on the mortgage.” Id. at 9. The First Circuit acknowledged, however, that a homeowner does not have standing “to claim the assignment is voidable because the assignee still would have received legal title vis-[à]-vis the homeowner.” Id. As a result, even successfully proving that an assignment is voidable “would not affect the rights as between those two parties or provide the homeowner with a defense to the foreclosure action.” Id.', 'Our case law regarding the distinction between void and voidable contracts is consistent with the First Circuit’s reasoning in Wilson. We have long held that a void contract is a nullity, but that a voidable contract affects only one party and “may be either ratified or rescinded at that party’s election.” Moura v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 90 A.3d 852, 857 (R.I. 2014). In Bishop v. Kent & Stanley Co., 20 R.I. 680, 684-85, 41 A. 255, 257 (1898), we held that a contract executed beyond the scope of the signer’s authority was not void, but instead that it was voidable at the election of the corporation. The Bishop Court applied that principle to mortgage assignments and concluded that a mortgage is voidable only by the mortgagee even in the absence of signer authority. Id.', 'Distinguishing void from voidable contracts, the First Circuit similarly reasoned that a corporate officer acting outside the scope of his or her authority creates a voidable contract that can legally be ratified by the corporation. Wilson, 744 F.3d at 10. A void contract is one that cannot be enforced, and in the mortgage context, a void assignment “is one in which the putative 5', 'Although, up to now, this Court has not fully adopted Wilson, the First Circuit’s analysis has been cited with approval in both Moura v.

Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 102 A.3d 636, 640 n.4 (R.I. 2014).', '-7- assignor ‘never properly held the mortgage and, thus, had no interest to assign.’” Id. (quoting Culhane, 708 F.3d at 291). In Wilson, the First Circuit further acknowledged that a challenge to a mortgage assignment on the ground that the assignor “never possessed a legally transferrable interest” alleges a void, as opposed to voidable, assignment. Id. (quoting Woods v. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., 733 F.3d 349, 354 (1st Cir. 2013)).', 'It is in the context of adopting the First Circuit’s rationale in Wilson that we apply the void versus voidable analysis to the facts of the present case. In her notices to depose, Cruz made it clear that she intended to obtain information relating to the authority of certain officials, specifically Mr. Nolan, to execute the mortgage assignment from MERS to ACT Properties on behalf of MERS. However, even assuming that Cruz can prove that Mr. Nolan lacked the authority to execute the mortgage assignment on behalf of MERS, this would not render the assignment void; instead, the assignment would be voidable at the election of one of the parties to the contract. See Wilson, 744 F.3d at 10 (“[W]hen a corporate officer acts beyond the scope of his authority, ‘[h]is acts in excess of his authority, although voidable by the corporation, legally could be ratified and adopted by it.’”) (quoting Commissioner of Banks v. Tremont Trust Co., 156 N.E. 7, 15 (Mass. 1927)). Because Cruz merely alleges that the assignment is voidable, and because she was not a party to the assignment, she lacks standing to challenge it, and she is not entitled to engage in discovery pertaining to the authority issue. See id. at 9 (“[A] * * * mortgagor does not have standing to challenge shortcomings in an assignment that render it merely voidable at the election of one party but otherwise effective * * *.”) (quoting Culhane, 708 F.3d at 291). 6 6', 'In her complaint, Cruz alleged that the assignments in the present case were fraudulently prepared. Pursuant to Rule 9(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, however, allegations of fraud must be stated with particularity to provide the basis for a claim. Cf.', '-8-', 'We are of the opinion that the hearing justice’s endorsement of standing through a denial of the defendant’s motion for a protective order was an error of law. The challenge to Mr. Nolan’s authority should have been treated as an allegation that the assignment was, at most, voidable. As such, it is our opinion that the hearing justice should have granted the motion for a protective order.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'Accordingly, the hearing justice’s denial of the motion for a protective order is quashed, and the matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion. Langadinos v. American Airlines, Inc., 199 F.3d 68, 73 (1st Cir. 2000) (“In all averments of fraud * * *, the circumstances constituting fraud * * * shall be stated with particularity.”) (quoting Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure); see also North American Catholic Educational Programming Foundation, Inc. v.

In the present case, Cruz has failed to allege facts that would elicit an inference of fraudulent intent; and, as a result, she has failed to sufficiently allege fraud. See Hayduk v. Lanna, 775 F.2d 441, 444 (1st Cir. 1985) (“[M]ere allegations of fraud * * * are too conclusional to satisfy the particularity requirement, no matter how many times such accusations are repeated.”).

The plaintiff, Virginia B. Kinder 1 (plaintiff), appeals from a Superior Court judgment which declared that Jil Westcott (defendant) had established the existence of an express easement appurtenant. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda submitted by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and that this case should be decided without further briefing or argument. Because we hold, pursuant to the express terms of the recorded instrument creating the easement, that the easement was freely assignable and appurtenant to the defendant’s land, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'Virginia B. Kinder passed away while this appeal was pending; Edward Austin—her nephew and co-executor of her estate—is substituted as plaintiff.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The plaintiff currently owns a parcel of land located at 158 Poppasquash Road, Bristol, Rhode Island, designated as assessors plat No. 182, lot No. 9 (lot No. 9). Additionally, plaintiff owns real property designated as assessors plat No. 182, lot No. 6 (lot No. 6). The defendant currently owns a lot located at 153 Poppasquash Road, Bristol, Rhode Island, designated as assessors plat No. 182, lot No. 15 (lot No. 15). This controversy arose from an easement over a sixteen-foot wide right-of-way that runs along a driveway on lot No. 9 and a portion of lot No. 6. The easement allows access to Poppasquash Road from defendant’s property.', 'The following brief history sets forth the facts relevant to this appeal. In 1952, Ralph F. Kinder (Ralph), 2 plaintiff’s late husband, conveyed lot No. 15 to his brother Joseph C. Kinder (Joseph). Ralph and plaintiff owned lot No. 9 in a joint tenancy; and Ralph, individually, owned lot No. 6. On March 18, 1961, Ralph and plaintiff executed a grant of an easement, in favor of Joseph. The easement was sixteen feet in width, extended from lot No. 15 over portions of lots Nos. 6 and 9, and provided Joseph with access to Poppasquash Road from lot No. 15. The instrument contains the following pertinent language:', '“JOSEPH C.

Joseph died in 1986, but his wife, Shirley N. Kinder (Shirley), and their children continued to use the easement across lots Nos. 6 and 9 for access to lot No. 15.', 'In 2002, Shirley passed away and her estate became the owner of lot No. 15. Later in 2002, the Town of Bristol approved the merger of lot No. 15 with lot No. 17, thus creating a buildable lot. On June 28, 2004, Shirley’s son, in his capacity as executor of Shirley’s estate, conveyed this lot—now designated as lot No. 15—to defendant. A few years later, defendant constructed a home on lot No. 15, and her family began using the right-of-way across lots Nos. 6 and 9 to access Poppasquash Road from their property. 3 In 2012, plaintiff sent cease-and-desist letters to defendant, demanding that defendant stop using the right-of-way.', 'On September 10, 2012, plaintiff filed this action, seeking a declaratory judgment to quiet title to the right-of-way and damages for trespass. The defendant counterclaimed that her right of access derived from an instrument expressly granting the owner of lot No. 15 an easement appurtenant. Subsequently, defendant moved for summary judgment, asserting that she had an express easement permitting her to travel on the right-of-way.', 'In opposition to summary 3', 'The plaintiff asserts that, during construction of defendant’s home, the contractors did not use the right-of-way across lots Nos. 6 and 9; instead, plaintiff states that the contractors accessed lot No. 15 through property owned by Joseph and Shirley’s son.', '-3- judgment, plaintiff submitted an affidavit declaring that plaintiff, as grantor, did not intend for the easement to run with the land; instead, she intended the easement to serve only Joseph and his family.', 'On October 1, 2013, a hearing on defendant’s motion for summary judgment was held in Providence County Superior Court. The defendant argued that the language in the instrument that created the easement was clear and unambiguous, citing the habendum clause 4 which stated, “To Have and to Hold the same unto Grantee, his executors, administrators, heirs and assigns, as appurtenant to said lands of Grantee and every part thereof.” (Emphasis added.) Conversely, plaintiff argued that the instrument was ambiguous because the language in the granting clause— which omitted “heirs and assigns”—conflicted with the language in the habendum clause. According to plaintiff, this ambiguity requires extrinsic evidence on the grantors’ intent when construing the document. The plaintiff contends that the grantors did not intend for the easement to run with the land.', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel, the trial justice found that the language in the instrument created an express easement in favor of Joseph and his heirs and assigns. Specifically, the trial justice noted that both the definition of grantee and the language of the habendum clause referenced the grantee’s “heirs and assigns.” He concluded that this was clear and convincing evidence that the easement would be for the benefit of Joseph’s heirs and assigns and was appurtenant to the dominant estate. Accordingly, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion for summary judgment from which plaintiff timely appealed. 4', '“The introductory words to the [habendum] clause are ordinarily to have and to hold.” Black’s Law Dictionary 825 (10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added).', '-4-', 'Issue on Appeal', 'Before this Court, plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred in granting summary judgment, arguing that the creation of an easement appurtenant involves questions of fact.

When interpreting an instrument that purportedly creates an easement, this Court must effectuate the intent of the parties. See Carpenter v. Hanslin, 900 A.2d 1136, 1147 (R.I. 2006). When construing its provisions, this Court examines the entire deed. See Bradish v. Sullivan, 54 R.I. 434, 440, 173 A. 117, 119 (1934). However, when the provisions of a written', '-5- agreement are clear and unambiguous, such provisions “‘can be interpreted and applied to the undisputed facts as a matter of law’” and “neither oral testimony nor extrinsic evidence will be received to explain the nature of extent of the rights acquired.” Carpenter, 900 A.2d at 1147 (quoting Mattos v. Seaton, 839 A.2d 553, 557 (R.I. 2004)).', '“[T]o create an easement by express grant, there must be a writing containing plain and direct language evincing the grantor’s intent to create a right in the nature of an easement rather than a license.” Pelletier, 46 A.3d at 36 (quoting 25 Am. Jur. 2d Easements and Licenses § 15 at 513 (2004)). In the case before us, the language in the deed is clear and unambiguous. The first paragraph of the instrument defines the term “grantee” to include “his executors, administrators, heirs and assigns[.]” 5 (Emphasis added.) Even though the granting clause 6 does not specifically include the words “heirs and assigns,” that clause must be read in harmony with this definition which includes the grantee’s heirs and assigns. In fact, because the definition of grantee also embraced the grantee’s “heirs and assigns,” repeating the terms in the granting clause would amount to surplusage. 5', 'The exact language in the definition clause states: “JOSEPH C.

65,"Imperial Capital Bank v. : Main and West, LLC et al. :",non-criminal,not affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. Main and West, LLC, Thomas C. Riley, and Deborah J. Stebenne (collectively, defendants) appeal from the entry of summary judgment in the Superior Court in favor of City National Bank (plaintiff or CNB). Judgment entered in the sum of $348,243.24, plus interest, costs, and attorney’s fees for a deficiency on a promissory note. This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on December 4, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. After carefully reviewing the record, we are satisfied that this appeal may be resolved without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the decision of the Superior Court and remand for a new hearing on plaintiff’s summary-judgment motion.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On October 27, 2004, Imperial Capital Bank (Imperial) extended a loan (the loan) to Main and West, LLC (Main and West) in the principal sum of $607,500. That same day, Main and West signed a promissory note (the note), as security for the loan. Also, Thomas C. Riley and Deborah J. Stebenne personally guaranteed the loan (the guaranty). Under the terms of the', '-1- note, Main and West was obligated to make monthly payments in accordance with a schedule set forth in the note.', 'Apparently, Main and West failed to make the monthly payments and defaulted on the note. After the default, plaintiff—who had acquired the loan after Imperial dissolved in 2009—filed suit seeking full payment of defendants’ outstanding obligations. 1 The plaintiff contended (1) that it was the holder of the note and the guaranty; (2) that defendants failed to make payments and defaulted under the terms of those instruments; and (3) that defendants owed plaintiff the principal sum of $386,898.24, plus interest, under the note and the guaranty.', 'On June 8, 2012, plaintiff moved for summary judgment and, in support of its motion, submitted an affidavit from Jason Baker (Baker), a Vice President of CNB. 2 The plaintiff asserted that CNB had acquired the loan, the note, and the guaranty from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC), which had been appointed as Imperial’s receiver when Imperial closed in 2009. The plaintiff also argued that the FDIC, under a limited power of attorney, had indorsed the note and assigned the mortgage securing the note to plaintiff. Thus, plaintiff avowed that no material facts were in dispute and its motion for summary judgment should be granted.', 'Subsequently, defendants sent plaintiff a discovery request, seeking that plaintiff designate individuals to testify on sixty-seven topics and produce over one hundred documents. The plaintiff moved for a protective order, arguing that some of the subject matter and document requests sought to be discovered involved schedules and exhibits about the purchase and 1', 'The plaintiff’s original complaint alleged that it was the successor-in-interest to Imperial. However, plaintiff amended its complaint, clarifying that it “acquired its interest [directly] from the FDIC and not as an acquisition of Imperial * * *.” 2', 'The plaintiff attached, to Baker’s affidavit, a copy of the note, an allonge, a limited power of attorney, the guaranty, and an assignment.', '-2- assumption agreement entered into by plaintiff and the FDIC. The plaintiff alleged that these schedules and exhibits contained information about other borrowers that was “highly sensitive, confidential, and irrelevant to the instant action.” The defendants filed a motion to compel, and, on September 17, 2012, a magistrate of the Superior Court granted plaintiff’s motion for a protective order and denied defendants’ motion to compel.', 'On October 16, 2012, a trial justice of the Superior Court heard arguments on plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment. The defendants argued that a question of fact existed as to whether the FDIC obtained defendants’ loan from Imperial and, if so, whether their loan was in fact sold to plaintiff. The plaintiff argued that no question of fact existed as to whether the loan had been transferred, citing Baker’s affidavit which attested to that fact. Additionally, according to plaintiff, an allonge and assignment also were attached to the affidavit, which indicated that the loan had been assigned to plaintiff. After hearing counsels’ arguments and reviewing the allonge, assignment, and affidavit, the trial justice found that summary judgment was appropriate in this case. However, rather than grant summary judgment, the trial justice conditioned the order on the production of a protected document—to be reviewed in camera—which, plaintiff argued, would also establish that the loan had been transferred to CNB. 3', 'After reviewing the document in camera and denying defense counsel’s request to view the document, the trial justice then granted summary judgment.', 'The defendants timely appealed. 4 Before this Court, defendants assert that the trial justice erred in granting plaintiff’s 3', 'It was disclosed at oral argument that the document reviewed in camera by the trial justice was a redacted Schedule 4.15A and 4.15B of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement between the FDIC and plaintiff. 4', 'Although defendants prematurely filed a notice of appeal on November 14, 2012, final judgment eventually entered.

Although a trial justice may examine materials in camera, in order “to prevent the discovery or use of evidence, consideration of in camera submissions to determine the merits of litigation is allowable only when the submissions involve compelling national security concerns or the statute granting the cause of action specifically provides for in camera resolution of the dispute.” Id. None of those circumstances are present in this case.', 'Here, the trial justice apparently conditioned the order granting summary judgment upon his review—in camera—of a document that had been previously deemed protected and nondiscoverable. The trial justice failed to provide defense counsel with an opportunity to review the document, even though the document had been redacted so that only information pertaining to the transfer of Main and West’s loan was included.', 'When finally granting plaintiff’s motion, the trial justice stated that, “[b]ased on the submissions and reviewing the entire document, [in camera,] the [c]ourt is satisfied that the bank has shown that this loan was, in fact, transferred.” The trial justice reiterated that, “based on the [c]ourt’s in camera review, the summary judgment motion is granted.” We deem this error. 6', 'We have found no case in this jurisdiction which addresses defendants’ argument. However, Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure is patterned on Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

66,,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. These consolidated appeals arise out of a decision of the Superior Court issuing various declaratory and injunctive relief in a highly contested labor dispute between the Town of North Kingstown (town) and the North Kingstown Firefighters, Local 1651, International Association of Firefighters, AFL-CIO (union). For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm in part and reverse in part the decision of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'A', 'The 2010 Expired Collective Bargaining Agreement', 'On June 30, 2010, a labor contract that had been in effect between the town and the union since July 1, 2007, expired. Prior to the expiration of that agreement, the parties had attempted to negotiate a successor contract, but to no avail. Subsequently, an interest arbitration panel was convened to set forth the terms of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the parties. After thirteen days of hearings and after sifting through 172 exhibits and 357 pages of post-', '-1- hearing briefs, the panel issued an award on August 9, 2011. The panel’s award was retroactive, covering the period from July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011. 1', 'One of the more critical and contentious issues that arose during this interest arbitration was the town’s proposal to reorganize from a four-platoon structure to a three-platoon structure. 2 The town made clear at the arbitration that, if allowed to effectuate this reorganization, it would not press other of its proposals that would have made structural changes to the operation of the fire department. However, the town’s proposal on this issue was rejected by the panel, and the award provided for the same work schedule as the prior CBA.', 'B', 'Implementation of the Three-Platoon Structure and North Kingstown I', 'On February 23, 2011, the union wrote to the North Kingstown town manager requesting that collective bargaining negotiations commence for a new CBA year 2011-2012 in accordance with G.L. 1956 § 28-9.1-6. The parties exchanged a series of communications and eventually on October 28, 2011, met to bargain for a successor agreement. Five additional negotiating sessions were conducted, but the parties were unable to reach an agreement. Throughout the negotiations, the key issue of contention between the parties was the implementation of the three-platoon structure and the accompanying twenty-four hours on, forty-eight hours off work schedule. At the end of the sessions, no agreement was reached, and no issues were submitted to interest arbitration.', 'On December 19, 2011, the town wrote to the union indicating that it intended to introduce an ordinance to reorganize the fire department. Two subsequent negotiating sessions 1', 'The Firefighters Arbitration Act (FFAA or the Act) restricts a panel award to one year. See G.L. 1956 § 28-9.1-12. 2', 'To carry out this reorganization, the town set forth a proposal to increase the average workweek from forty-two hours to fifty-six hours and to change the schedule to include a twenty-four hour on-shift followed by a forty-eight hour off-shift.', '-2- were conducted. However, no agreement was reached. Then, on January 30, 2012, the town council enacted, in amended form, an ordinance that authorized the town’s desired implementation of the department reorganization. Another negotiating session was held after that, but no agreement was reached.', 'On February 28, 2012, the union filed suit in the Washington County Superior Court seeking: (1) a declaratory judgment that the ordinance was invalid because it was passed in violation of the town charter; (2) a declaratory judgment that the town violated the Firefighters Arbitration Act (FFAA or the Act) and the State Labor Relations Act (SLRA); and (3) injunctive relief. Prior to issuing a decision on the merits, the Superior Court ordered the parties to engage in mediation, which failed to resolve the matter.', 'On March 11, 2012, the town began implementing the ordinance, including the three-platoon structure and accompanying schedule.', 'On May 23, 2012, the Superior Court issued a written decision declaring that, because it was passed in violation of the town charter, the ordinance was invalid. See International Association of Firefighters, Local 1651, AFL-CIO v. Town of North Kingstown, WC 2012-127, 2012 WL 1948338 (R.I. Super. Ct. May 23, 2012) (North Kingstown I). Additionally, the Superior Court found that, even if that ordinance had been properly passed, it was still “invalid because it conflicts with the FFAA by imposing changes to wages, hours, and terms and conditions of employment without first bargaining to agreement or following the FFAA’s statutory arbitration procedures.” However, the Superior Court explicitly recognized that:', '“[T]he platoon structure of the Fire Department is a management right that may', 'be properly asserted at the expiration of the CBA [and that] [g]oing forward the', 'parties may agree to a new CBA that addresses the effects of this management', 'change on mandatory bargaining subjects or proceed to interest arbitration, solely', 'to determine the effects on mandatory bargaining subjects and not the', 'management decision itself.”', '-3- Nevertheless, the court found that “unilateral implementation of changes to wages, hours and terms and conditions of employment” was improper.', 'C', 'North Kingstown II', 'Prior to the Superior Court’s decision in North Kingstown I, on February 23, 2012, the union wrote to the town manager requesting bargaining for the contract year July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013. Additionally, on March 14, 2012, the union filed a demand for interest arbitration for the July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012 contract period and an arbitration panel was named (AAA Case 11 390 00469 12) (2011-2012 Arbitration Panel). Also, the union later filed a demand for interest arbitration for the July 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013 contract period and another arbitration panel was named (AAA Case 11 390 01035 12) (2012-2013 Arbitration Panel). On June 14, 2012, the union filed an unfair labor practice (ULP) charge with the State Labor Relations Board (SLRB) (ULP-6088). On July 9, 2012, the town filed a demand for interest arbitration over the effects of the three-platoon structure reorganization and a third arbitration panel was named (AAA Case 11 390 01169 12) (Effects Arbitration Panel). 3 On August 2, 2012, the SLRB issued a complaint against the town, alleging that the manner in which the town implemented the three-platoon structure violated state law.', 'On September 5, 2012, the town filed a verified complaint in the Superior Court seeking declarations that:', '(1) the SLRB was without jurisdiction to enforce ULP-6088;', '(2) the town’s actions in implementing the three-platoon structure were lawful;', '(3) jurisdiction to determine the effects of the town’s decision to implement the', 'three-platoon structure rests exclusively with the Effects Arbitration Panel; 3', 'The town later, on November 5, 2012, withdrew this demand for arbitration.', '-4-', '(4) the union waived its right to submit to interest arbitration the unresolved', 'issues arising out of the parties’ negotiations for a CBA for the July 1, 2011', 'through June 30, 2012 period; and', '(5) the 2011-2012 Arbitration Panel was without jurisdiction to decide any', 'unresolved issues between the parties for the July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012', 'period. The town also sought to stay the 2011-2012 Arbitration Panel and a declaration that the SLRB was without jurisdiction to enforce ULP-6088.

The town also sought to stay the 2012-2013 Arbitration Panel.', 'At the time these actions were filed, the town was continuing to operate under the three- platoon structure. The town’s position before the Superior Court was that it had the inherent right to reorganize into the three-platoon structure, especially in light of the fact that the CBA had expired and the union had failed to request interest arbitration of unresolved issues within the time frame delineated by the FFAA as set forth in § 28-9.1-7. Additionally, the town', '-5- contended that the union had forfeited its right to collectively bargain altogether due to the union’s failure to comply with the notice provision of § 28-9.1-13.', 'Both parties filed memoranda addressing the issues pending before the Superior Court. In order to simplify and clarify the issues that needed to be addressed, the Superior Court held a conference in accordance with Rule 16 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The parties were instructed to agree to the most significant issues that needed to be addressed. Pursuant to this instruction, the parties submitted a statement to the Superior Court indicating that “the parties agree[d] that the following issues [were] before the Court for decision.”', 'The issues presented were:', '(1) Decide the town’s petition/motion to stay the 2011-2012 Arbitration Panel;', '(2) Decide the town’s petition/motion to stay the arbitration of Certain Firefighter', 'Grievances;', '(3) Decide the town’s request for a stay of ULP-6088;', '(4) Decide the town’s petition/motion to stay the 2012-2013 Arbitration Panel;', '(5) Decide the town’s request for a declaration that the town’s implementation of', 'the three-platoon structure was lawful;', '(6) Decide whether the town bargained with the union to impasse over the effects', 'of the three-platoon structure before unilaterally changing the work schedules and', 'shifts; and', '(7) If not, decide whether the town has the right to implement a three-platoon', 'structure without first bargaining with the union to impasse over the effects of the', 'change. On December 14, 2012, the Superior Court issued a written decision that addressed some, but not all, of the matters presented in the parties’ list of issues. See Town of North Kingstown v. International Association of Firefighters, Local 1651, AFL-CIO, WC 2012-542, 2012 WL 6638703 (R.I. Super. Ct.

On February 4, 2013, 4 the Superior Court entered an order setting forth the following five declarations issued in the decision:', '“(1) The Town’s actions in implementing unilateral changes to the wages, hours,', 'and terms and conditions of employment, were unlawful, in violation of the', 'doctrine of election of remedies and the terms of the FFAA.', '(2) The SLRB, and not [the Superior Court], has jurisdiction over the subject', 'matter of the Complaint in ULP-6088 insofar as it is necessary to determine', 'which terms and conditions have existed between the parties since the expiration', 'of the previous CBA.', '(3) The arbitration panel does not have jurisdiction to determine the effects of said', 'unilateral changes, as those changes are invalid and must be undone.', '(4) Both the Union and the Town waived their rights to submit unresolved issues', 'to interest arbitration under the FFAA, pursuant to R.I.

At that same hearing, the hearing justice denied the town’s motion to stay the order pending appeal.', 'In accordance with Article I, Rule 8 of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure, the town moved in this Court for a stay of the order pending appeal.

In particular, on September 27, 2013, the SLRB issued a decision and order in ULP-6088 concluding that the town had committed unfair labor practices by failing to bargain in good faith and unilaterally implementing its reorganization in violation of the FFAA. See In re Rhode Island State Labor Relations Board and the Town of North Kingstown, ULP-6088, 2013 WL 5755149 (R.I. Lab. Rel. Bd. Sept. 27, 2013).

In Town of Tiverton v. Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge # 23, 118 R.I. 160, 163, 372 A.2d 1273, 1275 (1977), this Court analyzed a provision under the Municipal Police Arbitration Act (MPAA) 8 that is identical to a provision in the FFAA.

We found unavailing the union’s argument that there were other ad-hoc ways in which the town could appropriate money that were separate from the date of the financial town meeting, noting that the “statute is clearly designed for the ordinary course of events.” Id.', 'Further, we stated that the statute in question operated “like an appeals statute, condition[ing] rights thereunder on full compliance with the stated requirements.” Town of Tiverton, 118 R.I. at 165, 372 A.2d at 1276.

As such, we held that because the union’s notice was not timely, “the town was not obliged to negotiate with the [union] on any issues falling within the purview of § 28-9.2-13.” Town of Tiverton, 118 R.I. at 166-67, 372 A.2d at 1276.', 'Here, the Superior Court justice correctly recognized that it was “clear that the Union did not give the required notice prior to the 120-day time frame.” 9 Notwithstanding, he declined to find that the union had forfeited its right to bargain over matters requiring the appropriation of money. He put particular significance on the fact that the parties actually negotiated after receipt of the defective notice. This emphasis was misplaced. In Town of Tiverton, 118 R.I. at 163, 372 A.2d at 1275, the parties also entered into negotiations after receipt of the union’s defective notice. Notwithstanding that fact, we held that the union’s failure to comply with the statutory directives was fatal, and that the town could not be compelled to negotiate with the union regarding any matter requiring the appropriation of money. Id. at 166-67, 372 A.2d at 1276. We discern no legally distinguishable difference from what occurred here. 10 Accordingly, we hold that the union’s failure to comply with § 28-9.1-13 vitiated any obligation of the town to bargain regarding any matter requiring the appropriation of money. 9', 'The union argues that under the town’s charter it is possible to appropriate money in ways other than through the approval of the town’s final budget. We rejected this type of argument in Town of Tiverton v. Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge # 23, 118 R.I. 160, 166, 372 A.2d 1273, 1276 (1977). We reject the same here as well. Section 1008 of the town’s ordinances provides that the ordinary date for final approval of the town’s budget is the “first Wednesday in May.” In 2011, the date that was 120 days in advance of the first Wednesday in May was January 4, 2011. However, the union did not request bargaining until February 23, 2011, which was over a month after the 120-day deadline. Therefore, the union’s request was not timely. 10', 'The union attaches significant weight to our recognition in Town of Tiverton, 118 R.I. at 163, 372 A.2d at 1275, that the town entered negotiations “[u]nder protest.” In that case, the town had already been ordered by the Superior Court to enter into negotiations. Id. Thus, the town’s protest in that case should simply be read as acknowledging that the town complied with the Superior Court’s order pending appeal to this Court. See id. That fact, however, does not alter our analysis and the conclusion that here the town was not obligated to bargain with the union on “any issues falling within the purview of [§ 28-9.1-13].” Town of Tiverton, 118 R.I. at 166-67, 372 A.2d at 1276.', '- 16 -', 'Our analysis does not end here, however. While the union’s failure to comply with § 28- 9.1-13 removed any obligation the town had to bargain regarding any matter requiring the appropriation of money, it still remained that the town was required, upon proper notice, to bargain regarding other matters. See § 28-9.1-6. Such bargaining did in fact occur. Section 28- 9.1-7 provides that:', '“In the event that the bargaining agent and the corporate authorities are unable,', 'within thirty (30) days from and including the date of their first meeting, to reach', 'an agreement on a contract, any and all unresolved issues shall be submitted to', 'arbitration.” Here, the parties’ first meeting took place on October 28, 2011; therefore, any unresolved issues must have been submitted to arbitration within thirty days from that date. The union did not demand interest arbitration until March 14, 2012, which was well beyond the thirty-day time frame. Accordingly, the hearing justice correctly found that the union failed to timely submit any unresolved issues pursuant to § 28-9.1-7.', 'The union argues that the parties mutually agreed to extend the period for negotiations. In Lime Rock Fire District v. Rhode Island State Labor Relations Board, 673 A.2d 51, 52 (R.I. 1996), we acknowledged that the parties had expressly “agreed in writing to extend the deadline for negotiations.” (Emphasis added.) Thus, we considered the deadline to be thirty days from the date to which the parties had expressly agreed to extend their negotiations. Id. at 54. In contrast, here the hearing justice found that there was no evidence that the parties expressly agreed to either any particular time frame for negotiations or an extension of such a time frame to a particular point. We find no error in that determination. Cf. Marshall Contractors, Inc. v. Brown University, 692 A.2d 665, 670 (R.I. 1997) (stating that generally “when contract negotiations materialize into a mutual understanding and resulting binding contract is ordinarily a question of fact for the factfinder”). Without an express agreement to extend the deadline, the', '- 17 - hearing justice was correct in determining that the deadline of § 28-9.1-7 could not be extended. See Lime Rock Fire District, 673 A.2d at 54. Therefore, because the union 11 failed to timely “submit[ ] unresolved issues to arbitration within the designated period, it has waived its right to pursue that remedy.” Id.', 'In Lime Rock Fire District, 673 A.2d at 52, the town’s fire district laid off an entire class of employees. Without any evidence to the contrary, we assumed that the union complied with § 28-9.1-13 and timely requested bargaining on matters requiring the appropriation of money. Lime Rock Fire District, 673 A.2d at 53. We further assumed that both parties appropriately offered proposed changes in contractual provisions during bargaining. Id.; see § 28-9.1-17. Further, we recognized that “the status of the fire fighters’ jobs was clearly an unresolved issue that could have been * * * brought to arbitration * * *.” Lime Rock Fire District, 673 A.2d at 54; see § 28-9.1-3(3). However, in light of the union’s failure to timely submit any unresolved issues (i.e. provisions regarding “the status of the fire fighters’ jobs”) to arbitration, we did not find the fire district’s unilateral action to be unlawful. Lime Rock Fire District, 673 A.2d at 54.', 'Additionally, in Lime Rock Fire District, 673 A.2d at 53, we recognized “the significance of arbitration in the procedural framework of the FFAA.” Construing § 28-9.1-2(c) and § 28- 9.1-12 together, we noted that “‘the firefighters who are subject to [the FFAA’s] terms shall have no right to engage in any work stoppage, slowdown, or strike, the consideration for the provision being the right to a resolution of disputed questions’ through the ‘method of arbitration.’” Lime Rock Fire District, 673 A.2d at 53 (quoting §§ 28-9.1-2(c) and 28-9.1-12). Failure to avail itself of this right exposes a union to potentially drastic outcomes.

We discuss that determination infra.', '- 18 -', 'Here, it is our opinion that the town’s actions in implementing its decision to change to a three-platoon structure were lawful under the circumstances before us in this case. We reach this determination based on the union’s failure to timely comply with § 28-9.1-13, its failure to timely submit unresolved issues to arbitration pursuant to § 28-9.1-7, and our reliance on both our own precedent and that of other courts. Critical to this holding is that the union had knowledge that the town had proposed to implement the three-platoon structure as early as the negotiations and hearings before the arbitration panel for the July 1, 2010 to June 30, 2011 contract year. Additionally, the union was put on formal notice at least as early as the first negotiation session on October 28, 2011, regarding matters pertaining to the 2011-2012 contract year, of the town’s proposal to implement the three-platoon structure.', 'In Town of Burrillville, 921 A.2d at 116, the town sought to change the procedure for police officers’ receipt of injured-on-duty (IOD) benefits. The town and the union discussed the contents of the proposed change. Id. at 120. Despite the fact that only approximately one week had passed between the time the town informed the union of the proposed change and the implementation of the proposed change, we found that the union had “received more than adequate notice about the contents of [the] proposed [change], but it failed to request bargaining after receiving such notice.” Id. We held that “a union with sufficient notice of a contemplated change waives its bargaining rights if it fails to request bargaining prior to the implementation of that change.” Id. At that point, the SLRB had already opined that the issue, i.e. receipt of IOD benefits, was a “mandatory subject[ ] for bargaining.” Id. at 117. 12 Nevertheless, in light of the union’s waiver, we held that the town was free to implement the proposed change. Id. at 121. 12', 'Because of our determination of waiver, we did not address the town’s argument that receipt of IOD benefits was not a mandatory subject of collective bargaining.

It is certainly arguable that these facts alone may have justified the town in implementing its decision to reorganize in a three-platoon structure. 13 See Town of Burrillville, 921 A.2d at 120; Town of Tiverton, 118 R.I. at 166-67, 372 A.2d at 1276. Without doubt, however, because: (1) the union had knowledge of the town’s desire to implement the three-platoon structure from the previous year’s negotiations; (2) the union failed to timely comply with § 28-9.1-13; (3) the town formally proposed the implementation of the three-platoon structure at the October 28, 2011, negotiating session; and (4) the union failed to timely submit unresolved issues to interest arbitration pursuant to § 28-9.1-7, the town’s implementation of its decision to reorganize in a three-platoon structure was lawful.

The petitioners, former Providence Mayor Vincent A. Cianci, Jr. and former Chief of the Providence Fire Department James Rattigan, seek review on certiorari of an order by the Superior Court denying without prejudice their motion for summary judgment.1 The underlying dispute arose after the respondents, Theodore J. Fabrizio, Jr. and Stephen J. Deninno, two Providence firefighters, objected to orders from their superiors that they serve as part of the crew of a fire engine in the 2001 Pride Parade.2 Following their unwilling 1', 'Although both Vincent A. Cianci, Jr., and James F. Rattigan do not presently hold their former offices as Mayor and Fire Chief, for the sake of narrative clarity we shall hereinafter refer to them simply by the titles which they held at the time of the 2001 Pride Parade that gave rise to the instant jarndycean piece of litigation. 2', 'The Rhode Island Pride Commission, the Pride Parade’s sponsor, is a nonprofit organization the goal of which is “celebrating the pride and diversity of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgendered community of Rhode Island and southern New England.” About Us, RHODE ISLAND PRIDE, http://www.prideri.com/ (last visited December 19, 2014).', '-1- participation in the parade, the respondents sued the petitioners, as well as the City of Providence, on a variety of state and federal claims. Mayor Cianci and Chief Rattigan moved for summary judgment on two of those claims (viz., Counts Six and Seven; see infra), invoking the venerable doctrine of qualified immunity from suit.3 After entertaining argument in open court, the hearing justice opined that further development of the pertinent facts was warranted; accordingly, he denied the motion for summary judgment, but he specifically stated that the denial was without prejudice.', 'For the reasons set forth below, we quash the judgment of the Superior Court and remand with instructions that petitioners’ motion for summary judgment be granted.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel4', 'In 2001, Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. Deninno were employed by the Providence Fire Department, Mr. Fabrizio as a firefighter and Mr. Deninno as a captain. Both men served in Engine Company No. 7, a company based at the North Main Street Fire Station. On June 15, 2001, Engine Company No. 7 received a work assignment to drive a fire truck in the 2001 Pride Parade the next day. Nothing in the record indicates that assignments of this type were at all uncommon.5 It is further uncontested in the record that Engine Company No. 7 was the engine 3', 'Regrettably, the papers containing petitioners’ motion for summary judgment and the accompanying memorandum of law are missing from the record before us. Nonetheless, we have been able to glean from the extant record the essence of their argument. 4', 'There is no material dispute with respect to the facts that we have summarized in the text. 5', 'Chief Rattigan testified in his deposition that fire engine companies had also received orders to participate in parades for other organizations; and the record indicates that the Fire Department used an official “Request for a Fire Company” form for the 2001 Pride Parade.', '-2- company chosen to carry out the 2001 Pride Parade assignment due to its proximity to the parade route, in accordance with the practice of Chief Rattigan.', 'Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. Deninno self-identify as members of the Roman Catholic Church, and they contend that their beliefs as Catholics do not allow them to “support, encourage, nor condone homosexual behavior.”', 'When these two firefighters learned of their company’s assignment, they objected to participating in the parade on the basis of their religious beliefs, expressing their discomfort to the district chief. Notwithstanding the objections of Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. Deninno, Chief Rattigan reiterated his order that they carry out the task assigned. (Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. Deninno also alleged that they were told by others associated with the Fire Department that the order to participate in the parade came directly from Mayor Cianci.) The next day, Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. Deninno reluctantly were part of the crew of Engine Company No. 7 as it took part in the parade pursuant to the June 15, 2001 order. Both firefighters alleged that it was their conviction that to do otherwise would jeopardize their employment status within the Fire Department.', 'Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. Deninno further alleged that, while the parade was ongoing, they experienced sexual harassment, including being subjected to sexual propositions and other offensive remarks. Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. Deninno also claimed that the harassment did not end with the work assignment; they averred that, after their assignment to the parade, they suffered additional sexual harassment at the hands of their coworkers and also received at least sixty profanity-laced anonymous phone calls. Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. Deninno alleged that, despite participating in meetings with the City’s Equal Employment Opportunity Officer, filing formal grievances with their union, and lodging complaints with “upper-level management,” their complaints went unresolved.', '-3-', 'In June of 2004, Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. Deninno filed nearly identical complaints in the Superior Court for Providence County against several defendants––Mayor Cianci, individually and in his official capacity; Chief Rattigan, individually and in his official capacity; and the City of Providence, by and through its treasurer, Stephen Napolitano. The only counts in their complaints that are relevant to this appeal are Count Six (alleging deprivation of the right of freedom of religion under the Rhode Island Constitution) and Count Seven (alleging deprivation of the rights of freedom of speech and association under the Rhode Island Constitution).6 Mr. Fabrizio and Mr. Deninno sought several forms of relief, including declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory and punitive damages.', 'In January of 2012, petitioners, Mayor Cianci and Chief Rattigan, moved for summary judgment on Counts Six and Seven on the basis of qualified immunity.7 The two officials argued that respondents had no clearly established right to “refuse to complete a legitimate work 6', 'All other counts in the complaint were disposed of in favor of Mayor Cianci and Chief Rattigan during earlier stages of the litigation for reasons that are not presently relevant. The original nine counts were as follows: (1) Count One, alleging employment discrimination in violation of the federal Civil Rights Act; (2) Count Two, alleging unlawful discrimination in violation of the state Fair Employment Practices Act; (3) Count Three, alleging unlawful discrimination in violation of the state Civil Rights Act; (4) Count Four, alleging a deprivation of the right to freedom of religion under federal law; (5) Count Five, alleging a deprivation of the right to freedom of speech and association under federal law; (6) Count Six, alleging deprivation of the right of freedom of religion in violation of the Rhode Island Constitution; (7) Count Seven, alleging deprivation of the right of freedom of speech and association in violation of the Rhode Island Constitution; (8) Count Eight, alleging intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (9) Count Nine, alleging negligent infliction of emotional distress. 7', 'Through its ten long years of travel, this case has been removed to federal court, has been remanded by that court, and has survived several dispositive motions in state court––including a partial motion for summary judgment by respondents, a motion for summary judgment on the merits by petitioners, and a motion to dismiss by petitioners. Somewhere along the way, the parties managed to undertake a great deal of discovery; among those whose depositions were taken were Mr. Fabrizio, Mr. Deninno, and Chief Rattigan.', '-4- assignment”––i.e., to refuse to man a fire truck in a parade because of personal moral objections to the task. The respondents vociferously disagreed, arguing in their objection to the motion for summary judgment (1) that qualified immunity was no bar to any injunctive or declaratory relief in their favor; and (2) that, more importantly, in view of what they contended was the applicable test for constitutional violations of the rights of government employees, petitioners could not show that they were qualifiedly immune from suit. After considering the arguments of the respective parties, the hearing justice rendered a bench decision denying the motion. While the hearing justice noted that this Court had alluded to the possible applicability of the doctrine of qualified immunity in earlier cases such as Ensey v. Culhane, 727 A.2d 687 (R.I. 1999) and Pontbriand v. Sundlun, 699 A.2d 856 (R.I. 1997), he did not pass upon the applicability of that doctrine in this case; it was his view that the facts had not yet been sufficiently developed for him to be able to grant petitioners’ motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, the hearing justice denied the motion—albeit without prejudice.', 'Mayor Cianci and Chief Rattigan subsequently filed a petition for review on writ of certiorari. We granted the petition and stayed further Superior Court proceedings pending our review of the matter.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'As a general rule, this Court will not review the denial of a motion for summary judgment, since such an order constitutes an interlocutory decision; and, under our precedent, the non-prevailing party is not entitled to an appeal of right. National Refrigeration, Inc. v. Capital Properties, Inc., 88 A.3d 1150, 1154 (R.I. 2014). However, even though a direct appeal is not available, a non-prevailing party may petition for certiorari with respect to an otherwise nonappealable order. See Fayle v. Traudt, 813 A.2d 58, 61 (R.I. 2003). On occasion, we have', '-5- granted a writ of certiorari following a denial of a motion for summary judgment where no genuine issues of material fact are in dispute, and both parties present purely legal arguments. See, e.g., Henderson v. Nationwide Insurance Co., 35 A.3d 902, 905 (R.I. 2012). Our review on certiorari is confined to determining whether an error of law has occurred. Woodruff v. Gitlow, 91 A.3d 805, 809 (R.I. 2014).', 'We review the denial of a motion for summary judgment de novo, and we use “the same standard of review that applies to a grant of summary judgment.” Woodruff, 91 A.3d at 809 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also National Refrigeration, Inc., 88 A.3d at 1154; Employers Mutual Casualty Co. v. Arbella Protection Insurance Co., 24 A.3d 544, 553 (R.I. 2011). This standard requires us to view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party; and, if we conclude that a genuine issue of material fact exists or that the moving party is not entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we must affirm the denial of summary judgment. See Woodruff, 91 A.3d at 810; see also Morales v. Town of Johnston, 895 A.2d 721, 726-27 (R.I. 2006). See generally Estate of Giuliano v. Giuliano, 949 A.2d 386, 390-91 (R.I. 2008).', 'III', 'Analysis', 'Although petitioners argue that the doctrine of qualified immunity protects them from liability, we have stated that “[g]overnment officials need not avail themselves of the protections of qualified immunity when no constitutional violation is present.” Monahan v. Girouard, 911 A.2d 666, 673-74 (R.I. 2006). Accordingly, we conclude that, in view of the facts of this specific case, it is not necessary to invoke the doctrine of qualified immunity because no constitutional violation occurred.', '-6-', 'Here, respondents received an order to participate in the parade because their engine company was assigned to the task; it is uncontested that such orders were common, as evidenced by Chief Rattigan’s reference to receiving “numerous” requests from parade organizers for Fire Department participation and as reflected in the standard form for such requests used by the Department. After receiving this work assignment from their employer (the regularity of which has not been questioned), respondents participated in the parade merely as relatively anonymous public servants. We are unaware of any pertinent legal authority in support of the proposition that, in such specific circumstances, employees’ rights are violated if they happen to possess religious objections to the beliefs of the group with which an otherwise legitimate work assignment requires brief interaction. See generally Mendoza Toro v. Gil, 110 F. Supp. 2d 28, 35 (D.P.R. 2000) (stating that the plaintiff’s beliefs “[did] not relieve her of her professional obligation to complete legitimate work assignments” and further stating that the plaintiff did not “have a First Amendment right to pick and choose work assignments that suit[ed] her moral beliefs”).', 'The respondents’ appearance in the parade, solely as members of the Providence Fire Department, did not constitute a form of expression on their part. Rather, it was simply the accomplishing of a task assigned to an engine company of the Providence Fire Department, and the individuals chosen to carry out that assignment cannot be said to have engaged in personal speech by carrying out their work as public servants.', 'See generally Hennessy v. City of Melrose, 194 F.3d 237, 245, 246 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting that plaintiffs who allege that they have been discharged for exercising First Amendment rights must show they have engaged in constitutionally protected speech—that is, “commenting upon matters of public concern”) (internal quotation marks omitted).', '-7-', 'As we noted in Monahan, “the first step in evaluating a claim to qualified immunity is to determine whether the plaintiff has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right at all * * *.” Monahan, 911 A.2d at 674 (internal quotation marks omitted). The respondents’ participation in the parade as public servants carrying out a legitimate work assignment was not a deprivation of their constitutional rights.', 'Therefore, as in Monahan, since there was no deprivation of a constitutional right, our analysis rightly can come to an abrupt halt since “the need for [invocation of the doctrine of qualified immunity] no longer exists.” Id.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth herein, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Superior Court is quashed.

Maguire contends that she sustained injuries when she tripped and fell on a public sidewalk. On October 28, 2014, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the plaintiff to appear and show cause why the issues raised should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 19, 2007, plaintiff, who was and is currently disabled, was walking on the sidewalk outside Providence Place Mall (the mall) at 144 Providence Place in Providence, Rhode Island, when her “crutch” slipped into a hole in the pavement, causing her to lose her balance', '-1- and fall to the sidewalk. The plaintiff contended that she suffered injuries as a result of her fall. At that time, the property that abuts the sidewalk at 144 Providence Place was owned by Providence Place Group, L.P., and individual space on the ground floor in close proximity to the fall was leased to Old Navy and Joe’s.', 'On January 22, 2010, plaintiff filed a complaint sounding in negligence against the City of Providence (the city), Stephen Napolitano, in his capacity as Treasurer for the City of Providence and/or his successors, Old Navy, and Joe’s. The complaint also included both state and federal disability claims 1 against the city, Old Navy, and Joe’s, as well as a claim that the city violated Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 704). The complaint alleged that the city was negligent in failing in “its duty to repair, keep, maintain * * * said sidewalk and sidewalk area in a safe condition and oversee and insist that said sidewalk was not in a dangerous and/or negligent condition.” The complaint further alleged that Old Navy and Joe’s each “had a continuing duty to see that the * * * sidewalk was kept in good repair and maintained in good condition so that it did not become and/or remain in negligent and/or dangerous condition, and a duty to warn of its dangerous and/or negligent condition.” The complaint added that Joe’s had a special duty to maintain the sidewalk because it “used said sidewalk to further its business” in that it placed tables and chairs outside the restaurant. Significantly, plaintiff did not allege that defendants were responsible for creating or causing the defects in the sidewalk.', 'On June 25, 2013, Joe’s filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the grounds that responsibility for the maintenance of a public sidewalk rested with the city or the 1', 'The state disability act is codified by G.L. 1956 § 11-24-2.1 and G.L. 1956 chapter 87 of title 42, and the federal disability act is codified by the Americans with Disabilities Act at 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 to 12213.', '-2- State of Rhode Island and that owners or lessees of property abutting public sidewalks do not owe any duty to pedestrians. By virtue of its lack of responsibility for the sidewalk, Joe’s added that any alleged violations of state or federal law concerning plaintiff’s disability were irrelevant. On July 8, 2013, Old Navy filed its own motion for summary judgment, arguing that it owed no duty to plaintiff because its lease obligated the landlord, not the tenant, to repair and maintain common areas including sidewalks. Old Navy also adopted the argument raised by Joe’s that the city was responsible for maintenance of the sidewalk.', 'On August 20, 2013, the hearing justice granted Joe’s and Old Navy’s motions for summary judgment on the ground that the occupant of land may not “be held liable for injuries suffered by pedestrians walking on the sidewalk located in front of their businesses * * *.” 2 He reasoned that the designer and constructor of the sidewalk may have been liable to plaintiff, but that Joe’s and Old Navy did not fit in that category. Rejecting the argument that Joe’s was liable because it used the sidewalk to further its business, the hearing justice found that Joe’s could not have contributed to plaintiff’s fall because there was no evidence that its tables and chairs were on the sidewalk around the time of the accident. He also determined that the leases were clear that neither Joe’s nor Old Navy had any contractual obligation to maintain or repair the sidewalk. Finally, the hearing justice concluded that all disability claims had to be dismissed since neither defendant owed a duty to plaintiff to maintain or repair the sidewalk. The plaintiff filed a timely appeal to this Court on September 6, 2013. 2', 'The matter is still pending with regard to the city, as this case comes before us on partial summary judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. See Coro, Inc. v. R. N.

The plaintiff’s contentions, however, overlook the extensive line of our own authority standing for the proposition that a property owner owes no duty to the public for the condition of an abutting sidewalk when he or she has taken no action to create the dangerous condition. See Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1047 (R.I. 2010) (“It is a well established legal principle in this jurisdiction * * * that a landowner whose property abuts a public way has no duty to repair or maintain it.”); see also Saunders v.

See Wyso, 78 A.3d at 751. In Wyso, we rejected the argument that a duty should be recognized simply because we have decided duty issues on an ad hoc basis in the past. Id. In considering the five-factor approach to assess whether a duty exists in negligence claims, we noted that these factors were meant to be “case specific” instead of binding “in future cases', '-5- involving different factual situations.” Id. (quoting Ferreira v. Strack, 636 A.2d 682, 685 n.2 (R.I. 1994)). As such, we concluded that the defendants owed no duty of care to the plaintiff because the claimed injuries occurred in an area outside the property owner’s control. Id. (citing Ferreira, 636 A.2d at 685). Further, we distinguished Banks on the ground that it was a premises liability case lodged by an invitee on the landowner’s property, as compared to a slip-and-fall on a public sidewalk outside the defendants’ control or possession. Id.', 'Because the facts in this case are nearly identical to those in Wyso, we adopt its reasoning and conclude that Old Navy and Joe’s did not owe a duty to maintain the public sidewalk abutting their establishments. The plaintiff’s claims that defendants owed her a duty to warn are likewise without merit, given that “a property owner who owes no duty of care to an individual also owes no duty to warn those individuals.” Wyso, 78 A.3d at 752 (citing Berman, 991 A.3d at 1048).', 'The plaintiff claims that this case is distinguishable from Wyso because Joe’s “has had control, use, and possession of the subject sidewalk area.” The plaintiff has failed, however, to present the Court with the evidence necessary to substantiate that claim. She failed to produce evidence that Joe’s designed, developed, repaired, or altered the abutting sidewalk, and she similarly failed to produce evidence that Joe’s periodic use of a small portion of the sidewalk during the summer months created the defect that caused her fall. Moreover, the plaintiff admitted at her own deposition that there were no tables or chairs outside Joe’s on that March day. Without such evidence, there is no basis for this tribunal to conclude that the defendants could have caused the defect, and the plaintiff’s claim that there remain genuine issues of material fact as to control, use, and possession must fail. See Saunders, 118 R.I. at 32, 371 A.2d at 274 (“[I]n this case the fall was on the public sidewalk * * * and nothing in the affidavits on', '-6- file establishes a factual basis for the plaintiff’s assertion that the defect was attributable to the defendants’ fault.”). Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the hearing justice properly granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the plaintiff’s negligence claims. 3', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court, and the record in this case shall be remanded to that tribunal. 3', 'In the absence of a legally recognized duty, plaintiff’s disability claims fare no better, and we agree with the hearing justice’s decision granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment on those grounds.', '-7-', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Ann Marie Maguire v.

(Emond) and Tecta America New England, LLC (Tecta) (collectively the plaintiffs) appeal from a judgment of the Superior Court granting BankNewport’s (defendant) motion for summary judgment and denying the plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment. On appeal before this Court, the plaintiffs argue that the Superior Court erred when it analyzed their claims under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and the equitable subordination framework applicable to priority disputes between secured and unsecured creditors. Instead, the plaintiffs contend that their claims should have been analyzed under the theory of unjust enrichment. In that regard, the plaintiffs aver that each of them has sufficiently demonstrated that it conferred a benefit upon the defendant, that the defendant appreciated the benefit, and that the defendant’s acceptance of the benefit, without payment, would be inequitable and unjust. Conversely, the defendant argues that it was not unjustly enriched because it neither received, nor did it appreciate, any benefit conferred by the plaintiffs. Further, the defendant argues that it is not inequitable for a secured creditor to retain the benefit that it recovered arising from its contractual rights. Finally, the defendant contends that a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs would do great damage to our jurisprudence because it', '-1- would effectively render a secured creditor’s priority status meaningless. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'In May 2010, AIDG Properties, LLC (AIDG), a real-estate holding company managed by Anjan Dutta-Gupta (Dutta-Gupta), purchased premises located at 184 John Clarke Road, Middletown (the property). The property consisted of 5.15 acres of real estate and a 57,372- square-foot industrial office building.', 'AIDG purchased the property in order to lease the majority of the office building to Advanced Solutions For Tomorrow, Inc. (ASFT), a related defense contracting firm. Dutta-Gupta was the principal of ASFT and the relationship between AIDG and ASFT has been described as that between a real-estate holding company and an operating company.', 'To finance the purchase of the property, and to obtain capital to perform certain necessary improvements to the building located thereon, AIDG obtained two loans from defendant. The first loan was in the amount of $2,516,000; it was intended to finance the acquisition of the property. That loan was secured by a first mortgage on the property, naming defendant as mortgagee. Further, AIDG obtained a second loan in the amount of $1,984,000, referred to as a bridge or construction loan, to help, in part, with financing the purchase of the property as well as funding the necessary improvements. The second loan was secured by a second mortgage on the property in favor of defendant. Both loans were personally guaranteed by ASFT, Dutta-Gupta, and his wife, Indrani Dutta-Gupta.', 'Necessary improvements included the replacement of the mechanical, or HVAC, systems, which was estimated to cost $400,000, as well as a total roof replacement, which was', '-2- estimated to cost $357,000. It soon became evident that an increase to the construction budget was required. As a result, on October 6, 2010, a loan modification was executed, increasing the construction budget and bringing the combined total amount of the first and second loans to $4,727,520.', 'On August 2, 2010, AIDG engaged ABC Building Corp. (ABC) to serve as the general contractor for the HVAC and roofing renovations. AIDG and ABC engaged in a competitive bidding process to solicit interested subcontractors to bid on the projects. After reviewing the bids that were submitted, ABC selected Emond to serve as the HVAC subcontractor based upon the company’s bid and experience. As a result, on August 31, 2010, ABC and Emond entered into a subcontract agreement. The agreement provided that Emond was to remove the existing HVAC system as well as design, construct, and install a new system. The original subcontract price for the HVAC work was $400,000. 1', 'Similarly, following a competitive bidding process, ABC selected Tecta to serve as the subcontractor for the new roof.', 'On September 10, 2010, ABC and Tecta entered into an agreement that provided that Tecta was responsible for removing the existing roof and installing the new roof. The original subcontract price for the roofing work was $206,570. 2', 'Emond and Tecta commenced the improvements, respectively, in September and October of 2010.', 'Pursuant to the subcontract agreements, plaintiffs submitted monthly payment applications to ABC, describing in detail the work that had been completed during the preceding month. ABC then compiled the subcontractors’ payment applications into a single, consolidated monthly payment application and forwarded it to AIDG. The consolidated payment application reflected all the work that had been performed by plaintiffs during the previous month. 1', 'Two approved change orders brought Emond’s final subcontract price to $413,428. 2', 'Similarly, an approved change order raised Tecta’s final subcontract price to $207,230.', '-3-', 'Upon receipt of ABC’s consolidated monthly payment application, AIDG transmitted the application to defendant for its review. The defendant engaged an inspector to review the completed work and to confirm that the work described in each payment application had, in fact, been satisfactorily completed. When defendant’s inspector found the completed work to be in order, the requested distribution of the construction loan proceeds was approved and processed. Thereafter, the loan proceeds were disbursed to AIDG, which, in turn, paid the subcontractors for the previous month’s work. Generally, this process took thirty days.', 'In accordance with the above-described procedure, plaintiffs submitted monthly payment applications to ABC. Emond submitted monthly payment applications from September 2010 to February 2011, requesting a total payment amount of $413,428.21. 3 The record discloses that Emond was paid only $94,668.02. Likewise, Tecta submitted monthly payment applications from October 2010 to February 2011, excluding the month of January, seeking a total payment amount of $186,507. 4 It is undisputed that Tecta received a total amount of $11,191.50. For some reason, plaintiffs’ November payment applications were not timely transmitted; as a result, they were submitted along with the December payment application. At that time, Emond was owed $191,046.27; while Tecta was owed $174,883.50 for their November and December payment applications.', 'The plaintiffs substantially completed the remaining renovations in January 2011.', 'The defendant’s inspector reviewed the work described in the November and December payment applications and confirmed that the work had been satisfactorily completed.', 'On February 3, 2011, defendant approved the requested distribution of the construction loan 3', 'Emond’s monthly payment applications are as follows: September: $28,440; October: $76,728.03; November: $155,572.77; December: $35,473.50; January: $73,486.09; and February: $43,727.82. 4', 'Tecta’s monthly payment applications are as follows: October: $11,191.50; November: $138,996; December: $35,887.50; and February: $432.', '-4- proceeds to AIDG. The following day, defendant deposited the loan proceeds in the total requested amount of $497,327.66 into AIDG’s account.', 'Several days later, and before any further funds had been disbursed to plaintiffs, defendant learned that Dutta-Gupta had been arrested based on allegations that he bribed a government official in connection with defense contracts that had been procured by ASFT. Almost immediately, ASFT laid off all its employees and ceased operations. The defendant then declared Dutta-Gupta’s arrest to be an event of default because it constituted a material adverse change in the circumstances of AIDG and its guarantors. Therefore, under the terms of the loan documents, defendant accelerated the loans, making the full amount immediately due and payable.', 'Then, on February 8, 2011, defendant set off the February 4, 2011, deposit of $497,327.66 that had been made into AIDG’s account by “reversing” it. Similarly, pursuant to the terms of the personal guaranties, defendant set off the bank accounts of ASFT and Dutta- Gupta.', 'As a result of defendant’s setoff and reversal of the February 4, 2011, deposit, AIDG was unable to pay plaintiffs for the work they had performed. Indeed, plaintiffs have received no compensation since the October payment applications. As a result, there is no dispute that Emond is owed a total amount of $318,760.19 and Tecta $196,038.50 for materials and labor.', 'On February 15, 2011, defendant filed a complaint in Newport County Superior Court, asserting that it would be irreparably harmed if the property were to remain unsecured and unprotected. The defendant also filed a motion for injunctive relief, seeking to enjoin all parties from entering the property. A justice of the Superior Court issued an order granting defendant possession of the property and denying all others access to it. At one point, Emond requested', '-5- that defendant allow its employees to enter the property and retrieve the HVAC equipment that it had installed, but for which it had not been paid. However, defendant denied Emond’s request, stating that it was unable to grant access without approval from the Superior Court.', 'On February 16, 2011, defendant commenced foreclosure proceedings against AIDG. Shortly thereafter, AIDG filed for bankruptcy protection in the Northern District of Georgia. 5 As a result, defendant discontinued its foreclosure proceedings.', 'In an effort to be remunerated, plaintiffs and ABC initiated mechanic’s lien proceedings against AIDG in the Superior Court. The defendant responded in each of the mechanic’s lien proceedings by filing an account and claim. Thereafter, on July 18, 2011, defendant obtained permission from the United States Bankruptcy Court to foreclose on the property. The following day, defendant filed petitions for permission to foreclose in each of the pending mechanic’s lien proceedings pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 34-28-16.1. 6 The plaintiffs did not file objections to defendant’s petitions to foreclose. On July 29, 2011, defendant’s petitions were heard by a justice of the Superior Court, who granted defendant permission to foreclose on the property. The defendant then re-initiated its foreclosure proceedings.', 'On September 15, 2011, Emond notified defendant of its equitable lien against any foreclosure proceeds. The following day, defendant conducted the foreclosure sale. At the sale, it was announced that the mortgage that was being foreclosed was the second mortgage, putting prospective bidders on notice that, if they purchased the property, they would do so subject to the 5', 'AIDG filed for bankruptcy in the Northern District of Georgia because that was the location of its corporate headquarters. 6', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-28-16.1 provides in pertinent part that:', '“the holder of a mortgage having a priority over [mechanics’] liens * * * may', 'petition the court to exercise the power of sale contained in the mortgage and the', 'court shall grant the petition to foreclose, after notice to all interested parties and', 'hearing thereon, upon a showing by the mortgagee that the mortgage is valid,', 'entitled to priority and is in default * * *.”', '-6- outstanding first mortgage. The defendant prevailed at the foreclosure sale, with an opening credit bid of $1,000,000. On October 27, 2011, defendant recorded its foreclosure deed in the Middletown Land Evidence Records. Thereafter, defendant made a decision that it would retain the property and use it for its corporate headquarters.', 'On November 15, 2011, plaintiffs filed a complaint in Newport County Superior Court, seeking to recover compensation for their work under the theory of unjust enrichment. The defendant answered the complaint and eventually, on September 17, 2012, it filed a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs objected to defendant’s motion for summary judgment and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. On May 29, 2013, a written decision was filed by a justice of the Superior Court, finding as a matter of law that defendant “was not unjustly enriched by any improvements the [p]laintiffs made to the premises when it purchased [the property] at foreclosure.” Accordingly, the court granted defendant’s motion for summary judgment and denied plaintiffs’ cross-motion for summary judgment.', 'On June 4, 2013, judgment entered in favor of defendant. The plaintiffs timely filed a notice of appeal.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews de novo a trial justice’s decision granting summary judgment.” Sola v. Leighton, 45 A.3d 502, 506 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Lynch v. Spirit Rent-A-Car, Inc., 965 A.2d 417, 424 (R.I. 2009)). “Summary judgment is appropriate only when the ‘pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as [a] matter of law.’” Id. (quoting Plunkett v. State, 869 A.2d 1185, 1187 (R.I. 2005)). “Only when a review of the admissible evidence viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving', '-7- party reveals no genuine issues of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, will this Court uphold the trial justice’s grant of summary judgment.” Id. (quoting National Refrigeration, Inc. v. Standen Contracting Co., 942 A.2d 968, 971 (R.I. 2008)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The plaintiffs aver that they have sufficiently demonstrated that they conferred a benefit upon defendant, that defendant appreciated the benefit, and that defendant’s acceptance of the benefit, without payment, would be inequitable and unjust. 7 On the other hand, defendant asserts that it was not unjustly enriched because it neither received, nor did it appreciate, any benefit conferred by plaintiffs. Further, defendant argues that unjust enrichment is inapplicable because it is not inequitable for a secured creditor to retain the benefit that is recovered arising from the enforcement of its contractual rights. Finally, defendant contends that a judgment in favor of plaintiffs would effectively render a secured creditor’s priority status meaningless.', 'It is well established that “[r]ecovery for unjust enrichment is predicated upon the equitable principle that one shall not be permitted to enrich himself at the expense of another by receiving property or benefits without making compensation for them.” Narragansett Electric Co. v. Carbone, 898 A.2d 87, 99 (R.I. 2006) (citing R & B Electric Co. v. Amco Construction Co., 471 A.2d 1351, 1355 (R.I. 1984)). “To recover for unjust enrichment, a claimant must prove: (1) that he or she conferred a benefit upon the party from whom relief is sought; (2) that the recipient appreciated the benefit; and (3) that the recipient accepted the benefit under such 7', 'At the outset, plaintiffs argue that the Superior Court erred because it analyzed their claims under the UCC and the equitable subordination framework applicable to priority disputes between secured and unsecured creditors. Instead, plaintiffs contend that their claims should have been analyzed under the theory of unjust enrichment. We do not agree with plaintiffs’ contention that the hearing justice analyzed the complaint under the UCC and equitable subordination framework. Rather, it is our opinion that our case law on unjust enrichment is dispositive of the instant action.', '-8- circumstances ‘that it would be inequitable for [the recipient] to retain the benefit without paying the value thereof.’” Dellagrotta v. Dellagrotta, 873 A.2d 101, 113 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Bouchard v. Price, 694 A.2d 670, 673 (R.I. 1997)). This Court has previously explained that the third prong of the analysis is the most important. Narragansett Electric Co., 898 A.2d at 100. “Determining what constitutes a just or unjust result requires a trial justice to examine the facts of the particular case and balance the equities.” Dellagrotta, 873 A.2d at 115 (citing R & B Electric Co., 471 A.2d at 1356). We have acknowledged that “[s]imply conferring a benefit upon a landowner by a subcontractor is not sufficient to establish a claim for unjust enrichment.” R & B Electric Co., 471 A.2d at 1356.', 'The parties disagree as to whether the first two prongs of the unjust enrichment analysis have been satisfied. The plaintiffs argue that a benefit was conferred upon defendant because it was their unpaid labor and materials that increased the value of defendant’s collateral. Additionally, plaintiffs argue that defendant has appreciated and retained the benefit because it purchased the property at foreclosure and opted to use the improved building as its corporate headquarters. Conversely, defendant argues that it was not the recipient of a benefit conferred by plaintiffs because it did not own the property at the time the work was performed and it did not have any contractual relationship with plaintiffs.', 'We will assume, without deciding, that plaintiffs have satisfied the first two prongs of the unjust-enrichment analysis. We do so because it is our opinion that the third prong of the analysis is dispositive, and we turn our attention to that to determine whether it would be inequitable for defendant to retain any benefit without paying for the value thereof.', 'The plaintiffs argue that it would be inequitable for defendant to retain undisbursed portions of the construction loan, which it reversed and remitted to itself, as well as the improved', '-9- collateral, because it is contrary to the purpose underlying the construction loan and the expectations of the parties. As support for its argument, plaintiffs cite Providence Steel & Iron Co. v. Flammand, 413 A.2d 487 (R.I. 1980); however, in our opinion, that case is distinguishable from the present situation on at least two grounds. In Flammand, 413 A.2d at 487, the plaintiff, a subcontractor, brought an unjust enrichment action against a general contractor and landowner seeking to recover the value of materials that it had furnished. The evidence revealed that the general contractor had informed the landowner that the subcontractor had not been compensated. Id. at 488. Nonetheless, the landowner used the construction loan proceeds that had been earmarked for the subcontractor to pay other subcontractors on unrelated projects. Id. Based upon the landowner’s actions, this Court affirmed the trial justice’s finding that the landowner had been unjustly enriched. Id.', 'The plaintiffs also rely upon Metric Constructors, Inc. v. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd., 72 Fed. App’x. 916 (4th Cir. 2003); but again, that case is readily distinguishable from the case before us.', 'In Metric, the plaintiff contracted with the landowner to serve as the general contractor on a major construction project. Id. at 918. Under the terms of the construction contract, payments were made directly to the plaintiff by the lender, as opposed to the scenario here, where the lender released funds to the landowner who, in turn, was to pay plaintiffs. Id. at 918-19. At some point, the lender became aware of the landowner’s financial difficulties and impending default but, nevertheless, induced the plaintiff to continue working. Id. at 919-20. Thereafter, the lender ceased funding the project, foreclosed on the collateral, and refused to tender payment to the plaintiff for the work performed. Id. Based upon those facts, the court found that the lender was liable to the plaintiff for unjust enrichment. Id. at 924.', '- 10 -', 'Finally, plaintiffs seek support from the holding in J.G. Plumbing Service, Inc. v. Coastal Mortgage Co., 329 So. 2d 393, 396 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1976). In that case, the court held that a construction lender may be held liable if it “affirmatively mislead[s] subcontractors and materialmen so as to induce them to continue to work upon and supply materials to the job to their detriment.” Id. at 396. Thus, the plaintiff’s recovery was predicated upon the lender’s fraud and misrepresentations. 8 Id.', 'Here, it is undisputed that the plaintiffs were neither in a contractual relationship with the defendant nor were they paid directly by the defendant. Instead, the plaintiffs contracted with AIDG which, under the terms of that agreement, was the party responsible for tendering payment. In addition, the plaintiffs have made no suggestion on the record that the defendant engaged in any type of misconduct including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, or bad faith. The record reveals that on February 4, 2011, the defendant fully disbursed the loan proceeds that had been requested in the November and December payment applications to AIDG to compensate the plaintiffs for their work. Several days later, Dutta-Gupta was arrested on bribery charges, constituting a material adverse change that was an event of default as defined in the loan documents. This caused the defendant to leverage its contractual right, a right no party has disputed, to set off AIDG’s bank account and reverse the February 4, 2011, deposit. Thereafter, the defendant exercised its rights as a secured creditor to foreclose on the property. 9 8', 'Our review of the case law reveals a consistency concerning unjust enrichment actions prosecuted by subcontractors against construction lenders. See Twin City Construction Co. of Fargo, N.D. v. ITT Industrial Credit Co., 358 N.W.2d 716, 719 (Minn. Ct. App. 1984) (lender’s liability premised upon its exploitation of subcontractor’s weakened position); Irwin Concrete, Inc. v. Sun Coast Properties, Inc., 653 P.2d 1331, 1335 (Wash. Ct. App. 1982) (lender’s misrepresentations and inducement of subcontractor to continue working despite knowledge of the landowner’s pending foreclosure justified liability); Gee v.

The plaintiff, Torrado Architects (Torrado), appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the defendant, Rhode Island Department of Human Services (DHS), denying the plaintiff’s successive petition to compel arbitration filed after the first arbitration proceeding in this matter was concluded and confirmed. After considering the arguments advanced by counsel, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'On July 1, 2008, Torrado signed an agreement to perform architectural, engineering, and design services, for a fee of $61,500, for renovations at a state-owned property located at 480 Metacom Avenue in Bristol, Rhode Island—commonly known as the Rhode Island Veterans Home. A document referred to as a Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) was issued to Torrado', '-1- on April 17, 2009, and signed by the state purchasing agent. The BPA referenced the agreement dated July 1, 2008. The BPA explicitly stated that the compensation was “NOT TO EXCEED” $61,500. This fee was calculated as a percentage of the overall expected construction costs.', 'Torrado claims that the administrator of the home, General Richard Baccus (Baccus), assured its representatives that additional services, outside the scope of the BPA, needed to be performed and that Torrado would be compensated for those services. By letter dated April 27, 2010, Torrado communicated with Baccus the need for additional compensation based on the design changes. Specifically, Torrado asserted that the anticipated construction costs for the project had nearly doubled and that, therefore, their fee—which was based on a percentage of the total construction costs—had also increased significantly.', 'On January 24, 2012, Baccus submitted an “EOHHS Critical Expense Request Form” and a “Single Source Justification Form” to the Division of Purchases, seeking the funds necessary to pay Torrado’s increased fees. This request was denied on March 30, 2012. On June 11, 2012, Torrado submitted a contract dispute claim to State Purchasing Agent Lorraine Hynes (Hynes), pursuant to the State of Rhode Island Procurement Regulations section 1.5.2.1 Hynes denied the claim on July 16, 2012. Torrado appealed Hynes’ determination to the Chief Purchasing Officer (CPO) pursuant to Procurement Regulations sections 1.5.6 2 and 1.6. The CPO denied Torrado’s appeal by memorandum dated September 10, 2012. Torrado then filed a 1', 'Section 1.5.2 of the State of Rhode Island Procurement Regulations provides: “The Purchasing Agent is authorized to resolve contract disputes between contractors and user agencies upon the submission of a request in writing from either party * * *.” 2', 'Section 1.5.6 provides that “[a]ny appeal from the Purchasing Agent’s determination of a contract dispute * * * must be filed with the Chief Purchasing Officer within fourteen (14) calendar days and in accordance with the ‘bid protest’ procedures set forth in Section 1.6 of these regulations entitled ‘Resolution of Protest.’”', '-2- complaint 3 in the Superior Court seeking relief pursuant to an Administrative Appeals Procedure and the Administrative Procedures Act. In the prayer for relief, Torrado asked the court to (1) reverse the decision of the CPO; (2) award Torrado a revised contract amount of $156,000; and (3) award “[a]ny other relief as this [c]ourt deems just.”', 'The parties, on October 15, 2012, stipulated that the matter would be held in abeyance while a statutory arbitration procedure was under way. 4 The arbitrator issued a “Decision and Award” on December 17, 2012. The arbitrator indicated in his decision that, although he sympathized with Torrado because he believed that plaintiff rendered additional services to DHS, he concluded that the additional work was not authorized under the procurement regulations. Accordingly, the arbitrator concluded that Torrado was entitled to recover only the outstanding amount owed pursuant to the BPA. Finally, after previously denying a request by Torrado to expand the scope of the arbitration by considering claims that were equitable in nature, and not set forth in the Superior Court complaint, the arbitrator declared that he:', '“makes no determination as to what, if any, other remedies', 'Torrado may have, including but not limited to the pleading causes', 'of action against the State sounding in quantum meruit, unjust', 'enrichment, promissory estoppel and/or negligence in allowing', 'Administrator Baccus to wrongfully procure additional work,', 'thereby leading to potential recovery of the monies sought.” Torrado then filed a motion requesting that the arbitrator reconsider his decision. The basis of the motion to reconsider was Torrado’s position that the arbitrator refused to consider Torrado’s alternative remedies. Torrado later withdrew its motion. By agreement of the parties, the arbitrator’s award was confirmed on January 7, 2013. No appeal from this award was taken. 3', 'Torrado Architects v. Richard A.

Torrado had previously demanded, and DHS had refused, to arbitrate equitable claims that the arbitrator declined to consider in the first arbitration. Torrado’s motion to compel was heard on May 7, 2013. The trial justice rendered a bench decision on June 24, 2013, declaring that Torrado’s claims were barred by the doctrine of res judicata. In denying the requested relief, the trial justice expressed surprise that the arbitrator did not stay the arbitration and encourage Torrado to amend its complaint. The trial justice suggested that Torrado could have amended its complaint, even after arbitration concluded, and that its failure to do so was fatal. Judgment entered on June 25, 2013, in favor of DHS on Torrado’s petition to compel arbitration. Torrado filed a notice of appeal from this judgment on June 26, 2013.', 'Standard of Review', '“[W]hether a dispute is arbitrable is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo.” Weeks v. 735 Putnam Pike Operations, LLC, 85 A.3d 1147, 1151 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State Department of Corrections v. Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, 866 A.2d 1241, 1247 (R.I. 2005)). “[A] duty to arbitrate a dispute arises only when a party agrees to arbitration in clear and unequivocal language; and, even then, the party is only obligated to arbitrate issues that it explicitly agreed to arbitrate.” Id. at 1152 (quoting State Department of Corrections, 866 A.2d at 1247).', 'Issue Presented', 'There is no dispute that questions related to Torrado’s performance of its contract with DHS are arbitrable under the Public Works Arbitration Act. See G.L. 1956 § 37-16-2. The sole issue before the Court is whether the original arbitration award—which ripened into a judgment', '-4- when it was confirmed by the Superior Court—has res judicata effect on Torrado’s petition to compel arbitration.', 'Analysis', '“The doctrine of res judicata bars the relitigation of all issues that ‘were tried or might have been tried’ in an earlier action.” Huntley v. State, 63 A.3d 526, 531 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Bossian v. Anderson, 991 A.2d 1025, 1027 (R.I. 2010)). The doctrine serves as a bar to a second cause of action where there exists: (1) “identity of parties”; (2) “identity of issues”; and (3) “finality of judgment in an earlier action.” Id. (quoting Bossian, 991 A.2d at 1027).', 'There is no dispute that both identity of parties and finality of judgment exist. Rather, Torrado challenges the existence of the second element—identity of issues. Torrado argues that the trial justice erred with respect to identity of issues for two reasons. First, Torrado asserts that its equitable claims could not have been asserted in the first complaint because they were not part of the administrative appeal that was referred to arbitration. Torrado argues that once the arbitration commenced, the arbitrator was vested with the authority to decide procedural matters, including whether Torrado could add counts to be arbitrated. Torrado contends that, because the arbitrator refused to allow the amendment, an identity of issues is not present. Second, Torrado argues that, by objecting to the motion to amend the scope of the arbitration proceeding, DHS acquiesced to split the issues such that the arbitrator later “carved out” the claims from the arbitration award.', 'In determining whether a claim is barred because of identity of issues, this Court has adopted the transactional rule set forth in § 24 of the Restatement (Second) Judgments. See Plunkett v. State, 869 A.2d 1185, 1188-89 (R.I. 2005) (citing ElGabri v. Lekas, 681 A.2d 271, 276 (R.I. 1996)). Section 24(1) of the Restatement (Second) Judgments at 196 (1982) provides', '-5- that a claim that is extinguished by a final judgment “includes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose.” In order to determine whether a claim arose out of the same transaction, the Court will look to “whether the facts are related in time, space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a unit conforms to the parties’ expectations or business understanding or usage.” Id. at § 24(2); see also Plunkett, 869 A.2d at 1189.', 'However, even if the transactional test is satisfied, there are several exceptions that could preclude the application of the doctrine. One such exception exists when “‘formal barriers in fact exist[] and [are] operative against a plaintiff in the first action,’ preventing full presentation of his or her claim.” Plunkett, 869 A.2d at 1190 (quoting Restatement (Second) Judgments § 26 at cmt. c). This Court has recognized another exception, stating that the rule against splitting claims is “not applicable where the defendant consents, in express words or otherwise, to the splitting of the claim.” ElGabri, 681 A.2d at 277 (quoting Restatement (Second) Judgments § 26 at cmt. a). Additionally, the Restatement provides that, when “[t]he court in the first action has expressly reserved the plaintiff’s right to maintain the second action[,]” the rule against splitting claims will not apply. Restatement (Second) Judgments § 26(1)(b) at 233.', '“The principle underlying the rule of [res judicata] * * * is that a party who once has had a chance to litigate a claim before an appropriate tribunal usually ought not to have another chance to do so.” Huntley, 63 A.3d at 532 (quoting Restatement (Second) Judgments ch. 1 at 6). Here, Torrado had ample opportunity to bring its equitable claims but failed to do so. The equitable claims that Torrado seeks to assert arise out of the same set of facts that were the basis of the administrative appeal—that Baccus induced Torrado to perform additional work that was', '-6- not part of the original contract. When claims arise from the same set of factual circumstances, the identity-of-issues prong is satisfied. See Plunkett, 869 A.2d at 1189.', 'Additionally, there are no exceptions to the res judicata doctrine present in this case that would serve to negate the finality of the judgment confirming the arbitration award. First, formal barriers were not present that would have prevented Torrado from asserting its equitable claims in the original complaint or by way of an amended complaint filed before the arbitrator’s award ripened into a final judgment. In fact, it appears that Torrado was aware of this possibility when it argued in its motion to reconsider the decision of the arbitrator: “Torrado’s further position is that in the sake of ‘judicial economy,’ this Arbitrator should hear Torrado’s further actions against the State rather than Torrado amending its complaint and alleging those causes of action against the State.” Nonetheless, the parties stipulated to an order confirming the arbitrator’s decision.', 'Similarly, we cannot agree with Torrado’s contention that the arbitrator “carved out” the equitable claims in his decision—thereby creating an exception to the prohibition against splitting claims—when he declared that he:', '“makes no determination as to what, if any, other remedies', 'Torrado may have, including but not limited to the pleading causes', 'of action against the State sounding in quantum meruit, unjust', 'enrichment, promissory estoppel and/or negligence in allowing', 'Administrator Baccus to wrongfully procure additional work,', 'thereby leading to potential recovery of monies sought. * * * Such', 'causes of action that might be pled, if any, are outside of the', 'purview of this Arbitration[.]” (Emphases added.) The arbitrator did not “carve out” the equitable claims as Torrado contends, but simply decided not to make any determination about them as they were outside the scope of the arbitration. Although the arbitrator mentioned the possibility of pleading these claims in the future, the award did not provide the right to do so after judgment entered. Rather, his decision was', '-7- tempered by the hypothetical verbs of “may” and “might.”', 'The arbitrator recognized the possibility of Torrado bringing additional equitable claims, but certainly his decision did not guarantee that possibility or “carve out” the equitable claims for a future complaint.', 'The availability of an avenue to litigate additional equitable claims was extinguished when the arbitrator’s decision was confirmed by the parties on January 7, 2013. 5 After that, the res judicata effect of the judgment defeats any future claims arising out of the same transaction.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. The papers in this case may be returned to the Superior Court. 5', 'There is no evidence that DHS acquiesced to the splitting of the claims “in express words or otherwise.” ElGabri v. Lekas, 681 A.2d 271, 277 (R.I. 1996). Certainly, DHS did not consent by objecting to the arbitrator hearing the equitable claims, as Torrado argues. Without any evidence of DHS giving its explicit consent to the splitting of the claims, Torrado’s assertion of this exception applying is without merit.

71,Deborah Thornley : v. : Community College of Rhode Island et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The plaintiff in this disability discrimination case, Deborah Thornley, appeals from a Superior Court judgment in favor of the defendants, Community College of Rhode Island (CCRI), Anita Creamer, Doris Fournier, and the Board of Governors for Higher Education (collectively defendants). The plaintiff was enrolled in the nursing program at CCRI during the 2003-2004 academic year, while allegedly suffering from chronic headaches, which she treated with the medication Percocet. During the spring semester of 2004, the plaintiff left the nursing program. She subsequently filed a civil action against the defendants, claiming that she had been “dropped” from the nursing program at CCRI because of her disability. The jury, however, after an eleven-day trial reached a verdict for the defendants, finding that the plaintiff had failed to prove that she was disabled.', 'The plaintiff argues on appeal that the trial justice erred by: (1) admitting into evidence a medical report prepared by a neurologist who treated plaintiff four years after she left CCRI; (2) excusing a juror on the fourth day of trial; and (3) informing the jury that some of plaintiff’s claims had been dismissed as a matter of law after the close of evidence. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts', 'The plaintiff filed a complaint against defendants in Superior Court on November 18, 2004, alleging five counts: (1) violation of the Rhode Island Civil Rights Act (RICRA); (2) violation of the Rhode Island Fair Employment Practices Act; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (4) breach of contract; and (5) vicarious liability and/or respondeat superior resulting from Fournier’s and Creamer’s actions within the scope of their employment by CCRI. The plaintiff’s second and fifth claims were dismissed pursuant to defendants’ motion for summary judgment; the remaining claims proceeded to trial.', 'The plaintiff testified at trial that she began suffering from severe headaches in the 1970s or 1980s, for which she sought treatment from numerous doctors. These headaches continued to affect plaintiff through the time of her trial in 2012. According to plaintiff, she was diagnosed with “brain lesions” in 1995 and again in 2002. In 2000, plaintiff was prescribed and began taking Percocet to treat her headaches. The plaintiff testified that, from October 2002 to the fall of 2003, she experienced “pounding” headaches “[a] couple of times a week,” with each headache lasting an hour to an hour and a half. During this time period, she also experienced “severe” headaches “[a] couple of times a year,” during which she would have to lie on the floor “[b]ecause the pressure on the top of [her] head felt like [her] head was going to explode and [she] started vomiting.”', 'In the fall of 2001, plaintiff was accepted into the nursing program at CCRI. She began her studies in the fall of 2002, with the goal of becoming a Registered Nurse. Approximately halfway through the fall semester of 2002, plaintiff took a leave of absence from the nursing program. According to plaintiff, she told her instructor, Patricia Bosworth, that she suffered', '-2- from brain lesions, and her instructor suggested that she withdraw from the program. Bosworth testified, however, that plaintiff told her she had a brain tumor and was experiencing other serious personal issues, and that plaintiff herself made the decision to leave the program.', 'The plaintiff re-enrolled in the nursing program at CCRI in the fall of 2003, beginning with a course referred to as “Nursing I.” Before re-enrolling, plaintiff told Doris Fournier, who was the Department Chair of the nursing department at CCRI, that she had been misdiagnosed, that she did not have a brain tumor, and that she was capable of returning to the program. After receiving passing grades on the first two written exams that semester, plaintiff failed the next two, purportedly because she could not concentrate due to her headaches. The plaintiff discussed her difficulty with her clinical instructor, Donna Ashworth; and, in October 2003, plaintiff informed Ashworth that she was taking Percocet to treat her headaches. Ashworth referred plaintiff to a disability services program at CCRI called the “Access Program.”', 'The plaintiff applied to the Access Program and was given extra time in which to complete her final examination for Nursing I in the fall semester of 2003; she finished the course with a passing grade. The plaintiff began taking the next course in the program, referred to as “Nursing II,” 1 in January 2004, while still reportedly experiencing “pressure” headaches. The plaintiff, not realizing that she had to re-apply to the Access Program each semester, did not request an accommodation for the first written exam in Nursing II, and she failed the test. She then re-applied to the Access Program in order to obtain accommodations for future exams. The plaintiff did not ask for any accommodations for the clinical portion of Nursing II. 1', 'Both Nursing I and Nursing II consisted of two components: a “theoretical” or “classroom” component; and a “clinical” component, which involved practicing skills in a lab and in real-life clinical settings.', '-3-', 'On February 1, 2004, plaintiff telephoned her Nursing II clinical instructor, Anita Creamer, and told her that she had “problems with headaches” and was taking medication. According to Creamer, plaintiff told her she had “a degenerative disease.” Creamer asked plaintiff if she had received clearance from her physician to attend the clinical portion of Nursing II, and plaintiff said that she had. The plaintiff testified that her relationship with Creamer became increasingly negative after this conversation; plaintiff felt that Creamer was singling her out and treating her differently from the other students in her class. Creamer testified at trial that plaintiff struggled with the clinical portion of Nursing II; she was anxious, she had difficulty learning the correct method of documentation, she did not always apply concepts learned in Nursing I, and she breached confidentiality and infection-control protocols.', 'The plaintiff had a meeting with Creamer on February 18, 2004. According to Creamer, plaintiff reported at this meeting that she suffered from various health issues, including an unspecified, life-threatening “autoimmune disease of the brain,” hypertension, and nosebleeds. Creamer recalled that plaintiff was unsure whether she should continue with the nursing program due to these health concerns. The plaintiff also told Creamer that she was taking Percocet “every 4 to 6 hours” to treat her chronic headaches. Creamer told plaintiff that she could not take Percocet while participating in the clinical setting unless she obtained medical clearance, because the medication could potentially impact her decision-making and judgment abilities.', 'A meeting was held on February 23, 2004, among plaintiff, Fournier, Maureen McGarry (the Dean of Health and Rehabilitative Services at CCRI), and Tracy Karasinski (the Director of Access, Mentoring, and Disability Services at CCRI). The plaintiff was told at this meeting that she was not being dismissed from the nursing program, but that she would need medical clearance if she wished to return to her clinical classes while taking Percocet. The plaintiff', '-4- testified that she understood that the purpose of this meeting was to try to get her back into school. According to plaintiff, however, discontinuing the use of Percocet was not an option for her at that time. When asked at trial what would have happened if she had stopped taking the medication, plaintiff stated: “My head would feel like it was going to explode. I would be vomiting. I would have to lay [sic] on the floor for hours at a time.”', 'After this meeting, plaintiff did not go back to her clinical class and did not contact CCRI. Instead, she filed a complaint with the Commission for Human Rights on February 26, 2004, alleging disability discrimination. Another meeting was held on March 16, 2004, which plaintiff attended, along with her husband, Creamer, Fournier, and McGarry.', 'During this meeting, McGarry again told plaintiff that she could not return to the clinical class while taking Percocet. Fournier also reiterated, however, that plaintiff was not being dismissed from the nursing program. The meeting ended when plaintiff and her husband left. After this meeting, plaintiff received a letter from McGarry stating that she could contact the Dean of Students if she felt they had not reached a satisfactory resolution. The plaintiff, however, did not make any further attempts to reconcile the issue of her inability to participate in the clinical program while taking Percocet to treat her headaches. She received a midterm grade of “F” for Nursing II and did not attempt to return to the nursing program.', 'Doctor Jeffrey Wilson, a family physician, testified at trial that he had been treating plaintiff as her primary care physician since November 5, 2003.', 'When he began treating plaintiff, Dr. Wilson obtained from Dr. Lloyd Alderson her medical records, which included multiple MRI results. When Dr. Wilson began seeing plaintiff, Dr. Alderson was prescribing Percocet for her and she was taking up to four pills per day. Doctor Wilson diagnosed plaintiff in November 2003 with a sinus infection and chronic headaches. Doctor Wilson testified that', '-5- “Dr. Alderson was the specialist treating the chronic headaches that [in] [Dr. Alderson’s] opinion were resulting from the demyelinating[2] issues seen on MRI.” 3 Doctor Wilson agreed that plaintiff’s MRI results supported a diagnosis of chronic headaches caused by a demyelinating issue. Doctor Wilson testified that, in his experience as a doctor, chronic headaches could impair one’s ability to work, take care of oneself, and take examinations in school.', 'Doctor Wilson saw plaintiff sporadically from the fall of 2003 to the summer of 2004, during which time she complained of various ailments including ear pain, leg pain, and throat pain. On February 27, 2004, plaintiff told Dr. Wilson that she had been “kicked out” of nursing school; however, plaintiff did not request, and Dr. Wilson did not write, a letter to CCRI indicating that plaintiff could perform in a clinical setting while taking Percocet.', 'Doctor Wilson referred plaintiff to Dr. Gary L’Europa, a neurologist, who rendered a report dated October 6, 2008. Over plaintiff’s objection, Dr. Wilson was permitted to testify at trial regarding Dr. L’Europa’s report, and the report was admitted into evidence. This report contained a section titled “impression,” in which Dr. L’Europa wrote that plaintiff’s headaches were “Analgesic Rebound Headache[s] secondary to [P]ercocet use.” Because Dr. L’Europa’s opinion was that the Percocet use was causing the headaches, he recommended discontinuing the medication. Doctor Wilson’s notes from this time period indicate that plaintiff saw and was 2', 'Doctor Wilson defined “demyelinating disease” as follows:', '“[A] disease that happens in the brain. Sometimes in the spinal', 'cord. Nerves have an insulation around them, the same as', 'electrical wires just outside have an insulation. The insulation', 'helps nerve impulses travel faster through the nerves. A', 'demyelinating disease is a disease that attacks that myelin which is', 'the name for the insulation and eats away at it, creating a situation', 'where there is less insulation around the nerve and then the nerves', 'don’t work as well. The impulses don’t travel as well or as', 'quickly.” 3', 'Doctor Alderson did not testify at trial.', '-6- dissatisfied with multiple doctors—Dr. Alderson, Dr. Stratton, Dr. L’Europa, and Dr. Johnson. Doctor Wilson also referred plaintiff to Dr. Richard Cervone in 2010, who reviewed her recent MRIs and concluded that there was no neurological explanation for her symptoms.', 'II', 'Procedural History', 'After the close of evidence at trial, defendants moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure on all three of plaintiff’s remaining claims: violation of RICRA; intentional infliction of emotional distress; and breach of contract. Specifically regarding the RICRA claim, defendants argued that plaintiff had failed to prove that she was dismissed from the nursing program and had failed to prove that she suffered from a disability. Before the trial justice rendered her decision on defendants’ Rule 50 motion, plaintiff filed a motion for leave to amend her complaint in order to conform to the evidence presented at trial. The trial justice granted defendants’ Rule 50 motion but allowed plaintiff leave to amend her complaint; specifically, plaintiff was permitted to amend the factual portion of her complaint and to add a new cause of action for violation of RICRA by constructive discharge. 4 The plaintiff then filed an amended complaint, in which she added a claim for constructive discharge. 5 Before counsel made their closing statements, the trial justice informed the jury that some of the claims in the case had been dismissed as a matter of law. 4', 'Although the original complaint was, in the words of the trial justice, “not artfully drafted,” the parties apparently construed it to have asserted a claim for violation of RICRA by wrongful termination. 5', 'The plaintiff also asserted a new version of her previous RICRA claim and reasserted her claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and breach of contract. During argument regarding the motion to amend, however, the trial justice specifically asked plaintiff’s counsel whether the RICRA count was the sole subject of the motion to amend, and counsel replied affirmatively.', '-7-', 'The case was submitted to the jury on February 9, 2012, on plaintiff’s constructive discharge claim only. That same day, the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendants, finding that plaintiff did not have a disability during the relevant time period. Judgment on the verdict was entered on February 9, 2012. On February 14, 2012, defendants filed a motion for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Rule 50(b) regarding plaintiff’s amended complaint. The plaintiff filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure on February 20, 2012. On June 6, 2012, the trial justice issued a bench decision granting defendants’ motion for judgment as a matter of law as to the constructive discharge prong of plaintiff’s amended RICRA claim, denying plaintiff’s motion for a new trial, and ordering plaintiff to pay limited costs. Final judgment for defendants was entered on June 12, 2012. 6 The plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal. 7', 'III', 'Discussion', 'A', 'Dr. L’Europa’s Report', 'On appeal, plaintiff first argues that the trial justice erred by admitting into evidence the medical report prepared by Dr. L’Europa, as well as the testimony of Dr. Wilson regarding this report. Specifically, plaintiff argues that this evidence was not relevant because it “had no bearing on the reason why [plaintiff] left CCRI in 2004.” The plaintiff also contends that the 6', 'The result of this unusual disposition is that the record contains two final judgments in favor of defendants on plaintiff’s constructive discharge claim: judgment on the verdict, which was entered on February 9, 2012; and judgment as a matter of law, which was entered on June 12, 2012. 7', 'The plaintiff’s notice of appeal purports to appeal the judgment on the jury verdict, the judgment as a matter of law, and the denial of the motion for a new trial. The plaintiff’s brief, however, focuses only on alleged errors pertaining to the jury trial.', '-8- report should have been excluded pursuant to Rule 403 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence because it was unduly prejudicial.', 'In response, defendants argue that Dr. L’Europa’s report was relevant to plaintiff’s alleged disability during the fall of 2003 and the spring of 2004, because plaintiff “testified that her headaches were consistent from at least the 1980’s to the time of trial in 2012.” Moreover, the report contained descriptions of plaintiff’s headaches that were similar to the headaches that plaintiff claimed to be experiencing in 2003 and 2004. Thus, defendants assert that the report was relevant because it addressed the potential cause of plaintiff’s headaches, as well as the issue of whether plaintiff actually suffered from a neurological condition.', 'It is well established that “[t]he admission or exclusion of evidence on grounds of relevancy is within the sound discretion of the trial justice * * * .” State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1035 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Calenda, 787 A.2d 1195, 1199 (R.I. 2002)). Thus, “absent a showing of abuse of this discretion, this Court will not disturb a ruling concerning the admissibility of evidence.” Id. (quoting Calenda, 787 A.2d at 1199).', 'Here, plaintiff’s cause of action depended on her ability to prove that she was disabled in the fall of 2003 and the spring of 2004, a premise that she ultimately failed to establish. She testified to a long-term, chronic condition of severe headaches, which began decades before her experiences at CCRI and continued through 2012. Rule 401 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence defines “relevant evidence” as “evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.” Doctor L’Europa’s report was relevant to plaintiff’s claim of disability because it contained the opinion of a treating neurologist regarding the prevalence and potential causes of plaintiff’s headaches. This information, although not reported', '-9- until 2008, could easily shed light on plaintiff’s condition in 2003 and 2004, especially given the evidence that there had not been any significant change in her headaches after this time period. Thus, the trial justice did not abuse her discretion in admitting into evidence Dr. L’Europa’s report and the testimony regarding this report.', 'As for plaintiff’s claimed error under Rule 403, we must reiterate our well-established maxim that “the ‘raise-or-waive’ rule precludes a litigant from arguing an issue on appeal that has not been articulated at trial.” State v. Ford, 56 A.3d 463, 470 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Brown, 9 A.3d 1240, 1245 (R.I. 2010)). Here, plaintiff’s counsel objected to the admission of Dr. L’Europa’s report on grounds of relevance. At no point during trial did counsel argue that the report was unduly prejudicial; thus, we shall not consider plaintiff’s claim on appeal that the admission of Dr. L’Europa’s report was in violation of Rule 403.', 'B', 'The Excusal of Juror 78', 'On the fourth day of trial, a juror (Juror 78) approached the court with concerns about his own experiences in relation to the facts unfolding at trial. Juror 78 informed the trial justice that he had “a bunch of experiences in [his] life that [were] substantially similar to [plaintiff’s],” specifically that he had suffered from “a persistent migraine condition” from ages sixteen to twenty-two, including a portion of time when he was in college. This juror also informed the court that his mother-in-law was “a nurse who takes Percocet at night specifically so it doesn’t affect her abilities during the day.” Additionally, the juror commented on his experience with “faculty hazing” at Bentley University, and noted that this was another parallel between plaintiff’s case and his own life experiences. Juror 78 stated: “I don’t think I’m biased but I do', '- 10 - think I understand [plaintiff] to a higher degree than the average person.” The following exchange took place between Juror 78 and the trial justice:', '“THE COURT: Okay, do you believe that you can keep all', 'of these experiences out of your consideration of this case?', '“JUROR 78: None of it is admissible during deliberations?', '“THE COURT: Your experiences.', '“JUROR 78: Yes, I can do that.', '“THE COURT: It won’t influence how you view the', 'evidence, your own personal experiences?', '“JUROR 78: I did try and when we introduced the evidence', 'on the Percocet frequency, I did take a look at it and say well, like', 'my mother-in-law makes sure she fills the prescriptions and kind', 'of stockpiles them basically for times she might need them more', 'than other times so that sort of thing may be --', '“THE COURT: Okay, but you haven’t heard any evidence', 'about that?', '“JUROR 78: No, I haven’t, not one way or the other.', '“THE COURT: But you’re using your experience to [sic]', 'potentially as a lens through which to view this evidence; is that', 'fair?', '“JUROR 78: Yes.', '“THE COURT: And if you’re not permitted to do that, do', 'you think you could?', '“JUROR 78: I can, yes. I just, I’m not sure I would know', 'exactly what. That was the logical conclusion to me. I didn’t', 'realize I was doing something inappropriate with that one.” After discussing the matter with the attorneys, the trial justice dismissed Juror 78 and selected an alternate to take his place.', 'The plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred by excusing Juror 78. According to plaintiff, “[t]here was no basis to question the juror’s assurance that he could decide the case on the evidence.”', 'The plaintiff views this excusal as a “mid-trial peremptory” challenge, in contravention of G.L. 1956 § 9-10-18, which provides for the exercise of peremptory challenges only before the opening of trial. The defendants, for their part, argue that the removal of Juror 78 was not an attempt to use a peremptory challenge in mid-trial; rather, this juror was excused', '- 11 - by the trial justice for cause. The defendants also argue that this issue is waived because plaintiff failed to raise it in her motion for a new trial.', 'We have previously held that “any arguable legal errors that may have been committed by the trial justice during the course of the trial” must be brought to the attention of the trial justice. Mead v. Papa Razzi, 899 A.2d 437, 445 (R.I. 2006) (emphasis omitted). “It is not necessary, however, to itemize at the Rule 59 juncture each and every non-legal error that counsel believes may have been committed during the trial * * * .” Mead, 899 A.2d at 445. Furthermore, “[i]t is well-settled in this jurisdiction that the issue of whether a juror is disqualified due to bias, prejudice or interest is left to the discretion of the trial justice.” State v. Valcourt, 792 A.2d 732, 735 (R.I. 2002) (quoting State v. McDowell, 685 A.2d 252, 255 (R.I. 1996)). Thus, in this context, the issue of whether the trial justice erred in excusing Juror 78 was not an issue of law; rather, it was a matter committed to the sound discretion of the trial justice. See Mead, 899 A.2d at 445. Accordingly, plaintiff did not waive this issue by failing to present it in her motion for a new trial.', 'As to the merits of plaintiff’s argument, however, we disagree. The responsibility for ensuring a fair and impartial trial rests squarely with the trial justice, whether it be in a civil or criminal context. Absent a clear abuse of discretion, we are reluctant to restrain a trial justice’s authority to excuse a juror in the midst of trial before, so to speak, “the hurlyburly’s done, [w]hen the battle’s lost and won.” 8', 'In the matter under review, the trial justice properly heeded our admonition in Valcourt that “[t]o determine a juror’s impartiality, an appropriate in camera inquiry of the juror is necessary.” Valcourt, 792 A.2d at 735. The record discloses an extensive in camera discussion 8', 'William Shakespeare, Macbeth, act 1, scene 1.', '- 12 - with the juror, in the presence of counsel, during which the trial justice asked him questions concerning his ability to separate his background experiences from the facts of the case at hand. After entertaining arguments from counsel, the trial justice expressed her concern that the juror was injecting his own experiences “to fill gaps in the evidence.” As an example, she cited the juror’s recollection of his mother-in-law’s practice of “stockpiling” Percocet. Notwithstanding the juror’s avowal that he could remain fair and impartial, the trial justice believed “that he’s going to draw extensively on his special experience.” Accordingly, she excused him.', 'We are satisfied that the trial justice was acting well within the parameters of her broad discretionary authority when she excused Juror 78. She conducted an appropriate in camera inquiry, which caused her to conclude that this juror was “using his personal experiences to fill gaps in evidence, not to interpret the evidence that’s there but to actually create additional evidence.” In our opinion, her concerns were well founded. The juror’s references to his mother-in-law’s “stockpiling” of Percocet; and to his experience with “faculty hazing” at Bentley University (at which “no one ever gets fired or dismissed. * * * [T]he people at the university * * * simply decide to eliminate a person and they stop talking to them * * * until the person figures out that [he or she] should leave”); and his comment that he thought he understood the plaintiff “to a higher degree than the average person,” were sufficient to justify the trial justice’s concerns about his objectivity. 9 9', 'The plaintiff’s final argument on appeal is that the trial justice erred by telling the jury, after the close of the evidence, that some of the claims in the suit had been dismissed as a matter of law. The defendants argue, and plaintiff concedes, that plaintiff’s counsel at trial failed to object to the trial justice’s statement at the time it was made. As previously noted, our well-established raise-or-waive rule prevents us from considering issues on appeal that have not been preserved below. State v.

72,John Wells : v. : R. Suzanne Smith et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court. This case arises out of claims of negligence brought by the plaintiff, John Wells (plaintiff), alleging that R. Suzanne Smith (Smith) and Michael Ead (Ead) (collectively, defendants), negligently caused the plaintiff’s injuries. The Supreme Court heard oral argument on October 30, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not summarily be decided. Following the grant of summary judgment by a justice of the Superior Court, the plaintiff timely appealed. After hearing the arguments of counsel and having reviewed the memoranda of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide this appeal. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'In 2007, defendant Smith hired defendant Ead, a contractor, to construct an addition onto her home. During construction, the Department of Environmental Management (DEM) notified Smith that the construction was in violation of the local zoning ordinance and, further, that the addition must be removed. Shortly after receiving notification from DEM that removal was', '-1- necessary, Smith instructed Ead to cease construction. She also decided to sell the property. Raymond Wells (Raymond 1) and his wife offered to purchase the property, agreeing to remove the addition in connection with the purchase. Raymond enlisted plaintiff, his brother, to help with the demolition.', 'While working at the site, plaintiff fell from the roof and sustained injuries. 2 On June 13, 2011, plaintiff filed suit against defendants alleging negligence, premises liability, negligent hiring, strict liability, res ipsa loquitur, and negligent design, construction, and inspection for his resulting injuries.', 'On March 5, 2013, Smith filed a motion for summary judgment, contending that, as the owner, she was not liable for any potential negligence of Ead, an independent contractor and that none of the exceptions to the “independent contractor rule” applied in this case. Specifically, Smith argued “that one who employs an independent contractor is not liable for the negligent acts of the independent contractor.” Smith also asserted that she had no duty to maintain or repair the addition and that she was not aware of any defect in its construction. Further, she argued that there was no evidence of an abnormally dangerous condition. Lastly, she averred that plaintiff’s res ipsa loquitur argument was without merit. Ead joined in Smith’s motion for summary judgment, arguing that plaintiff assumed the risk of his injuries when he elected to 1', 'For ease of reference, first names may be used throughout this opinion. No disrespect is intended. 2', 'In plaintiff’s complaint, he alleges injuries to his “back, right shoulder, ribs, and various other parts of his body.” The plaintiff also alleges he “has suffered and will continue to suffer pain and mental anguish.”', '-2- climb on the roof and demolish the addition and that a contractor is not liable to third parties for negligence after the contractor’s work is accepted. 3', 'The plaintiff filed an objection to defendants’ motion for summary judgment; and, on June 10, 2013, a hearing on the motion was held in Superior Court. The plaintiff conceded that he did not have any facts to rebut the version of the facts set forth by defendants. However, plaintiff argued that count two—the negligent-hiring count—was still viable against Smith, because Smith knew that Ead was not an experienced contractor, that she observed Ead construct the roof, and that she “knew or should have known that * * * Ead was unqualified to put up the addition.” According to plaintiff, because Smith had hired Ead, she was liable to third parties injured by his negligence. The plaintiff also contended that count seven—the negligent design, construction, and inspection count—was still viable against Ead.', 'The trial justice granted defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to all counts in the complaint. The trial justice noted that plaintiff had conceded all counts except for count two, the negligent-hiring claim, and seven, the negligent design, construction, and inspection claim. The trial justice held, as a matter of law, that Smith could not be found negligent in hiring Ead, because she did not owe a legal duty of care to plaintiff. The trial justice also ruled that Ead owed no duty of care to plaintiff because he “couldn’t have known or anticipated that the roof was to be dismantled and that he had to make the addition safe for dismantling.” The plaintiff’s appeal to this Court relates to the judgment entered on those counts. 3', 'When Ead joined Smith’s summary judgment motion, he also filed a limited objection. However, as the limited objection is immaterial to our analysis and decision, we will not address it.', '-3-', 'Standard of Review', '“This Court reviews a trial justice’s grant of a motion for summary judgment by undertaking a de novo review.” Phelps v. Hebert, 93 A.3d 942, 946 (R.I. 2014) (citing Willis v. Omar, 954 A.2d 126, 129 (R.I. 2008)). Accordingly, we “review[] the evidence in the light most favorable to, and draw[] all reasonable inferences in favor of, the nonmoving party.” Id. (citing Martin v. Marciano, 871 A.2d 911, 914-15 (R.I. 2005)). This Court “affirm[s] a grant of summary judgment only when ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as [a] matter of law.’” Id. (quoting Martin, 871 A.2d at 915).', 'Discussion', 'Negligent Hiring', 'Before this Court, plaintiff argues that the trial justice erred in granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to count two—negligent hiring—against Smith. The plaintiff contends that, as Rhode Island recognizes direct liability of an employer to third parties injured by acts of unfit or incompetent employees, Smith is liable for not knowing about or inquiring into Ead’s knowledge, qualifications, or ability. The plaintiff further argues that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Ead was an employee or independent contractor. After carefully reviewing the record, we reject this argument.', '“To properly set forth ‘a claim for negligence, a plaintiff must establish a legally cognizable duty owed by a defendant to a plaintiff, a breach of that duty, proximate causation between the conduct and the resulting injury, and the actual loss or damage.’” Brown v. Stanley, 84 A.3d 1157, 1161-62 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Willis, 954 A.2d at 129). “It is axiomatic, however,', '-4- that ‘[a] defendant cannot be liable under a negligence theory unless the defendant owes a duty to the plaintiff.’” Id. at 1162 (quoting Ferreira v. Strack, 636 A.2d 682, 685 (R.I. 1994)).', '“Whether a defendant is under a legal duty in a given case is a question of law.” Willis, 954 A.2d at 129 (citing Martin, 871 A.2d at 915). However, “[b]ecause there is no set formula for finding [a] legal duty, such a determination must be made on a case-by-case basis.” Id. at 130 (citing Martin, 871 A.2d at 915). Accordingly, we conduct this analysis by examining “all relevant factors, including the relationship of the parties, the scope and burden of the obligation to be imposed upon the defendant, public policy considerations, and notions of fairness.” Gushlaw v. Milner, 42 A.3d 1245, 1252 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Volpe v. Gallagher, 821 A.2d 699, 705 (R.I. 2003)). If the court determines that no duty exists, “then the trier of fact has nothing to consider and a motion for summary judgment must be granted.” Soave v. National Velour Corp., 863 A.2d 186, 188 (R.I. 2004) (quoting Ferreira, 636 A.2d at 685).', 'In granting summary judgment, the trial justice reasoned that Smith “could not have known [and] would not have * * * predict[ed] that the city [and DEM] would have required her to take down the structure that * * * Ead had created * * *.” Accordingly, the trial justice determined that Smith, a landowner, did not owe a legal duty to plaintiff, a subsequent demolition contractor.', 'We agree with the trial justice and hold that Smith had no duty to ensure that what Ead built would be safe for a demolition which was not anticipated at the time of hiring and construction. 4 Therefore, “as it is well settled that in the absence of a legal duty, * * * plaintiff’s 4', 'Although plaintiff’s argument that Smith was Ead’s employer and was negligent in hiring him is an issue in this case, we are of the opinion that the issue of whether a duty was owed to plaintiff is determinative and we need not address the issue of Ead’s relationship with Smith.', '-5- claims must fail as a matter of law[,]” summary judgment was properly granted as to count two. See Brown, 84 A.3d at 1164.', 'Negligent Design, Construction, and Inspection', 'The plaintiff also assigns error to the grant of summary judgment as to count seven— negligent design, construction, and inspection—against Ead. The plaintiff asserts that defendant Ead owed plaintiff a legal duty, citing Soave, for the proposition that “a builder or contractor is liable for injury or damage to a third person as a result of the condition of the work, even after completion of the work and acceptance by the owner, where it [is] reasonably foreseeable that a third party would be injured by such work due to the contractor’s negligence * * *.” Soave, 863 A.2d at 189 (quoting Peters v. Forster, 804 N.E.2d 736, 742 (Ind. 2004)).', 'In support of plaintiff’s contention that Ead had a duty of care to him, plaintiff argues: (1) that as a contractor, Ead knew or should have known that proceeding without a building permit would result in an order to dismantle the structure; and (2) that he was “within a class of foreseeable plaintiffs who would be on Smith’s roof” and therefore it was foreseeable that injury could result from Ead’s negligence. The issue before us is whether the trial justice erred in finding, as a matter of law, that Ead did not owe a legal duty to plaintiff. See Brown, 84 A.3d at 1162.', 'After careful review of the record, we agree with the trial justice that Ead did not have a legal duty to make the roof safe for dismantling. The record discloses that Ead had been forced to stop construction, based on factors beyond his control, including zoning and DEM regulations. Over a year later, when the plaintiff was dismantling the roof, Ead had no control over the structure and no ability to control the work or maintain the site. Thus, the trial justice properly granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment as to count seven. We affirm.', '-6-', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court granting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment.

73,State : v. : Kevin Storey.,non-criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Kevin Storey, appeals from a Superior Court judgment of conviction for one count of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of simple assault and battery. After a jury trial, the defendant was sentenced to a term of fifteen years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with five years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation. On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice erred by: (1) denying his motions for judgment of acquittal and new trial; (2) not allowing him to cross- examine the complaining witness concerning custody issues involving her sons; and (3) imposing an illegal sentence. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After considering the parties’ written submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. 1 For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'The parties agreed to waive oral argument.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'Danielle Saleeba testified at trial that on the night of October 27, 2009, she awoke to defendant (then her husband) shaking her shoulders and demanding to know why she had not told him that David Liese, the general manager at the restaurant where she worked, had been working with her the previous night. According to Saleeba, defendant struck her on the head with an open palm and began choking her with both hands pushing down on her throat. Saleeba recalled that she could not breathe and thought that she was going to die. She managed to get out of defendant’s chokehold, but he then stuck his fingers down her throat, only pulling them out when she bit him. Saleeba further testified that, as she tried to get off the bed, defendant struck her left temple with either his fist or his elbow.', 'Ms. Saleeba said she was bleeding profusely from the side of her head. She testified that when her eldest son saw her emerge from the bedroom on her way to the bathroom, he told her that she had “blood squirting out the side of [her] head.” 2 Saleeba recalled hearing defendant tell her son that his mother had “hit her head on the computer desk.” The computer desk was located next to the bed but on the other side from where she always slept. At trial, Saleeba stated that she “went along with it [because she] didn’t want anything bad to happen to [her] son * * *.” When Saleeba looked in the mirror in the bathroom, she saw a “big gaping hole” on her temple that “looked like a fountain coming out the side of [her] head.” Saleeba told defendant she needed an ambulance to get to the hospital, but he insisted on driving her to the hospital himself. Before leaving, Saleeba testified, she called her mother (who lived ten minutes away), told her 2', 'Saleeba has three sons, but defendant is the biological father of only her youngest son.', '-2- that she had cut her head, and asked her to come over to sit with the children while she went to the hospital.', 'Ms. Saleeba’s mother, Cynthia Saleeba (Cynthia), 3 testified that when she arrived at her daughter’s house, she saw a lot of blood around the house. She observed blood on a pillow and towel on the kitchen floor, smears and trails of blood between rooms as well as in the bedroom on the pillow, sheet, and blanket on the side of the bed farthest away from the computer table. She did not recall seeing any blood on the computer table in the bedroom or between the computer table and the bed.', 'Ms. Saleeba testified that she had been married to defendant for four years at the time of the incident, but that they had not been getting along for a couple of years. Saleeba recalled that, over the course of the previous month, defendant had been accusing her of having an affair with David Liese. At trial, Liese testified that he saw defendant at the restaurant the evening before the incident occurred, and that defendant made comments insinuating that there was more than an employer and employee relationship between Liese and Saleeba. Liese testified that the comments made him feel uncomfortable because they were not true, but that defendant did not threaten him.', 'According to Saleeba, during the ten-minute drive to Rhode Island Hospital, defendant told her that he had to beat her up because he could not “beat up [Liese],” and he repeatedly told her that “[t]he next time I’m going to kill you.” At the hospital, Saleeba received approximately twenty-four stitches along her left temple. She admitted at trial that she did not tell any of the staff at Rhode Island Hospital the truth about how she had sustained her injuries because she 3', 'To avoid confusion, we shall refer to Cynthia Saleeba as Cynthia. No disrespect is intended.', '-3- feared for her life and because defendant was with her most of the time that she was at the hospital.', 'Several days later, however, Saleeba told her mother what had happened. On Halloween, after trick-or-treating with all three of her sons, she returned home with them and the father of her eldest son.', 'Saleeba testified that, sometime after defendant arrived, he announced his intention to “take care of [Liese] once and for all” and then left. Saleeba recalled that, when defendant returned, he was angry because Liese had not been at the restaurant, which was where defendant had expected to find him. The defendant announced that Saleeba was never to return to her employment at the restaurant. Saleeba testified that she called her mother because her children were upset and afraid, and wanted to leave. Cynthia testified that she received a telephone call that evening around 10 p.m. from her daughter, asking her to come to her daughter’s house. When Cynthia arrived at the house, she found her two eldest grandsons in tears. Saleeba testified that she then told her mother the truth about what had happened four days earlier. Saleeba and her children went to her mother’s house to spend the night. The next morning, Saleeba and her mother went to the East Providence police station, where they both completed written statements and photographs of Saleeba were taken.', 'The defendant was tried by a jury in March 2012 in Providence County Superior Court on two counts of violating G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2: one count of assault with a dangerous weapon and one count of felony assault resulting in serious bodily injury. At the close of the state’s evidence, the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal. The jury returned a verdict on March 30, 2012, convicting defendant of assault with a dangerous weapon (count 1), acquitting him of assault and battery resulting in serious bodily injury (count 2), but convicting him instead on count 2’s lesser-included offense of simple assault and battery. On April 5, 2012,', '-4- the trial justice denied defendant’s motion for a new trial. On July 12, 2012, the trial justice sentenced defendant to fifteen years on count 1, with five years to serve and ten years suspended, with probation. On count 2, the trial justice sentenced defendant to one year, suspended, with probation, to be served concurrently with count 1. The trial justice also entered a no contact order with respect to Saleeba and ordered domestic abuse counseling.', 'II', 'Issues on Appeal', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred in denying both his motion for judgment of acquittal and his motion for a new trial. The defendant also contends that the trial justice erred during the trial when she did not allow cross-examination of Saleeba on the subject of prior custody issues regarding her sons and that the fifteen-year sentence for his conviction for assault with a dangerous weapon is illegal. We will address each issue in turn, providing additional facts as necessary.', 'A', 'Motions for Judgment of Acquittal and New Trial', 'At the close of the state’s evidence, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. The entirety of his argument was:', '“In this case, Judge, I’d submit, given the physical discrepancies in', 'the evidence, the fact that although the complainant said she was', 'choked to the point of not being able to breathe, the physicians on', 'that night noted nothing in her throat. Given that, I ask the Court', 'to grant this motion.” The trial justice, noting that she must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state without assessing credibility or weighing the evidence, denied the motion.', '-5-', 'After the jury returned its verdict, defendant presented a similar argument in his motion for a new trial. “The pivotal point in this case,” he submitted, was that a hand “simply could not cause the wound that was discussed and described at trial.” Moreover, he argued that while Saleeba testified to having been strangled to “near blackout condition” on the night of the incident, the hospital record reflected no soreness or redness or markings to her neck; nor were any bruises visible in a photograph taken by the police four days later. Thus, he maintained, reasonable minds could not differ “that nothing touched her throat that night.”', '1. Standard of Review', 'We have oft stated that, “[w]hen faced, as here, with both Rule 29 and [Super. R. Crim. P.] 33 motions, ‘this Court first conducts a review of the new-trial motion.’” State v. Fleck, 81 A.3d 1129, 1133 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Gaffney, 63 A.3d 888, 893 (R.I. 2013)). This is so because a defendant has a “higher hurdle to overcome when arguing a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal than when he seeks to prevail on a Rule 33 motion for a new trial * * *.” Fleck, 81 A.3d at 1133. “[U]nless a defendant can show that the presented evidence failed to support his or her conviction upon the motion-for-a-new-trial standard, a defendant necessarily will be unable to establish he or she was entitled to a judgment of acquittal.” State v. Pineda, 13 A.3d 623, 640 (R.I. 2011). We begin our analysis, therefore, with an examination of defendant’s motion for a new trial.', 'When a trial justice is presented with a motion for a new trial based on the weight of the evidence, he or she “acts as a thirteenth juror and exercises independent judgment on the credibility of witnesses and on the weight of the evidence.” State v. Watkins, 92 A.3d 172, 191 (R.I. 2014) (quoting State v. Clay, 79 A.3d 832, 841 (R.I. 2013)). “[T]he trial justice must consider the evidence in light of the jury charge, then independently assess the credibility of the', '-6- witnesses and the weight of the evidence, and also ultimately determine whether he or she would have reached a result different from that reached by the jury.” Id. (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 841- 42). “If, after conducting this independent review, the trial justice agrees with the jury’s verdict or if the evidence is such that reasonable minds could differ as to the outcome, the motion for a new trial should be denied.” Id. (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 842). “Only when the trial justice does not agree with the jury’s verdict, [must he or she] embark on a fourth analytical step.” Id. (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 842).', 'This Court’s review of a denial of a motion for a new trial is deferential because the trial justice is in an “especially good position to evaluate the facts and to judge the credibility of the witnesses * * *.” Watkins, 92 A.3d at 191 (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 842). “If the trial justice has articulated adequate grounds for denying the motion, his or her decision is entitled to great weight and will not be overturned by this Court unless he or she has overlooked or misconceived material evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Id. (quoting Clay, 79 A.3d at 842).', '2. Discussion', 'The defendant argues that the evidence presented at trial was “equivocal at best” and that the weight of the evidence did not support a finding that defendant had choked Saleeba “as she had alleged.” The defendant contends that the only evidence tending to prove that he had choked Saleeba was her own testimony, which was not consistent with the statements she made to her son, mother, and hospital staff immediately after the incident. The defendant also argues that the jury could not have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of assault with a dangerous weapon without expert testimony that it is possible for a person to be choked to the point of not being able to breathe without incurring any marks or bruising on the neck.', '-7-', 'At the hearing on defendant’s motion, the trial justice articulated the standard for a new trial motion and then summarized the evidence presented to the jury. The trial justice stated that she found Saleeba credible and honest, commenting that she “stated the evidence as it was, * * * didn’t exaggerate, * * * [and] explained what she did, why she did it.” The trial justice also commented that Cynthia’s testimony was consistent with Saleeba’s version regarding the precise location in the bedroom where Saleeba had sustained her injuries. The trial justice stated that she agreed with the jury’s determination that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of assault with a dangerous weapon even though the hospital had not noted any injury to Saleeba’s neck. Ultimately, the trial justice agreed with the verdict.', 'On appeal, defendant argues that the trial justice impermissibly shifted the burden of proof to him when she commented that “there was no expert testimony with respect to * * * whether the choking with the hands would have left any marks there.” We have previously rejected a similar argument when a trial justice commented about a defendant’s failure to offer evidence that a visible injury would have had to result from the conduct of which he was accused. See State v. Adewumi, 966 A.2d 1217, 1224 (R.I. 2009).', 'Here, the trial justice thoroughly reviewed the testimony and evidence adduced at trial. She found the testimony of the state’s “most significant witness,” Danielle Saleeba, to be credible and forthright, specifically commenting on her testimony of defendant “choking her, standing over her, kneeling over her, his hands on her, and she couldn’t breathe. She thought she was dying at that time.” The trial justice then assessed the evidence in light of her charge to the jury and determined that she would have reached the same conclusion as the jury.', 'It is clear to us that the trial justice’s statement about the lack of expert testimony to show that choking in the manner described by the complaining witness necessarily would have left', '-8- marks on her neck was merely commentary that no such evidence had been offered to discredit Saleeba’s testimony.', '“[T]he trial justice’s comment on the lack of expert evidence does', 'not compel the conclusion that [the] defendant was required to', 'produce expert evidence; rather, the comment merely implies that', 'such evidence may have assisted the trial justice, as the trier of', 'fact, to better understand the circumstances of the case.” Adewumi,', '966 A.2d at 1224. The trial justice did consider, however, the explanation given by Saleeba at the hospital that she had hit her head on a computer table. The trial justice believed it to be a “story,” noting that defendant “was at her side. She was afraid. She thought he would kill her, because he said that over and over on the way to the hospital.” We are satisfied that the trial justice appropriately exercised her responsibilities in considering defendant’s motion for a new trial, and that she neither overlooked nor misconceived material evidence, nor was otherwise clearly wrong.', 'The defendant also argues that there was no evidence that he “used his hands in a manner that was likely to produce substantial bodily harm” or that he “in fact possessed the physical capability of using his hands in such a way as to cause substantial bodily harm.” He contends, therefore, that the state failed to meet its burden of proof on the charge of assault with a dangerous weapon. To the extent that this argument has been adequately preserved with respect to either his Rule 29 motion or Rule 33 motion, we find it to be unpersuasive.', 'We have previously held that “the use of hands alone may constitute an assault with a dangerous weapon” when the hands are “employed in such a manner as to be likely to produce substantial bodily harm.” State v. Zangrilli, 440 A.2d 710, 711 (R.I. 1982). “This Court has repeatedly held that ‘[t]he test is not whether serious bodily injury results from the assault, but whether the object was so used that serious bodily injury may have resulted.’” State v. Lopez, 78 A.3d 773, 781 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. Gore, 820 A.2d 978, 980 (R.I. 2003) (mem.)). We', '-9- recently affirmed the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal under similar circumstances. See Lopez, 78 A.3d at 781. In Lopez, the complaining witness testified that the defendant had his hands around her neck in a choking fashion but did not testify as to the length of time the defendant had his hands around her neck, nor did she sustain injuries that are typically consistent with choking. Id. at 777, 781. Based on this evidence, we upheld the denial of the motion, commenting that “[t]his Court has never stated that any specific duration or intensity is necessary for choking with a person’s hands to constitute assault with a dangerous weapon.” Id. at 781. An assault with a dangerous weapon occurs even though hands are not a per se weapon because serious bodily harm may result. Id.; Zangrilli, 440 A.2d at 711-12. Regardless of the injuries actually suffered by the complaining witness as a result of the choking, “a choke, if carried to its natural conclusion, would probably cause death.” Lopez, 78 A.3d at 781.', 'In this case, the complaining witness testified that defendant “had his hands pushed on [her] throat and he was choking [her].” Saleeba recalled that she could not breathe and thought she was going to die. Notwithstanding any evidence to the contrary, whether we consider this evidence in the light most favorable to the state under Rule 29, or whether we consider it in light of the trial justice’s credibility assessments under Rule 33, sufficient evidence was produced at trial to support a finding that defendant used his hands “in such a manner * * * likely to produce substantial bodily harm.” See Lopez, 78 A.3d at 781 (quoting Zangrilli, 440 A.2d at 711).', 'B', 'Scope of Cross-Examination', '1. Standard of Review', '“The ability of a defendant to meaningfully cross-examine the state’s witnesses is ‘an essential element’ of the due process guarantees of the United States and Rhode Island', '- 10 - constitutions.” State v. Lomba, 37 A.3d 615, 621 (R.I. 2012) (quoting State v. Doctor, 690 A.2d 321, 327 (R.I. 1997)). However, it is well settled that the trial justice has the discretion to sustain objections to lines of inquiry that are “potentially misleading or irrelevant, that offer little or no probative value, or that exceed the scope of the direct examination * * *.” State v. Wright, 817 A.2d 600, 610 (R.I. 2003). As such, “[a] trial justice’s exercise of discretion to limit the scope of cross-examination ‘is not reviewable except for clear abuse, and only if it constitutes prejudicial error.’” Lomba, 37 A.3d at 621 (quoting Wright, 817 A.2d at 610).', '2. Discussion', 'The defendant argues that the trial justice erred when she did not allow him to cross- examine Saleeba about past custody issues with her two eldest sons. The defendant contends that this subject was directly related to Saleeba’s credibility as a witness because the purpose of his cross-examination on this subject was to probe her potential motive to lie about the incident. A review of the trial transcript, however, reveals that the trial justice did allow defendant to explore the custody of Saleeba’s two eldest sons outside the presence of the jury.', 'When defendant’s counsel questioned Saleeba under oath but outside the presence of the jury regarding any past custody issues and/or involvement with the Department of Children, Youth & Families (DCYF), she admitted that, while she had joint custody of both older sons with their respective fathers, primary placement of one of those sons was with his father. Saleeba relayed that, while both of her sons were at one time physically placed with their respective fathers, her eldest son began to live with her after she contacted DCYF to report an incident between him and his step- mother. Saleeba denied that she had ever lost custody of her eldest son.', 'The trial justice ruled that defendant could not cross-examine Saleeba about her prior custody issues because, based on the questioning that took place outside the presence of the jury,', '- 11 - the custody of her two eldest children was irrelevant to the charges being tried. Given the wide discretion we afford trial justices in limiting the extent of cross-examination, we perceive no error in the trial justice’s ruling. See Wright, 817 A.2d at 610.', 'C', 'Illegal Sentence', 'The defendant argues that the fifteen-year sentence imposed by the trial justice is illegal because, he contends, the trial justice confused the evidence constituting the basis for the defendant’s convictions on each count and in essence sentenced the defendant to fifteen years for his conviction for simple assault and battery. It is well settled that this Court does not consider either “the validity or the legality of a sentence on direct appeal” unless extraordinary circumstances are present. State v. Ibrahim, 862 A.2d 787, 793-94 (R.I. 2004) (quoting State v. Bettencourt, 723 A.2d 1101, 1114 (R.I. 1999)). This Court has held repeatedly that the review of a sentence must begin in the Superior Court pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. Ibrahim, 862 A.2d at 794. The record in this case does not reflect that the defendant challenged the sentence imposed by the Superior Court and the defendant has not provided us with extraordinary circumstances to compel our review of his sentence on direct appeal. Therefore, this issue is not properly before us for review. 4 4', 'Even if this issue were properly before this Court, there is no indication that the trial justice imposed an illegal sentence. The Reporter’s Notes for Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure defines an “illegal sentence” as one “which has been imposed after a valid conviction but is not authorized under law.” The defendant was found guilty of assault with a dangerous weapon in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2(a), which carries a maximum sentence of twenty years. The trial justice sentenced the defendant to fifteen years, which is clearly less than the maximum allowed by law.', '- 12 -', 'III', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

74,: v. : Patricia Brown. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Indeglia, for the Court. The defendant, Patricia Brown, appeals from a Superior Court ruling granting the motion of the plaintiff, Pawtucket Redevelopment Agency (PRA), for a new trial on the defendant’s counterclaim against the PRA. The plaintiff also appeals the denial of its renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. This case came before the Supreme Court on October 28, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After hearing the arguments of counsel and reviewing the memoranda submitted on behalf of the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown. Accordingly, we shall decide the appeals at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 6, 2007, the PRA filed a complaint in Providence County Superior Court against defendant. The complaint alleged that the PRA had entered into an agreement with defendant to loan her up to $100,000 toward the purchase, relocation, and maintenance of the', '-1- Silver Top Diner. 1 The agreement was verified by defendant’s execution of a promissory note, an indemnification agreement, and a U.C.C. financing statement. Pursuant to the agreement, plaintiff advanced defendant $52,878.25. The plaintiff averred that defendant had defaulted on repayment of the advance and refused to repay the loan, which constituted a breach of the agreement. 2 On May 8, 2007, defendant filed an answer and a counterclaim.', 'The trial commenced on October 3, 2012. The PRA introduced testimony from the current executive director of the PRA, Barney Heath, as well as the former executive director, Michael Cassidy. During defendant’s case-in-chief, testimony was heard from Herbert Weiss, an employee of the city’s planning and redevelopment office; Laurie DeRobbio, a contractor who consulted with defendant; Donna Brady, a former property owner in the area of the proposed new site of the diner; and defendant herself.', 'It was adduced at trial that the PRA is a statutorily created quasi-public entity whose purpose is to allocate federal funds as a means of promoting economic development with the goal of improving the community and living environment in the City of Pawtucket (city or Pawtucket). In late 2001, the PRA learned that the Silver Top Diner was being evicted from its location in Providence.', 'It was undisputed that the diner was not permitted to retain its Providence location.', 'The defendant was contacted by Weiss to discuss the possibility of bringing the diner and its business to Pawtucket. Weiss reported back to Cassidy. At the time, 1', 'The Silver Top Diner was a fixture of the area that now surrounds Providence Place Mall since the 1930s. Operated out of a classic Kullman Dining Car, in its heyday the Silver Top Diner serviced the factory workers returning home from the third shift. In more recent years, the diner catered to the late-night scene and no doubt features prominently in many after-hour tales. The history of the Silver Top Diner, as well as its struggle with the City of Providence to remain in its original location is chronicled in both Diners of New England (2005) by Randy Garbin and Donald Kaplan and Alan Bellink’s Classic Diners of the Northeast (1986). 2', 'The plaintiff also requested a declaratory judgment to enforce its security interest in the diner pursuant to the U.C.C. financing statement. The trial justice granted plaintiff the requested declaratory relief, which is not at issue in this appeal.', '-2- Cassidy was not only Weiss’s superior at the planning department, but also the executive director of the PRA.', 'There was testimony that defendant, Cassidy, Weiss, and Bernard Buoncervello 3 met a number of times to discuss possible sites for the diner and also to discuss how the PRA would be able to help with the project. By letter dated January 30, 2002, Cassidy, in his capacity as the city’s director of planning and development (as opposed to his role with the PRA), contacted defendant. Cassidy informed defendant of a possible site that defendant might want to consider. He also explained that the acquisition of a “24/7” victualling license would rest entirely with the city council, but that the city’s planning and development office would be open to discussing options for defendant to explore to obtain financial assistance with her project.', 'Cassidy testified regarding further discussions among the above-named individuals. He explained that on February 27, 2002, in his capacity as the executive director of the PRA, he sent defendant a letter which stated that the PRA agreed to approve defendant’s “request for a Commercial Rehab loan to assist [defendant in] relocate[ing] the Silver Top Diner to the City of Pawtucket.” The letter set forth seven enumerated conditions on the loan approval, including that:', '(1) The PRA will provide a $100,000 loan to assist with all relocation costs of the', 'diner, in accordance with a disbursement schedule determined by the PRA;', '(2) The PRA will require a first position mortgage and U.C.C. lien on the diner', 'and on the property that is deeded for the diner site and that ownership of the', 'physical diner structure must be transferred to defendant prior to closing;', '(3) The loan will be amortized and repaid over a fifteen-year period, interest rate', 'of the loan will be 5 percent, and that payment is due upon certification of', 'occupancy to operate; 3', 'At trial, defendant testified that while she was the owner of the business, Buoncervello was the owner of the building in which the business operated. There was also testimony regarding a side agreement between Buoncervello and defendant regarding the transfer of title to the building. That agreement is not relevant to this appeal.', '-3-', '(4) The PRA has approved temporary storage of the diner on the PRA’s property', 'until the diner is relocated to a final site;', '(5) The PRA will request the City of Pawtucket to transfer three lots to the PRA', 'to create a development site for the diner;', '(6) The PRA will require a competitive bid process for any and all work that will', 'be paid for with PRA funds; and', '(7) The PRA will require inspection of the work prior to the release of any', 'payments for the relocation costs.', 'At trial, there was also testimony as to the division of responsibilities between the PRA and defendant regarding the project. The parties agreed that the PRA was to be responsible for the physical improvements to the land upon which the diner was to be relocated, but that defendant would be responsible for the development of the building itself. The defendant did not dispute the division of responsibilities, but rather contended that the PRA indicated to her that it would “hold [her] by [the] hand every step of the way,” and that it had failed in that regard.', 'It was further testified that on March 8, 2002, defendant signed a promissory note and other related documents to finalize the loan described in the February 27, 2002, letter. After the loan documents were signed, the diner was moved from its Providence location to the Pawtucket site. Following the relocation, a series of efforts were undertaken by the parties to make the operation of the diner in Pawtucket a reality, but all these efforts were for naught.', 'The testimony at trial indicated that on June 27, 2002, defendant submitted a site plan to the PRA that was developed by a contractor named William Gervais. The bare-bones plan merely indicated where on the piece of property the diner would be situated. Meanwhile, the PRA handled a request to the zoning board for a variance for the project. Additionally, the PRA arranged for a neighborhood meeting to take place in the presence of the city council member whose district covered the site of the diner to see if he would support defendant’s request for a', '-4- “24/7” victualling license. To defendant’s dismay, she encountered significant opposition from neighbors at the meeting; and, ultimately, the council member stated that he would not support her request if it appeared before the city council.', 'In light of this opposition, defendant stated that she would seek to find another site to relocate her business. Yet, for four months, the PRA did not hear from defendant regarding the project. In the spring of 2003, defendant restarted her communications with the PRA. By that time, the PRA had contacted an engineering firm named Ayoub Engineering to craft a site plan for the lot on which the diner would sit. The PRA suggested that defendant could also utilize Ayoub to obtain a building design. In May of 2003, defendant entered into a contract with Ayoub for the building design; and both the Gervais site plan and the design plan made by Ayoub were put out to bid. Unfortunately, no bids were received.', 'Cassidy testified that, as a result, he met with defendant to discuss possible courses of action. Cassidy explained that one possible option would be to seek to obtain an estimate of the construction costs from which a contract could later be sought.', 'Although defendant was responsible for the building component of the project, the PRA obtained a construction cost estimate from a company called Site Tech.', 'After receiving the estimate from Site Tech, defendant and DeRobbio, the owner of Capital City Construction, engaged in discussions regarding construction on the project. DeRobbio testified that her firm wanted to perform the construction work for the project. Additionally, DeRobbio explained that she believed the Site Tech estimate to be too costly, and felt that the construction could be completed for less. However, neither defendant nor DeRobbio ever produced a written plan required for the PRA to approve construction.', '-5-', 'There was testimony that, at the suggestion of the PRA, a consultant to the Pawtucket Business Development Corporation (PBDC) produced a business plan based on the Site Tech estimate for defendant with the aim of her being able to utilize it to secure bank financing for construction of the building. However, bank financing for the project was not secured.', 'At trial, after the PRA rested, defendant moved for judgment as a matter of law. The trial justice denied the motion, which was not later renewed. At the close of all of the evidence, the PRA moved for judgment as a matter of law on both the PRA’s complaint and on defendant’s counterclaim. The trial justice denied the motions. Although she found defendant’s filings somewhat confusing, the trial justice nonetheless allowed the case to go to the jury on defendant’s claim for negligent misrepresentation concerning the scope of the relationship between the PRA and defendant and the business advice that the PRA would provide her. 4 In addition, plaintiff’s claims for breach of contract and for book account were submitted to the jury. On October 10, 2012, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the PRA on its book account claim for $52,878.25. The jury also rendered a verdict in favor of defendant on her amended counterclaim for negligent misrepresentation for $112,878.25. Judgment on each of the jury verdicts was entered that same day.', 'Subsequently, the PRA filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law on defendant’s counterclaim and a motion for a remittitur or alternatively a new trial on the counterclaim. On October 26, 2012, a hearing was held on the motions. Viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the trial justice denied the PRA’s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law. 4', 'At a hearing prior to the jury charge, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion to amend her counterclaim to conform to the evidence adduced at trial. Although the trial justice acknowledged that she “ha[d] a bit of a difficult time sorting through the factual allegations and a', '-6-', 'In reviewing the motion for a new trial, the trial justice outlined her role as the “superjuror.” The trial justice summarized the evidence adduced at trial and then proceeded to discuss the credibility of each of the witnesses. She noted that the PRA’s witnesses “were both professional, straightforward, and persuasive” and “testified consistently to the travel of the project.” In stark contrast, the trial justice found that defendant was someone who sought to “continual[ly] blame * * * others at all points in this project” and who took “very little responsibility for her own actions,” which ultimately left the trial justice to “seriously question her credibility.” These credibility deficiencies gave the trial justice “great pause in accepting the defendant’s representation that Cassidy said he would hold her hand every step of the way.”', 'Indeed, the trial justice found that “the credible evidence of record does not support a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant’s reliance on anything the PRA may have said or done was reasonable under the circumstances.” Further, the trial justice found that the jury award on defendant’s counterclaim had “no rational basis in the evidence whatsoever.”', 'Therefore, she granted the PRA’s motion for a new trial on defendant’s counterclaim, finding that “the damages award[ed] to the defendant failed to respond to the controversy, [did] not do substantial justice between the parties, and [was] also against the fair preponderance of the evidence.” Given this disposition, the trial justice found it unnecessary to address the PRA’s motion for a remittitur.', 'On November 7, 2012, defendant filed a notice of appeal. The notice sought to appeal a judgment that was purportedly entered on October 19, 2012. The notice also mentioned the granting of a new trial and a counterclaim.', 'The following day, on November 8, 2012, a judgment was entered in the Superior Court that, inter alia, denied plaintiff’s motion for legal recognizable cause of action,” she determined that “it appear[ed] to the [c]ourt that the legal cause of action set forth in this counterclaim is a negligent misrepresentation claim.”', '-7- judgment as a matter of law and granted plaintiff’s motion for a new trial and to set aside the jury verdict on defendant’s counterclaim. On January 3, 2013, the PRA filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the denial of plaintiff’s motion for judgment as a matter of law on defendant’s counterclaim.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When ruling on a motion for judgment as a matter of law, “the trial justice is called upon to consider ‘the evidence presented at trial in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses * * *.’” Almonte v. Kurl, 46 A.3d 1, 16 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Swerdlick v. Koch, 721 A.2d 849, 856 (R.I. 1998)). The trial justice must deny the motion “if there are factual issues concerning which reasonable people may reach differing conclusions.” Botelho v. Caster’s, Inc., 970 A.2d 541, 545 (R.I. 2009). “It is a fundamental principle that this Court reviews in a de novo manner a trial justice’s decision with respect to a motion for judgment as a matter of law * * * employ[ing] the same standard as did the trial justice.” Almonte, 46 A.3d at 16.', '“With regard to the motion for a new trial, it is well settled that our review of a trial justice’s decision is deferential.” Martin v. Lawrence, 79 A.3d 1275, 1283 (R.I. 2013). “A trial justice’s role in considering a motion for a new trial is that of a superjuror, who must weigh the evidence and assess the credibility of the witnesses.” Rose v. Cariello, 85 A.3d 618, 622 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Gomes v. Rosario, 79 A.3d 1262, 1265 (R.I. 2013)). In performing this task, “[t]he trial justice is also free to ‘reject some evidence and draw inferences which are reasonable in view of the testimony and evidence in the record.’” King v. Huntress, Inc., 94 A.3d 467, 481 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Botelho, 970 A.2d at 545). If the trial justice has carried out the duties', '-8- required by Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure then “‘his or her decision is accorded great weight by this Court’ and ‘his or her determination either granting or denying a motion for new trial will not be disturbed unless * * * [he or she] has overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.’” King, 94 A.3d at 482 (quoting Botelho, 970 A.2d at 546).', 'Further, “[a]lthough the fixing of damages is normally a function of the jury, it may be rejected by a trial justice on a motion for a new trial.” Rose, 85 A.3d at 623 (quoting Bonn v. Pepin, 11 A.3d 76, 78 (R.I. 2011)). “If the trial justice is persuaded that ‘the verdict is wrong because it fails to respond truly to the merits and to administer substantial justice between the parties or is against the fair preponderance of the evidence, he [or she] should set aside the verdict and order a new trial.’” McGarry v. Pielech, 47 A.3d 271, 280 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Morgera v. Hanover Insurance Co., 655 A.2d 698, 698 (R.I. 1995) (mem.)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'We pause at the outset to address several issues relating to the notices of appeal filed in this matter.', 'Article I, Rule 4(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure provides that a notice of appeal must be filed “within twenty (20) days of the date of the entry of the judgment, order, or decree appealed from.” The plaintiff’s notice of appeal was dated and filed on January 3, 2013, which is outside of the twenty-day window from the judgment entered on November 8, 2012. “It is well settled that ‘the time specified in Rule 4(a) is mandatory, and that once the prescribed time has passed there can be no review by way of appeal.’” Iozzi v. City of Cranston,', '-9- 52 A.3d 585, 588 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Wachovia Bank v. Hershberger, 911 A.2d 278, 279-80 (R.I. 2006) (mem.)).', 'At oral argument, plaintiff’s counsel averred that the appeal was timely. He made reference to our briefing order which recognized the following:', '“The parties stipulate that the Court may accept copies of the judgment on the', 'defendant’s counterclaim and the notice of appeal filed by the plaintiff from that', 'judgment, in lieu of the originals.” That order does not help plaintiff.', 'While parties may agree to accept copies of original documents, the matter still remains that the notice of appeal was dated and filed on January 3, 2013. Accordingly, plaintiff did not timely appeal. The filing of a timely notice of appeal is the “sole sine qua non of the taking of the appeal.” State v. Hallenbeck, 878 A.2d 992, 1020 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Joseph R. Weisberger, Rhode Island Appellate Practice cmt. 3.3 at 14 (1993)). Indeed, Article I, Rule 3(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Appellate Procedure “makes clear that failure to file a timely notice of appeal renders any purported appeal invalid.” Martin v. Lilly, 505 A.2d 1156, 1159 (R.I. 1986). No stipulation of the parties can overcome this procedural requirement. Additionally, there is nothing in the record indicating that the appeal was otherwise timely. We therefore decline to address the merits of plaintiff’s appeal of the denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law. 5 See DiLibero v. State, 996 A.2d 599, 601 (R.I. 2010) (mem.) (holding that “this Court will not entertain untimely appeals”). 5', 'Even if we were to consider plaintiff’s appeal, we still would not find that there was any error in the trial justice’s denial of the motion. Although the trial justice ultimately acknowledged that she did not believe defendant’s assertion that the PRA misrepresented the scope of the relationship between it and defendant, the trial justice still recognized, appropriately, that reasonable minds could draw “conflicting conclusions” on that issue. Therefore, the motion for judgment as a matter of law was properly denied. See Botelho v. Caster’s, Inc., 970 A.2d 541, 545 (R.I. 2009).', '- 10 -', 'Conversely, the errors with defendant’s notice of appeal, although there are many, are not necessarily fatal to the perfection of her appeal. 6 Rule 3(c) provides that “[t]he notice of appeal * * * shall designate the judgment, order or decree or part thereof appealed from.” Here, defendant’s notice stated that it sought to appeal a judgment entered on October 19, 2012. Specifically, the notice sought to appeal from paragraph five of that judgment. The record makes clear that no judgment in this matter was entered on that date.', 'However, on that date, the PRA did file a “Motion for a New Trial.” In that motion, below the paragraph numbered “4,” plaintiff requested that the trial justice “set aside the jury’s verdict and award herein as to Defendant’s Counterclaim and grant and award to Plaintiff a new trial on Defendant’s Counterclaim.”', 'The defendant’s notice of appeal also mentioned the granting of a new trial and a counterclaim. Accordingly, it is clear that defendant sought to appeal the granting of the PRA’s motion for a new trial and setting aside the jury verdict on defendant’s counterclaim. See Greensleeves, Inc. v. Smiley, 942 A.2d 284, 289-92 (R.I. 2007). We therefore proceed to address the merits of defendant’s appeal. 7 6', 'We note that defendant’s notice of appeal is date-stamped November 9, 2012. However, the docket sheet indicates that defendant’s notice of appeal was filed on November 7, 2012, prior to the entry of judgment. Even if filed prematurely, we may still treat defendant’s notice of appeal as timely. See Russell v. Kalian, 414 A.2d 462, 464 (R.I. 1980) (noting that for certain prematurely filed notices of appeal we may “treat the appeal as if it had been timely filed after the entry of judgment”). 7', 'In addition to the technical error in defendant’s notice of appeal, defendant’s Rule 12A statements come dangerously close to constituting a waiver of the issue on appeal. See Wilkinson v. State Crime Laboratory Commission, 788 A.2d 1129, 1131 n.1 (R.I. 2002) (“Simply stating an issue for appellate review, without a meaningful discussion thereof or legal briefing of the issues, does not assist the Court in focusing on the legal questions raised, and therefore constitutes a waiver of that issue.”). Also, to the extent defendant tries to argue in her Rule 12A statements that the trial justice should have granted defendant’s motion for judgment as a matter of law, we need not address such argument. The defendant “failed to renew [her motion] at either the close of the evidence or after the jury’s verdict * * * [and] [t]his failure * * * is fatal to [her] efforts to renew the arguments [she] now makes before us.” Blue Coast, Inc. v. Suarez Corporation Industries, 870 A.2d 997, 1008 (R.I. 2005).', '- 11 -', 'In doing so, we note that the trial justice conducted an extensive review of the proceedings below, passing on the weight of the evidence and assessing the credibility of the witnesses, including defendant herself.', 'In this assessment, defendant was found to be not credible. Further, the trial justice found that it appeared that the PRA had attempted to provide defendant with the resources and services that it had promised her it would and that it was defendant herself who failed to fulfill her responsibilities to the project. Additionally, based on her independent review of the record, the trial justice found that the jury award on defendant’s counterclaim had “no rational basis in the evidence whatsoever.” In sum, the trial justice carefully and completely carried out her duties in ruling on a motion for a new trial.', 'Therefore, in no way has the defendant pointed to any instance in which the trial justice “overlooked or misconceived material and relevant evidence or was otherwise clearly wrong.” Rose, 85 A.3d at 623 (quoting Gomes, 79 A.3d at 1265). Accordingly, we discern no error in the trial justice’s decision to grant the plaintiff’s motion for a new trial and to set aside the jury verdict on the defendant’s counterclaim.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The note stated in relevant part: “I understand that the Lender may transfer this Note. The Lender or anyone who takes this Note by transfer and who is entitled to receive payments under this Note is called the ‘Note Holder.’” To secure payment obligations under the note, the Breggias executed a mortgage (the mortgage) on the property located at 21 Tabor Drive. The mortgage deed denominated the Breggias as the borrowers and mortgagors and specified that MERS was the mortgagee, acting as nominee for lender, AmNet, and lender’s successors and assigns. The mortgage deed included the statutory power of sale in favor of MERS as well as its “successors and assigns.” In the event that the Breggias failed to fulfill their obligations under the note, it was provided that MERS had the right to enforce its interests, “including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the Property.” The mortgage deed was duly executed and recorded in the Land Evidence Records for the Town of Johnston on February 28, 2007.', 'AmNet subsequently transferred the note payable without recourse to IndyMac Bank, FSB (IndyMac), which then transferred the note endorsed in blank to Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). IndyMac remained the servicing agent of the note on behalf of Fannie Mae.', 'On July 11, 2008, the Office of Thrift Supervision closed IndyMac and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver for IndyMac. The interim bank of IndyMac Federal Bank, FSB (IndyMac Federal) was established, and the FDIC was appointed as conservator for IndyMac Federal. IndyMac’s assets were then transferred to IndyMac Federal, and the FDIC, still acting as receiver for IndyMac, assumed IndyMac’s responsibilities as servicer of the notes which IndyMac had previously transferred to Fannie Mae. When IndyMac Federal was placed into receivership on March 19, 2009, substantially all of its assets were sold', '-2- to OneWest, including the note-servicing rights. Thereafter, Fannie Mae and OneWest entered into a contract in which OneWest agreed to service the notes then held by Fannie Mae.', 'On May 15, 2009, MERS, as nominee for original lender AmNet, assigned its interest in the mortgage to OneWest. OneWest thus stood in a position where it was authorized to service the note for Fannie Mae and was also the mortgagee by assignment from MERS. When the Breggias failed to make timely payments, OneWest initiated foreclosure proceedings, sending notice of default to the Breggias and scheduling a foreclosure sale for July 28, 2009. On July 22, 2009, the Breggias filed an action seeking a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and compensatory damages in Providence County Superior Court.', 'Their complaint sought a declaration that the assignment from MERS to OneWest was invalid, and it also sought to quiet title to the property. The sale was enjoined for two weeks by a Superior Court justice, but was eventually held by OneWest, as mortgagee and servicer for the note-holder, on January 20, 2010. At the sale, the property was sold to Fannie Mae, and its foreclosure deed was recorded shortly thereafter.', 'The defendants filed an answer to plaintiffs’ complaint, and subsequently, on December 3, 2010, filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.

We have clearly rejected this argument in Bucci and Mruk, where we held that MERS or its assigns, even without the original note holder, had the power to foreclose. See Mruk, 82 A.3d at 537-38; Bucci, 68 A.3d at 1085-89.

The defendant, Brian Verry (defendant), is before the Supreme Court on appeal from a judgment of conviction entered after a jury trial in the Superior Court. He was convicted of one count of felony assault, for which he received a twenty-year suspended sentence with twenty years of probation; one count of simple assault, for which he received a one-year sentence to be served concurrently with the other sentence imposed; and one count of first-degree child abuse, for which he received a sentence of twenty years, with fifteen years to serve and five years suspended with five years of probation. In support of his appeal, the defendant argues that the trial justice (1) abused his discretion in refusing to grant a continuance, and (2) erred and violated the defendant’s right to present a defense when the trial justice prohibited the defendant’s father from testifying in the defendant’s case-in-chief. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case arose from the assault and abuse of Beth, 1 an infant less than two months of age. Beth was born on January 11, 2006, a premature birth; her parents are defendant and Megan Verry (Megan). On March 8, 2006, after discovering a “monstrous growth coming out of [Beth’s] head[,]” defendant and Megan brought Beth to the Emergency Room (ER) at South County Hospital. At the ER, Beth was seen by a triage nurse and a physician, Dr. William Sabina (Dr. Sabina). Doctor Sabina examined Beth and interviewed defendant and Megan. After ordering a CT scan of Beth’s head and examining her a second time, Dr. Sabina diagnosed Beth with a subdural hematoma with cephalohematoma; she was transferred, by ambulance, to the Emergency Department at Hasbro Children’s Hospital (Hasbro). The Department of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF) was notified that the infant may have been abused. 2', 'At Hasbro, doctors performed a series of tests, which revealed that Beth suffered horrifying injuries, including a large skull fracture with both fresh and old bleeding in the brain. X-rays and an MRI also revealed small fractures near the ends of the infant’s bones, where the bones grow; both collarbones had been fractured and were healing; the child’s ribs were fractured in eighteen places; and her pelvis was cracked. In total, in her brief fifty-five days of life, the infant had sustained between thirty-six and forty bone fractures, including a skull fracture. Because of the number of fractures, Dr. Carol Jenny (Dr. Jenny), the director of the Child Protection Team at Hasbro, consulted a geneticist, Dr. Diane Abuelo (Dr. Abuelo), to recommend testing to determine whether Beth had an underlying bone disease, osteogenesis 1', 'In order to protect her privacy, the infant has been given a pseudonym. 2', 'Doctor Sabina testified that he contacted DCYF because nothing in Beth’s history explained the causation of her brain swelling and because the CT indicated that some of the blood in Beth’s brain could have been there days or weeks earlier.', '-2- imperfecta (OI or brittle bone disease). Hasbro subsequently sent a skin biopsy and blood sample to a laboratory in Seattle, Washington, for genetic testing. 3', 'Doctor Jenny and Dr. Kathleen McCarten (Dr. McCarten), a pediatric radiologist who also examined the child and performed tests, testified that they did not attribute the child’s injuries to an underlying bone disease. According to Dr. Jenny, because of the fact that Beth had not fractured any more bones since the March 8, 2006 incident, coupled with the fact that her bones had healed and developed “beautifully” since the initial trauma, it was Dr. Jenny’s opinion that Beth did not have OI.', 'Doctor Jenny concluded that Beth’s injuries were caused by “excessive” squeezing, “abusive rough handling[,]” and “abusive head trauma.” 4', 'Because child abuse was suspected in this case, DCYF placed a forty-eight-hour hold on Beth, and she was removed from her parents’ custody. The Narragansett Police Department began an investigation; Det. Timothy Lackie (Det. Lackie) went to defendant’s home in order to interview the parents. The defendant was not home when Det. Lackie arrived, and Megan was interviewed first. The next day, on March 10, 2006, Det. Lackie interviewed defendant at the police station, with his attorney present. The defendant told the police that Beth’s head may have hit the arm of a rocking chair while he was holding her on the night of March 8 and that he might have “held her too tight a couple of times.”', 'A DCYF child protective investigator, Katherine Bianchi (Bianchi), also interviewed defendant. Bianchi testified that defendant had stated that “on several occasions, in an effort to make [Beth] stop crying, he squeezed her.” The defendant also reported that he had previously 3', 'Although the genetic testing found a “sequence variant[,]” the results failed to conclude that the infant had OI or any bone disease. 4', 'Doctor Lauren Noel (Dr. Noel), Beth’s pediatrician, testified that, at the time of trial, the infant had not broken a single bone since being discharged from Hasbro in April 2006.', '-3- “hit her * * * on the changing table in an effort to make her stop crying.” The defendant further stated that, on the night Beth was hospitalized, “he had hit [Beth’s] head on the changing table in an effort to have her stop crying and also her head on the side of the rocking chair in an effort * * * to make her stop crying.”', 'The defendant was arrested and subsequently charged, by criminal information, with three felony crimes: two counts of felony assault, serious bodily injury due to Beth’s skull fracture and serious bodily injury due to Beth’s fractured ribs, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-5-2; and one count of first-degree child abuse, in violation of G.L. 1956 § 11-9-5.3. In April 2010, a jury trial commenced in Superior Court. On April 20, 2010, the trial justice granted a judgment motion of acquittal on count two, reducing the felony assault charge concerning the fractured ribs to the lesser-included offense of a simple assault. However, after the jury was unable to reach a verdict, a mistrial was declared.', 'A second jury trial commenced in January 2011. The defendant was convicted of all three counts. A judgment of conviction and commitment entered on February 18, 2011, and defendant timely filed a notice of appeal that same day.', 'Analysis', 'Denial of Motion for Continuance', 'The defendant claims that the trial justice erred by denying his motion for a continuance in order for the defense to investigate genetic-testing results that were provided to the defense during jury selection in the second trial.

However, the laboratory received the state’s supplemental testing request in December 2010. On January 5, 2011, day two of jury selection in defendant’s second trial, the state provided defense counsel with a report discussing results from the requested supplemental testing conducted in the Seattle, Washington laboratory. After receiving the report, defense counsel asked the trial justice for a continuance of at least one week, based on his contention that more time and information were needed in order to retain an expert to testify about the report and explain a sentence in the report that stated, “[g]iven these findings[,] in addition to the report of no signs of OI in your patient, the father, [defendant], we believe it is unlikely that this variant contributes to bone fragility.” Apparently, defense counsel had learned—recently—that when defendant was four months old, he broke his femur and that defendant’s family may have information of “other incidents of broken bones within the family[.]” Defense counsel requested a continuance to determine whether this new information, in conjunction with the recently received laboratory report, could explain Beth’s injuries.

After determining that defendant’s father’s testimony was “irrelevant, confusing, and [could] lead to [an] argument about brittle bone” disease which “both [parties agreed] * * * they w[ould] not argue[,]” the trial justice precluded the father’s testimony.

Brousseau et al. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Goldberg, for the Court.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court on October 30, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. The plaintiff, William J. Nye (plaintiff), appeals pro se from a Superior Court judgment dismissing the plaintiff’s quiet title claim and granting summary judgment in favor of the defendants—Susan J. Brousseau, individually and as trustee, Paul G. Brousseau, individually and as trustee (the Brousseaus), and The Brousseau Family Trust (collectively, defendants)—on the plaintiff’s claims for negligence and fraud. Additionally, the plaintiff appeals the dismissal of his claim to quiet title. Having considered the arguments advanced by the parties, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that the appeal may be decided at this time. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'Facts and Travel', 'This case is the parties’ third appearance before this Court in less than five years. The details of their affairs have twice been set forth by this Court in Nye v. Brousseau, 992 A.2d', '-1- 1002 (R.I. 2010) (Nye I) and Nye v. Brousseau, 47 A.3d 335 (R.I. 2012) (mem.) (Nye II). Accordingly, we shall endeavor to confine our recitation of the facts.', 'At the center of the dispute is a 325.59-square-foot parcel (judgment parcel) that was awarded to plaintiff and described in the amended final judgment that entered in Nye I, 992 A.2d at 1010. However, shortly before final judgment entered in Nye I, the Brousseaus transferred, by quitclaim deed, property located at 265 Tiffany Avenue in Warwick (the Brousseau Property) to The Brousseau Family Trust (the trust). The judgment parcel is located within the described Brousseau Property and abuts plaintiff’s property.', 'Five months after this Court’s order in Nye II—in which the denial of plaintiff’s motion to set aside the transfer of the Brousseau Property to the trust was affirmed—plaintiff filed a complaint in this case, alleging: (1) “Quiet Title”; (2) “Negligence”; and (3) “Fraud.” The plaintiff argued that the transfer of the Brousseau Property to the trust via quitclaim deed, before final judgment entered in Nye I, served to render the final judgment a nullity. He is mistaken.', 'In this case, defendants admitted that all right, title, and ownership in the judgment parcel belongs to plaintiff, and this judicial admission is binding. The defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts, and on July 10, 2013, a Superior Court justice issued a written decision denying summary judgment on count one—quiet title—but granting summary judgment in favor of defendants on counts two and three. As to the quiet-title count, the trial justice concluded that “an abstract of the title * * * or any similar report concerning the status of the title from a reputable source, as specified under [G.L. 1956] § 34-16-2[,]” was “[n]oticeably absent” from the court file; and, thus, a genuine issue of material fact may exist which precluded the entry of summary judgment.', 'The Superior Court justice then concluded that “[p]laintiff must first comply with the mandate of § 34-16-2 before this [c]ourt may adjudicate [p]laintiff’s quiet title', '-2- action on the merits.” On count two, he determined that the facts did not demonstrate that defendants owed a duty, that defendants breached a duty, or that any cognizable harm from such a breach existed. With respect to count three, alleging fraud, it was determined that no evidence existed which demonstrated that defendants made any false representations to plaintiff. Furthermore, the court determined that plaintiff’s claim of fraud on the court was not supported by competent evidence.', 'On August 16, 2013, an order entered that granted defendants’ motion to compel plaintiff to comply with § 34-16-2. 1 The order required plaintiff to submit the name of a title company or attorney to complete an abstract within thirty days for approval by the court, and then, after approval by the court, an additional thirty days for the title company or attorney to submit a title abstract to the court. The plaintiff failed to comply with this order.', 'On September 17, 2013, defendants filed a motion to dismiss count one based on plaintiff’s failure to comply with the August 16 order and plaintiff’s prior statement that he disavowed any claim based upon § 34-16-2. On October 28, 2013, the motion to dismiss was heard before a different justice of the Superior Court, and plaintiff continued to advance that count one was unrelated to any claim under § 34-16-2 of the General Laws. The Superior Court 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-16-2 provides:', '“Upon filing his or her complaint, the plaintiff shall thereafter, at his or', 'her own cost, select, with the approval of the court, a title company or an attorney', 'familiar with the examination of land titles, which company or attorney shall', 'proceed to examine the title to the real estate described in the complaint, and', 'when the examination is completed, shall deposit an abstract of title to the real', 'estate in the court, together with a report of the status of the title and a list of the', 'parties found interested therein, and who should, in the opinion of the company or', 'attorney, be made parties to the action. Upon receipt of the abstract and report, the', 'court shall order all persons not parties to the action but found by it to be', 'necessary to the cause to be made parties defendant and shall order notice to be', 'given to those defendants.”', '-3- justice determined that plaintiff was ordered to, and failed to, comply with § 34-16-2; and, thus, she dismissed count one and entered final judgment. The plaintiff timely appealed to this Court. 2', 'Analysis', 'Initially, we conclude that the Superior Court justice was correct in granting summary judgment for defendants on counts two and three. The plaintiff utterly failed to set forth any theory that evidenced that defendants owed him a duty to report the transfer of the property. Furthermore, no evidence was set forth by plaintiff demonstrating that defendants made false representations to him or that defendants perpetrated any fraud upon the court. In the absence of material factual disputes, combined with the determination that defendants are entitled to judgment as a matter of law, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. See Moore v. Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, 18 A.3d 541, 544 (R.I. 2011) (citing Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038, 1043 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Turning next to the heart of plaintiff’s rambling and confusing argument, we similarly conclude that the Superior Court justice was correct in dismissing count one. The plaintiff was required to retain a professional title examiner to prepare a title abstract pursuant to the August 16, 2013 order of the Superior Court. A necessary component to a claim to quiet title on property under § 34-16-2 is a record showing that title is held by someone other than the claimant. The plaintiff’s subjective belief that his claim was for some undefined relief and not an action to quiet title does not negate the fact that his complaint sought to quiet title to the judgment parcel. Accordingly, it was proper for the Superior Court justice to order him to obtain an abstract. By electing to disregard this order, plaintiff risked dismissal of the claim.

78,Rocco D’Alessio : v. : State of Rhode Island. :,non-criminal,affirm,"['Justice Flaherty, for the Court. The applicant, Rocco D’Alessio, appeals from the denial of his application for postconviction relief. This case first came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on December 5, 2012, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we concluded that cause in fact had been shown, and we assigned the case to the regular calendar for full briefing and argument. Thereafter, the matter was argued on September 30, 2014. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On May 29, 2007, Rocco D’Alessio filed an application for postconviction relief in Providence County Superior Court.', 'The applicant argued that newly discovered evidence required that his April 16, 2002, conviction for the second-degree murder of his infant daughter,', '-1- Gianna D’Alessio, be vacated. At a hearing conducted before a justice of the Superior Court, applicant presented the testimony of Dr. Richard T. Callery, who, while he was employed on a contract basis with Rhode Island’s Office of State Medical Examiners (OSME), had reviewed the file of Gianna D’Alessio.', 'Briefly, the facts leading to applicant’s conviction are as follows. 1 On the evening of January 13, 2000, applicant was caring for his infant daughter at the Providence home that he shared with Gianna’s mother, Jennifer Greenhalgh. The couple had resided there for little over a month. Ms. Greenhalgh left Gianna in applicant’s care while she returned to work, her first shift back at her job since Gianna’s birth. Before Ms. Greenhalgh left for work, the two had become involved in an argument about why applicant was late in arriving home, causing her to be late in leaving for work. Their argument continued when Ms. Greenhalgh informed applicant that she had hidden a stash of cocaine so that he would not be able to use the drug while he was babysitting Gianna. The applicant became upset and persisted, and Ms. Greenhalgh eventually revealed to him where the cocaine was located so that she could leave for work. Before she left the home, Ms. Greenhalgh made sure applicant had calmed down and, once he did so, she departed for work at about 4 p.m., leaving Gianna in his care.', 'Approximately an hour later, a Rescue Company of the Providence Fire Department, commanded by Lt. Alan Fortes, responded to the home of applicant’s neighbor because of a report that a child was having difficulty breathing. Lieutenant Fortes and other rescue personnel arrived to find applicant holding a sleeping Gianna. He told them that the child was having trouble breathing and was not acting right. The child was examined and appeared to be generally healthy, perhaps simply colicky, or constipated. Lieutenant Fortes asked applicant if he wished 1', 'A more extensive recitation of the facts of Gianna’s death and the subsequent trial is articulated in this Court’s opinion at State v. D’Alessio, 848 A.2d 1118, 1120-23 (R.I. 2004).', '-2- that Gianna be brought to the hospital, but deferred to applicant’s decision not to do so. 2 Lieutenant Fortes and his colleagues then departed the residence and left Gianna with applicant.', 'Lieutenant Fortes and his company received a second call for an unresponsive baby around 8 p.m., this time to applicant’s residence. The first responders arrived at the address and, alerted by a light, proceeded around to its source at the back of the house. The applicant emerged from the house holding Gianna out towards Lt. Fortes, who could immediately see that the child was not breathing.', 'Gianna was transported to Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence, where she was pronounced dead soon after arriving.', 'On May 19, 2000, applicant was indicted for first-degree murder. At trial in April, 2002, the state medical examiner, Dr. Elizabeth Laposata, testified that the case was one of Shaken Baby Syndrome. 3 Doctor Laposata testified that Gianna’s injuries resulted from “absolutely violent trauma” and not from any accidental means. She went on to say that death would have resulted “within a few minutes” from the infliction of the injuries. Doctor Laposata stated she had no doubt that the injuries were caused by a violent shaking of the infant. 4 Further, she testified that she had arrived at her conclusion from the very moment she witnessed the autopsy. Several months later, but before she testified, Dr. Laposata confirmed her opinion with Dr. Selina Cortez, a neuropathologist at Rhode Island Hospital. The evidence at trial revealed that the infant had been in applicant’s sole custody throughout the evening. On April 16, 2002, the 2', 'Lieutenant Fortes testified that he asked applicant if he wished his daughter to be transported to the hospital three times, which was Lt. Fortes’ standard practice when he did not believe that transport was required. 3', 'Doctor Laposata testified that Shaken Baby Syndrome is characterized by the types of injuries that result from “violent, forceful shaking of a baby.” These injuries include tears in blood vessels in the brain and nerve damage that ultimately cause death. 4', 'At a hearing on a motion for a new trial, the trial justice made a point to note that Dr. Laposata’s testimony was particularly credible.', '-3- jury returned a guilty verdict for second-degree murder; the trial justice sentenced applicant to a term of sixty years, forty years to serve, with the balance suspended, with probation.', 'On May 29, 2007, D’Alessio filed an application for postconviction relief in which he alleged that newly discovered evidence required that he be granted a new trial. To support his application, D’Alessio offered the testimony of Dr. Richard T. Callery, who was, at the time of his testimony, the chief medical examiner for the State of Delaware. In the past, Dr. Callery had done contract work for Rhode Island’s Office of State Medical Examiners. Several years after D’Alessio’s conviction, Dr. Callery was approached at a medical conference by Georgia Pasqualone, a forensic nurse who had been retained by applicant’s attorney. Ms. Pasqualone asked Dr. Callery if he would assist her by reviewing a file she had been given by applicant’s attorney. Doctor Callery immediately remembered Gianna D’Alessio’s file as one that he had worked on while in Rhode Island. Doctor Callery was put in touch with applicant’s attorney, who determined that Dr. Callery’s testimony would be relevant to the postconviction-relief application. 5 Eventually, Dr. Callery testified at an evidentiary hearing that was held on July 8, 2011, before the original trial justice. Doctor Callery was qualified as an expert witness in forensic sciences. At the hearing, the state did not contest whether Dr. Callery’s testimony was indeed newly discovered, but did argue that it was not material. The differences between the testimony of Dr. Laposata and Dr. Callery became the main issue in applicant’s postconviction- relief proceedings.', 'In his testimony, Dr. Callery related how he was tasked by Dr. Laposata with reviewing and finalizing incomplete reports for several autopsies that had been performed by Dr. Samuel A. Livingstone, a medical examiner who was no longer with the office. As part of this process, Dr. 5', 'D’Alessio was represented by several attorneys before his present attorney began to represent him on this appeal on January 16, 2013.', '-4- Callery had reviewed the file of Gianna D’Alessio in 2000, shortly after the infant’s death and well before D’Alessio’s trial. The practice of reviewing such files was routine for Dr. Callery, who had worked for OSME on a contract basis since 1988.', 'When he first reviewed the D’Alessio file, it contained preliminary findings and conclusions that had been made by Dr. Livingstone.', 'Doctor Callery testified that, at the time he first saw the D’Alessio file, the manner of death had been determined to be homicide and the matter had been considered a “Shaken Baby Syndrome type case.” It was Dr. Callery’s duty to go through the police report, hospital records, and autopsy notes and provide his opinion on whether the initial conclusion was correct. However, Dr. Callery testified that he could not “fix the case,” because of the poor quality of the notes and photographs that were in the file. Doctor Callery said that he told Dr. Laposata, “[he could not] sign off on this as a shaken baby, and [he could not] determine it’s a homicide.” Doctor Callery then gave the file back to Dr. Laposata and had no further contact with it.', 'Doctor Callery testified that he had come to “no conclusion whatsoever” with respect to the file and instead returned it to Dr. Laposata to correct and finalize. Doctor Callery repeated his lack of a conclusion later in his testimony, saying he could not determine any cause of the child’s death and he could not, at the time he reviewed the file, confirm the preliminary findings of Dr. Livingstone and Dr. Laposata. 6 Under cross-examination by the state, and a later lengthy questioning by the hearing justice, Dr. Callery said that he did not remember specifically what the file contained, but that it “should have included” materials like retinal slides and standard tissue samples of organs, including the brain. It is significant that, at the time Dr. Callery 6', 'Under direct examination from D’Alessio’s lawyer:', '“Q: And it’s your opinion at that time that there could not be determined a cause of death', 'as a homicide or that it was Shaken Baby Syndrome?', '“A: My testimony is I could not do it.”', '-5- reviewed the file, it did not contain the supplemental neuropathology report by Dr. Cortez, which had been referred to in Dr. Laposata’s trial testimony. Doctor Callery testified that it would have been possible to improve the file to such a degree that a conclusion could be made that the infant’s death was a homicide caused by the violent shaking of a baby, but that in the file’s then condition, “[he] didn’t feel comfortable doing it.” 7 In response to questioning by the hearing justice, Dr. Callery listed the possible manners of death that the medical examiner routinely cites: suicide, accident, undetermined, natural, and homicide. Doctor Callery finally said that in his estimation the manner of death was “[b]etween homicide and undetermined.”', 'On September 19, 2011, the hearing justice issued a ruling from the bench on D’Alessio’s application.', 'The hearing justice found the evidence provided by Dr. Callery to be newly discovered and assumed, arguendo, that the evidence could not have been discovered in the exercise of trial counsel’s due diligence. However, the hearing justice also found Dr. Callery’s testimony to be “valueless,” in that “such testimony would in no way have altered this jury’s verdict.” Further, the justice found that Dr. Callery’s testimony lacked substantial weight and credibility and that it appeared to him to have been motivated by personal animus towards Dr. Livingstone, the original medical examiner who prepared the infant D’Alessio’s file. 8 For those reasons, the hearing justice denied the application for postconviction relief. Judgment denying 7', 'Doctor Callery testified, “[i]f new material had been generated and different things happened afterwards that allowed somebody else to [form the opinion Gianna’s death was caused by homicide], so be it. I’m not here to criticize them.” 8', 'Additionally, and somewhat inopportunely, the hearing justice, sua sponte, raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel and proceeded to rule on it saying, “I could stop right there, but I shall not, because there is more to be said that supports the denial of the [application]. The [applicant] was represented by able, experienced counsel * * *. In sum, there is no place in this case for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.”', '-6- postconviction relief was formally entered on September 21, 2011. The applicant filed a timely appeal with this Court. 9', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-1, a person may file an application for postconviction relief if he or she contends that “the conviction violated [his or her] constitutional rights or that newly discovered facts require vacation of the conviction in the interest of justice.” Bleau v. Wall, 808 A.2d 637, 641 (R.I. 2002) (quoting Powers v. State, 734 A.2d 508, 513-14 (R.I. 1999)). A postconviction-relief proceeding is civil in nature, and the burden of proof lies with the applicant to show by a preponderance of the evidence that relief should be granted. Lyons v. State, 43 A.3d 62, 64-65 (R.I. 2012) (citing Brown v. State, 32 A.3d 901, 907 (R.I. 2011)). In applications for postconviction relief based on newly discovered evidence, we use the same standard of review as in a motion for new trial based on newly discovered evidence. Brennan v. Vose, 764 A.2d 168, 173 (R.I. 2001) (citing McMaugh v. State, 612 A.2d 725, 731 (R.I. 1992)). This standard is a two-pronged test; to satisfy the threshold prong the evidence must be (1) newly discovered and not available at the time of trial; (2) it must not have been discoverable by due diligence; (3) it must be material, not simply cumulative or impeaching; and (4) it must be of the type that would likely change the verdict at trial. Id. If the evidence meets the four-part threshold prong, it then must meet the second prong, which is an assessment of whether it is “credible enough to warrant relief.” Ferrell v. Wall, 889 A.2d 177, 184 (R.I. 2005) (quoting 9', 'During the pendency of his appeal, applicant made a motion for a limited remand to the Superior Court to litigate claims that the state violated applicant’s constitutional rights by failure to disclose evidence because, “[t]he appeal now before this Court concerns a claim of newly discovered evidence, and does not raise any constitutional claims.” On September 12, 2013, we denied that motion.', '-7- Fontaine v. State, 602 A.2d 521, 524 (R.I. 1992)). This Court will not overturn a trial justice’s findings regarding an application for postconviction relief absent clear error or a determination by this Court that the trial justice neglected or misconceived material evidence. Reise v. State, 913 A.2d 1052, 1055 (R.I. 2007) (citing State v. Thomas, 794 A.2d 990, 993 (R.I. 2002)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'On appeal, applicant advances three arguments. First, applicant contends the hearing justice clearly erred when he ruled that the newly discovered evidence was not material and would not change the verdict at trial. Second, he alleges the court further erred by raising and denying, sua sponte, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Third, applicant argues that his right to due process was violated when the state withheld evidence from the defense in violation of applicant’s constitutional rights as set forth in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). See also State v. Nickerson, 94 A.3d 1116, 1125 (R.I. 2014); DeCiantis v. State, 24 A.3d 557, 570 (R.I. 2011); State v. Chalk, 816 A.2d 413, 419 (R.I. 2002) (noting that this Court, “provides even greater protection to criminal defendants than the one articulated [by the United States Supreme Court]”). We conclude that the first argument is without merit and that the second and third arguments are not properly before this Court because they were not raised in the postconviction-relief proceedings below. We will address each argument in detail.', 'A. Newly Discovered Evidence', 'The applicant claims that the newly discovered evidence, namely Dr. Callery’s testimony, demands the vacating of his conviction for second-degree murder and the granting of a new trial.', '-8- Specifically, D’Alessio contends that, in the absence of Dr. Callery’s testimony at trial, he was deprived of the right to a fair trial and a verdict that is worthy of confidence.', 'At the hearing, there was no serious dispute that this evidence cleared the hurdle of being newly discovered. The hearing justice assumed that applicant had been diligent in his search for evidence before his 2002 trial. However, the hearing justice found that the evidence was not material and that it would “in no way have altered” the verdict. We conclude that the hearing justice’s determination was not clearly erroneous.', ""When he determines the weight of newly discovered evidence, a hearing justice must decide whether the evidence is material and not simply cumulative or impeaching. Brennan, 764 A.2d at 173. Cumulative evidence is that which tends to prove the same point as that of the other evidence offered. State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1032 (R.I. 2004). Impeaching evidence, on the other hand, is “information that is not related to [the] defendant's guilt or innocence and serves only to destroy the credibility of the [witness].” Bleau, 808 A.2d at 644. In short, material evidence is that which creates a “reasonable probability of a different result.” Id. at 643 (quoting Powers v. State, 734 A.2d 508, 514 (R.I. 1999)). The question is whether, without the proffered evidence, the defendant received a fair trial resulting in a “verdict worthy of confidence.” Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434 (1995). In order to undermine the confidence in the verdict, there must exist a nexus between the new evidence and the outcome of the trial. Bleau, 808 A.2d at 644."", 'In our opinion, Dr. Callery’s testimony was not material, as this Court has defined that term. 10 Taken as a whole, the testimony is not of the type that would undermine the confidence 10', 'While Dr. Callery’s testimony was not ultimately material, we question if it was, as the state argues, simply cumulative or impeaching. It is applicant’s argument that, had he testified at trial, Dr. Callery would have testified that he was not able to arrive at a conclusion on the file.', '-9- in the verdict. See Brennan, 764 A.2d at 173. Even if we were to characterize Dr. Callery’s testimony as probative on D’Alessio’s guilt or innocence and not simply as undermining Dr. Laposata’s credibility, it was nevertheless of such a vague and indefinite nature that it could not create a “reasonable probability of a different result.” Bleau, 808 A.2d at 643 (quoting Powers, 734 A.2d at 514). Indeed, when asked to state a conclusion, Dr. Callery would only say that it was “[b]etween homicide and undetermined.” Doctor Callery acknowledged that his testimony was based on his review of a file that was not yet complete, before the neuropathology reports were conducted, and that, “[i]f new material had been generated and different things happened afterwards that allowed somebody else to [form the opinion Gianna’s death was caused by homicide],” then he would not disagree with that conclusion. 11', ""In addition, the newly discovered evidence must be likely to change the verdict at a new trial. Brennan, 764 A.2d at 173. For the reasons stated above, the hearing justice found that the testimony of Dr. Callery, when considered alongside the state’s evidence, was not of a type that would likely change the verdict at a new trial. The trial justice found Dr. Laposata's testimony to be credible. In our review, we agree that Dr. Laposata was compelling and note that she had consulted with an outside neuropathologist before she testified."", 'In concluding that a trial Conversely, in her testimony, Dr. Laposata was sure of her opinion. These differing points are the key quality of noncumulative testimony. State v. Lynch, 854 A.2d 1022, 1032 (R.I. 2004). Nor is Dr. Callery’s testimony merely impeaching, because he testified that in his experience, “[t]he symptomatolgy [sic] and the infliction of trauma do not have to be simultaneous.” Given applicant’s sole custody of the infant prior to her death, the timing between the injury and death directly relates to applicant’s guilt or innocence. Doctor Callery’s testimony was therefore not merely impeaching because it contradicted Dr. Laposata factually; it did not simply undermine her credibility. Bleau v. Wall, 808 A.2d 637, 644 (R.I. 2002). 11', 'It is noteworthy that in an earlier affidavit, Dr. Callery swore that he had reviewed the neuropathology report. Cross-examination revealed, however, that that report had not been completed until after Dr. Callery had completed his review of the file. Therefore, he could not have reviewed it.', '- 10 - conducted with the testimony of Dr. Callery would not likely have resulted in a different outcome, the hearing justice was neither clearly erroneous nor did he misconceive the evidence.', 'When he ruled on the credibility of Dr. Callery’s testimony, the trial justice said he was, “well satisfied that Dr. Callery’s testimony lacks substantial weight and credibility.” However, because it is our opinion that the testimony failed to overcome the threshold prong of the newly discovered evidence analysis, we need not, and will not, address this issue. 12 Although this Court’s analysis is not identical to the hearing justice’s, we reach the same conclusion; we agree that the testimony of Dr. Callery did not warrant postconviction relief.', 'B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel', 'The applicant argues that the hearing justice incorrectly, and sua sponte, passed on the issue of ineffective assistance of applicant’s trial counsel even though the issue was not raised by either applicant or the state at the hearing. We agree; this Court has noted “[i]n short, ‘a party should not be granted relief that it did not request.’” Nye v. Brousseau, 992 A.2d 1002, 1011 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Providence Journal Co. v. Convention Center Authority, 824 A.2d 1246, 1248 (R.I. 2003)). When the hearing justice said, “[i]n sum, there is no place in this case for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel,” there was no such claim before him. Because neither party addressed the competency of applicant’s trial counsel, it is our opinion that the hearing justice should have refrained from addressing it. Consequently, we see no reason to review it. 13 12', 'At the hearing, the justice did go on to offer his thoughts on the evidence’s credibility, but since this Court agrees the evidence is not material, our analysis need not reach the correctness of the justice’s findings on Dr. Callery’s credibility. See Fontaine v. State, 602 A.2d 521, 524 (R.I. 1992) (once the threshold prong “is satisfied, the trial justice must then determine whether the evidence presented is credible enough to warrant relief”); see also McMaugh v. State, 612 A.2d 725, 732-33 (R.I. 1992) (reviewing the trial justice’s credibility finding only because the threshold prong was satisfied). 13', 'We note such a claim would need to meet a high bar in the event a subsequent post-conviction relief application is filed. See G.L. 1956 § 10-9.1-8 (stating that claims not raised in the first', '- 11 -', 'C. Brady Compliance', 'The applicant also argues that information regarding Dr. Callery’s work on the D’Alessio autopsy file constituted exculpatory evidence that was not presented to the defense, a violation of the due-process guarantees of the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions. It is well settled that it is a violation of a criminal defendant’s right to due process when the prosecution suppresses favorable evidence material to the defendant’s guilt or innocence. Brady, 373 U.S. at 87; see also Chalk, 816 A.2d at 417-18 (acknowledging Brady’s application and its implication of both the United States and Rhode Island Constitutions). The obligations under Brady have been expanded to impose a duty on the prosecutor to learn of any favorable evidence “known to the others acting on the government’s behalf,” whether or not requested by the defense. Kyles, 514 U.S. at 437; Chalk, 816 A.2d at 418.', 'However, the time-honored “raise-or-waive” rule that this Court employs imposes upon litigants a duty to raise all their claims for relief in the trial court and properly articulate them to a judge for a ruling. State v. Bido, 941 A.2d 822, 828 (R.I. 2008). There is a narrow exception to this rule, but “the alleged error must be more than harmless, and the exception must implicate an issue of constitutional dimension derived from a novel rule of law that could not reasonably have been known to counsel at the time of trial.” State v. Bouffard, 945 A.2d 305, 312 (R.I. 2008) (quoting State v. Breen, 767 A.2d 50, 57 (R.I. 2001)). The bedrock principles of criminal discovery espoused in Brady and its progeny are hardly new; they have been crafted, considered, and limned by our nation’s courts for fifty years. instance “may not be the basis for a subsequent application, unless the court finds that in the interest of justice the applicant should be permitted to assert such a ground”).', '- 12 -', 'The applicant points to vague and scattered references in the hearing transcript that he urges constitute a Brady claim. We do not agree. 14 The applicant did not articulate a Brady claim in any cogent manner in his application or at the postconviction-relief hearing, and the hearing justice did not rule on any such claim. “[A] motion upon which a trial justice has not ruled presents no question for review by this Court.” Bido, 941 A.2d at 829 (quoting State v. Abreu, 899 A.2d 473, 476 (R.I. 2006)). Lastly, the applicant’s argument on appeal invokes no novel rule of law that would have been unknown in the year 2000 to the trial counsel, or in 2007 to the applicant’s attorneys on postconviction relief.', 'Accordingly, the issue of a possible violation of due process was not properly raised below, fails to meet the stricture of our narrow exception, and we consider it to have been waived. 14', 'Notably applicant did not litigate the Brady issue during the three-day hearing on postconviction relief. On appeal, he points to nebulous statements in the record, including factual allegations that Dr. Laposata “deprived the [d]efendant of the exculpatory evidence,” when she did not inform the state of Dr. Callery. Not only does this not touch on the prosecution’s conduct, which Brady addresses, but applicant did not present it clearly as a Brady claim. The other references cited in applicant’s briefs are similarly unconvincing. Brady was not raised in such a manner that the hearing justice should have known that he was required to rule on it. Indeed, this Court previously addressed the Brady issue when it denied applicant’s motion for a remand because, as applicant stated, “[t]he appeal now before this Court concerns a claim of newly discovered evidence, and does not directly raise any constitutional claims.” While we decline to analyze the Brady claim in detail, we note that the merits appear lacking. The applicant’s attorney conceded that the Attorney General did not possess the information that Dr. Callery had worked on the file, saying at the hearing, “no one knew Dr. Callery existed; not even the Attorney General’s Office.” Moreover, this Court has never held that information in the possession of the Office of State Medical Examiners is within the scope of the prosecutor’s duty to disclose.', '- 13 -', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed and the record may be remanded thereto.', '- 14 -', 'RHODE ISLAND SUPREME COURT CLERK’S OFFICE', 'Clerk’s Office Order/Opinion Cover Sheet TITLE OF CASE:', 'Rocco D’Alessio v.

On February 2, 2004, DeMarco’s attorney wrote Travelers, before filing suit, seeking payment of the policy limits to DeMarco. Later, on February 25, 2004, DeMarco’s attorney again wrote Travelers asking to settle for the policy limits and also informed Travelers of potential Asermely6 liability if it did not settle the claim. By letter dated February 27, 2004, Travelers responded and informed DeMarco that other claims existed as a result of the accident and that, therefore, Travelers could not exhaust its entire policy limits on DeMarco. Additionally, Travelers’ counsel informed the claim services director for Travelers (1) that Asermely liability would not apply in the circumstances of this case because there were multiple claimants and (2) that exhausting the policy limits on one claimant might violate Travelers’ fiduciary obligations to its insureds. Over the course of the next year, on April 19, June 7, and June 29, 2005, DeMarco’s attorney wrote to Travelers’ counsel seeking to engage in settlement negotiations. Further, on July 22, 2005, DeMarco’s attorney wrote to Travelers’ counsel yet again, offering to settle for the policy limits. There was no response from Travelers or its counsel to any of these communications, and Travelers’ efforts, if any, to resolve this case, with or without the participation of its insureds, remains an open question. 5', 'Wayne DeMarco et al. v.

(National Grid).9 Travelers’ offer to have the three parties divide the policy limits amongst themselves was not accepted; and, on August 15, 2006, Travelers commenced an interpleader action in the Superior Court where it sought—unsuccessfully—to deposit the policy limits into the registry of the court.10 On August 23, 2006, DeMarco’s attorney—for the final time—offered to settle for the policy limits. Travelers responded to DeMarco’s final demand and rejected the offer to settle. On September 14, 2006, after the parties engaged in unsuccessful mediation, Travelers offered to pay DeMarco $550,000 and Woscyna $450,000, “in exchange for a complete release from both claimants” in favor of Virginia Transportation and Doire. The offer was contingent on acceptance by both DeMarco and Woscyna. Although Woscyna was prepared to accept the offer, DeMarco rejected the offer by letter dated September 15, 2006.', 'The underlying tort action proceeded to trial on September 18, 2006. On September 22, 2006, a jury returned a verdict in favor of DeMarco in the amount of $2,053,795. With statutory interest, the total amount of the judgment was $2,801,939.07.

DeMarco agreed to release both Virginia Transportation and Doire but conditioned that release upon an assignment of any claims Virginia Transportation and Doire might have against Travelers. The release specifically excepted Travelers “from any and all claims that Releasors may have against Travelers in any way arising from the Litigation or any aspect thereof.” Virginia Transportation and Doire assigned “any and all claims and causes of action that [Virginia Transportation and Doire] may have” against Travelers to DeMarco. This assignment was made “in consideration of the General Release executed contemporaneously herewith[.]” Later, on January 3, 2007, the trial justice who presided over the underlying tort action entered an order that provided: “After hearing thereon and in consideration thereof judgment entered in favor of the plaintiffs on September 22, 2006, plus taxed costs in the amount of $5,879.32. Said judgment is satisfied in full.”', 'On November 22, 2006, DeMarco commenced this action in Superior Court against Travelers, its counsel, and counsel’s law firm. The first two counts of the six-count complaint sought: (1) a declaratory judgment in accordance with Asermely v. Allstate Insurance Co., 728 11', 'In this letter, Travelers’ independently retained counsel acknowledged that the insureds’ ability to contribute “to a settlement * * * will likely be extinguished if * * * DeMarco’s judgment forces them into bankruptcy.”', '-5- A.2d 461 (R.I. 1999), requiring Travelers to pay the entire judgment from the underlying tort action; (2) a declaratory judgment pursuant to § 27-7-2.2 declaring Travelers liable for prejudgment interest on the judgment in the underlying tort action. On September 23, 2008, a justice of the Superior Court granted summary judgment for plaintiff on counts one and two and denied defendant’s cross-motion for summary judgment on counts one, two, three, and four.12 Although the issues concerning the release were argued on summary judgment—and rejected by this Court on appeal—the effect (if any) of the judgment satisfied order had not been raised before the Superior Court. Final judgment on counts one and two, pursuant to Rule 54(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, subsequently was entered.13 The defendant timely appealed; and, on July 12, 2011, this Court issued its opinion in DeMarco I, in which we vacated the judgment in count one and remanded that count for trial, and affirmed the judgment in count two.14', 'With respect to count one, this Court held that, because the circumstances of this case involved multiple claimants, it was a question of fact as to the reasonableness of Travelers’ conduct with respect to the duty it owed its insureds under Asermely. See DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 614. We remanded count one to the Superior Court for a trial. Id. at 615. We affirmed count two. Id. at 629.

DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 617. Moreover, we determined that the general release granted to Virginia Transportation and Doire did not foreclose DeMarco’s ability to maintain the assigned claims against Travelers. Id. at 625-26. As we stated:', '“[I]t is our view that Travelers should not now be able to avoid', 'having to deal with Mr. DeMarco’s suit for excess damages by', 'claiming that it obtained a release for its insureds—and that', 'therefore the insureds had no claims to assign to Mr. DeMarco—', 'when the only reason the insureds were released from liability was', 'that they assigned to Mr. DeMarco the very rights that he is now', 'seeking to assert against Travelers.” Id. at 626. Finally, we concluded that the Judgment Satisfied Order was not properly before the Court because Travelers had not raised the issue in Superior Court and that the raise-or-waive rule controlled. Id. at 629.', 'On remand, plaintiff sought a calculation of prejudgment interest. The Superior Court justice granted plaintiff’s motion and determined that DeMarco I vacated final judgment on count one, but that the final judgment entered on count two remained undisturbed. Moreover, with respect to the judgment satisfied order, the Superior Court justice determined that Travelers had waived this argument with respect to count two and stated “to the extent it remains alive and impacts claims and counts other than [c]ount 2, [it] has not been properly presented in the context of today’s motion.” After analyzing three different approaches to assessing interest, the Superior Court justice ordered that interest be paid in the amount of $1,595,850.03. That calculation has not been challenged on appeal.', 'By order dated June 11, 2012, Travelers was to make payment to DeMarco by June 22, 2012.

The Court denied that petition on March 21, 2013.', '-7- pursuant to Rule 54(b) and was affirmed in DeMarco I. Additionally, we are of the opinion that the payment order contains sufficient elements of finality so as to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court. See McAuslan v.

The issue of subject-matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time, cannot be waived or conferred by either party, and can be raised sua sponte by the court. Rogers v.

Before this Court, Travelers seeks to amalgamate subject-matter jurisdiction with mootness. Travelers contends that DeMarco’s § 27-7-2.2 claim for interest was rendered moot because, after the judgment satisfied order entered, there was no longer a justiciable controversy and, based on mootness, the Superior Court was divested of subject-matter jurisdiction. Because issues regarding subject- matter jurisdiction can never be waived and can be raised at any time, Travelers argues to this Court that the Superior Court justice erred in deciding that Travelers had waived its mootness argument. We reject this contention.', '-8-', 'The judgment satisfied order was entered before our opinion in DeMarco I. In that case, we concluded that issues with respect to that order were not properly before the Court because they were not raised in Superior Court and therefore were deemed waived. DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 629. Travelers now seeks to engage in a collateral attack on the judgment in count two— which this Court affirmed—by raising the judgment satisfied order. To the extent that Travelers invites us to revisit our holding in DeMarco I and entertain issues that previously were waived, we decline to do so.', 'We note that if, as Travelers argues, the judgment satisfied order rendered the controversy moot and stripped the Superior Court or this Court of subject-matter jurisdiction, then the same would have been true at the time of DeMarco I. These issues, however, were never raised in DeMarco I. Despite this unique posture, we briefly address Travelers’ assertions of subject-matter jurisdiction and mootness.', '“A challenge to subject-matter jurisdiction ‘may not be waived by any party and may be raised at any time in the proceedings.’” Boyer v. Bedrosian, 57 A.3d 259, 270 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Pine v. Clark, 636 A.2d 1319, 1321 (R.I. 1994)). When considering claims for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, we are “refer[ring] only to the court’s power to hear and decide a case and not to whether a court having the power to adjudicate should exercise that power.” Narragansett Electric Co. v. Saccoccio, 43 A.3d 40, 44 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Mesolella v. City of Providence, 508 A.2d 661, 666 (R.I. 1986)). Pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 8-2-14(a), the Superior Court “shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of all other actions at law in which the amount in controversy shall exceed the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) * * *.” (Emphasis added.) It cannot be disputed that DeMarco’s § 27-7-2.2 claim met the threshold requirement of § 8-2- 14(a). Furthermore, G.L. 1956 § 9-30-1 provides that the Superior Court has the power to', '-9- entertain declaratory-judgment actions. Thus, the Superior Court was vested with jurisdiction over DeMarco’s § 27-7-2.2 claim for interest.', 'Mootness is a distinct concept, separate and apart from subject-matter jurisdiction. See Boyer, 57 A.3d at 271 (stating that a case may become moot “despite the court’s retention of subject-matter jurisdiction” (citing Matos v. Clinton School District, 367 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2004))). Concededly, some courts have treated mootness claims as implicating issues of subject- matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., In re Jorden R., 979 A.2d 469, 479 (Conn. 2009) (“Mootness is a question of justiciability that must be determined as a threshold matter because it implicates [a] court’s subject[-]matter jurisdiction[.]” (quoting In re Melody L., 962 A.2d 81, 106 (Conn. 2009))). In our view, however, while mootness ranks high on the justiciability spectrum, and may not be lightly overlooked, mootness does not equate with subject-matter jurisdiction. See Town Houses at Bonnet Shores Condominium Association v. Langlois, 45 A.3d 577, 582 (R.I. 2012) (deciding appeal of a moot case that fell within mootness exception); see also Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 330 (1988) (Rehnquist, J., concurring) (“If our mootness doctrine were forced upon us by the case or controversy requirement of [U.S. Const.] Art. III itself, we would have no more power to decide lawsuits which are ‘moot’ but which also raise questions which are capable of repetition but evading review than we would to decide cases which are ‘moot’ but raise no such questions.”).', 'It is well established that “a case is moot if the original complaint raised a justiciable controversy, but events occurring after the filing have deprived the litigant[s] of a continuing stake in the controversy.” Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069, 1079 (R.I. 2013) (quoting Boyer, 57 A.3d at 272).

(quoting City of Cranston v. Rhode Island Laborers’ District Council, Local 1033, 960 A.2d 529, 533 (R.I. 2008)). A narrow exception to the mootness doctrine exists whereby a case that is moot may still be decided if it involves issues “of extreme public importance, which are capable of repetition but which evade review.” Boyer, 57 A.3d at 281 (quoting Campbell v. Tiverton Zoning Board, 15 A.3d 1015, 1022 (R.I. 2011)). This could not occur, of course, if mootness divested the Court of subject-matter jurisdiction.', 'Having previously determined in DeMarco I that the release executed in favor of Virginia Transportation and Doire did not affect the claims assigned to DeMarco, DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 626, Travelers now recycles the same arguments in the context of the judgment satisfied order, fashioned as mootness.16 Specifically, Travelers attempts to evade liability based on the fact that their insureds, to whom they owed a fiduciary duty to protect from excess liability, see Asermely, 728 A.2d at 464; Medical Malpractice Joint Underwriting Association of Rhode Island v. Rhode Island Insurers’ Insolvency Fund, 703 A.2d 1097, 1102 (R.I. 1997), secured the protection of the judgment satisfied order in the face of an otherwise imminent bankruptcy by 16', 'The justice succinctly summarized the argument when she stated:', '“As I understand Travelers’ argument * * * an insurer would not be required to', 'pay if its insured for some reason is excused or absolved from payment. That', 'would be the case regardless of whether the payment sought from the insurer is', 'based upon a direct claim or upon an assigned claim and regardless of whether it', 'is for an excess judgment, a breach of contract claim, a bad faith claim, or for', 'statutory interest under the Rejected Settlement Offer statute. This also would be', 'the case regardless of whether the insured’s escape from payment is the result of', 'an assignment and release, a ‘judgment satisfied’ order, an agreement to', 'permanently forbear from enforcing an execution, a discharge in bankruptcy, or', 'some other means. The insurer would be entitled to the benefit of the insured’s', 'escape from liability or payment. * * * Thus, as I understand the argument,', 'distilled, the ‘Judgment Satisfied’ order must be viewed in isolation, has', 'independent legal significance, and trumps all.” The trial justice appropriately rejected this argument.', '- 11 - assigning to DeMarco their claims against Travelers. We declared in DeMarco I, “an assignment of rights in a case such as this is ‘a valuable means by which the insured may obtain protection from his insurance and by which the third party may obtain compensation * * *.’” DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 626 (quoting Stephen S. Ashley, Bad Faith Actions, Liability and Damages, § 7:18 at 7- 68 (1997)). Additionally, we previously have upheld an insured’s assignment of claims against its insurer and refused to:', '“obstruct an appropriate device for the payment of a claim by an', 'insurance carrier that has an obligation to its insured to absolve', 'him of liability without depriving itself of the right to pursue action', 'against another insurance carrier that it considers to be wholly or', 'partly liable for the loss.” Etheridge v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance', 'Co., 480 A.2d 1341, 1345 (R.I. 1984) (emphasis added). The judgment satisfied order that was entered in accordance with the assignment of rights does not alter the above quoted analysis.', 'The argument propounded by Travelers, that the judgment satisfied order rendered DeMarco’s § 27-7-2.2 claim moot, amounts to the same form-over-substance analysis that we rejected unequivocally in DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 624 (citing Etheridge, 480 A.2d at 1345). The settlement between DeMarco, Virginia Transportation, and Doire provided that only after “the exchange of the [a]ssignment and the release” would the judgment be deemed satisfied, not that the claims would be extinguished. Thus, the judgment satisfied order merely memorialized the parties’ intentions as set forth in the settlement agreement.17 This is confirmed by a review of the hearing transcript, where the original trial justice who directed the entry of the order stated: 17', 'In fact, at the hearing preceding the entry of the judgment satisfied order, counsel for DeMarco explicitly stated that “we’ve continuously taken the position that our settlement agreement was with Virginia and Leo Doire and had nothing to do with Traveler’s [sic]. * * * So I don’t want the record to reflect that we consent to any explanation down the road that we consented or agreed to any settlement with Traveler’s [sic].” In the face of this clear statement, in open court,', '- 12 -', '“clearly my concern * * * was that I wasn’t looking immediately to', 'inflict any undue harm on the defendant’s business to see if there', 'was some way to find a resolution through that which has been', 'found.

In DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 626, we declared,', '“it is our view that Travelers should not now be able to avoid', 'having to deal with Mr. DeMarco’s suit for excess damages by', 'claiming that it obtained a release for its insureds—and that', 'therefore the insureds had no claims to assign to Mr. DeMarco—', 'when the only reason the insureds were released from liability was', 'that they assigned to Mr. DeMarco the very rights that he is now', 'seeking to assert against Travelers.”', 'See Pinto v. Allstate Insurance Co., 221 F.3d 394, 404 (2nd Cir. 2000) (“It defies common sense to believe that [the injured plaintiff] contemplated receiving as consideration for her release of [the insured] a right of [the insured’s] that no longer existed.”).', 'Rather, it is precisely because DeMarco received an assignment of rights from Travelers’ insureds that there exists a justiciable controversy. See Etheridge, 480 A.2d at 1346 (concluding that a justiciable controversy existed following an assignment of rights). DeMarco was assigned all claims that Travelers’ insureds had against Travelers. We held that DeMarco’s § 27-7-2.2 claim “encompass[ed] the case at bar and [is] to be applied on remand[.]” DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 617. DeMarco’s § 27-7-2.2 claim was not extinguished merely because the judgment satisfied order also entered. See Black v. Goodwin, Loomis & Britton, Inc., 681 A.2d 293, 300 (Conn. 1996) (“An insurer may not hide behind the language of the policy after the insurer abandons its insured and the insured settles the claim by agreement.” (quoting Red Giant Oil Co. v. Lawlor, 528 N.W.2d 524, 532 (Iowa 1995))). Moreover, judgment was affirmed by this Court on Travelers’ counsel remained silent; yet he raises the argument in this Court. Our decision in DeMarco I speaks loudly.', '- 13 - DeMarco’s § 27-7-2.2 claim. DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 629. Yet, the prejudgment interest award remains unpaid, demonstrating DeMarco’s continuing stake in the controversy.

The fact that the judgment satisfied order memorialized the clear intent of the parties does not render the claims moot.', 'Finally, the justice of the Superior Court was correct in her conclusion that this Court affirmed the entry of summary judgment on count two in DeMarco I.18 In DeMarco I, after explicating the reasonableness test that needed to be applied to the Asermely claim which we vacated and remanded, we declared that § 27-7-2.2 was “neither complex nor ambiguous” and required that both prejudgment and postjudgment interest be assessed.19 DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 617. The Court concluded, “we vacate the grant of partial summary judgment as to Travelers’ liability pursuant to the principles set forth in Asermely, but we affirm the ruling with respect to 18', 'Indeed, as this seasoned trial justice noted on remand: “[t]he Supreme Court didn’t, as Travelers says in its papers, reverse me on [c]ount 2. If it did, this is the first time in twenty-two years that I’ve not been able to recognize that I’ve been reversed.” 19', 'We note that the dissent seeks to condition any recovery on count two upon a determination on count one. Amalgamating the claims, the dissent is implicitly creating a reasonableness standard for § 27-7-2.2 claims, which standard is not found in the statute. This reasoning ignores our venerable rules of statutory construction. “When interpreting a statute, our ultimate goal is to give effect to the General Assembly’s intent. * * * The best evidence of such intent can be found in the plain language used in the statute. Thus, a clear and unambigious statute will be literally construed.” Martone v. Johnston School Committee, 824 A.2d 426, 431 (R.I. 2003) (citing Stebbins v. Wells, 818 A.2d 711, 715 (R.I. 2003)). In DeMarco I, we recognized our previous holdings that § 27-7-2.2 was “neither complex nor ambiguous.” DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 617 (quoting Skaling v. Aetna Insurance Co., 742 A.2d 282, 291 (R.I. 1999)). Thus, the Court must give the words of the statute their plain and ordinary meaning. It is clear from a review of the statute that there is no language which would suggest that § 27-7-2.2 liability is subject to a reasonableness standard, akin to an analysis under Asermely. Accordingly, such an analysis has no place in analyzing DeMarco’s § 27-7-2.2 claim.', '- 14 - the applicability of the rejected settlement offer statute.” Id. at 629 (emphasis added). Thus, the Superior Court justice did not err in concluding that count two had been affirmed or in ruling that the payment order was consistent with our holding in DeMarco I. A determination that the § 27 7-2.2 claim for interest was extinguished because the summary judgment decision provided that “Travelers * * * is liable for the judgment entered in [the underlying tort action], interest included, to the extent that judgment remains unsatisfied” would be favoring the form-over- substance argument that we repudiated in DeMarco I and reject herein.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated in this opinion, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed. The papers may be returned to the Superior Court.', 'Justice Flaherty, with whom Justice Indeglia joins, dissenting in part and concurring in part. I agree, in part, with the holdings of the majority, that Travelers waived its arguments with respect to the judgment satisfied order and that the Superior Court had subject- matter jurisdiction over the dispute throughout the litigation. I concur with the majority that Travelers failed to raise the judgment satisfied order as a possible defense and that the trial justice rightly concluded that the argument had been waived. I also accept the reasoning of the majority that the Superior Court never was deprived of jurisdiction to resolve this case. However, because it is my opinion that the imposition of excess interest under the provisions of G.L. 1956 § 27-7-2.2 is at best premature, I must respectfully dissent from the majority’s holding in this case.', 'In Asermely v.

In essence, the Court held in Asermely that when a plaintiff offers to settle a claim for an amount that is within the policy limits, and the carrier declines to settle, the insurer is at risk if a later judgment exceeds the policy limit, including applicable interest. Id. The Court went on to say that an insurer’s good-faith calculation about the value of a particular claim provides no safe harbor, and that the insurer, because of its fiduciary duty to its insured, must assume the risk of a judgment that exceeds the limits of the contract of insurance. Id. It is clear, however, that when it issued Asermely, this Court considered only claims that involved one plaintiff and one defendant.', 'In DeMarco v. Travelers Insurance Co., 26 A.3d 585, 609 (R.I. 2011) (DeMarco I), the Court was faced with a different and vastly more complicated situation that involved more than one serious claim against an insured who clearly lacked sufficient coverage to satisfy both, or perhaps either, claim without leaving the insured exposed, or even uninsured, against the other serious claim. Altering the contours of its Asermely holding to address this issue, the Court, with respect to count 1, vacated summary judgment in favor of plaintiff and remanded the matter for a factual determination on whether the insurer had acted reasonably and in its insured’s best interest in handling the multiple claims. Id. at 615 (“In view of the fact that we have today explicated the parameters of the Asermely rule as it is to be applied in multiple claimant cases where the combined claims exceed the policy limits, it is necessary for us to vacate the grant of summary judgment for plaintiff with respect to count [1] of his complaint and remand for further findings of fact so that it can be determined whether or not Travelers met its duty to its insureds.”) However, the Court affirmed summary judgment in plaintiff’s favor with respect to', '- 16 - count 2, involving § 27-7-2.2, the so called “rejected-settlement offer” statute.1 DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 617.', 'An essential element of the Court’s decision in DeMarco I was that, irrespective of whether Travelers might be found liable on the merits of the Asermely claim, count 1, after remand, the summary judgment on the rejected-settlement offer statute, count 2, was affirmed. DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 616-17. On remand from this Court, and following this Court’s mandate in DeMarco I, the trial justice granted a motion to calculate interest on count 2 and ascertained the excess interest due to DeMarco from Travelers, a determination from which Travelers timely appealed.', 'In its affirming of that judgment, there can be no doubt that this Court has literally applied a statute which it concluded was clear and unambiguous in its language. DeMarco I, 26 A.3d at 617. The language of that statute is indeed unequivocal and unmistakable. Further, there is no debate that there was a demand to settle on behalf of DeMarco at the policy limit, a refusal to extend an offer to meet that demand, and an eventual judgment that surpassed the available policy limits. Id. at 587-95.', 'However, it is perfectly clear to me that, similar to this Court’s holding in Asermely, the statute anticipates a situation in which there is but one plaintiff and not, as here, multiple serious claims, any one of which might well exhaust the available coverage under the relevant policy of 1', 'I dissented from the holding in DeMarco v. Travelers Insurance Co., 26 A.3d 585 (R.I. 2011) because it was my opinion that a general release that had been executed by the plaintiff in the named insureds’ favor extinguished all rights of the parties in the case, and that, after defendants were absolved of all liability, with Traveler’s money, there was nothing left to assign. Id. at 629- 34. Because it was based on the release, the rationale for the dissent was overarching, and I therefore saw no reason for further discussion with respect to count 2.', '- 17 - insurance.2 Under the facts presented here, somewhat complicated by the Court’s holding in DeMarco I, it is entirely possible that, after trial on remand of count 1, Travelers may be found to have acted reasonably in protecting the interests of its insured in the face of multiple serious claims yet nevertheless be responsible for enormous sums of interest on judgments involving those very claims.', 'For that reason, it is my opinion that the literal application of the rejected-settlement offer statute at this time, before it is determined whether Travelers has any liability whatsoever under count 1, could very well lead to an absurd result. It is axiomatic that this Court will not construe a statute, even if it is clear and unambiguous, in a way that may lead to absurdity. See Swain v. Estate of Tyre ex rel. Reilly, 57 A.3d 283, 289 (R.I. 2012); DaPonte v. Ocean State Job Lot, Inc., 21 A.3d 248, 251 (R.I. 2011); Skaling v.

Of course, following that path would have left the insureds entirely unprotected against the also very substantial Woscyna claim. Further, it would have resulted in, if not necessitated, Travelers placing its own financial interests over the fiduciary duty that it owes to its insureds, something that this Court has said in the strongest terms an insurance carrier may not do.

If, on the other hand, a factfinder concludes that Travelers, in keeping with this Court’s holding in DeMarco I, did not act reasonably in light of its fiduciary duties to its insureds, it would be liable for the entire judgment under the principles set forth in Asermely and for all the interest on that judgment pursuant to § 27-7-2.2.', 'For these reasons, I respectfully dissent from the majority’s opinion in this case. 3', 'I do not agree with the majority’s characterization of the dissent as creating a reasonableness standard for § 27-7-2.2.

The relevant portion of § 12-19-2(a) provides: “if the punishment to be imposed is imprisonment, the sentence or sentences imposed shall be reduced by the number of days spent in confinement while awaiting trial and while awaiting sentencing.”', 'Thus, defendant asserts, his sentences in the instant robbery case should have been reduced by the roughly three years and three months that he spent incarcerated while awaiting trial and sentencing. Alternatively, defendant argues that he is entitled to credit for the time served between January 30, 2006—the date of his robbery charges and his presentation as a probation violator—and April 12, 2006, the date upon which he was adjudicated a probation violator and began serving his previously suspended twelve years for the drug-related charges.', 'The state, for its part, argues that defendant is not entitled to credit for the period of time between April 12, 2006 and April 24, 2009, because he was serving the execution of a previously suspended sentence rather than merely being confined while awaiting trial or sentencing. As for the period of time between January 30, 2006 and April 12, 2006, the state has submitted that, “[u]pon information and belief derived from an official at the Adult Correctional Institutions,” defendant was credited with “77 days of awaiting sentence/trial time” with respect to the execution of his previously suspended sentences. The state argues, therefore, that defendant is not entitled to credit to his robbery sentences because this period of time has already been credited to his drug-related sentences.', '-4-', 'As this Court has previously explained, the Legislature’s “enactment of the so-called dead-time provisions of § 12-19-2 was a benevolent effort to assist the person who, because of an inability to make bail, [has] been cast into a sort of limbo as he awaited the disposition of the charge or complaint which had caused his incarceration.” State v. Ilacqua, 765 A.2d 822, 824 (R.I. 2001) (quoting State v. Skirvin, 113 R.I. 443, 446, 322 A.2d 297, 299-300 (1974)). We have deemed such an individual “in limbo because the time spent awaiting trial or sentence [can] not be credited towards any future parole.” Id. (quoting Skirvin, 113 R.I. at 446 n.1, 322 A.2d at 300 n.1).', '“The credit provided for in § 12-19-2(a) thereby ensures that ‘all persons sentenced to identical terms w[ill], apart from differentials arising out of allowances for “good time” and/or parole, be deprived of their liberty for identical periods of time.’” Rose, 92 A.3d at 912 (quoting State v. Holmes, 108 R.I. 579, 584, 277 A.2d 914, 917 (1971)). Accordingly, “the phrase ‘while awaiting trial and while awaiting sentencing’ must be construed as embracing confinement time spent for any reason whatsoever in connection with an offense for which a defendant is subsequently sentenced.” Ilacqua, 765 A.2d at 824 (quoting Holmes, 108 R.I. at 582, 277 A.2d at 916).', 'Here, it is clear that defendant was not “in limbo” from April 12, 2006 to April 24, 2009; rather, he was serving the execution of the previously suspended sentences for the drug-related charges. See Skirvin, 113 R.I. at 446 n.1, 322 A.2d at 300 n.1. On April 12, 2006, when defendant was adjudicated a probation violator, his status changed from “an awaiting trial or sentencing status to that of one serving a * * * prison sentence.” Skirvin, 113 R.I. at 447, 322 A.2d at 300. The fact that he also happened to be awaiting trial and sentencing for the robbery charges from April 12, 2006 until April 24, 2009 did not change the nature of his incarceration', '-5- with regard to the drug-related charges; thus, he is not entitled to credit in his robbery sentences for this period of time.', 'The period of time from January 30, 2006 to April 12, 2006, however, does not lend itself to the same analysis. During this portion of time, defendant was being held without bail on the pending robbery charges and had been presented as a probation violator, but he had not yet been adjudicated a violator and had not yet begun serving his previously suspended sentences for the drug-related charges. Even if defendant has been credited with this time in his sentences for the drug-related charges, as the state contends, the mandatory dead-time provision of § 12-19-2(a) must still be applied to his sentences for the robbery charges, because all of defendant’s sentences were set to run concurrently.', 'The rationale for the dead-time provision in § 12-19-2(a) is one of fairness and consistency; if two individuals are given equal sentences, one should not spend more time incarcerated simply because he or she is not able to make bail or because of the protracted nature of his or her pretrial and presentencing proceedings. See Rose, 92 A.3d at 912; Ilacqua, 765 A.2d at 824; Santos v. Howard, 108 R.I. 666, 670, 278 A.2d 839, 841 (1971). It follows that, if an individual receives multiple sentences to be served consecutively, he or she should not receive a credit in every one of his or her sentences for any presentencing time served, because this would result in his or her spending less net time incarcerated than if he or she had not been held prior to sentencing. See Ilacqua, 765 A.2d at 823-24.', 'In the case of concurrent sentences, however, like the case at bar, this rationale does not obtain. On April 12, 2006, defendant began serving four concurrent twelve-year sentences for the drug-related charges; and, on April 24, 2009, he began serving two additional ten-year sentences for the robbery charges, to run concurrently with each other and with the sentences for', '-6- the drug-related charges. If only the twelve-year sentences were to be credited with the time during which he was incarcerated prior to April 12, 2006, then defendant would still find himself, after finishing all of his sentences, having been incarcerated longer than if he had not been held prior to April 12, 2006. Thus, in order to maintain the concurrent nature of the sentences, defendant was entitled to a credit for those days in his concurrent sentences for both the drug-related charges and the robbery charges. See Skirvin, 113 R.I. at 448, 322 A.2d at 301.', 'Additionally, the state contends that the defendant should not receive credit for the time between January 30, 2006 and April 12, 2006 in his sentences for the robbery charges, because those sentences were specifically set to begin on April 24, 2009.', 'To the extent that the sentencing justice may have intended the sentences to begin on April 24, 2009, without any credit for the time already served, he was in error. In consideration of the purpose behind the dead-time provision of § 12-19-2(a), we have previously held that a sentencing judge should impose a just sentence “without regard to whether the person sentenced has or has not been confined while awaiting disposition.” Holmes, 108 R.I. at 584, 277 A.2d at 917. Once the sentence is established, “it is for the warden into whose custody the sentenced person is given * * * to apply the provisions of § 12-19-2.” Holmes, 108 R.I. at 584-85, 277 A.2d at 917. Accordingly, then, it was the sentencing justice’s duty to impose a sentence for the robbery charges, which he did, and then the warden should have calculated and applied the credit for the days between January 30, 2006 and April 12, 2006, during which the defendant had already been incarcerated. 8 8', 'The defendant also perplexingly argues that the trial justice erred by entertaining his motion for credit for time served, because awarding credit for time served is an administrative rather than a judicial function. Because the state has not challenged the procedure utilized by defendant, we decline to address the issue of whether this procedure was proper. See State v.

Miguel, appeals pro se from a Superior Court order denying his motion to reduce what he contends was an illegal sentence imposed upon him pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure in January of 1992. In the underlying criminal case, the defendant pled guilty to second-degree murder and received a life sentence. On appeal, he argues: (1) that his life sentence is illegal because he should have been sentenced for voluntary manslaughter, which carries a maximum sentence of thirty years; and (2) that the continued imposition of the life sentence is violative of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 8 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', 'This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After a careful review of the record and after consideration of the parties’ written and oral submissions, we are satisfied that cause has not been shown and that this appeal may be decided', '-1- at this time. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the Superior Court’s denial of defendant’s motion to reduce his sentence.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The factual background as to what is now defendant’s third appeal to this Court has been fully narrated in our two previous opinions relative to this case––viz., Miguel v. State, 774 A.2d 19 (R.I. 2001) (Miguel I) and Miguel v. State, 924 A.2d 3 (R.I. 2007) (mem.) (Miguel II). Accordingly, we shall recount here only the facts necessary to our analysis of this most recent appeal.', 'In September of 1990, Catherine Miguel was stabbed to death; and defendant, her husband, eventually pled guilty to the crime of second-degree murder. Miguel I, 774 A.2d at 20. At the plea hearing, the trial justice engaged in a colloquy with defendant to ensure that defendant knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his rights. Id. at 21 (“[I]t is apparent to us from the record from the proceedings below that the trial justice fully advised Miguel of his constitutional rights and of the direct consequences of his plea.”).', 'The trial justice then sentenced defendant to life imprisonment at the Adult Correctional Institutions.', 'Following his plea and sentencing, defendant filed two applications for postconviction relief, both culminating in appeals to this Court, neither of which was availing. See Miguel II, 924 A.2d at 5; Miguel I, 774 A.2d at 22. Presently before us is defendant’s third attempt to challenge his plea and sentence; that challenge began on June 6, 2009, when he filed a “Motion to Reduce or Correct a Sentence” pursuant to Rule 35. In that motion, defendant argued that his life sentence was illegal because his level of intoxication at the time of the stabbing called for a manslaughter conviction and commensurate thirty-year maximum sentence, rather than the', '-2- sentence of imprisonment for life that is authorized by statute with respect to murder in the second degree. See G. L. 1956 § 11-23-2 (“Every person guilty of murder in the second degree shall be imprisoned for not less than ten (10) years and may be imprisoned for life.”).', 'After considering the arguments presented at the Rule 35 hearing, the trial justice held that defendant’s sentence was lawful under Rhode Island law and had been lawfully imposed upon defendant following his guilty plea. The defendant timely appealed from the denial of his motion.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'This Court has long held that our review of a hearing justice’s decision on a motion to reduce a sentence pursuant to Rule 35 is extremely limited.

Due to the fact that rulings on Rule 35 motions are confided to the sound discretion of the hearing justice and because we have “a strong policy against interfering with a trial justice’s discretion in sentencing matters,” it is well established that “we only will interfere with that discretion in rare instances when the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.” Ruffner, 5 A.3d at 867 (internal quotation marks omitted). With this standard of review in mind, we turn to the substance of defendant’s appeal.', 'III', 'Analysis', 'On appeal, defendant contends that the hearing justice abused his discretion in denying the Rule 35 motion and that the continued imposition of defendant’s purportedly illegal sentence', '-3- constitutes a violation of both the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article 1, section 8 of the Rhode Island Constitution.', 'A', 'Defendant’s Rule 35 Motion', 'Rule 35 authorizes the court to correct an illegal sentence at any time.', 'We have previously made favorable reference to the Reporter’s Notes to Rule 35, which define an illegal sentence as “one which has been imposed after a valid conviction but is not authorized under law.” See State v. Linde, 965 A.2d 415, 416 (R.I. 2009). As examples of such a sentence, the Notes to Rule 35 make reference to “a sentence in excess of that provided by statute, imposition of an unauthorized form of punishment, a judgment that does not conform to the oral sentence.” See id.; see also State v. Murray, 44 A.3d 139, 141 (R.I. 2012).', 'Here, defendant contends that he would not have pled guilty to second-degree murder had he known about the diminished capacity defense and that he ought to have received a sentence commensurate with voluntary manslaughter, rather than second-degree murder. As a result, defendant argues, his life sentence is illegal because it exceeds the thirty-year maximum sentence for voluntary manslaughter. See § 11-23-3(a).1 We are not persuaded by defendant’s arguments.', 'First, defendant’s contention that he is entitled to the maximum thirty-year sentence associated with manslaughter is incorrect. See Miguel II, 924 A.2d at 5.

See Murray, 44 A.3d at 141. He is statutorily authorized only to challenge the sentence itself, and life imprisonment is within the purview of Rhode Island’s statute prescribing the penalties for murder. See § 11-23-2.

82,State : v. : Kathleen McKinnon-Conneally. :,criminal,affirm,"['Chief Justice Suttell, for the Court. The defendant, Kathleen McKinnon-Conneally, 1 appeals from a Superior Court judgment finding her to be in violation of the terms of her probation and sentencing her to serve the eight and one-half years remaining on her previously suspended sentence.', 'On appeal, the defendant argues that the hearing justice imposed an excessive sentence for her probation violation. This case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided.', 'After considering the parties’ written and oral submissions and reviewing the record, we conclude that cause has not been shown and that this case may be decided without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'On March 23, 2010, defendant pled nolo contendere to one count of second-degree robbery. She was sentenced to ten years at the Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI) with 1', 'Throughout the record of this case, defendant’s last name is listed intermittently as “McKinnon Conneally” and “McKinnon-Conneally.” It is unclear which format is correct.', '-1- eighteen months to serve, which term to serve was stayed pending her completion of mental health and substance abuse counseling, and eight and one-half years suspended, with probation. Although it is not entirely clear from the record, the stay on the eighteen-month term to serve was apparently removed on February 1, 2011, and defendant was incarcerated at the ACI until her release on November 30, 2011. On December 19, 2011, defendant was arrested by the West Warwick Police Department on charges of first-degree robbery and conspiracy to commit first- degree robbery, based on an incident reported on December 1, 2011. On December 22, 2011, the state filed a violation notice against defendant pursuant to Rule 32(f) of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure for allegedly violating the terms of her probation. The Superior Court conducted a combined probation-violation and bail hearing on February 9, 2012.', 'At the hearing, complaining witness Carol Riddle testified that she went into a West Warwick package store on the night of December 1, 2011, to buy a beverage and withdraw cash from an ATM. 2 According to Riddle, defendant initiated a conversation with her and then invited her to listen to karaoke music playing in a bar next door. Riddle testified that, after drinking a couple of shots of liquor and some beer, she was ready to go home, but defendant suggested that they go someplace else to get something to eat and to “hang out.” Once the two women were outside the bar, defendant’s friend Andrew Jordan (“A.J.”) appeared and the three began walking on a main road. Riddle recalled that defendant suggested cutting through an alley so that they could reach their next destination more quickly. Once they were in the alley, A.J. knocked Riddle to the ground with a blow to her head and then punched her in the face before demanding that she give him the personal identification number for her ATM card. Riddle recalled that defendant was also demanding the personal identification number as she dumped 2', 'Riddle testified that she had some short-term memory problems due to a brain surgery she underwent prior to the December 1, 2011 incident.', '-2- the contents of Riddle’s purse onto the ground. Riddle convinced defendant and A.J. that she had to call her sister to get the personal identification number. Riddle testified that defendant and A.J. “let her up” and that they started “picking up stuff” that “had poured out of [Riddle’s] purse.” The items that Riddle picked up included her “ID card” and “[defendant’s] ID card.” Riddle testified that she put both ID cards in her bra. The three went to a bar, where Riddle told the bartender to call the police. One of the responding officers, Patrolwoman Trenna Hemond, testified that, when she met with Riddle at the bar, Riddle was emotionally upset. After speaking with Officer Hemond, Riddle was taken to Kent Hospital, where she realized that she was missing $70, a carton of cigarettes, and some prescription medication from her purse. A nurse at the hospital asked Riddle what was in her bra, and Riddle removed both ID cards. 3 Officer Hemond met with Riddle the next day at the West Warwick police station, where Riddle signed a statement of her account of the events from the previous evening.', 'The hearing justice found that defendant had violated the conditions of her probation by failing to keep the peace and maintain good behavior, and he set bail at $100,000 with surety on the new charges of first-degree robbery and conspiracy to commit first-degree robbery. The Superior Court held a sentencing hearing on February 29, 2012.', 'Susan Rivera, a social caseworker with the Department of Children, Youth & Families (DCYF), testified that defendant’s then one-year-old son was in foster care because defendant had been incarcerated at the ACI and placement with a family member was not an option. Rivera testified that she had observed defendant interacting with her son during supervised visits at the ACI.', 'While defendant had substance abuse and mental health issues to work through, Rivera was not concerned about defendant’s parenting skills and was hoping to reunify defendant with her son 3', 'The defendant’s ID card was admitted as an exhibit at the combined probation-violation and bail hearing.', '-3- when she was discharged from the ACI. Rivera also testified that she warned defendant that if she was arrested again during the first year of her release from the ACI, then DCYF could move to terminate her parental rights. Rivera stated that if defendant was sentenced to more than eight months on her probation-violation conviction, then DCYF would move to terminate her parental rights to her son.', 'Andrea Reis, a social worker with Project Connect at DCYF, testified that she had many opportunities to observe defendant interacting with her son during supervised visits at the ACI and that she had no parenting concerns based on these observations. Reis also testified that defendant “had a diagnosis of DDHD [sic], psychosis, [Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder] and anxiety and depression disorder.” The defendant testified that she had not engaged in the acts of which she was accused, but that she knew she had not kept the peace because she had solicited illegal drugs. She further testified that she had been cooperative during the entire probation- violation process and that she did not want to lose her son.', 'The hearing justice commented that he found defendant’s actions on the night of December 1, 2011, to be predatory given that Riddle’s apparent “ability to respond [and] react to things [had been] compromised” by her previous “brain operation.” He also commented that defendant had been released from the ACI less than forty-eight hours prior to the incident leading to the violation hearing. The hearing justice imposed the previously suspended eight and one-half years from defendant’s ten-year sentence for her conviction of second-degree robbery in 2010.', 'The defendant timely appealed from the judgment of conviction declaring her to be a probation violator, arguing that the hearing justice’s decision was arbitrary and capricious and that the imposition of the entire eight and one-half-year suspended sentence was an abuse of', '-4- discretion. After defendant submitted her prebriefing statement, however, she entered a plea of nolo contendere to the charges of first-degree robbery and conspiracy. 4 Based on this plea, the state moved to dismiss defendant’s appeal as moot. We granted the state’s motion with respect to the issue of whether defendant was properly declared a violator, but denied the motion with respect to whether the sentence ordered for the probation violation was excessive. Therefore, the only issue on appeal is whether the hearing justice abused his discretion when he ordered that defendant’s suspended sentence be executed in its entirety. 5', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'A trial justice has wide discretion to determine whether to execute any or all of a defendant’s previously suspended sentence. State v. Roberts, 59 A.3d 693, 697 (R.I. 2013); State v. Lancellotta, 35 A.3d 863, 869 (R.I. 2012). Therefore, our review of a probation-violation sentence is for an abuse of discretion only. Roberts, 59 A.3d at 697. 4', 'After defendant pled nolo contendere to first-degree robbery, she was sentenced to twenty years at the Adult Correctional Institutions, with eight and one-half years to serve, and eleven and one- half years suspended, with probation. This sentence was to run concurrently with the eight and one-half years that defendant was ordered to serve for her probation violation. On defendant’s nolo contendere plea to the count for conspiracy, she was sentenced to ten years suspended, with probation. 5', 'The state contends that this issue is not properly before this Court because defendant did not first challenge her sentence in the Superior Court by filing a motion to correct or reduce her sentence pursuant to Rule 35 of the Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure. We have previously stated, however, that the revocation of probation results in the execution of a previously imposed sentence and not in the imposition of a new sentence. State v. Brown, 821 A.2d 695, 696 n.2 (R.I. 2003). Therefore, defendant’s appeal from the execution of the previously suspended eight and one-half years is properly before us for review.', '-5-', 'III', 'Discussion', 'The defendant argues that the sentence ordered is excessive because the hearing justice ignored the sentencing benchmark for the 2010 conviction for second-degree robbery, defendant’s mental health diagnoses, and defendant’s substance abuse problems.', 'It is well settled that “the unexecuted portion of a probationer’s suspended sentence hangs over his or her head by the single horsehair of good behavior, until such time as the term of probation expires.” State v. Parson, 844 A.2d 178, 180 (R.I. 2004). When a defendant is found to have violated the terms and conditions of his or her probation, “[G.L. 1956] § 12-19-9 grants violation-hearing justices wide latitude in deciding whether a probation violator’s suspended sentence should be removed in whole, in part, or not at all.” 6 State v. Tucker, 747 A.2d 451, 454 (R.I. 2000). When a hearing justice is deciding how much of a previously suspended sentence to execute, his or her primary focus should be on the nature of the first offense. State v. Pires, 525 A.2d 1313, 1314 (R.I. 1987). The circumstances of the second offense, however, may also be taken into account. Id.', 'Here, the hearing justice advised the defendant that he was not sentencing her for the conduct that formed the basis for the probation violation. As he correctly noted, the only 6', 'General Laws 1956 § 12-19-9 provides in pertinent part:', '“Upon a determination that the defendant has violated the terms', 'and conditions of his or her probation the court, in open court and', 'in the presence of the defendant, may remove the suspension and', 'order the defendant committed on the sentence previously', 'imposed, or on a lesser sentence, or impose a sentence if one has', 'not been previously imposed, or may continue the suspension of a', 'sentence previously imposed, as to the court may seem just and', 'proper.”', '-6- concern relative to the new charges was that she had failed to keep the peace. The hearing justice also acknowledged that the sole issue to be resolved at the sentencing hearing was the “portion, if any, of the [suspended] sentence [the defendant] should be required to serve.” The hearing justice explicitly referred to the circumstances of the offense underlying the sentence imposed for the 2010 conviction for second-degree robbery and the indication in the police report that the defendant had engaged in physical violence during that incident as well. It appeared to the hearing justice that the defendant had preyed on Riddle’s apparent vulnerability. The hearing justice repeatedly commented that the defendant had been released from the ACI less than forty-eight hours before engaging in conduct that violated the terms of her probation and that this conduct was similar in nature to that for which she was originally sentenced. The hearing justice further noted that the defendant had been fortunate to have been ordered to serve only eighteen months of the original ten-year sentence. After carefully considering the record in this case in light of the hearing justice’s broad discretion to determine the extent to which a suspended sentence will be executed, or not, we are satisfied that the hearing justice did not abuse his discretion in executing the remaining eight and one-half years of the defendant’s previously suspended sentence. See Parson, 844 A.2d at 180; Tucker, 747 A.2d at 454.', 'IV', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.

The plaintiffs, Simcha Berman and Sarah Berman, 1 appeal from (1) a judgment entered after a jury verdict in favor of the defendant, the State of Rhode Island, in the plaintiffs’ civil action seeking damages and (2) the trial court’s denial of motions for judgment as a matter of law, a new trial, and to vacate judgment. The defendant cross-appeals the denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'This is the second time this case comes before us; however, on this occasion, the matter arises in an entirely new posture. While we assume the reader’s familiarity with our prior opinion, Berman v. Sitrin, 991 A.2d 1038 (R.I. 2010) (Berman I), by way of background we trace succinctly the winding path of this long and tragic tale. 1', 'Sarah Berman has since become divorced from Simcha, and her name is now Chaya Sarah Aryeh.', '-1-', 'On August 17, 2000, Simcha Berman fell while descending on a beaten path that abuts the paved portion of the Cliff Walk. 2 As a result of this fall, Simcha sustained a severe spinal cord injury that has rendered him a quadriplegic.', 'In 2003, an action was commenced by Simcha and his then-wife, Sarah, in the Newport County Superior Court. Originally, the Preservation Society of Newport County (society), the City of Newport (city or Newport), the Cliff Walk Commission (commission), and the State of Rhode Island (state) were all named as defendants. The plaintiffs alleged that Simcha’s injuries were caused by defendants’ negligent failure to properly inspect, maintain, and repair the location where Simcha fell and that defendants knew of defects in the location and failed to guard or warn against such defects.', 'In 2005, all defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were immunized from liability under Rhode Island’s Recreational Use Statute (RUS), G.L. 1956 chapter 6 of title 32. A first hearing justice denied each of the motions for summary judgment. However, a second hearing justice later granted summary judgment in favor of both the society and the city in light of the RUS. The plaintiffs timely appealed to this Court. Meanwhile, the state, which had not been granted summary judgment, was left on the sidelines during the pendency of the appeal to this Court. The state requested that the Superior Court reconsider its decision. The state argued that it had been placed in a “legal Catch 22” whereby it was still somehow potentially exposed to liability for possibly having a sufficient degree of control over the location where the injury occurred, yet, nonetheless, was unable to avail itself of owner immunity under the RUS. See § 32-6-3. The Superior Court ratified its earlier decision and denied the state’s motion to vacate or otherwise reverse the previous ruling. 2', 'The Cliff Walk is a major Newport tourist attraction which runs approximately 18,000 feet along Newport’s shoreline, high above the rocky Atlantic coast.', '-2-', 'Accordingly, on this case’s previous sojourn before us, we addressed only whether it was appropriate for the city and the society to have been granted summary judgment. Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1041. In that appeal, we affirmed the entry of summary judgment for the society, 3 but we vacated the grant of summary judgment for the city and remanded the case to the Superior Court for trial against the remaining defendants. Id. at 1053.', 'Prior to the commencement of the jury trial on April 5, 2011, the trial justice sifted through a variety of pretrial motions. The plaintiffs moved for a change of venue or change of venire, arguing that such was necessary to prevent local prejudice from inhibiting plaintiffs’ opportunity to obtain a fair trial. The motion was denied by the trial justice. Additionally, the trial justice denied plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability, holding that there were still factual issues to be resolved regarding breach and causation.', 'The day after the jury was empaneled, the jury, along with the trial justice and counsel, took a view of the Cliff Walk at the location where Simcha sustained injury. After conducting the view, the trial justice inquired on the record if any matter should be addressed. The plaintiffs now contend that they took issue with certain aspects relating to the jury view, though no such objection appears in the record. Following opening statements, plaintiffs settled with the city and the commission, leaving the state as the sole remaining defendant.', 'The trial justice instructed the jury, without any objection, that it not speculate as to the reason the city and the commission were no longer parties.', 'The trial continued on for a week.

The trial justice expressed concerns that the letter potentially constituted hearsay and that its value as notice to the state of the circumstances that gave rise to Simcha’s accident was lacking.', 'He noted that there was insufficient supplementary evidence to establish that the incident discussed in the letter was sufficiently similar in time, location, condition, or circumstances to that of Simcha’s fall. Further, he pointed out that the letter was addressed to the then-City Manager of Newport as opposed to the state. Accordingly, the trial justice declined to allow the document to be entered into evidence as a full exhibit.', 'Prior to the end of its case-in-chief, the state sought to introduce evidence, pursuant to Rule 411 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence, that the city had insurance coverage on the Cliff Walk. Earlier in the trial, plaintiffs had introduced into evidence as a full exhibit a document discussing a meeting that took place between city, state, and federal officials regarding damage to the Cliff Walk as a result of a hurricane. That document mentioned that the city had liability insurance and that the attorney for the liability insurer attended the meeting and was active in the discussion. The plaintiffs conceded that the city had liability insurance covering the Cliff Walk at the time of Simcha’s fall. In light of this concession and the trial justice’s finding that plaintiffs had opened the door by introducing into evidence the document indicating that the city had liability insurance, the trial justice informed the jury that the city had insurance covering the Cliff Walk at the time of Simcha’s fall. He then instructed the jury that such information was offered simply for the purpose of demonstrating the city’s ownership or control of the Cliff Walk.', '-4-', 'At the appropriate times, both parties moved for judgment as a matter of law, but the judge reserved decision.', 'Counsel gave closing arguments, and afterwards the trial justice proceeded to charge the jury. Included in his charge, was an explanation that the state owed a duty to plaintiff to exercise reasonable care in connection with the state’s actions regarding the Cliff Walk. The trial justice inquired if counsel had any objections to his charge. The only exception raised by plaintiffs was to an illustration about burdens of proof, which the trial justice promptly clarified. No other exceptions were raised.', 'On April 13, 2011, the jury returned a verdict for defendant finding that the state was not negligent, and the Superior Court entered judgment accordingly. 4 On May 19, 2011, the trial justice denied both parties’ renewed cross-motions for judgment as a matter of law and plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial, thereby allowing the jury verdict to stand. Both sides filed timely notices of appeal. Subsequently, plaintiffs filed a motion to vacate the judgment and order a new trial based on newly-discovered evidence and other grounds pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, which the trial justice denied after a hearing on February 17, 2012.', 'The plaintiffs filed another timely notice of appeal and we then consolidated the three appeals before this Court.

We shall address these arguments seriatim.', 'A', 'Change of Venue or Venire', 'The plaintiffs argue that their motion for a change of venue or venire should have been granted, alleging that there was substantial pretrial publicity and news commentary critical of plaintiffs’ case and the potential ramifications for the Cliff Walk, which would decrease plaintiffs’ chance of obtaining a fair and impartial jury. The plaintiffs’ assertion of potential bias focused exclusively on residents of the City of Newport and did not assert that jurors who might be drawn from other towns in Newport County would be biased. The trial justice found that, in the absence of any testimony or other evidence that possible jurors in the county had formed an opinion adverse to plaintiffs’ case, the sparse newspaper articles cited by plaintiffs did not', '-9- amount to the “clear and convincing evidence” required to justify a change of venue or venire. Burns, 79 R.I. at 132, 84 A.2d at 802. Nothing about that determination can be said to be an abuse of discretion. Furthermore, no objection was raised regarding the ability of the jury to hear the case after the jury had been sworn. See G.L. 1956 § 9-10-17 (“If a party knows of any objection to a juror before the case is opened to the jury and omits to suggest it to the court, he or she shall not afterwards make the objection, unless by express leave of the court.”).', 'B', 'Jury View', 'On appeal, plaintiffs take issue with the manner in which the jury view was conducted and the potential confusion that could have arisen because of changed circumstances from the time of Simcha’s fall. However, the record does not reflect that any objection was made regarding the procedure used for the view or about anything that took place while it was conducted. Nonetheless, plaintiffs insist that an objection was lodged at some point.', 'Recently, we recognized that a party taking issue with a matter pertaining to a jury view may not be foreclosed by the raise-or-waive rule when the party was unable to realize that a “significant evidentiary event occurred during the view.” Yi Gu v. Rhode Island Public Transit Authority, 38 A.3d 1093, 1100 (R.I. 2012). However, we emphasize that “the better practice is for counsel to articulate specific objections on the record to ensure that such issues are properly preserved for appellate review.” State v. Ibrahim, 862 A.2d 787, 795 (R.I. 2004). Counsel should be vigilant in scanning for potential error that might occur during a view. Nonetheless, the circumstances of Yi Gu are not present here. The plaintiffs were cognizant that the area to be viewed may have appeared somewhat different from the time of Simcha’s fall, but they still', '- 10 - failed to timely lodge an objection on the record. Further, nothing indicates that the view was treated as evidence by the jury.', 'Even if plaintiffs’ objection to the jury view was not waived, the argument must still fail. The decision to grant “a view is addressed to the discretion of the court.” DiMaio, 102 R.I. at 120, 228 A.2d at 863. The trial justice believed that the taking of a view of the Cliff Walk would allow the jury to better understand the evidence in light of repeated references to the Cliff Walk that would occur during trial. Prior to taking the view, the trial justice properly informed the jury that the view was not evidence, but only an aid to the jury’s understanding of the evidence. We cannot say that the trial justice’s decision, especially in conjunction with his cautionary instruction, was an abuse of discretion.', 'C', 'Application of Berman I', 'The major thrust of plaintiffs’ appeal rests on the argument that the trial justice erred in his application of Berman I and that his determinations went against the law of the case.', 'At the outset we note that “[t]he law of the case doctrine * * * is a flexible rule that may be disregarded when a subsequent ruling can be based on an expanded record.” Lynch v. Spirit Rent-A-Car, Inc., 965 A.2d 417, 424 (R.I. 2009) (quoting Chavers v. Fleet Bank (RI), N.A., 844 A.2d 666, 677 (R.I. 2004)). Our decision in Berman I came at the summary judgment stage as opposed to the fully developed factual record we have before us after a trial on the merits. See Nationwide Property & Casualty Insurance Co. v. D.F. Pepper Construction, Inc., 59 A.3d 106, 110 n.3 (R.I. 2013) (“The denial of a motion for summary judgment merely determines that a fact issue is involved, and does not even establish the law of the case.” (quoting Rhode Island Public Telecommunications Authority v. Russell, 914 A.2d 984, 991 (R.I. 2007)).', '- 11 -', 'Further, we cannot stress enough that whatever is to be gleaned from Berman I, on both the case at bar and beyond, is necessarily constrained by the posture in which we rendered our decision: review of the grant of summary judgment. “[I]n ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the trial justice must look for factual issues, not determine them. * * * [T]he justice’s only function is to determine whether there are any issues involving material facts.” Steinberg v. State, 427 A.2d 338, 340 (R.I. 1981). Our review employed the same standard as the trial justice. Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1043.', 'Thus, in Berman I, we were forced to “consider[ ] the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party [plaintiffs], without weighing the evidence or evaluating the credibility of witnesses, and draw[ ] from the record all reasonable inferences that support[ed] the position of the [plaintiffs].” Gianquitti, 973 A.2d at 590 (quoting Calise v. Curtin, 900 A.2d 1164, 1168 (R.I. 2006)). We expressly acknowledged that “[t]his Court is not the finder of fact.” Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1053. However, as a matter of law, based on the record then before us, we expressed that “[i]n our opinion, the city had an affirmative duty to take reasonable steps to warn and shield unsuspecting visitors * * * in some reasonable manner.”', 'Id. at 1051. Conversely, based on that same limited record, we found that there was “no duty owed by the Society.” Id. at 1048. Still, we recognized that “the question of whether the city is liable in tort is a task that is committed to the fact-finder,” and that it remained to be resolved. Id. at 1053. Moreover, we remarked that it was a completely open question as to whether the state, which was not a party to the appeal before us, had any responsibility for the maintenance of the Cliff Walk. Id. at 1046 n.9. It was, as we sometimes say, an issue for another day.', 'The plaintiffs’ contentions overlook the manner in which the trial justice allowed the case to be tried. Although the state was not a party to our decision in Berman I, the trial justice still', '- 12 - refused to afford the state immunity under either the public duty doctrine or the RUS. Those determinations parallel our holdings in Berman I regarding the defenses available to the city. See Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1044 n.7 (“[W]e are of the opinion that the public duty doctrine and its exceptions are not relevant to the case at bar.”); see id. at 1053 (“[T]he immunity provided by the RUS is not available to [the] City * * *.”). Indeed, at the outset of the proceedings, the trial justice explained to the venire that plaintiffs’ theory of the case was that “the State of Rhode Island * * * assumed authority * * * and * * * exercised control over the Cliff Walk.” Further, during his final charge, he instructed the jury that the state owed plaintiff a duty of reasonable care and allowed the case to proceed to the jury on a straightforward negligence claim, uninhibited by any immunity defenses, notwithstanding the absence of any expert testimony presented by plaintiffs to support their claims regarding duty or breach. Accordingly, as much as possible, the trial justice followed both the “letter and spirit” of the salient holdings of our decision in Berman I. Sansone v. Morton Machine Works, Inc., 957 A.2d 386, 398 (R.I. 2008) (quoting RICO Corp. v. Town of Exeter, 836 A.2d 212, 218 (R.I. 2003)).', 'Nonetheless, plaintiffs assign error to the introduction of testimony 5 suggesting that the city and state believed they did not have authority to take certain actions with respect to the Cliff Walk. 6 In the trial below, the state, as the sole remaining defendant, unquestionably had the right to defend itself against plaintiffs’ claims. The plaintiffs, however, take issue with the 5', 'The plaintiffs also assign error to the failure to provide the jury with specific instructions regarding the duty (or lack thereof) of the society with respect to the Cliff Walk. This argument is addressed Part III E, infra. 6', 'The plaintiffs contend that res judicata or collateral estoppel should have precluded testimony of this nature. This contention fails under either doctrine because the state was not a party to Berman I and did not litigate any of the issues that may have been decided therein. See Reynolds v. First NLC Financial Services, LLC, 81 A.3d 1111, 1115, 1118 (R.I. 2014) (noting that the first requirement for res judicata is identity of parties and that a prerequisite for application of collateral estoppel is previous litigation between the same parties or parties in privity).', '- 13 - manner in which the state defended itself. To a large extent, the state’s defense focused on highlighting its limited involvement with the Cliff Walk. Additionally, the state sought to more fully flesh out the specific actions that certain entities had taken with respect to the Cliff Walk. Of course, the state was free to introduce evidence that may have inculpated the city in some way. See Cooney v. Molis, 640 A.2d 527, 530 (R.I. 1994) (“[A] remaining joint tortfeasor is free to assert the settling joint tortfeasors’ liability in their absence.”). As far as testimony regarding the relationship between the society and the Cliff Walk is concerned, we cannot say that the error, if any, in admitting such evidence was so prejudicial as to warrant reversal. See Conneally v. Gemma, 82 R.I. 136, 142, 107 A.2d 308, 311 (1954); see Part III D, infra.', 'D', 'Evidentiary Rulings', 'The plaintiffs argue that the trial justice erred with respect to three main evidentiary issues. We address each of these arguments separately below, mindful that “[w]hen reviewing such decisions, we will not conclude that a trial justice abused his or her discretion as long as some grounds to support the decision appear in the record.” Dalo v. Thalmann, 878 A.2d 194, 200 (R.I. 2005) (quoting Boscia v. Sharples, 860 A.2d 674, 677 (R.I. 2004)).', '1. Testimony Regarding the Society', 'As a component of their larger argument assigning error to the trial justice’s application of Berman I, plaintiffs take issue with the introduction of testimony regarding the nature of the relationship between the society and the Cliff Walk.', 'Distilled to its essence, plaintiffs’ contention is that they were prejudiced by allegedly irrelevant and immaterial evidence. Like other evidentiary issues, we review the “admission of evidence objected to as being irrelevant or immaterial” under the abuse of discretion lens. Gaglione v. Cardi, 120 R.I. 534, 538, 388 A.2d', '- 14 - 361, 363 (1978). Indeed, “[t]he determination of whether evidence is relevant is confided to the sound discretion of the trial justice * * *.” State v. Silvia, 898 A.2d 707, 716 (R.I. 2006). “Furthermore, it is the burden of the party opposing such evidence to establish that the proposed evidence clearly has no bearing on the proceedings.” Jones v. Wilbur, 604 A.2d 779, 780 (R.I. 1992).', 'Specifically, plaintiffs disagree with the introduction of testimony that indicated: (1) that the society was the owner of the specific piece of land on which Simcha sustained injury; and (2) that the city and state needed permission from landowners whose property abuts the Cliff Walk, including the society, to install signage or fencing on the property owners’ land. This grievance fails to acknowledge that this testimony was elicited from plaintiffs’ own witness. A party faces a trying task to complain that its own witness’s testimony treaded into troublesome territory. 7 While one of the state’s witnesses also testified to these same facts, we find that “the admission of [the testimony] was not prejudicial error, since it appears substantially without objection elsewhere in the transcript” of plaintiffs’ own witness. Grygiel v. Grygiel, 68 R.I. 155, 158, 26 A.2d 743, 744 (1942). Therefore, even “assuming that some of such testimony was not material, we do not agree that it was so prejudicial as to require a new trial.” Conneally, 82 R.I. at 142, 107 A.2d at 311.', '2. Letter from Sister McKillop', 'The plaintiffs also argue that the letter from the then-President of Salve Regina College, Sister Lucille McKillop, should not have been excluded from evidence. Written on October 7, 7', 'This is especially true considering plaintiffs did not attempt to impeach their witness with a prior inconsistent statement or otherwise seek to treat the witness as adverse. See R.I. R. Evid. 607; State v. Vargas, 420 A.2d 809, 812 (R.I. 1980) (“[A] party who is surprised by his own witness’s testimony may be permitted, in the discretion of the trial justice, to confront the witness with prior inconsistent statements.”).', '- 15 - 1987, the letter was addressed to the then-City Manager of Newport and discussed the death of a Salve student on the Cliff Walk and the writer’s belief that fencing was needed in certain areas along the Cliff Walk. The trial justice refused to admit the document as a full exhibit, finding that the letter was hearsay and that plaintiffs had not established sufficient similarity between the events described in the letter and the case at bar to constitute notice to the state.', 'Here, the trial justice explained his misgivings with the letter being offered as some type of notice to the state. He noted that the letter was written more than a decade prior to Simcha’s fall and that it was addressed to the city instead of the state. Additionally, the trial justice found that plaintiffs had not established sufficient similarity in time, location, condition, or circumstances between the incident discussed in the letter and Simcha’s fall.', 'Given the thoroughness of the grounds supporting his decision, we cannot say that the trial justice abused his discretion in excluding the contents of the letter from evidence.', '3. City’s Liability Insurance', 'The plaintiffs also assign error to the jury being informed that the city had liability insurance on the date of Simcha’s fall. After the jury was so informed, the trial justice instructed the jury that such information was offered simply for the purpose of demonstrating ownership or control and was not to be considered for the purpose of determining the negligence of any party.', 'Rule 411 of the Rhode Island Rules of Evidence provides that “[e]vidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue whether he acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully.” However, the rule also explicitly states that it “does not require the exclusion of evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control * * *.” Id. In light of this, the trial justice found that evidence that the city had liability insurance was relevant to the issue of control over the', '- 16 - Cliff Walk and was, therefore, admissible. Additionally, the trial justice found that plaintiffs had opened the door to this evidence by placing a document into evidence indicating that the city had insurance.', 'As we stated above, the admissibility of evidence is committed to the trial justice’s discretion. See Morel, 64 A.3d at 1179. Additionally, a party that opens the door to certain evidence on a particular issue is hard pressed to complain of the opposing party casting further light on the newly exposed threshold. See United States v. Joost, 133 F.3d 125, 128 (1st Cir. 1998) (“A party who opens a door cannot be heard to complain that the adverse party strolled through the doorway.”); State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 470 (R.I. 2013).', 'However, because plaintiffs conceded that the city had liability insurance covering the Cliff Walk during the relevant time, there was no need for the jury to hear prolonged testimony or see extensive documentary evidence on this point. Rather, the jury was given a simple instruction by the trial justice. 8 “Although a trial justice’s instructions are not ‘evidence,’ we review [his] instruction on insurance under Rule 411 to determine whether it violated the spirit of the rule.” Oden v. Schwartz, 71 A.3d 438, 454 (R.I. 2013). We review “issues pertaining to jury instructions * * * de novo.” Id. (quoting State v. Vargas, 991 A.2d 1056, 1060 (R.I. 2010)).', 'Here, the trial justice correctly acknowledged that control and responsibility were salient issues. See Berman I, 991 A.2d at 1046 n.9. This fact is highlighted by language contained in 8', 'After plaintiffs conceded that the city had liability insurance covering the Cliff Walk for the relevant time, the trial justice instructed the jury as follows:', '“I am going to inform you that at the time of Mr. Berman’s fall on August 17,', '2000, the City of Newport had insurance against liability for that event. Now this', 'is not being offered to you as to whether anyone was negligent, the State or the', 'City or anyone else for that matter. It’s simply being offered to you as evidence', 'of ownership or control of the Cliff Walk at that time. And it’s not to be', 'considered by you in rendering a verdict on the issue of damages * * * to either', 'Mr. or the then Mrs. Berman.”', '- 17 - the document mentioning insurance introduced by plaintiffs. In detailing what took place at a meeting between city, state, and federal officials regarding maintenance of the Cliff Walk, a participant at the meeting stated that “[t]he entire ensuing discussion then centered on the issue of ownership with all sides trying to avoid any responsibility for ownership.” Further, the fact that the city had already settled did not preclude the state from trying to show that the city was the responsible party. As we have said, a “remaining joint tortfeasor is free to assert the settling joint tortfeasors’ liability in their absence. This holding, in our opinion, encourages settlement but does not prejudice the rights of the nonsettling defendants.” Cooney, 640 A.2d at 530.', 'While we acknowledge that “the trial justice might more appropriately have refrained from using the phrase ‘[had insurance against liability for that event]’ in [his] instruction, we cannot say that the use of this phrase so pervaded the minds of the jurors that they were rendered incapable of arriving at a fair and impartial verdict.” Oden, 71 A.3d at 455. Indeed, the instruction expressly told the jurors that the information was “not being offered * * * as to whether anyone was negligent * * * [a]nd it’s not to be considered * * * in rendering a verdict on the issue of damages.” “[I]t is well settled that the members of the jury are presumed to follow the trial justice’s instructions,” and we see no reason to upset that presumption here. Oden, 71 A.3d at 455 (quoting State v. Clark, 754 A.2d 73, 80 (R.I. 2000)). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial justice did not err in his instruction regarding liability insurance and the limited purpose for which it could be considered.', 'E', 'Instructions to the Jury', 'On appeal, plaintiffs also take issue with some of the other instructions given to the jury. In particular, plaintiffs argue that the trial justice erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the', '- 18 - society had no duty, responsibility, or control over the location where the incident occurred. Additionally, plaintiffs contend that the trial justice erred in refusing to specifically instruct the jury that the state had assumed a duty of care over the premises in question. 9', 'We need not address these arguments. The plaintiffs did not raise these objections to the jury instructions below. “We have noted that we are especially rigorous in the application of the raise-or-waive rule when considering objections to jury instructions.” Botelho, 970 A.2d at 548. As such, plaintiffs’ “failure to object to a jury instruction precludes review of the instruction on appeal.” State v. Pacheco, 763 A.2d 971, 979 (R.I. 2001).', 'We take this moment to reiterate that although “no particular formality is required of counsel in raising an objection,” there still must be an objection raised on the record. King, 94 A.3d at 483 (quoting A.R. Alvernas, Inc. v. Cohen, 420 A.2d 78, 81 (R.I. 1980)). With respect to jury instructions, it is imperative that a focused objection “specific enough to alert the trial justice as to the nature of [the trial justice’s] alleged error” in giving any jury instruction (including a trial justice’s failure to instruct as to a particular issue) must be made on the record after the jury is instructed and before it retires to deliberate. Id. (quoting Botelho, 970 A.2d at 548). Such is required in order to comply with Rule 51(b) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.

Finding no error in the trial justice’s rulings on each of these grounds, we reject them in turn.', '1. Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law', 'The issue of negligence may be treated as a matter of law “only if the ‘facts suggest only one reasonable inference.’” Berard v.

Ciccone, 59 A.3d 125, 130 (R.I. 2013)). “[I]f there are ‘factual issues on which reasonable people may draw different conclusions,’” the motion must be denied.

Ann & Hope of Rhode Island, Inc., 637 A.2d 339, 350-51 (R.I. 1994).', '- 20 - the Cliff Walk. This instruction was given notwithstanding the trial justice’s candid reflection in ruling on plaintiffs’ renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law that, based on his “view of the evidence, there was an open issue * * * as to whether the State assumed a duty to maintain or warn visitors to the Cliff Walk.”', 'Taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, there were numerous factual questions upon which reasonable jurors could disagree in determining whether the state breached this assumed duty. There was evidence introduced that other individuals may have used the path where Simcha fell without any difficulty, that, in fact, he himself may have even gone down the path once before, and that his accident could have occurred simply because he lost his footing. Additionally, there was evidence from plaintiffs’ own witness that there was no way to ensure complete safety on the Cliff Walk and that any precautionary measures taken required a careful balancing of the potential risks and the public’s right to use and enjoy the Cliff Walk. As such, there was no error in determining that the jury should resolve these factual disputes, and the trial justice properly denied plaintiffs’ motion for judgment as a matter of law.', '2. Motion for a New Trial', 'The plaintiffs contend that the trial justice committed reversible legal error by not properly following our decision in Berman I. We have already determined that the trial justice adhered to our earlier mandate. See Part III C, supra. Finding that the trial justice carried out his appropriate duties under Rule 59 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, we likewise hold that the trial justice did not err in refusing to grant a new trial.', 'After carefully outlining plaintiffs’ arguments, the trial justice articulated his basis for finding that there was sufficient competent evidence that justified the jury’s verdict in light of the jury charge. The trial justice concluded that, at the end of the day, the state had only an', '- 21 - extremely limited role with respect to the Cliff Walk and that there was a “dearth of evidence” to support a finding of negligence in that limited role. The trial justice also discussed certain credibility and consistency issues relating to Simcha’s testimony. Specifically, the trial justice noted that, while he was sympathetic to Simcha’s situation, he did not find him to be credible with respect to his testimony regarding the ground crumbling beneath his feet. Additionally, the trial justice found that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that, if fencing or other suggested precautionary measures had been put in place, such measures would have necessarily prevented this incident.', 'Thus, the trial justice properly denied plaintiffs’ motion for a new trial.', '3. Motion to Vacate Judgment', 'After the conclusion of the trial and entry of judgment in favor of defendant, plaintiffs moved to vacate the judgment. The plaintiffs produced evidence that the city had installed warning signs at entrances to the Cliff Walk and at the location of several paths leading to the water, including the location where Simcha had fallen. The plaintiffs allege that this evidence contradicted testimony by the state that it believed it would need the society’s or any other abutting landowner’s permission to do any type of work in the area.', 'A motion to vacate based on newly discovered evidence requires a showing that: “(1) the evidence is material enough that it probably would change the outcome of the proceedings and (2) ‘the evidence was not discoverable at the time of the original hearing by the exercise of ordinary diligence.’” Malinou, 970 A.2d at 10 (quoting Medeiros v. Anthem Casualty Insurance Group, 822 A.2d 175, 178 (R.I. 2003)).', 'The trial justice determined that plaintiffs had not satisfied either ground. He found that plaintiffs could have discovered whether any entity needed the society’s or another abutting', '- 22 - landowner’s permission by questioning or deposing such entity or person. Further, the trial justice reasoned that, even if such evidence could not have been timely discovered, it still probably would not have had an impact on the outcome of the trial. The trial justice noted that the signs were installed over a decade after Simcha’s fall and that the signs were installed by the city, a completely different entity from defendant.', 'Accordingly, we are satisfied that the trial justice did not abuse his discretion in denying the motion to vacate on grounds of newly discovered evidence. See Medeiros, 822 A.2d at 178 (holding that failure of party seeking vacation of judgment to interview a witness may demonstrate lack of due diligence).', 'The plaintiffs’ other reasons for seeking a vacation of judgment fare no better. The plaintiffs assert that the judgment should be vacated pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3) due to “fraud * * *, misrepresentation, or other misconduct” on the part of the state. The plaintiffs contend that the state’s position during trial was that it did not have the authority to install fencing or signs along the Cliff Walk and that the installation of signs by the city after the trial is indicative of fraud or a misrepresentation. The trial justice determined that evidence the city installed signs at the location where Simcha fell had no bearing on the state’s actual or perceived ability to install signs at the time of the accident. 11', 'For the foregoing reasons, we cannot say that the trial justice abused his discretion in refusing to grant a new trial or to vacate judgment based on the grounds alleged by plaintiffs. 11', 'The plaintiffs also argued that the judgment should be vacated pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, which justifies relief for “any other reason.” The trial justice correctly acknowledged that this clause is to be invoked “only in unique circumstances to prevent manifest injustice” and that such was not the case before him.

We find no error in that determination.', '- 23 -', 'G', 'The State’s Alleged Errors', 'Although it was found to be not negligent by a jury after a trial on the merits, the state has filed a cross-appeal, assigning error to certain rulings of the trial justice. In particular, the state argues the following: (1) plaintiffs failed to establish a prima facie case because of a lack of expert testimony; (2) plaintiffs failed to establish predicate facts indicating that the state owed plaintiffs a duty; (3) the public duty doctrine shielded the state from liability; and (4) the state was entitled to immunity under the RUS.', 'Generally, a party that has received a completely favorable jury verdict “cannot be said to be aggrieved by any of the alleged erroneous rulings” of a trial justice. Wallworth v. United Electric Railways Co., 51 R.I. 463, 464, 155 A. 402, 402 (1931). The state argues, however, that this case should never have been submitted to a jury for myriad reasons in the first place. Nevertheless, in light of our determination that the jury verdict in favor of defendant should stand, we decline the state’s invitation to opine further. See Furlan v. Farrar, 982 A.2d 581, 585 (R.I. 2009).', 'We recognize, as did the trial justice, that our decision in Berman I is not without its critics.

Sitrin, 16 Roger Williams U. L. Rev. 305 (2011). However, we also recognize the principle that “[d]iscretion is often the better part of valor, and courts should not rush to decide unsettled legal issues that can easily be avoided.” United States v. Gonzalez, 736 F.3d 40, 40 (1st Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 1012 (2014); see PDK Laboratories Inc. v.

These cases came before the Supreme Court on October 2, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in these appeals should not be summarily decided. 1 After a bench trial, a justice of the Superior Court declared that the defendants, Timothy W. and Pamela J. Scott (defendants), owed the plaintiff, Timothy Raiche (plaintiff) d/b/a T. Raiche Builders, $5,455.50 in damages and further found that the defendants were responsible for prejudgment interest on the amount of an offer of judgment that had been deposited in the Registry of the Superior Court, in accordance with Rule 68(b)(3) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. The defendants timely appealed the trial justice’s decision to award prejudgment interest on the amount of the offer of judgment. The plaintiff cross-appealed the trial justice’s damages award. For the following reasons, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown and, thus, deny and dismiss the appeals of both parties and affirm the judgment. 1', 'Although two separate appeals were filed and two case numbers were assigned, we have consolidated the cases into this opinion.', '-1-', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendants own a home located on Solar Drive in Westerly, Rhode Island. In 2003, they decided to expand and remodel the dwelling. After obtaining a design plan, defendants met with several builders, including plaintiff. On November 20, 2003, defendants entered into a written agreement with plaintiff, in which plaintiff agreed to complete the construction work on defendants’ home for $240,000. Construction commenced in January 2004.', 'During the course of the project, defendants requested certain design changes. For example, it became necessary to install a load-bearing beam, which resulted in additional changes to the kitchen plan. The defendants also requested outside stone work and a redesign of the kitchen’s plumbing. Additionally, defendants selected a new lighting plan, which required additional electrical work.', 'Although plaintiff instructed the appropriate subcontractors to implement the changes, the written agreement between plaintiff and defendants mandated that any changes that involved extra costs could only be executed by written orders and any such change order had to include payment terms. 2 No written change orders were executed between the parties.', 'After nine months of construction, the project was completed.', 'In November 2004, plaintiff submitted an invoice to defendants, indicating a total of $318,242.80 in charges. The defendants’ previous payment of $189,500 was credited, leaving a balance of $128,742.80.

Payment was not forthcoming.', 'On June 2, 2005, plaintiff filed suit asserting that defendants breached the contract and were unjustly enriched in failing to pay the remaining balance. On October 2, 2008, defendants presented an offer of judgment to plaintiff in accordance with Rule 68. 3 The defendants’ offer of judgment stated: “[defendants,] pursuant to Rule[s] 67 and 68 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure, deposit the sum of $50,000 into the Registry of Court as an Offer of Judgment for the balance of the contract due and owing to * * * [p]laintiff[.]” On October 6, 2008, plaintiff accepted the offer of judgment, but only as part payment in accordance with Rule 68(b)(3).', 'The plaintiff’s acceptance stated:', '“[plaintiff], pursuant to Rule 68(b)(3) of the 3', 'Rule 68 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure provides:', '“(a) Offer of Judgment.

In assessing the amount of damages, the trial justice conducted a thorough review of the evidence under a breach-of-contract analysis as well as an unjust- enrichment analysis. He concluded that, pursuant to the contract between the parties, plaintiff was entitled to $240,000 for construction work on the project. As defendants had already paid plaintiff $189,500 and deposited $50,000 into the Superior Court Registry, the trial justice found that plaintiff was entitled to $500. The trial justice also found, under an unjust-enrichment theory, that plaintiff was entitled to $4,955.50 for electrical work in connection with the new lighting plan, work that was not anticipated in the written agreement. 4 Thus, the trial justice awarded plaintiff $5,455.50, plus interest and costs.', 'A judgment entered on March 7, 2011, requiring defendants to pay $55,455.50, plus interest and costs from the date the action accrued until October 30, 2009, the date plaintiff withdrew the funds from the Superior Court Registry, with interest on the balance from October 30, 2009 until the date of judgment. After a series of orders and an objection by defendants, plaintiff thereafter filed a separate motion seeking to amend the form of the 4', 'The plaintiff had been aware of all defendants’ other construction changes and had worked directly with subcontractors when completing those changes. This additional electrical work, however, was completed without plaintiff’s consent or pre-approval but billed to him by a subcontractor, an occurrence that differed from defendants’ other requested construction changes.', '-4- judgment to conform to the trial justice’s written decision.', 'At a subsequent hearing, plaintiff argued that the judgment should reflect that prejudgment interest was due on the $50,000 offer of judgment from November 17, 2004 until October 30, 2009. The defendants argued that prejudgment interest should apply only to the $5,455.50 amount, not the Rule 68 offer-of-judgment amount.', 'The trial justice granted plaintiff’s motion to amend, vacated the previous judgment, and asked plaintiff to submit a new judgment.', 'The trial justice then issued an order on the issue of prejudgment interest, finding that the offer of judgment did not include prejudgment interest and that prejudgment interest was owed on the $50,000 from the date the action accrued to the day it was paid. The trial justice specifically noted that a Rule 68(c) “offer * * * not accepted in full satisfaction shall be deemed withdrawn, i.e., shall not be disclosed to the jury, and evidence thereof is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine interest or costs[,]” as support that “the rule assumes that the clerk will need to know what payments were [made] in order to calculate the amount of prejudgment interest.” 5 Lastly, the trial justice concluded that payment of the offer of judgment to the court registry tolls the accrual of additional interest, but he noted that payment was not made until February 2009. Therefore, the trial justice found that “[p]rejudgment interest shall be calculated on the amount of $55,545.30 from the date of filing of the complaint to October 30, 2009. Additional prejudgment interest shall be calculated on the amount of $5[,]545.30 from October 30, 2009 to the date of the judgment.”', 'After several attempts, an amended final judgment was entered on March 30, 2011. Both parties timely appealed. 5', 'The trial justice also reasoned that the offer of judgment did not include interest, because the offer had never been filed with the Superior Court. That issue is not before us.', '-5-', 'Before this Court is (1) defendants’ appeal, asserting that the trial justice erred in awarding prejudgment interest on the $50,000 deposited in the court registry as an offer of judgment; and (2) plaintiff’s cross-appeal, asserting that the trial justice erred in awarding only $55,455.50 6 in damages.', 'Standard of Review', '“When interpreting statutes and court rules, we apply a de novo standard of review.” State v. Brown, 898 A.2d 69, 76 (R.I. 2006) (citing Jacksonbay Builders, Inc. v. Azarmi, 869 A.2d 580, 583 (R.I. 2005)). “In matters of statutory interpretation our ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act * * *.” State v.

(quoting Alessi, 44 A.3d at 740). “However, the plain meaning approach must not be confused with ‘myopic literalism’; even when confronted with a clear and unambiguous statutory provision, ‘it is entirely proper for us to look to the sense and meaning fairly deducible from the context.’” Id. (quoting In re Brown, 903 A.2d 147, 150 (R.I. 2006)). “Therefore, we must ‘consider the entire statute as a whole; individual sections must be considered in the context of the entire statutory scheme, not as if each section were independent of all other sections.’” Id. (quoting Mendes v. Factor, 41 A.3d 994, 1002 (R.I. 2012)). 6', 'Both parties’ briefs and the trial court decision list the damages total as $55,455.50. However, the trial justice’s order, “Relating to Motion to Amend Judgment[,]” lists the damages total at $55,545.30. The origin of this discrepancy is unclear. Nonetheless, as the last amended judgment order listed the total damages as $55,455.50, plus interest and both parties refer to this number as the damages award, the Court will use $55,455.50 as the damages award that plaintiff is appealing.', '-6-', 'Additionally, “[i]t is well established that the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are accorded great weight and will not be disturbed unless the record shows that the findings clearly are wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” Process Engineers & Constructors, Inc. v. DiGregorio, Inc., 93 A.3d 1047, 1051 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Wellington Condominium Association v. Wellington Cove Condominium Association, 68 A.3d 594, 599 (R.I. 2013)). “If, as we review the record, it becomes clear to us that ‘the record indicates that competent evidence supports the trial justice’s findings, we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for [that of the trial justice] even though a contrary conclusion could have been reached.’” Id. at 1052 (quoting Wellington Condominium Association, 68 A.3d at 599). “When we review the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury, we accord those findings great deference.” Lamarque v.

The defendants 7', 'Rhode Island’s Rule 68(b)(3) allows a party to accept an offer of judgment “as part payment only and proceed with the action on the sole issue of the amount of damages.” Rules permitting offers of judgment in most jurisdictions do not allow for acceptance as part payment only. See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. 68; Alaska R. Civ. P. 68; Del. R. Civ. P. 68; Me. R. Civ. P. 68; Mass. R. Civ. P. 68; S.C. R. Civ. P. 68; Tenn. R. Civ. P. 68.', '-7- argue that the trial justice erred in awarding statutory interest on the $50,000 tender, because the offer of judgment was made with the intent to fully resolve the case—meaning that their offer of judgment included prejudgment interest. The defendants assert that Rule 68 is designed to incentivize settlements and that similarly situated defendants would have little motivation to make offers of judgment if acceptance in partial satisfaction did not constitute a compromise settlement, inclusive of interest. The plaintiff argues that the imposition of prejudgment interest was appropriate because the total amount of damages exceeded the $50,000 offer of judgment and that the offer of judgment did not indicate that prejudgment interest was included.', 'Rule 68(b)(3) provides that a party making a claim may “accept the tender [of an offer of judgment] as part payment only and proceed with the action on the sole issue of the amount of damages.” Importantly, Rule 68(b)(3) must be read in conjunction with Rule 68(c), which provides that “[a]n offer * * * not accepted in full satisfaction shall be deemed withdrawn, i.e., shall not be disclosed to the jury, and evidence thereof is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine interest or costs.” (Emphases added.) We are of the opinion that this language is clear and unambiguous. Rule 68 is devoid of any language that would suggest that an offer of judgment accepted as part payment only also includes prejudgment interest. Therefore, as “our assigned task is simply to interpret the [rule], not to redraft it * * *[,]” we conclude that an offer of judgment accepted as part payment only does not include prejudgment interest. See Iselin v. Retirement Board of the Employees’ Retirement System of Rhode Island, 943 A.2d 1045, 1049 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Sindelar v. Leguia, 750 A.2d 967, 972 (R.I. 2000)).', 'However, if an offer of judgment accepted as part payment only explicitly states that prejudgment interest is included in the offer, this condition would be sufficient to establish that', '-8- prejudgment interest was included in the offer of judgment. 8 Also, although not raised by either party to this case, a question arises as to when prejudgment interest should stop accruing on an offer of judgment that is accepted as part payment only—when the offer is deposited in the Registry of the Superior Court or when the funds are collected? The commentary to Rule 68 provides guidance, stating that “[s]ince [the claimant accepting the offer] has the option of accepting the deposit as part payment, he [or she] is not entitled to interest on the amount deposited after the date of deposit, no matter how large his ultimate recovery.” Robert B. Kent, et al., Rhode Island Civil Procedure § 68:2 (West 2011). Accordingly, interest on an offer of judgment accepted as part payment only runs from the accrual date until the date the funds are deposited into the Superior Court Registry.', 'Damages', 'In his cross-appeal, plaintiff contends that the trial justice erred in his damage award, because, he contends, the evidence submitted at trial established $126,152.60 in damages, an amount that was not disputed at trial. The plaintiff argues that, because defendants’ cross-claim for defective workmanship and defective services was dismissed, defendants were thus precluded from contesting the amount of damages. However, no cross-claim was filed in this case. 9 The plaintiff also contends that defendants were precluded from contesting damages by the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel—apparently because the issue of defective workmanship was not litigated.', 'The plaintiff does not clarify how those doctrines apply in this case. Therefore, we decline to address this argument and confine our analysis to whether the trial 8', 'We caution, however, that to be effective, this mechanism requires a calculation of what portion of the offer is compensation and what portion of the amount is prejudgment interest. 9', 'The plaintiff may be referring to defendants’ counterclaim (rather than a cross-claim), which alleged defective workmanship and defective services; nonetheless, dismissal of the counterclaim has no bearing on the damages issue before this Court.', '-9- justice erred in finding that plaintiff was entitled to $55,455.50 in damages, instead of the amount plaintiff claims. See Fisher v. Applebaum, 947 A.2d 248, 252 (R.I. 2008).', 'Our assessment of the record reveals that that the trial justice conducted a proper review of the evidence adduced at trial. He reviewed the written agreement between the parties and assessed the credibility of the witnesses. He then performed a thorough analysis of Rhode Island’s parol evidence rule. Under Rhode Island law, a court can consider parol evidence for the purpose of “supplement[ing] an agreement that is incomplete” or not fully integrated. Lisi v. Marra, 424 A.2d 1052, 1055 (R.I. 1981). However, a court cannot consider parol evidence for the purpose of contradicting an agreement not fully integrated. See Golden Gate Corp. v. Barrington College, 98 R.I. 35, 42, 199 A.2d 586, 590 (1964). The trial justice determined that the parties’ contractual relationship was governed by the written agreement. Next, the trial justice found “the written agreement to be an incomplete expression or ‘partial integration,’” and “proceed[ed] to the final step of the [parol evidence] analysis—comparing the terms of the alleged oral agreement to those of the written agreement.” He found that, “[b]ecause the oral pricing terms contradict the written pricing terms, the written pricing terms must govern.”', 'Turning to plaintiff’s theory of unjust-enrichment, the trial justice found that plaintiff was entitled to $4,955.50 for electrical work that was performed at plaintiff’s expense. Although the trial justice included the $4,955.50 in his total damage award, plaintiff’s cross-appeal did not dispute the trial justice’s unjust-enrichment finding. Therefore, the trial justice concluded that (1) $240,000 was the governing price term in the only written agreement between the parties; (2) defendants had previously paid plaintiff $239,500; (3) defendants also owed plaintiff $4,955.50 for electrical work not included in the written agreement; and (4) defendants made an offer of judgment for $50,000. Thus, plaintiff’s damages totaled $55,455.50.', '- 10 -', 'This Court accords great weight to the factual findings and conclusions of a trial justice sitting without a jury, and we are satisfied that the trial justice made sufficient findings of fact, evaluated the testimony, and was not clearly wrong in his conclusion that the plaintiff is entitled to $55,455.50, not $126,152.60.', 'Conclusion', 'For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the Court affirms the judgment of the Superior Court.

It is noteworthy that the defendant was previously before this Court on a closely related case, Malinou v. Seattle Savings Bank, 970 A.2d 6, 12 (R.I. 2009), wherein this Court affirmed a Superior Court judgment that Seattle Savings Bank had the right to foreclose on the property. In this appeal, the defendant challenges Fannie Mae’s right to possession of the property. On September 24, 2014, this case came before the Supreme Court pursuant to an order directing the parties to show cause why the issues in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of the parties and examining the memoranda that they submitted, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.', '-1-', 'I', 'Facts and Travel', 'The defendant’s mother, Etta E.

On November 15, 1991, the decedent executed and delivered a home equity conversion adjustable rate note and an adjustable rate allonge (collectively the note) to Rhode Island Housing and Mortgage Finance Corporation (RIHMFC). The note was secured by a mortgage on the property. Collectively, those documents created a “reverse mortgage” that required that “all outstanding principal and accrued interest [be paid] to Lender upon receipt of a notice by Lender requiring immediate payment in full * * *.” See Malinou, 970 A.2d at 8. The note specified that, upon decedent’s death, lender had the right to demand immediate payment of the note in full.', 'On October 31, 2002, before Mrs. Malinou died, RIHMFC assigned the note and mortgage to Seattle Savings Bank. The assignment was not recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds in Providence until June 3, 2003.', 'In January 2003, the decedent died testate as the sole owner of the property. It is undisputed that no principal or interest payments had been paid during decedent’s lifetime. Pursuant to the terms of decedent’s will, defendant inherited the property. It is noteworthy that defendant has resided at the property since 1946 and has maintained his law practice on the first floor since 1960.', 'On June 30, 2003, Seattle Savings Bank notified defendant that it held the mortgage and it demanded payment of the note in full.

Id. at 12.', 'Once again, in the spring of 2007, Seattle Savings Bank noticed and advertised the foreclosure of the property. This time, on June 13, 2007, the foreclosure took place and Seattle Savings Bank was the highest bidder. Thereafter, Seattle Savings Bank recorded a foreclosure deed in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds in Providence. On July 30, 2007, Seattle Savings Bank executed a quitclaim deed conveying the property to Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae recorded the quitclaim deed on August 3, 2007.', 'On or about August 3, 2007, Fannie Mae sent a notice of termination of tenancy by sufferance to defendant pursuant to G.L. 1956 § 34-18.1-2.1 The notice instructed defendant to vacate the property by August 14, 2007. The defendant failed to comply. As a result, on September 7, 2007, Fannie Mae filed a trespass and ejectment complaint in Sixth Division District Court. In the District Court, the parties entered into a stipulation to transfer the case to Superior Court because “[d]efendant’s defense relies upon issues of [t]itle which are properly heard in the Superior Court.” An order was entered to that effect. 1', 'General Laws 1956 § 34-18.1-2 provides that “[t]enants of lands or tenements at will or by sufferance covered by this chapter shall quit upon notice in writing from the landlord at the day named therein.”', '-3-', 'Prior to trial in Superior Court, the parties entered into a joint statement of undisputed facts. In addition to many of the facts outlined above, the parties further agreed that, on July 10, 2007, an assignment naming Seattle Mortgage Company as assignor was recorded in the Office of the Recorder of Deeds in Providence in book 8763 at page 94. That document, which was prepared by DocX, a subsidiary of Lender Processing Services, Inc. (LPS), failed to name an assignee. Further, the parties agreed that, at the time of trial, there remained on record a tax sale deed to Rookies Real Estate, NLR Partners, recorded on August 3, 2012. However, Fannie Mae was within the time to redeem the property and no petition to foreclose the right of redemption had been filed.2', 'The nonjury trial commenced on March 20, 2013. At trial, defendant, in an effort to defeat Fannie Mae’s trespass and ejectment action, relied heavily upon the Seattle Mortgage Company assignment and the August 2012 tax-sale deed. In addition, defendant urged the trial justice to enforce subpoenas duces tecum that he had caused to be served upon LPS and Bank of America (BOA), respectively, one day and two days before the commencement of trial. The trial justice refused to enforce the subpoenas because they were overbroad and violated the pretrial order closing discovery on February 19, 2013. Further, the trial justice found that enforcing the subpoenas would inevitably require the trial to be suspended for an unspecified length of time.', 'On March 22, 2013, the trial justice issued a bench decision. In her decision, she determined that a presumption in favor of the record title holder, Fannie Mae, existed and that clear and convincing evidence was necessary to overcome that presumption.

Further, the trial justice gave no weight to the August 2012 tax-sale deed because Fannie Mae’s right to redeem was still in effect.3 Accordingly, the trial justice awarded Fannie Mae possession of the property. Judgment in favor of Fannie Mae entered on the same day.', 'On March 29, 2013, defendant filed a motion to stay the execution of judgment.

The defendant contends that personal jurisdiction over decedent’s estate was lacking because Fannie Mae failed to serve the estate. The record reflects that defendant failed to raise this argument in the lower court.

Because defendant failed to argue that the Superior Court lacked personal jurisdiction in the lower court, we conclude that that argument has been waived.', 'Notwithstanding defendant’s waiver, “it is well settled that by a general appearance a defendant submits himself to the jurisdiction of the court, [and] any failure to serve him with process becomes immaterial.” Mack Construction Co. v. Quonset Real Estate Corp., 84 R.I. 190, 194, 122 A.2d 163, 164 (1956) (citing Industrial Trust Co. v. Rabinowitz, 65 R.I. 20, 13 A.2d 259 (1940)); see also Robert B.

In response, defendant entered an appearance on behalf of himself and the decedent. The defendant made a suggestion of decedent’s death on the record and admitted that he was the sole occupant of the property. Accordingly, we conclude that defendant’s argument concerning lack of personal jurisdiction is unavailing.', 'However, that does not end our jurisdictional inquiry. A challenge to subject matter jurisdiction “may not be waived by any party and may be raised at any time in the proceedings.” Boyer v. Bedrosian, 57 A.3d 259, 270 (R.I. 2012) (quoting Pine v. Clark, 636 A.2d 1319, 1321 (R.I. 1994)). Indeed, at the outset of the nonjury trial, the trial justice herself questioned whether or not she had jurisdiction over the trespass and ejectment action because it was not before her on a District Court appeal; rather, it was being tried in the first instance in the Superior Court after the parties had transferred it to that tribunal.', '-7-', 'General Laws 1956 § 8-8-3(a)(2), provides that the District Court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of “[a]ll actions between landlords and tenants pursuant to chapter 18 of title 34 and all other actions for possession of premises and estates * * *.” In addition, G.L. 1956 § 8- 2-14(a) states that “[t]he [S]uperior [C]ourt shall have original jurisdiction of all actions at law where title to real estate or some right or interest therein is in issue, except actions for possession of tenements let or held at will or by sufferance * * *.” No provision of G.L. 1956 chapters 18 or 18.1 of title 34, provides for the removal of trespass and ejectment actions to the Superior Court for trial.', 'However, it is well established that a party who stipulates to judgment in the District Court is entitled to appeal that judgment to the Superior Court for a trial de novo.

Further, this Court previously has reviewed a trespass and ejectment action that was, by agreement, removed from the District Court to the Superior Court for trial. Martineau v. King, 120 R.I. 265, 266, 386 A.2d 1117, 1118 (1978).', 'In Martineau, we discerned no jurisdictional deficiency, in that the case was removed to the Superior Court by agreement because, as is the case here, issues of title were raised in defense to the trespass and ejectment action. Id.', 'Here, the parties entered into a stipulation to transfer the case to Superior Court because “[d]efendant’s defense relies upon issues of [t]itle which are properly heard in the Superior Court.” Based upon that stipulation as well as the fact that numerous issues had been raised regarding title, the District Court entered an order granting the transfer. By agreeing to transfer the case to the Superior Court, the parties were, in essence, adhering to the same procedure as', '-8- had the parties in Martineau, 120 R.I. at 266, 386 A.2d at 1118. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the instant action.', 'B', 'The Documentary Evidence', 'Next, defendant argues that this Court should not give deference to the trial justice’s findings of fact because they were based entirely on documentary evidence. Instead, defendant urges this Court to engage in a de novo review of the evidence. As support, defendant cites Imperial Casualty and Indemnity Co. v. Bellini, 888 A.2d 957 (R.I. 2005); however, nowhere in that case did this Court make any such pronouncement. To the contrary, this Court has explained that “[f]indings of fact by a trial justice sitting without a jury are entitled to great weight and will not be disturbed by the reviewing court unless they are clearly wrong. This has been our guiding principle even when the issue to be resolved depends upon the interpretation of documentary evidence.” Zifcak v. Greater Woonsocket Board of Realtors, Inc., 117 R.I. 9, 13, 362 A.2d 763, 766 (1976) (citing Chase v. Blackstone Distributing Co., 110 R.I. 537, 545, 294 A.2d 392, 396 (1972)).

As support, the trial justice relied upon Providence & Worcester Co. v. Exxon Corp., 116 R.I. 470, 359 A.2d 329 (1976), and Newport Yacht Club, Inc. v. Deomatares, 93 R.I. 60, 171 A.2d 78 (1961).

We previously have held that Seattle Savings Bank had the authority to foreclose. Malinou, 970 A.2d at 12. The record is clear that after the foreclosure, Seattle Savings Bank conveyed its rights and interests in the property to Fannie Mae by means of a quitclaim deed. The only document that could cast any doubt on Fannie Mae’s title was the assignment involving Seattle Mortgage Company.', 'The validity of the Seattle Mortgage Company assignment was appropriately questioned by the trial justice as a result of defendant’s allegations concerning the fraudulent business practices committed by DocX, the party that prepared the assignment at issue. In addition, the Seattle Mortgage Company assignment is an extraneous document that is outside Fannie Mae’s chain of title. Accordingly, and although we depart somewhat from the trial justice’s reasoning, we nonetheless uphold her finding that defendant failed to rebut the presumption that Fannie Mae was entitled to possession of the property. 4', 'In some cases concerning real property, such as adverse possession and establishing an easement, we require clear and convincing evidence in support of such claims.

The defendant argues that the trial justice strayed beyond the bounds of her discretion when she refused to enforce the subpoenas. Alternatively, defendant avers that, even if the trial justice had the discretion to decide whether to enforce the subpoenas, her failure to enforce them was an abuse of that discretion.', 'This Court has held that “parties should not be allowed to employ a subpoena after a discovery deadline [on the eve of trial] to obtain materials from third parties [or parties] that could have been produced before discovery [closed].” Butera v. Boucher, 798 A.2d 340, 345 (R.I. 2002) (quoting 9A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure, § 2452 (Supp. 2002)). In Butera, the Court determined that a subpoena issued on the “eve-of- trial” that was both “overbroad and untimely” should not be enforced. Id.; see also National Exchange Bank v. Lubrano, 29 R.I. 64, 70, 68 A. 944, 946 (1908) (refusing to enforce a subpoena duces tecum issued after the close of the plaintiff’s case because the defendant had had ample opportunity to request evidence prior to trial). The Court explained that a “subpoena duces tecum, when [employed] as a means of belated discovery, should not be allowed to circumvent the discovery deadlines for parties established by the other rules of civil procedure or by court order.” Butera, 798 A.2d at 345.', 'The record reflects that the LPS and BOA subpoenas were served, respectively, one day and two days before the commencement of trial. The subpoenas, which were unlimited as to time, sought all documents and information, electronic or otherwise, related to the mortgage at issue, including the account history and trail of assignment. The trial justice said that if the', '- 11 - subpoenas were to be enforced, the trial would have to be suspended, because LPS and BOA “would need weeks, if not months, to search for, organize, and compile the information and to assert any objections and privileges they might deem appropriate.” Further, she found that defendant had “had a substantial period of time to conduct discovery, including [Super. R. Civ. P.] 30(b) depositions” prior to trial. The trial justice also indicated that enforcing the eve-of-trial subpoenas would have run contrary to the pretrial order that closed discovery on February 19, 2013. In light of the foregoing, it is our opinion that the trial justice’s decision was not an abuse of discretion and we see no reason to disturb it.', 'E', '2012 Tax Sale Deed', 'Finally, the defendant argues that, because the property was sold at a tax sale conducted by municipal authorities in 2012, Fannie Mae no longer had the authority to bring the action. But a reading of G.L. 1956 § 44-9-12(a) reveals that a tax sale does not “give to the purchaser any right to either the possession, or the rents, or profits of the land until the expiration of one year after the date of the sale * * *.” This Court has explained that “[o]ne who purchases property at a tax sale acquires a title that is contingent upon the owner’s nonredemption.” Alberston v. Leca, 447 A.2d 383, 388 (R.I. 1982) (citing § 44-9-12). It is undisputed that, at the time of trial, Fannie Mae retained its right of redemption.

This case came before the Supreme Court for oral argument on September 24, 2014, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this appeal should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we are of the opinion that cause has not been shown, and we proceed to decide the appeal at this time, without further briefing or argument. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court. 1', 'For a detailed explanation on the function of MERS in the mortgage industry, see Bucci v.

The note stated in relevant part, “I understand that the Lender may transfer this Note. The Lender or anyone who takes this Note by transfer and who is entitled to receive payments under this Note is called the ‘Note Holder.’” The note was secured by a mortgage on the Auburn Avenue property. The mortgage deed denominated Leone as the borrower and mortgagor and specified that MERS was the mortgagee, acting as nominee for lender, Equity One, and lender’s successors and assigns. The mortgage deed included the statutory power of sale in favor of MERS as well as “to the successors and assigns of MERS.” Finally, it was provided that MERS had the right to enforce its interests, “including, but not limited to, the right to foreclose and sell the property,” in the event Leone failed to fulfill his obligation to pay the note. The mortgage deed was duly executed and recorded in the Land Evidence Records for the Town of Johnston on December 11, 2006.', 'On April 24, 2009, Equity One executed a notarized limited power of attorney enabling ARC to act on its behalf.

That assignment was recorded in the Land Evidence Records for the Town of Johnston on December 4, 2009. Unfortunately, Leone failed to make timely payments to the lender. As a result of Leone’s default with respect to his obligations, ARC initiated foreclosure proceedings. In November of 2009, the property was sold at a foreclosure sale conducted by ARC.', 'On February 5, 2010, Leone filed an action for declaratory relief in Providence County Superior Court. His complaint sought a declaration that the assignment from MERS to ARC was invalid, and it also sought to quiet title to the property. On October 21, 2010, defendants, without having filed an answer to plaintiff’s complaint, filed a motion to dismiss the complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure.', 'Attached to the memorandum in support of the motion to dismiss were two documents that had not been incorporated in plaintiff’s initial pleading: the note and the limited power of attorney. Leone filed an objection to the motion to dismiss, attaching to his memorandum a document that was not part of his complaint. This document, entitled “Consent Order,” was issued by the United States Department of the Treasury; it concerned MERS’s business practices. After several continuances, the motion to dismiss was argued on May 24, 2011.4', 'On April 12, 2012, the hearing justice issued a written decision after having considered materials outside of the pleadings.

The justice further found that, at the time of foreclosure, ARC was a valid assignee of the mortgage from MERS and that as a result, ARC had the statutory power of sale. Additionally, the justice found that ARC held the power of attorney for the holder of the note. The justice also found that Leone was in default of his obligations under the note because he had failed to make payments which had precipitated the foreclosure proceedings. Therefore, the hearing justice granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. The plaintiff filed a timely appeal to this Court.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'When ruling on a motion to dismiss, Rule 12(b) states if “matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in Rule 56 * * *.” Further, this Court has held that “when the [hearing] justice receives evidentiary matters outside the complaint and does not expressly exclude them in passing on the motion, then Rule 12(b)(6) specifically requires the motion to be considered as one for summary judgment.” Multi-State Restoration, Inc. v.

First, plaintiff contests the hearing justice’s conversion of the motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment. He argues that the complaint would have survived a motion to dismiss. The plaintiff contends that summary judgment, even if properly converted, was nonetheless incorrectly granted to defendants. The plaintiff posits that the assignment of the mortgage from MERS to ARC was invalid, that the foreclosure by ARC was improper, and that the hearing justice improperly relied on other Superior Court decisions. We conclude that these arguments are without merit and we will address them in turn.', 'A. Conversion of Rule 12(b)(6) Motion', 'The plaintiff first argues that the conversion of defendants’ Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure was improper. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that he was not afforded proper notice of the conversion in accordance with Rule 12(b). Based on our review of the record, we disagree.', 'A motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) allows a court to dispose of a proceeding at an early stage if the complaint fails to set forth provable facts under which relief could be granted.', '-5- Mendes v. Factor, 41 A.3d 994, 1000 (R.I. 2012).

The defendants included the note that plaintiff had signed when he executed the mortgage and the limited power of attorney that bestowed the rights of the note holder on ARC.', 'In his reply, plaintiff submitted a consent order from several federal agencies that pertained to the practices of MERS in the mortgage market. The hearing justice, in his sound discretion, considered those documents in addition to the pleading and “[u]nder these circumstances, conversion of the dismissal motion to one for summary judgment was automatic under the rules.” Bowen Court Associates v. Ernst & Young, LLP, 818 A.2d 721, 726 (R.I. 2003).', 'Indeed, a party who supplies matters outside of the pleadings to a judge who is considering a motion to dismiss cannot complain of a lack of notice that such materials would be considered and a conversion to a motion for summary judgment would result.

Further, in the absence of a documented request by plaintiff to exclude such materials, we can discern no error in the hearing justice’s action. Both parties submitted materials outside the pleadings for the hearing justice to consider before he ruled on the motion to dismiss. Accordingly, we are satisfied that plaintiff was not denied notice or the opportunity to present additional material and that the Superior Court justice properly converted the motion to dismiss to one for summary judgment.', 'B. Motion for Summary Judgment', 'The plaintiff next argues that the hearing justice erred when he determined that no genuine dispute of material fact existed and when he granted summary judgment in favor of defendants. The plaintiff argues that the assignment of the mortgage from MERS to ARC was invalid, that the foreclosure sale by ARC was not proper, and that the hearing justice improperly relied on previously decided Superior Court cases in making his decision. However, after reviewing the record, we are of the opinion that the arguments plaintiff advances concern the hearing justice’s conclusions of law and not matters of fact.', '“Summary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact is evident from ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits if any,’ and the motion justice finds that the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law.” Swain v.

The', '-7- plaintiff has failed to meet his burden of showing the existence of a disputed issue of material fact. In our opinion, the authority of MERS, as named mortgagee, to foreclose or to assign the mortgage are questions of law, not questions of fact to be determined by the hearing justice. Mruk v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., 82 A.3d 527, 532 (R.I. 2013). In so concluding, we note that we do not write on a blank slate and that we have addressed the issues raised by plaintiff in previous opinions. See Mruk, 82 A.3d at 532; Bucci v. Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB, 68 A.3d 1069, 1085 (R.I. 2013).', 'The plaintiff argues that MERS lacks the statutory power of sale because it held the mortgage only as nominee of the lender, Equity One, but this argument is without merit. In a case where the mortgage used identical language to the one in question, this Court held that MERS was the mortgagee with statutory power of sale. See Bucci, 68 A.3d at 1085. Here, as in Bucci, the mortgage language said, “[b]orrower does hereby mortgage, grant and convey to MERS, (solely as nominee for Lender and Lender’s successors and assigns) and to the successors and assigns of MERS, with Mortgage Covenants upon the Statutory Condition and with the Statutory Power of Sale * * *.” Id. at 1081. When plaintiff executed the mortgage containing this explicit language, he gave to MERS the contractual authority to exercise its right to foreclose.', 'Further, plaintiff argues that MERS did not validly assign the mortgage to ARC because it did not hold the note, but again, this Court has disposed of this argument. In a similar case, we have held that MERS, as mortgagee and nominee of the lender, could validly assign the mortgage and invest its assignee with the statutory power of sale. Mruk, 82 A.3d at 537. In Mruk, MERS assigned its interest in the mortgage to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA), which later began foreclosure proceedings. Id. at 530-31. We held that, based on the', '-8- reasoning in Bucci, the same entity need not hold the mortgage and the note, MERS was a valid mortgagee despite not holding the note, and its assignment to FNMA was therefore consistent with Rhode Island law. Mruk, 82 A.3d at 537. Similarly, the assignment of Leone’s mortgage to ARC was valid because MERS was the mortgagee and nominee for the original lender, Equity One and its successors and assigns. Upon the execution of the assignment, ARC held the statutory power of sale with the ability to foreclose.', 'The plaintiff next argues that the power of attorney that was issued to ARC by the note’s named lender, Equity One, is invalid or not authentic.', 'The hearing justice accepted its authenticity and found that it credibly demonstrated that ARC held the power of attorney for the lender, in addition to being the assignee of the mortgage via MERS. We can divine no error by the hearing justice in construing the document within the context of a proceeding for summary judgment.', 'With respect to the remaining essential facts, the plaintiff does not show the existence of a genuine dispute; “[o]nce ‘the moving party establishes grounds for [summary] judgment, the opposing party, who counters that there is a material factual dispute, * * * must set forth specific facts that would constitute a genuine issue for resolution at trial.’” McGovern v.

In his filings, the plaintiff never disputed that he was in default of his obligations under the promissory note, never disputed the mortgage deed and assignment, which he included with his verified complaint, and accepted that the note provided by the defendants was an accurate copy.

Picillo (contestant) from a Superior Court judgment, declaring that the heirs-at-law 1 of Ann Marie Picillo (the decedent or the testatrix) failed to prove that the testatrix lacked testamentary capacity to execute a will and failed to prove that the will was the product of undue influence. The contestant, who appeared before the Court pro se, asserts that the trial justice erred by: (1) failing to consider whether the will was executed in compliance with G.L. 1956 § 33-5-5; (2) concluding that the will was not the product of undue influence; (3) finding the decedent had the requisite testamentary capacity to execute the will; and (4) failing to make appropriate findings of fact required by Rule 52(a) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure. Because we are of the opinion that the trial justice committed no error, we affirm the judgment. 1', 'Originally eight of the decedent’s heirs-at-law—Beatrice Picillo, Cathy Picillo, Kenneth T. Picillo, Jr., Michael J. Picillo, Raymond Picillo, Jr., Robert S. Picillo, Warren Picillo, and Mariann DelFino—appealed the Probate Court decision. However, only Michael, contestant, has appealed the Superior Court judgment.', '-1', 'Facts and Travel', 'On November 11, 2004, the decedent executed her last will and testament. She died on November 21, 2004. The decedent never married and had no children; she was predeceased by four brothers, her only siblings.', 'The heirs-at-law consisted of the decedent’s nieces and nephews, including contestant, for whom, the record revealed, she had little or no regard. In accordance with her oft-spoken direction, the will bequeathed nothing to the heirs-at-law. Rather, the will named Maria Christina Castellanos Muriel (Muriel or proponent), her in-home caregiver, and Richard L. Walsh, III (Attorney Walsh), her long-time attorney, as co-executors; devised to Muriel her home and a rental property next door; and bequeathed certain bank accounts as well as the remainder of her estate to Diane Munroe (Munroe), her long-time friend and former neighbor. 2', 'On December 6, 2004, a petition for probate of the decedent’s will was filed in Warwick Probate Court. After a lengthy contest that challenged the validity of the instrument, the will was admitted to probate on October 4, 2007. The contestant, along with the remaining heirs-at-law, timely appealed to the Superior Court, alleging that at the time she executed the instrument, the testatrix lacked testamentary capacity and that the will was procured by the undue influence of Muriel and Munroe.', 'A Superior Court bench trial was held in November and December 2010.', 'Attorney Walsh, the attorney who drafted the will and was named as co-executor, testified that he had represented the decedent in legal matters from 1986 until her death. Attorney Walsh averred that he began discussing the decedent’s will with his client in 1993 and did so again in 2003. He noted that, by 2003, the testatrix was bedridden and that, in 2004, her leg was amputated. 2', 'Although the will included bequests to others, those provisions are not relevant to this opinion.', '-2- Attorney Walsh testified that the testatrix indicated to him on more than one occasion that she did not want her nieces and nephews to receive anything from her estate. He testified that, on October 18, 2004, he met with the decedent to discuss her estate plans and that, on that occasion, she made several changes to the draft he had been preparing. During that meeting, the testatrix told him that, in addition to rheumatoid arthritis, she had been diagnosed with a respiratory disease and expected to live for only three or four months. This diagnosis, according to Attorney Walsh, was the reason she desired to finalize her will. Based on that discussion, Attorney Walsh prepared another draft of the will and delivered it to the decedent on October 27, 2004.', 'Attorney Walsh also testified about the decedent’s relationship with Muriel. According to Attorney Walsh, Muriel had been in and out of the room during the October 18, 2004 meeting, and he observed what he characterized as an “employer[-]employee relationship” between the decedent and Muriel. Attorney Walsh also discussed conversations he had with the decedent concerning Muriel. The testatrix disclosed that, over the last year and a half of her life, she had grown to have great affection for Muriel, who had provided her with considerable care, such that she had come to consider Muriel and her two sons as her family.', 'Next, Attorney Walsh testified that, on November 10, 2004, the testatrix contacted him and requested that he come to her house the following day in order to finalize her will. Although he initially was unavailable on November 11, 2004, Attorney Walsh did see his client that evening. Attorney Walsh testified that he met with his client—in private—for twenty to thirty minutes; that he found her to be alert, awake, and speaking clearly; and that she did not appear to be under the influence of any medication. He then left to finalize the will and returned with three witnesses. The testatrix executed the will that night. Attorney Walsh testified that it was his belief that the testatrix had the requisite testamentary capacity to execute the will and that he did', '-3- not consider her to be under duress or subject to the undue influence of anyone, including Muriel and Munroe.', 'Two of the three subscribing witnesses to the will also testified at trial, Steven Pagano (Pagano) and Attorney Walsh’s mother, Nancy Walsh (Mrs. Walsh).3 Both Pagano and Mrs. Walsh testified that the decedent’s responses during the reading of the will were clear and that she did not appear to have problems understanding Attorney Walsh when he read the will to her. Both Pagano and Mrs. Walsh stated that they heard the decedent answer “yes” to all of Attorney Walsh’s questions and that each witnessed her execute the will in their presence.', 'Next, Jane Illuzzi (Mrs. Illuzzi), a hospice nurse who made regular visits to the decedent’s home in November of 2004, testified. According to Mrs. Illuzzi, the testatrix had expressed to her how happy she was to have Muriel caring for her. Mrs. Illuzzi also testified that the decedent told her that she did not want her own family to take anything from her estate and that she wanted to name Muriel as one of the beneficiaries. Lastly, Mrs. Illuzzi testified about the events of November 11, 2004. She stated that, although morphine had been administered that day, the testatrix nonetheless appeared alert and oriented and was never delirious.', 'Mrs. Illuzzi’s daughter-in-law, Erin Illuzzi (Attorney Illuzzi), also testified at trial. Apparently, Attorney Illuzzi had been summoned by the decedent on November 11, 2004 when she was unable to reach Attorney Walsh.', 'Attorney Illuzzi testified that she met with the decedent for the first time at 2 p.m. on November 11, 2004, to discuss her will and that, during this meeting, the decedent understood her questions, answered them appropriately, and did not appear to be under the influence of any type of medication. Attorney Illuzzi also stated that the decedent had disclosed to her that she did not care for her nieces and nephews and that they were 3', 'The third witness to the execution of the decedent’s will, Richard L. Walsh, Jr., did not testify at trial; he had passed away.', '-4- to receive nothing. However, Attorney Illuzzi also testified that, after having met with her for almost three hours, the testatrix began to tire and “gradually break down” and had trouble answering her questions. She testified that, during her meeting with the decedent, Muriel and Munroe tried to remind the decedent of specific items and accounts that she had told them she would leave to them. Attorney Illuzzi testified that, at that point, she had questions about the decedent’s capacity and decided to leave, but she added that she had been willing to return later that evening or the next morning to finalize the will. Hillary Sullivan (Sullivan), a paralegal, was also at the November 11, 2004 meeting between Attorney Illuzzi and the decedent, and she testified—by way of deposition—that the decedent had been in a daze and had trouble answering questions during the entire meeting, not just at the end.', 'Doctor James Burrill (Dr. Burrill) testified as an expert witness on behalf of the heirs-at- law. Having reviewed the decedent’s hospice records, Dr. Burrill testified about the effects of morphine the testatrix received in the twenty-four hours prior to November 11, 2004. According to Dr. Burrill, based on the amount of morphine the decedent purportedly was administered— three doses in a twenty-four-hour span—it was his opinion that she would have been delirious when she executed her will.', 'Muriel testified next and discussed, among other things, her first-hand knowledge that the amount of morphine set forth in the decedent’s hospice records had not been administered to the testatrix and that she had never been given more than one dose in a day. 4 Muriel described her relationship with the decedent as having grown from that of an employer-employee to a personal and caring relationship. By November 2004, Muriel was paying rent and living in an apartment 4', 'There was testimony that the decedent would be forced from her home and into a hospice facility if she was not given morphine; thus, as the decedent wished to remain in her home, Muriel and Munroe recorded in the decedent’s hospice records that she received more morphine than the amount that actually had been administered.', '-5- owned by the decedent. She was caring for the decedent daily, including family dinners with her family and the decedent on a nightly basis.', 'Lastly, Munroe, the decedent’s former neighbor and long-term friend, testified.', 'Her testimony corroborated that of Muriel concerning the amount of morphine administered in the twenty-four hours preceding the execution of the will.', 'Munroe also testified about the relationship between the testatrix and Muriel, stating that she thought the decedent loved Muriel like a daughter. She also testified about the decedent’s demeanor on November 11, 2004, stating that she appeared to understand everything that took place when she executed the will.', 'The trial justice issued a written decision and found that the decedent had the requisite testamentary capacity when she executed the will and that the will was not the product of undue influence. The contestant appealed.', 'Standard of Review', '“According to our well settled ‘raise[-]or[-]waive’ rule, if an issue was not preserved by specific objection at trial, then it may not be considered on appeal.” State v. Pona, 66 A.3d 454, 468 (R.I. 2013) (quoting State v. McManus, 990 A.2d 1229, 1237 (R.I. 2010)). “We require a specific objection so that the allegation of error can be brought to the attention of the trial justice, who will then have an opportunity to rule on it.” Id.', 'Additionally, “[i]t is well established that the factual findings of a trial justice sitting without a jury are accorded great weight and will not be disturbed unless the record shows that the findings clearly are wrong or the trial justice overlooked or misconceived material evidence.” Process Engineers & Constructors, Inc. v. DiGregorio, Inc., 93 A.3d 1047, 1051 (R.I. 2014) (quoting Wellington Condominium Association v. Wellington Cove Condominium Association, 68 A.3d 594, 599 (R.I. 2013)). “If, as we review the record, it becomes clear to us that ‘the', '-6- record indicates that competent evidence supports the trial justice’s findings, we shall not substitute our view of the evidence for [his or hers] * * *.’” Id. at 1052 (quoting Wellington Condominium Association, 68 A.3d at 599).', 'Analysis', 'Statutory Requirements', 'First, contestant argues that proponent failed to establish that the will was executed according to the requirements of § 33-5-5 of the General Laws.', 'Although contestant acknowledges that evidence was submitted to the trial court that the subscribing witnesses were present when the decedent executed the will, he contends that this testimony was not specific enough to satisfy the statutory requirements of § 33-5-5 and that, therefore, proponent failed to establish that the subscribing witnesses were actually “in the presence” of the testatrix and each other when she executed the will. The contestant asserts that the decision was “absolutely silent with respect to [this] issue” and that the trial justice erred in failing “to make a finding of fact that there was indeed compliance with” § 33-5-5.', 'The proponent responds that this issue was not litigated in the Probate Court or the Superior Court.', 'Nevertheless, proponent submits that sufficient evidence was produced to satisfy the requirements of § 33-5-5. The proponent points to the testimony of Attorney Walsh and two of the subscribing witnesses, Pagano and Mrs. Walsh, as establishing that: (1) when the will provisions were read to the decedent, the decedent agreed to each provision; (2) the decedent signed the will herself in the presence of both Pagano and Mrs. Walsh; and (3) Pagano and Mrs. Walsh also signed the will in the presence of the decedent and each other. Lastly, proponent contends that the trial justice made sufficient factual findings as to the proper execution of the will in his written decision to defeat this issue.', '-7-', 'After careful review of the record in this case, we are satisfied that the issue of whether the will was executed in accordance with § 33-5-5 was not argued to the trial justice. Although in their reasons for appeal to the Superior Court the heirs-at-law alleged that the will “was not executed according to the requisite statutory formalities[,]” neither side raised this issue to the trial justice. The focus of the trial was limited to the issues of undue influence and testamentary capacity, as set forth by counsel in their opening statements to the trial justice. Nonetheless, we shall proceed to address this question.', 'Section 33-5-5 provides in relevant part:', '“No will shall be valid * * * unless it shall be in writing', 'and signed by the testator, or by some other person for him or her', 'in his or her presence and by his or her express direction; and this', 'signature shall be made or acknowledged by the testator in the', 'presence of two (2) or more witnesses present at the same time,', 'and the witnesses shall attest and shall subscribe the will in the', 'presence of the testator, but no form of attestation shall be', 'necessary, and no other publication shall be necessary.” “Under our law, if [a] will has been signed by [the] testator and the required number of witnesses, there is a presumption that the statutory requisites for executing a will have been met.” Lett v. Giuliano, 35 A.3d 870, 877 (R.I. 2012). “The burden of proof in a will contest is a preponderance of the evidence.” Pollard v. Hastings, 862 A.2d 770, 776 n.3 (R.I. 2004).', 'There is nothing in the record before us that casts any doubt that the requirements set forth in § 33-5-5 were not met. No witness or piece of documentary evidence even suggests that the will was not executed according to the formalities of the statute. Although the trial justice failed to state specifically that the statutory formalities were met, he did make factual findings that satisfied the statutory requirements. The trial justice found the testimony of Attorney Walsh to be “credible in its entirety[,]” noting that Attorney Walsh had “twenty-four years of experience[] and had completed upwards of two hundred wills.” Attorney Walsh testified that he', '-8- read the will aloud to the decedent, watched her sign the will, and then observed Pagano and Mrs. Walsh sign the will in the decedent’s presence and in the presence of each other. The trial justice also noted that both subscribing witnesses testified that they observed Attorney Walsh read the will, observed the testatrix acknowledging the portions read aloud to her, and witnessed her signing the will. There was no evidence to the contrary and nothing before the Court that would overcome the presumption of validity.', 'A trial justice sitting without a jury need not “make findings with respect to every witness or issue in which ‘a full understanding of the issues’ and the conclusions of the fact finder ‘may be reached without the aid of separate findings.’” Donnelly v. Cowsill, 716 A.2d 742, 747 (R.I. 1998) (quoting Anderson v. Town of East Greenwich, 460 A.2d 420, 423-24 (R.I. 1983)). Accordingly, we reject the argument that the execution of the will was not in accordance with § 33-5-5.', 'Undue Influence', 'Next, contestant argues that the trial justice erred in rejecting the claim that the will was procured by undue influence. Our review of the record reveals that the trial justice conducted the correct analysis; he reviewed the testimonial and documentary proof, weighed the evidence, passed on the credibility of the witnesses, and found that the will was not the product of undue influence.', 'Undue influence is the “substitution of the will of [the dominant] party for the free will and choice [of the subservient party].” Filippi v. Filippi, 818 A.2d 608, 630 (R.I. 2003) (quoting Tinney v. Tinney, 770 A.2d 420, 437-38 (R.I. 2001)). When determining what constitutes undue influence, “a trial justice ordinarily examines the totality of [the] circumstances, including the relationship between the parties, the physical and mental condition of the [subservient party], the', '-9- opportunity and disposition of [the] person wielding influence, and his or her acts and declarations.” Id. (quoting Tinney, 770 A.2d at 438). “The question of whether undue influence exists is a fact-intensive inquiry.” Id. (citing Tinney, 770 A.2d at 438).', 'In his decision, the trial justice properly noted that “not all influence is undue” and that only undue influence will serve to invalidate a will and must amount to “the substitution of the will of a third party for the free will and choice of the testator * * *.” Caranci v. Howard, 708 A.2d 1321, 1324 (R.I. 1998). The trial justice explored the nature and depth of the decedent’s relationship with Muriel and Munroe as support for her decision to leave the bulk of her estate to them rather than the heirs-at-law.', 'He recounted Attorney Walsh’s testimony about the decedent’s personality and what the trial justice concluded was the “strength of her character.” The trial justice referenced Attorney Walsh’s testimony describing the relationship between the decedent and Muriel “as strictly an employer[-]employee relationship, with [Muriel] acting solely at [the decedent’s] direction.” The trial justice also found that Attorney Walsh’s characterization of the relationship between the testatrix and Muriel was supported by Muriel’s own testimony, which he found to be credible. The trial justice also noted Muriel’s demeanor during her testimony, including her emotional reaction to a photo of the decedent and the testimony from other witnesses 5 who recounted the decedent’s praise for Muriel. He declared “that there existed a true and sincere caring relationship between them, and that their emotional attachment to one another went beyond the bounds of their employer[-]employee relationship.” Addressing the decedent’s friendship with Munroe, the trial justice noted the long, “very close” relationship the two had since becoming neighbors in the 1980s. 5', 'The trial justice noted that Attorney Walsh, Mrs. Illuzzi, and Munroe were the witnesses who corroborated Muriel’s testimony regarding the depth of her relationship with the decedent.', '- 10 -', 'The trial justice then remarked on the “stark contrast” between the testatrix’s relationships with Muriel and Munroe and her antipathy toward her nieces and nephews.', 'He noted that witness testimony revealed that the decedent harbored an “intense animosity towards her entire family” and cited two specific instances that explained why she decided to leave them nothing. 6 Lastly, the trial justice rejected the argument that Attorney Illuzzi’s testimony that Muriel and Munroe had encouraged the decedent to remember certain dispositions established undue influence, stating that there was other testimony that the decedent already had committed to making those dispositions, thus establishing that they were not substituting their will for that of the decedent’s.', 'After careful review, we are satisfied that the trial justice made sufficient findings of fact and that he did not overlook or misconceive material evidence nor was he clearly wrong in rejecting the claim of undue influence.', 'Testamentary Capacity', 'The contestant next assigns error to the finding that the decedent possessed the requisite testamentary capacity when she executed the will. Our assessment of the record reveals that the trial justice conducted a proper analysis of the evidence and controlling law and declared that he agreed with the findings of the Probate Court that the decedent was of sound mind and possessed testamentary capacity when she executed the will. 6', 'The first incident occurred when contestant was living with the decedent. Apparently, the decedent had asked contestant to leave her food in the mornings, but contestant failed to do so, necessitating a call to a friend who stopped by every morning to feed her. The second and more egregious incident occurred when the decedent’s niece was living with her. The niece left the decedent’s home on a Friday evening and did not return for the entire weekend—leaving her immobile and without any food or means to move about her home. The decedent finally contacted another family member to come tend to her on Sunday morning, finding a famished decedent greatly in need of personal care.', '- 11 -', '“It is well-settled that in a will contest, the proponent of the will bears the burden of proof of testamentary capacity by a fair preponderance of the evidence.” Pollard, 862 A.2d at 777. Also well-established is the test for testamentary capacity, which requires that, at the time the will is executed, the testatrix,', '“has sufficient mind and memory to understand the nature of the', 'business [s]he is engaged in when making h[er] will[;] has a', 'recollection of the property [s]he wishes to dispose of thereby[;]', 'knows and recalls the natural objects of h[er] bounty, their deserts', 'with reference to their conduct and treatment of h[er], [and] their', 'necessities[;] and the manner in which [s]he wishes to distribute', 'h[er] property among them.” Rynn v. Rynn, 55 R.I. 310, 321, 181', 'A. 289, 294 (1935).', 'In the case before us, contestant argues that the testimony of Attorney Illuzzi and Dr. Burrill established that the decedent lacked testamentary capacity at the time she executed her will. The contestant points to Attorney Illuzzi’s testimony that, several hours into her visit with the decedent, she concluded that the decedent lacked testamentary capacity as conclusive evidence that later that evening when the decedent executed the will she also lacked the capacity to do so. The contestant also contends that Dr. Burrill’s testimony, derived from the hospice records of morphine doses set forth in the medical chart, was proof that she lacked capacity.', 'The trial justice specifically addressed this evidence in his decision, but he assigned greater weight to the testimony of Attorney Walsh, the testatrix’s long-time attorney and whose testimony was corroborated by other contemporaneous witnesses. Attorney Walsh testified that he believed the decedent had testamentary capacity during the will execution on November 11, 2004.', 'The trial justice also was persuaded by Munroe’s testimony that the decedent had not received morphine in the time period before she executed the will. He also noted that “[e]ven if [the decedent] had taken morphine at some point during the previous day, the testimony of Attorney Walsh and of the witnesses to the will’s execution convince[d him] by a fair', '- 12 - preponderance of the evidence that [the decedent] had testamentary capacity at the time she signed her will.” We accord great weight to the factual findings and conclusions of a trial justice sitting without a jury.

Rhode Island Department of Administration, 88 A.3d 1134, 1141 (R.I. 2014).', 'In this case, it is apparent that the trial justice made sufficient findings of fact, evaluated the testimony, and was not clearly wrong in his conclusion that the decedent possessed the requisite testamentary capacity to execute a will on November 11, 2004.', 'Rule 52(a)', 'Lastly, contestant argues that the trial justice failed to make sufficient findings of fact to support his written decision. “Rule 52(a) * * * requires a trial justice in a nonjury case to ‘find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon * * *.’” JPL Livery Services, Inc., 88 A.3d at 1141 (quoting Rule 52(a)). However, the trial justice “need not engage in extensive analysis to comply with this requirement.” Id. (quoting Connor v.

The procedure required the doctor to open plaintiff’s abdomen, remove the portion of the skull embedded inside, reopen the incision on his scalp, and reattach the piece of his skull to his head. The plaintiff testified that he was awake for part of the procedure and that the removal of a drain from his skull created a “sick, slithering feeling” as if a “snake was being tugged out of [his] head.” Doctor Guglielmo testified that plaintiff was doing well on July 6, 2006, but that he sought treatment for headaches in both September 2007 and April 2012. She informed the jury of her opinion that the cause of plaintiff’s headaches was the severe head trauma he suffered in the 2006 assault.', 'The remainder of plaintiff’s testimony centered on his loss of enjoyment of life. Although he acknowledged that he graduated on time, with the assistance of tutors, he was unable to attend his graduation ceremony in order to have the staples removed from his head. The plaintiff also testified that he stopped playing pickup sports, a regular activity of his, after the incident. He added that, some years later, he enrolled at Rhode Island College, but he testified that he left during his second semester due to the embarrassment he felt over the constant injury-related questioning. The plaintiff testified that he is horrified by the permanent scars that appear on his head.', 'In her closing argument, plaintiff’s counsel provided the jury with a demonstrative aid, or “guideline of sorts,” that might help “put a value on what [plaintiff] has been through.” The trial justice then instructed the jury to answer the interrogatory: “What, if any[,] damages[] did plaintiff suffer and prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence as a result of the defendant’s, Shawn McKiernan’s, assault * * *.” After deliberation, the jury returned a verdict awarding plaintiff $1.75 million in damages plus interest.', '-4-', 'Contending that the verdict shocked the conscience and was against a fair preponderance of the evidence, defendant filed a “motion for remititir [sic] and/or new trial” on December 12, 2012. On December 28, 2012, the trial justice granted defendant’s motion, ordering a new trial unless plaintiff agreed to a remittitur of the damages awarded from $1.75 million to $925,000 plus interest. The plaintiff accepted the remittitur in lieu of a new trial, and a judgment was entered to that effect. 2 The defendant filed a timely notice of appeal from that judgment on January 3, 2013.', 'II', 'Standard of Review', 'As we have often stated, “[w]hen ruling on a motion for a new trial [in a civil case tried to a jury], the trial justice acts as a ‘superjuror’ and ‘should review the evidence and exercise his or her independent judgment in passing upon the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses.’” Connor v. Schlemmer, 996 A.2d 98, 114 (R.I. 2010) (quoting Seddon v. Duke, 884 A.2d 413, 413 (R.I. 2005) (mem.)).', '“The trial justice undertakes his or her ‘independent appraisal of the evidence in the light of his [or her] charge to the jury.’” Id. at 114-15 (quoting Kurczy v. St. Joseph Veterans Association, Inc., 713 A.2d 766, 770 (R.I. 1998)). “[T]he trial justice need not engage in an exhaustive review and analysis of the evidence and testimony presented at trial * * * [but] need only make reference to such facts disclosed by the testimony as have motivated his or her conclusion.” Bourdon’s, Inc. v. Ecin Industries, Inc., 704 A.2d 747, 758 (R.I. 1997) (quoting Kwarciak v. Star Market, 506 A.2d 545, 547 (R.I. 1986)).', '“Although the fixing of damages is normally a function of the jury, it may be rejected by a trial justice on a motion for a new trial.” Reccko v. Criss Cadillac Co., 610 A.2d 542, 545-46 2', 'The judgment awarded plaintiff $925,000 with interest of $760,273.97, for a total of $1,685,275.97.', '-5- (R.I. 1992). “A trial justice may set aside a verdict ‘when [her] judgment tells [her] that it is wrong because it fails to respond truly to the merits of the controversy and to administer substantial justice and is against the fair preponderance of the evidence.’” Murray v. Bromley, 945 A.2d 330, 333 (R.I. 2008) (quoting Candido v. University of Rhode Island, 880 A.2d 853, 856 (R.I. 2005)).', '“In the alternative, a remittitur may be accomplished if the trial justice concludes, after passing upon the evidence, that the plaintiff is not entitled to such an award or that the award is unreasonable in light of the evidence presented at trial.” Reccko, 610 A.2d at 546 (citing Zarrella v. Robinson, 460 A.2d 415, 418 (R.I. 1983)). “The trial justice may reject the award or order a remittitur of the award if it shocks the conscience or it ‘clearly appears to be excessive, or to represent the passion and prejudice of the jury rather than their unbiased judgment.’” Id. at 546 (quoting Zarrella, 460 A.2d at 418-19).', 'We “will affirm a trial justice’s decision on a motion for a new trial as long as the trial justice conducts the appropriate analysis, does not overlook or misconceive material evidence, and is not otherwise clearly wrong.” Murray, 945 A.2d at 334 (quoting Morrocco v. Piccardi, 674 A.2d 380, 382 (R.I. 1996)).', 'III', 'Discussion', 'In his appeal, defendant contends that, despite the remittitur, the final ruling rendered in favor of plaintiff for $925,000 plus interest is excessive, punitive, and shocks the conscience. He argues that the jury was influenced by sympathy, passion, and prejudice when it awarded plaintiff $1.75 million.', 'The defendant asserts that plaintiff’s medical expenses totaled approximately $135,000, and he notes that plaintiff did not make a claim for lost wages. He also', '-6- claims that, during closing arguments, plaintiff’s counsel requested that the jury award plaintiff $732,165 in damages, an amount $1 million less than what was actually awarded, and nearly $200,000 less than what was ordered on the remittitur.', 'The plaintiff argues that the evidence supports the award of $925,000. Notably, plaintiff points to the medical expenses, as well as the pain and suffering he incurred in both the immediate aftermath of the assault and the rehabilitation process. He also contends that his attorney never made a request for any specific monetary amount during his closing argument. Instead, plaintiff asserts that counsel merely used a demonstrative aid to provide the jury with a method for calculating damages as a “guideline.”', 'After careful consideration of the record, we conclude that the trial justice acted properly in granting defendant’s motion and reducing the damages to $925,000. In her decision, the trial justice clearly articulated her role in deciding a motion for a new trial or a remittitur. After examining the evidence presented, she concluded that there was competent credible evidence to support the jury’s award of medical expenses.', 'The trial justice then discussed the jury’s consideration of plaintiff’s injuries, specifically their length and severity, as well as how those injuries affected his life on a day-to-day basis. Although the trial justice commented that plaintiff made a “remarkable recovery,” she acknowledged that this did not diminish the permanency of his injuries. The trial justice found that “[t]here is compelling and credible evidence by the plaintiff of the pain that he endured and that he continues to endure, the suffering at the time of the injury and in his extensive recovery period, and the humiliation, embarrassment, anguish, grief, [and] anxiety during that recovery period to this day.”', 'The trial justice recognized that the guideline used by plaintiff’s counsel to calculate compensatory damages suggested a verdict around $1 million less than what was returned by the', '-7- jury. Additionally, she determined that the verdict reflected “that the jury acted with some degree of sympathy, passion, and prejudice” and concluded that the original award shocked the conscience. She noted, however, that the credible evidence presented at trial justified an award of $925,000, which provided plaintiff “with approximately $30 per day” for the 51.3 years of his life expectancy.', 'A careful review of the record demonstrates that the trial justice properly considered and weighed the testimony and evidence presented. Given that she did not misconceive or overlook material evidence, as well as the great weight the trial justice is accorded in ruling on such motions, this Court sees no basis for overturning her ruling.
